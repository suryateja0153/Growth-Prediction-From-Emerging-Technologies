 and tell us a little bit of what HHS is sharing here and how it's going to help agencies government-wide if you have a question or comment or something is confusing to you please I put it into the chat box on your GoToWebinar console and the the GoToWebinar team will send it over to me and I'll ask the question if you don't have any questions please do submit them after the webinar because we will go ahead and have some Q&A time I expect that Kristen will have speak for about 20 to 30 minutes and then we'll definitely have plenty of time for Q&A but please feel free to share your questions when you have need arises all right Kristin thank you for joining us today and please take it away Thank You Jacob hi everybody you probably had me talk about syndication and content models before and I'm really excited to tell you about HHS sharing its content models as well as triple features this is a it's a great way we're hoping everyone could collaborate so first for those who don't know what is a Content model it's a representation of types of content and their interrelationships content modeling breaks down content items like Bratz like an FAQ page an article page and it breaks them into smaller structures just you can think of it almost as a very basic outline and it's these are called the smaller structures are called content types and they are defined by their attributes why am I doing this so open and structured content models can help they can help you create content and this is super important I hope everybody is thinking of it that's platform agnostic and format free and device independent really and we've seen it so many times we all create the single purpose content and focus on making things more future-ready flexible and most importantly reusable in age of smartphones tablets social media tools syndication websites our content the need for module content is growing quickly so how are we going to do this we're going to create once and publish everywhere and it's called cope you sure you've seen it around we call it sometimes great once published enthusiastically and that's hopefully with the use of using content models the goal of cope is implementing content models is to create once publish everywhere adopting these content models will allow your content to be flexible enough to go wherever it's needed whether on a motor syndicated mobile device or it's pulled in the data is pulled in by another application most importantly it's flexible and consumable in this corner here there's a picture of NPR digital media they are a great example they follow cope in their page our guest content development and it shows its website mobile they have an API they do RSS feeds it's the same content it's just being made portable there was some couple of questions when we sent out the ad for the webinar and I'm just going to briefly go over content strategy and information architecture you might have seen some emails on the content manage managers listserv but information architecture it's ia and in the simplest terms it's the navigation tools you provide to users to go through your site it's your structure and then content strategy CS is often described in a set of methods guidelines for development and curation of content coupled with strategy for distribution of content across the web so basically is the work you do to shape and define the voice of your brand there's an article that I wrote there's a URL right here highly recommend it goes way more into detail but we could take up the whole webinar just digging into that just consider the ia it should be thought as an enabler for content strategy it helps tell your story it helps you give the tools to lead users through a specific path and if your information architecture does not allow certain tours through your content it limits the stories you can tell so it defines how people move about your your site okay on that good two second over introduction of information architecture models so here's what we're excited to share models HHS we actually have over twenty models that we have on the list is continuing to grow and I can tell you that the the models change and and we we will continue to add them to our github site and we working to collaborate the NIH library also recently has some models that we recently got and shared as well they're not in our github site but we're happy to share them with others in an effort to promote collaboration and get others to utilize the IDE the concept of content models we put them and github some of them that are being offered there's an article and FAQ announcements news releases leadership bio and internal and external blog post these content models are in use on our site now um here is an example of what you'll see if you go to the HHS github site I can try to go to it them let's go through this and then I can go to the github site and have everybody go through it you can do it together you can find out an overview with each content type I put there's content type details there's all kinds of information specific dependencies here's a little snippet and I can show everybody when we go into github what is there it outlines shows in a word document it's also in a spreadsheet and we covered it kind of proud to say that the team did a great job so for those who are using Drupal you will know and hopefully be excited that we have these content models as Drupal features for those who don't know Drupal feature is a collection of Drupal configurations that are intentionally grouped together to facilitate a particular use case these configurations can be used for content type declarations views module settings roles permissions among things that it it allows a Content model to just kind of plug in quick and dirty way of saying it okay so we're going to go to the github site now but know that here's my contact information it's Kristin Kyler at HHS gov and everyone can reach out to me and ask me questions so maybe don't want to online but definitely if you have other content models to share we're going to continue to share them everyone we encourage others to collaborate here we go we're going into github it's a live demo so cross your fingers okay so when you log in to github.com back slash HHS we have an HHS what they call this there's a repo it lists they're all here and since I highlighted the FAQ the first one I'm going to go into it but there's the drupal feature detail on the content type and the structured content will click here very well-documented list the features the content type the library the FAQ again here's the overview the details Drupal module features dependencies how to install it point a contact I'm going to pull one up so just bear with me folks if you have questions please submit them to the chat box I'll be happy to ask cristen alright so here is the word document of the HHS FAQ content model just basically this is the format that we that we use for it we have what type is it we have it defined and then we've broken the page down as to what's required with the field titles what's required the content and metadata so it's just a simple FAQ page that we all have created or seen over time and it's getting down and Jacob and I have had meetings before where we talked about we actually did a webinar where we had people create breakdown there's there's a formula there's some great webinars on digital gov gov you can you can go in and see that the history on how to create these we have categories and audiences and these are all the audiences and categories just you guys have internally at HHS yes and we actually just banded our audience tag we're excited do you is some folks have been asking questions you have an example of like what this looks like on the web potentially I assume would just be the HHS website okay yeah if you go to the HHS website this is behind the scenes I didn't access the Drupal code behind it but when you're creating a page this these are the features have been added so that it's outlined so when you're creating a page they'd vary box for you you have to select the primary audience from the list when you're building the page number of questions are actually coming in so prior to cope with HHS how is HHS approaching content and what made you guys make the switch so I started at HHS in the end of November and I can tell you that I think when they did the redesign of their website prior to my arrival they knowing that they syndicate their content they have a desire to make their content portable to be accessible on mobile devices responsive hopefully take their data and push it elsewhere so that was the thought behind it and they were one of our partners we have the HHS syndication storefront and that content then necessity the need for having portable content I guess was seen early on but this is something that is gaining in popularity you know and everybody thinks about artificial intelligence and you want your content to be consumed by let's just say Alexa you'd want to have that portable you'd want to have it so that it can just easily be consumed I think the NPR example is one of the vast ones that the successes of having your content in a structure that can go to many different many different views through the questions oh yeah there's a ton of questions see how does topic tithing work do you have to choose for a predefined list of tags topic tagging yeah sorry so we have a taxonomy that we use at HHS it's not for topic it would be right now it's audience you have an audience taxonomy we have a taxonomy working group that's established and we hash it out based on our needs and that we work with our Eveleigh with our analytics team for that right now we're not tagging specifically towards a topic like chicken pox or now it would probably be tagged maybe by the office people are wondering are they noticed it's you guys trout you these are in Drupal and there are questions about WordPress um first to the question of Drupal if you have something earlier than group 'el seven while they work in that triple environment all right so I went to put on my techie hat really small no you cannot use a Drupal seven feature in a drupal if you're using like Drupal for if you're running an older version but I'm sure you could tweak in a little bit we're working on looking into Drupal 8 for some of our you know updates as well but right now we're in seven so that's why the Drupal features are in seven and what was the other question WordPress yes so how would you actually leverage these in another content management system you would probably use the word document and structure your in WordPress you have to structure your own content model and I have some used WordPress very often but you could easily just create a word document or Excel and utilize that and then create a template within WordPress or whatever janitor using yeah here's a good question so then please keep your questions coming in and take you just like we've been putting them in do you know of any I use of Alexa or other interactive date applications using content models so the reason you would have your content in the content model is that it would be exportable Alexa and Google the artificial intelligence tools have their own I think Jacob might correct me if it's a story I believe that I believe it is a story and we've had different groups we've met with and everyone can make fun of me but it's if then this then that group that's correct they have their that assess the story I think yeah actually - Alexa skills yeah each have their own but when you make your content clear it's portable it's not not platform dependent so that you're if you wanted to create a story or something for Alexa or Google it's easily outlined and the tools can utilize that much easier than if you had a web page that was not outlined and with clearly defined fields so help I think so please resubmit if we didn't get that one I know CDC has done a lot of work in this area and HHS are you guys starting to offer these to the other divisions in other parts of HHS or is it just HHS headquarters at this point no no is if we're supporting your website these are being utilized and then I will also tell you there's the hope something that we are talking about seriously now but the news release content model we use and we'd love to have our other Optive using it and I will tell you that that would be the goal so that the news releases instead of the old cutting and pasting amongst the various organizations if we used it we could clearly syndicated without issue so and that's that's our future one of our future projects that we're discussing now ooh more more questions you're not getting away that easy are your models based on any standard models that have already been defined like this schema not org I think some of the earliest kosta agency work were bait was based on schema.org and I think that's where the HHS models come from correct yes I know your predecessors were working with some of the working groups yes so working on that ah do you anticipate in extensions to current structures to accommodate interactive content similar to schema.org so I think there's some other fields that may be needed for interactive content yeah then we was we have if it was more interactive I think so we have 20 right now that 20 content models we shared the list that's six we have out there right now and with their dribble features they're updated json-ld I think as we go forward then we would definitely add them and they'd be for more interactive content types I don't think right now they're kind of static pages for some of them and and I would say if you wanted to make changes or if you wanted some I came upon so that allowed put this piece of code in you would say please do don't github you could like oh yeah that's why this is here so github is you know remember this is a collaborative site and you have suggestions and this is a place where we can all work together add your content models this is something I'm happy if you take it and modify it to based on your knees this is what suits off at the time the current time that I you know if you told me hey Kristen I took yours and I manipulated it into something else I would be thrilled you know this is your just a draft for you and then that I got you gave you the drafts to start with it starting point and are you guys trafficking use of the so there's a question about Google Analytics but how are you tracking success and measuring impact of the models so I don't know if you put out you can if there's an impact for Google Analytics data or you know is it just kind of more of a way to organize everybody's using the same topic standards in schema yeah I think it goes to content strategy more than analytics we work with the endlichs team for taxonomy and and we definitely consult them with the page layouts the structure but we're not to my knowledge we're not getting data specifically to the content models maybe on github you would get it here but the focus on the content model would be chess what Jacob said to have the the pages in the structure uniform and having the content consumable so I guess if I had an FAQ page that was in a structured content model it was outlined and I was also offering it for syndication and maybe I have some other forms of disseminating that information and that would be where my analytics would come into play able to get some data that way to see the ease of use if you had a page that wasn't portable you know you just had an HTML page it looked great but only it was only in one browser and that it worked in and didn't give all the information and it wasn't consistent and I would tell you probably would be less successful thank you why not just use schema.org or types instead of it's creating custom models this is the question comes up a lot and I think the answer has been in the past the schema.org goes in a lot of detail and I think if you base your approach on schema.org and you pull out the elements and that's what we did for the original content model so we did in the open structure content working group project a few years ago then we looked at schema.org and we plucked out some of the things that made sense because I assume you're socializing these two folks are not traditional web managers and folks like that correct yes yeah so I think schema.org is good I think a lot of search folks in the federal government are proponents of schema.org and I think pulling the elements that are most important from schema.org has been the approach of some agencies so I know some agencies are full-on using schema.org and I mean we've talked to a financial organization in the federal government that was taking 30 years to create content models yeah yeah so so I think there there are a number of approaches but I think schema.org is good it's just hard for a lot of folks who are developing content in the federal government to to say oh god just keep em out or because they get overwhelmed with the number of different pieces that you have to put in a schema.org model so one I apologize I'm having a paraphrase these questions my computer is freezing app I think there's a lot of folks on this ah webinar who are interested in selling I cope for organizations like state as one person but how is code marketed internally particularly to HHS ever management before being a made available publicly or was it a top-down mandate I don't think it's a mandate yet but I think as budgets get tight and resources are fewer and fewer big management will embrace cope more so than you know they would not thinking about it earlier I also HHS has a syndication storefront I can have an avenue and so we are focused we're focused on sharing our content and broadening our our audiences and reach so I think that the value we see creating once and publishing enthusiastically or everywhere really holds a lot of we see the value in it I think just looking at what NPR has done is this is the article might be it this is one but here here's an example this is an article I did this is past life so NIH news and health they do have a content model for their newsletter here's their newsletter here who's preventing type 2 diabetes it was in a clean structure and then also offered via syndications the div tag was there and here it is same article same content with the attributes and we are at the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library so that's exciting and it's a group of people that may not have seen the NIH news and health newsletter again this is the ADHD put out in the template and here it is on the a DD Resource Center same article same content so I think when management sees the value in having your content shared or your data consumed by another tool then it really get a huge return on investment okay and here's another technical question for you okay um is it marketer marked up with json-ld yes it is and you down alright some other questions we're just getting past 2:30 here so you know we scheduled an hour for the session but sometimes we can go short I want to make sure we got everybody's questions answered just to remind everybody a good way to see content models and content strategy information architecture everything being utilized I highly highly recommend looking at NPR digital media and their Sarah crane at usa.gov there but she talked about adaptive content and how it worked with API is using NPR and this was great they were working USAJOBS content strategy at the time here is a little example at the video on NPR coke I think in PR is generally recognized as the first organization to to use this yeah yeah there's tech leaders like Google Bing and Yahoo Nature BBC and Hearst and New York Times continue and I think that a number of programs and our organization Digital Cup starts comes to mind that are looking at schema.org in some of the structured content and content syndication I'll move you forward do you have any tracking of how other folks are using HHS content do you see it's being syndicated a lot or is it are you still sort of we are showing it better we're we're working on right now that is growing exponentially and I can tell you that we're in talks with some commercial group as well as universities like house you know their health like Loma Linda Reed doubt this morning and they're interested in consuming our content so I can see for certain organizations where they have many pages that they want to have you know each site may be a state I could see you guys possibly if you had information on your main page but you wanted to have same information like an update alert on your you know each country the site I could see some value in that and especially its updated 24 by 7 it's updated real-time um I can tell you that having the structure content was critical with syndication for Zika virus information when I was at NIH we consumed it directly from CDC and we were able to have the latest and greatest Zika in health information and updates on our NIH homepage two more questions came in actually really good one can you sort of have an interplay between content models say could you use a but if you could have a say a bio at content model but you could also use saq content model for that set you know what I think you could yeah so that's that's a great you know idea so yes yeah theoretically yeah but we don't use it right now but but yeah I think I'm gonna have to hook you up somebody with somebody about this JSON LP and it's taking it from the AG I think this'll I actually wants to maybe syndicate your content based on the questions okay I'm happy to just get your information and send it to me yeah I'll have to we have the attendee list I'll connect so they've been asking some some detailed questions with you okay you have it RJ MLD for these especially that was they were just updated so this kind of comes up the question of metrics or are you guys tracking articles that are syndicated do you have an approach for that and no CDC was looking at this last I checked I don't know if there's a standard way so we have Google Analytics on our the storefront and the admin side so we can see who is syndicating and who is not what content it just goes into details specific for the the content owner adds it to the storefront get a little bit of detail and then one of my favorite ways which is going to drive analytics people crazy by just seeing your broader audiences you can have a more enhanced Google search with looking for the attribute using boolean code and just I like to see it's a quick and dirty way of seeing the content in outside science I have a bookmarked say if it comes out okay so here's a monk answer Texas mythology oncology Cancer Center they're syndicated content I can look by the attribute from cancer gov I've got NLM's content here for Montgomery County North town Public Library chicken another poultry is being consumed so it's exciting for me just and I do this every once in a while like yours federal tobacco laws and policy crave the change has decided information from nie HS yeah this is fun for me to say and you can dig down it's a quick and dirty way but even this when visiting services in Trinidad and Tobago I mean our content is our audience is growing exponentially just by and the cleaner and leaner you make it that it's more easily consumed makes it more portable great so I'm going to I was asked to repeat the question about the interplay of our content types um - I've got working in both heroes a longer question than it looked in the preview sub that I opened up here what is the interplay between content types what is a relationship between content types can you use FAQ on buyers so hot over there places where you're using multiple content types and how how does that interplay work out so could you have the same two content types on a page potentially potentially yes I'm currently we are not doing that so are you saying that your your content types are sort of one use case like you don't have a lot of multiple use cases where you would have a patient has two content types yeah I don't think we would have I possibly on the blog the the the external blog and internal blog I could see them being having an interplay I like on an FAQ I don't think we'd want to put somebody's bio so it really would be dependent but doesn't mean it couldn't happen sorry from being big we just still do that currently but I think you could probably do whatever you needed to do with content types models folks please send me some more questions they're coming in have a few more minutes so folks we're talking about leadership BIOS and the interplay of those if you could add a leadership i/o to a article model or something to that so I think you could have a page and other pages uses of the content type yeah absolutely that definitely could do okay so a good question is somebody's thinking about this am I right in thinking that are at a higher level content types and tagging content is a piece of a larger solution like an ontology where content types are the products of themes and they just think probably not the right word an example would be an FAQ and your question right off my screen so I thought I saw the person that does send that question I will follow up with you after VI to the webinar so I think that what we're learning right now is a lot of ways that these could be applied but I think you have to be strict to setting to the type when you use Picanto type I mean is it are there any optional fields in any of your your models yes I think in the FAQ and I'm not going to pull it back up and this one is a quick example here this is our FAQ we pulled this up the word document and it's these are the required fields so this is the data that has to be filled in and then here this information is really dependent upon the the page so it's those are not the required fields so I hope that answers that and I think thinking of content models and information architecture and content strategy I think you have your information architecture and content strategy they work as one I think that's how everybody should start thinking they they are its they're relevant to each other it's really important to think about that and I think a Content model is a good way of the second step of your content strategy and considering that you're going to have clear portable content that can get is consumed by others module it's great the needs are growing just think about going on tablets and smartphones and media tools and that's for many of us we do at work but I don't think the vast majority of people have either of you know a laptop but very few people have the big desktops that they're they do using so I think as time goes on not to be predictor but those might be limited to people sitting at a desk and even I I just have a laptop I know some people just have tablets so having your content future ready and flexible and reusable yet that to me is the number one argument for imploringly employing content models so I if there are a few questions pop typing in a couple people we're gonna have to follow up with so this is this'll bring us back to mobile real quick and I don't know if you'll notice I'll be impressed if you do which cell phone operating system does hhs.gov work best with Android or Apple iOS our content I would tell you that it's portable and flexible very answer so any are there a lot of micro sites that you guys are creating at this point so did you just we aren't I know CBC has some great micro site that they were creating they had a wonderful concussion micro site and we have talked about it in the future but it's getting our content pulled together I even talked about you know some content going forward I think our news release content models and having that across the agency will be our one of our big next steps before maybe even before the micro site but think about wanting to pull in a micro site and the content from it and the content has to really be clear clean structure I mean I I hate to say this but sometimes we there's pages that have been created that maybe it doesn't have the best CSS or you know my C and HTML Maxis a I've ever seen one from one of my co-workers for different groups but it's just something a Content model helps you keep everything kind of clean kind of going back to read and clean code the days when you were in school and you would be graded on the way your code looked when you wrote it just keeping that in mind okay so how can I add content to my HHS content to my site and specific question is you know am i doing a fetch request or do you have to embed code based on you search down you see HHS how are they adding words John I think how are you embed code from a content type so you take it yeah you would take it so you're like syndication so I would be like oh I want to add something to Jacobs yoga studio web page is just indication would I'm happy to answer and walk you through the steps of syndication it's we say it's easy as 1-2-3 and you can probably go it's not a beautiful site it's definitely a government site but the HHS syndication storefront if you were to come in here and definitely but you can contact me offline and I will definitely work with you on you know some content that you can consume and getting it added to your page so one last phase I touched on this with another question how does it work with SEO is the structural content help your SEO in specific ways you can think of Jacob Star Amanda I'm telling you all these stops stoppers today I know I mean um I'm gonna say yes and then I'm not going to just say that content models but it does help with SEO and it's the tagging and there's various components that have our success with our search engine optimization they are definitely a helpful element to it okay let me see any more questions last call and questions please I'll just say I'll do my closing and please reach out I'm happy to share we're excited at HHS to to share our work the idea of collaborating with everyone something that the transparent we want you to see what we have and to work with you so please keep that in mind reach out send me an email and I'm happy to talk about syndication content models share our json-ld and the drupal features all these good things and when your coworker said note that the on google does read the json lb so yes there is SEO involved in a developer we have on another project or the room is shaking his head in agreement so that's good bye so final last question I think I knew the answer to this on they can email you so if you can put your slides back up so they could see your email address all right good I assume we can email you to get started but also I would go to the github page to get started is that correctly if you don't need me go directly to the github comm backsplash HHS it's here on the last slide and everyone's welcome to go there take a look dig around that's kind of the idea of github and and if you need more information you're welcome to reach out to me yes and I'll be collecting the questions and we should have contact information for anybody I didn't go back to I thank you all today ah this has been a digital gov University webinar I think you christened I live for coming in and sharing these content models across ages to use and talking about your expertise in this area if you're interested in ordering Kristen please email her if you're interested in a working group around this topic you can email me or Kristen thanks so much and have a great day thank you
