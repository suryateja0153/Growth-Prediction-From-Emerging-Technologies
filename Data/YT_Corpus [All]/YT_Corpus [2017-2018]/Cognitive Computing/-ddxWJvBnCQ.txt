 I really appreciate it it's always good to be with the brain trust and test out a number of new things for me as well and you're going to see in this presentation some new things and I kind of moved on to the the digital what I call pull of process side of this so I believe that process is one of the secret weapons or secret sauces that's going to be in digital and I'm coming from that perspective so I'll tell you what my biases right off the top now hopefully that's consistent with what you want and so what we're seeing in organizations is that they have a couple of things they can do with digital disruption one is they can ignore it either by sticking their head in the ground or in the clouds or they can die a slow painful death if you do nothing that's what's going to happen to you and this is a very exciting time I've lived through as you can tell by my age and lack of hair I've lived through a number of different things database online real-time all kinds of different things this is the mo and BPM of course this is probably the most exciting that's why I'm not retiring even though I should be and my wife constantly reminds me I should be so let's talk about what those business demands that are stretching us and the technical demands there are new emerging technologies every day so digital transformation we have to be faced and first thing we're going to talk about is why should organizations pay attention you know is this just more hype from a Gartner extra Gartner analyst who's turned tail and gone somewhere else what are the business and technical forces that are pulling and what's the journey likely to look like and one of the things that I believe in architectural e is a digital business platform each organization will be faced with building one it may be best to breed most likely will be so here's what organizations are doing we've talked about customer loyalty we've had a number of demos on it we've said we're going to mine you know speeding up organizations to the you know linking that speed to the change that we see an i/o to the Iowa T's happening in what nanoseconds so there are a lot of things that can happen and we're going to be linking the front end white collar systems to the IOT more than you think they're going to be up starts in the industry they're going to be significant differentiation and organizations are fighting to be a significant digital organization not that they you know they want digital so they can say it at they're at their cocktail party they have to do that to survive so this is from a study that was done out of MIT and done with capgemini so this basically talks about the four types of engagement that you can have one is if you have great digital capability and great leadership you are a digital master I don't see too many digital masters out in the real world today probably the closest that I've seen from a customer perspective might be amazon I think they get it I think they do it quite well as a customer I'm delighted with them though I have to say the more I Pam the more delighted I am in them and vice versa but most people are in this you know low digital capability and maybe some leadership so most people today are either a beginner or a conservative there are some people and I worked for a company like this American Express which was a fashionista they used to throw things against the wall and see what stuck what oh let's do some more of that now they don't have as much money they used to when I work there I don't know it was my salary or what but they are not doing quite as much of that so it's easy to fall into being too conservative or a fashionista from the beginning standpoint so you say so what why should I care here's why you should care they did a significant amount of research to say what's going to happen if you stay in a category well if you stay in a digital master and you're going to have to fight the state as a digital master it's not going to I'm there I'm there forever you got to keep working and reinventing yourself you see revenue profitability market valuation is up if you stay where you are look at this profitability is going to go down if you're a fashionista you're going to get some revenue but you're not going to be effective if you're a conservative you're going to be very effective but you're not going to get a lot of revenue increase so if you're if you're not a stock company if you're not evaluated in the stock market maybe that's not so bad maybe it's okay to be private and very well managed and comfortable and you go to your golf club and swing your clubs every once in a while and it's kind of nice and it's very well managed I don't think organizations can afford to be that way in it it does differ by industry everybody says well the way ender she's a little differ so if you take a look at those that are in a short fuse big bang in terms of global disruption by digital there are a fair amount of industries that fall into that particular quadrant now like we said earlier everybody likes quadrants right because that's what analysts do for a living I particularly like them this one's grether skewed isn't it there's a lot of short short fuse Big Bang there's also long fuse big bang and then there are people that you really don't necessarily want to do this so if you're on this top two-thirds of the chart you want to go for digital now the reality is only twenty-seven percent of organizations that gartner had done a study on looking at hundreds of CIOs actually have a digital plan even if its infant that's not very high so what are these forces now i'm going to use as an example before i joined air gun which is my new research company aragon research with it's a very small one boutique they were the only people i found that we're going to fund me doing what I wanted it's nice to do what you want isn't it and I had a boss that agreed with me or a potential boss I looked at a startup company I wanted to work in a startup company and I wanted to become rich like the really rich people have my own fast car so what I did is I came up with a way of valuating this startup because I didn't know these people sounded like they had a good idea what they were was authorization using biometrics so I decided to use a business framework from hasta welder and put in what that business model would be this helped me evaluate and talking with the cut of the the partners potential partners whether they had a good business model turns out they had a great business model but they lied about how much software they had so I said bye it was just an idea but what's happening this model becomes legacy because of the demand for innovation the speed that's required to stay Jermaine the demands for agility and business change what's your constituents customers shareholders employees partners all of these things and you can read like I can I'm not going to read this for you are stretching your business I'll guarantee you everybody in this room can see the results of this in their organization at least four or five of these are tugging at your CEOs coattails and if it's a she tugging on maybe her purse I don't but this is a big deal so this is one major force stretching organizations also i looked at the technical architecture that they said they had which when i check the code they didn't have it all they had was a fake demo so it's easy to produce fake demos isn't it so they used a comparative they had a server they had websites they dealt with multiple devices they had you know a foolproof three-point approach to the software and I mean it was a great idea they had patents they had lawyers they even had accountants but they didn't have any product so i left them but also that would become a legacy overall because there would be competitors so and there would be new kinds of software we've got the typical things that you've seen now is a secure social mobile we had a good example of that in the last session customer journey mapping signal and pattern recognition we've heard people say I'm not only looking for events i'm looking for associated events that are telling me i have a business pattern that business pattern may mean that i compare that pattern that emerging pattern to some strategy planning that i've done maybe i've used simulation for instance one hospital and i'm aware of did simulations for evacuations after some tornadoes wiped out almost all of the institutions in wichita so all the hospitals got together and said hey we need to come together and we want to see when we've got these emerging condition so these signals and patterns might do that we have fast and big data they're both good and in big data is one thing but super fast state is another and if we're dealing with nano seconds we're going to have that weds web-scale cloud integration Polly analytics Internet of Things which I by the way I don't like that name either but it's out there so we got to live with it unfortunately 3d printing augmented reality blockchain Bitcoin and I don't understand it as deeply as others but what I understand it is it's pretty foolproof in terms of auditing there's a not enough computing power to unravel it even if you could because things are nested and hashed cognitive computing robots we heard about today I believe that were headed the way that Nathan said some of it will be robots someone would be cognitive BOTS some of it will be machines and sensors all you know working to to help us we saw in their last example where that was helpful we're going to see and I've written a chapter for a book that's coming out this summer on how knowledge workers are going to be suit become superheroes because of cognitive insists you can be a generalist and have BOTS help you for the specialty why do we specialize almost all the industry specializes why because we want excellent right and if you have people specializing in the same thing over and over over again they get good well why can't somebody learn that they can and they can put it inside of a cognitive an assist or you could in some cases collaborate but most people when you have to collaborate with other people what do you get delays how many of you are about as impatient as me and can't wait to get the answer right I'm not going to sit there and wait give me a cog that knows I don't care whether it's deep mine I don't care where it's Watson just cog me baby so the idea of context rich a rule and constraint management we said well is everything going to be willy-nilly if we can't write the rules no you put constraints on it so you can wander within certain constraints and governance so these are some of the technologies that can impact the logical architecture I think we've all kind of you've heard this theme over and over again these are the four major areas that digital basically includes customer delight business operations new products and services and potentially business model transformation if all those stresses that I put on the slides earlier is true you're going to get that now is this sequential maybe not maybe you do the business transformation maybe you need a new model because yours is so broken I don't think you know a lot of banking models are broken or maybe they are so here's some real examples where and by the way said I'm a process bigot and a rule bigot that's where I come from here's an example of process this is a retail therapy they determine where the customer is if they if they are a customer they know their cell phone they know they walked in the store they offer them different opportunities the minute they walk in a store let's say they they catch somebody you know looking in the men's department and all of a sudden it links back to the inventory system it says hey we got a kind of shoes this person's buying something for fathers day why don't we offer them a smoking deal in a pair of shoes to go along with the tiles ties that you know this person is looking for with at say it's a daughter or son so this will automatically offer a great offering and also based on what you buy if you don't have a cell phone you're not a great customer and you don't have a credit card it'll put something on the receipt so maybe after you look at you say oh geez I could have got a pair of shoes too here's one fraught so that's at the customer interaction side you know you're hearing a lot of stories just like that right you're getting offers when you go in the store if you're signed up here's one for operations improvement this is an example where they do a simulation for this surgicenter at the beginning of the day and they tag all the patients all the loved ones all the equipment everything and if anything goes wrong there's a monitor that shows they notify everybody and they're able to Risa mew late incrementally simulate to say this is how an efficient operation are to go after living this with this particular one and this has been production for a long time they found out that they needed to buy more sterilizers because the accountant was keeping everybody from buying things do accountants keep people and buying things yes that's their life right just like accounts payable is the stall right so we can improve our operations we can come up with new products and services here's an example of putting wristbands on citizens that happen to have dimension they start approaching the borders I had a father in law that had dementia and he used to do what is known as bolting he decided in his mind that he wanted something new at the hardware store even though he really didn't have anything but in his mind he had to fix something you know they'd find him in the side of the road tipped over with his Walker you know in the gutter like this right if there was a system like this that would let you know when you're approaching a secure the security border that wouldn't happen to him he could have been run over so here's a internet of things combined with you know a normal kind of a process again these are process and rule driven solutions here's another one where it's a new business model this happens to be my home in Arizona it's not for sale I just had to come up with a picture quick so the new way buying a house you photograph a house it knows where you are you create a profile the bank or whoever you're doing by the way this works in Ireland or three banks that do this they aggregate your financials they generate a a budget the search for more homes they create an app and circulated to the lenders they post-closing they offer more services from that bank and then they you know basically auto open new accounts different kind of business model for a big now when I was looking for that house I would love that when you so everybody has issues with their legacy right everybody has issues that they have to deliver with digital is better when it focuses in on the differentiating and Mission Control don't waste your time on standard stuff I mean we're going to sit there and fight all day about the standard things unless somebody comes up with a more innovative way of making something standard differentiating again now I believe that there will be more intelligence added to software more intelligence added to each of our the people we deal with there'll be more intelligence added to all kinds of devices so you're going to have goal-directed processes where all of the resources will swarm automatically to bid on the work that's the world I think we're headed towards that's another one of my biases it's going to take a while before we get there but there are examples of that today we see that in Detroit Edison for instance they have when they see a storm approaching they will automatically let a bunch of independent people know they can restring electric lines and they'll assemble those agents for when the storm occurs and when it occurs in a damage occurs people bid on that work in dependence bid on that kind of work so this is where we're headed and I I think and let's say we're not even going to get there soon I think we're going to get there sooner than later we're going to have to come up with combinations of structured collaboration and IOT agent bidding collaboration working together dynamically this is the kind of process you're going to see a little bit of each piece so we can stop fighting about case and beat and structured BPM please if you want to fight about swarming that's good you know because then it makes it you know there's maybe some interest so the digital world will require creating an incremental transformation plan little by little and this transformation plan over time will improve improve improve and revisit an initial target based on what's happening in the business some of those patterns that we are talking about business patterns will require you to do that now here's a great case study from one of my favorite vendors they started off with these farms where they they took pills and dialed him in for the kind of crop that was in the field they scattered these pills and the pills would call out to the farmers and say I need water I need fertilizer I'm a tomato plant I need it now okay so the second thing they did is they decided what why bother the farmer well you just have the robotic arms come out and give liquid fertilizer and water and then the third was to link so let's say the pills are screaming I went water and turns out there was a storm in in the in the mountains about four miles away and the runoff was going to hit you two days from now so the pills are screaming on what water but if you give them water and this runoff comes what happens in trouble right you're going to drown the plants they also linked it to their weather models their satellite weather models this happened to be Australia and they've increased the output of food output by forty percent so they did it in incremental pieces so this is just an example but these are all live in production today Ike I had a hard time choosing which case studies I wanted because I could have picked from probably two dozen in each category these things are out here is not pretend it's working so what will a journey look like and what provisions should you carry so this is my cut at what you should be looking at you might disagree with me well what does a digital target look like well you need a target business architecture we talked about having modeling tools for business architecture I looked form I couldn't find one I had to do one by hand I think that would help and it would have goals visualizations and phases for the architecture so you have to build one part of the business or revert or rehab part of a business model you need costs and benefits you need a capital expenditure a budget income sources a rough organization some sponsors of people some skills you're contributing technologies off that list I gave you a dozen right I probably didn't get them all and tomorrow there'll be another one so we'll be constantly updating this plan will have to have proof of concepts we said you have to experiment we've got vendors begging us to use their sandboxes to experiment and innovate whether they're fast development whether they're simulation whether they're modeling all of them are they're inviting us to do POCs and we have to figure out what the long-term time frames are we need to come up with verification and measurement and we need to experiment and do post audits what went well what didn't go well right do it try it fix it make dust or eat it that's the world we're living in today can be p.m. play in that world yes some of these examples that I gave you we're done very quickly others not so what are the inputs to building this digital plan there's vision stated and unstated by management that's the hardest part to gather because then you have to go and interview executives I've done this before and you wonder if you're going to end up with your head in in under your arm when you walk out of the room right it's always hard to talk to them sometimes especially if they're high up operation plans if you you're afraid to talk to the executives or your executives aren't open and they're not visionaries look at the operational plans look for common threads get customer inputs whether its focus groups desires tests surveys get competitive industry trends there are benchmarks out there they're our industry focus groups out there start looking for existing constraints that are in the organization's how many of you have sad stories in management limits in your organization right oh you know Frank tried this last time he blew up right see see him he's this melted pot of wax over here right so you have to look for the sad stories you have to look for the political booby traps you know sometimes have you ever seen a manager that's completely incompetent but has a lot of power in middle management have you ever seen that every day so you're going to have to work around those things think about which digital technologies are going to be resisted and think about your legacy you have the salvage and surround and leverage and tweak and revisit by putting rules into old stuff where there's a hot spot you have to do that it's all part of this it's not all Greenfield I wish it was sorry it's not you have to come up with some new principles and by the way I didn't have any principles and my wife claims I don't have any know so i made some up here and say here are some business principles that you might want to consider here are some technical principles you might want to consider so mine is attract and spoil customers I mean that's my number one that I came up with starting and finishing with an outside Ian eliminating internal silos how many of you have ever had to do a transaction where they transfer you from one department to another because they didn't want to deal with it because they were being measured on time and your question was too complicated right or your set of events they couldn't finish with the standard-times that management gave them or they just wanted that punt all of a sudden you're talking to somebody and you get dead noise and you have to go through the queue again wait five minutes and listening to my crappy music right this happens all the time build inclusion and organize for change create operational excellence encourage and reward innovation how many your company's reward you for taking risk anybody yep you get it right happens to you but you're an analyst that's your job right take risks take bullets I work for a company that was the most stodgy conservative company and they realized if they didn't change they were going to be in trouble management came up with a pot of gold it said people that are willing to take risks you get a piece of this pot of gold and we'll evaluate it you several times throughout the year and give out little pieces of gold to those that do it so there are things technical principles collaborate with business we've been talking about that all day experimentation is essential talking about that all day composition instead of creation if it's already there use it if there's a cog in the cloud use it we saw in our last demo where some of the cognitive pieces were already there went out and got them agile development is first prize scalability and security has to be built in these are some principles that I think would be a jumpstart for people you have to have new competencies you have to have constituency engagement how do you keep everybody involved how do you stay hyperaware not just looking for patterns you like look for patterns you don't like complex problem solving every single I'm afraid of complexity and it's all complex and guess what life is complex I mean I keep trying to run away from it but it is complex now someday maybe all these robots and cogs will make my life so easy I don't have to think anymore another struggle anymore I don't creative digital design anticipatory decision making decision when we're going to be talking about decision making a great deal of tomorrow as i understand it innovative productivity operations agility these are the things that we have to work on and this is the same thing i'm going to be telling CIOs and workshops because aragon research is going to be doing workshops for companies you need some new skills to bolster those those competencies your business expertise technology expertise entry level expertise i don't know if i had these right i did these thinking they were right you'll tell me if they're wrong i know you will there may be some missing but you have to have a list to start with to know what you want to work on here are the digital technologies in this this is the same list i showed you before except this one tells you where the risk is if it's green go for it if it's yellow be careful if it's red you may be a pioneer what happens to pioneers they get arrows in their back there you go so I think this one's moving up into yellow and you know in my book I'm publishing it that it's red yet but it could be moving the yellow I haven't seen enough examples and I always I was burnt during the AI period myself I worked on a number of AI systems in the 80s and that stuff was very difficult I think Watson and deep mine make it better but I think there I think there are legal and ethical issues that have to get sorted out yet so this is the typical refining a digital plan you gather you interact you create and iteration is absolutely crucial to digital you know this just happens to be a picture I took who you know from Harvard Business Review it's called the innovators method it's a great method also what's missing is everybody you'll tell you why you need to do digital transformation everybody will tell you what some of the technologies are you can find case studies but there's no real good maturity model that's not so technically oriented it's not useful one of the reasons I joined Eragon is they're going to pay me to fill this in so the next time you see this it'll be filled in and hopefully verified with real case studies at least the early levels the initiating the opportunistic and the managed whether it's habitual or leveraged we will find some companies that will be that and there will be seven or eight things here that I'm going to build on so they're paying me to do that thank you very much what is a digital business platform why do I need one I think each organization is going to have to build a platform probably by best to breed today and it's going to have to help link an industry for dot zero kind of model which to me is the next generation of linking machine to people linking suppliers to providers and this is the kind of complexity it's going to create I know you everybody likes running away from complexity i know i do but it's going to happen and there are examples out there i saw one in seabed and this was just a trial one where they were taking images of people's mouths and jaws and they were sending it to a place that out sourced the creation of brand new teeth for these people whether it was complete or partial replacement so what we're going to see is the combining of sub seconds two minutes here's an example of a digital crash you can see smartphone the texts deceleration phone interrogate the passenger for vital signs they have to be wearing a Fitbit or something or maybe it'll be built into people's clothes I don't know phone sends medical information to the responders phone interrogate the vehicle for damage because the vehicle smart damage report is sent to the fire police and towing and insurance in the phone notifies the next akin that's all happening in sub seconds that's while it's still smoke the radiators still smoking but then also in the white collar side in some cases is repair estimates are sent to various providers from your phone and you get responses back to your phone phone interrogate seeeeee nearby video cameras so the lawyers can lick their lips right the phone sends information to law firms for assessment so you can get to pick your your favorite ambulance chaser so this is the kind of thing you're going to see now I think you're going to have to have a number of different ingredients in your platform this is my first cut at it arrogance going to pay me to make more put more details in it guess what's at the top like I said I'm a bigot for process bigoted for rules it's going to have analytic and cognitive platforms not just be I cognitive integration and development we've been talking a lot about developments for and we're going to have internation internet of thing platforms and application platforms not applications that is wet cement but applications that are built on BPM engines smart process apps I took a first cut at saying who might be on these who has some strength here and I just did my first cut so I could show Aragon it could be done are we going to find one vendor that satisfies all of those well there's some that they have some nice works right there they're over all over here right now on the Internet of Things you got credit if you could aggregate the signals but you know there are some firms on those bubbles that I'm missing so my job is to interrogate so hopefully I'll have a an up to date list and some research that I'll produce via air gun see any air vendors there IBM is not here tip goes in a lot of places software AG's in a lot of places Google's in a couple of great spots Microsoft's in a couple of great spots pegas in a couple of great spots so there's some maybe you know I'm not going to make the mistake and create another intelligent bpms magic quadrant I mean I've already been cheated so you're going to have to put this together yourself so you got to decide whether to buy best a brand or best to breed but my job is to prove this this particular chart right or wrong and add new people and hopefully I'll have time to do that now that somebody I'll have to try to collect from late payments from people that hired me and have to go market myself I've got a steady income now so I can do that I won't say which vendor owes me a lot of money right now but they're in the room so the notion of learning the power of digital technologies I think that's a challenge for all of us it's a challenge for me I showed you some stuff that's green it's not ripe yet right not all of everything I showed you was right not completely demonstrates some customer experience improvements and develop an incremental transformation plan and to help you out I wrote in a book it's coming out in May on digital transformation basically digital transformation inner later died so i'm also a bigot for cognitive computing as well and this is the book that I talked about agents swarming agents trying to bid to do work so these the two on the right are already there the one on the left should be there in May unfortunately I have to tell you a sad story my publisher and editor is a older gentleman older than me and you know I'm older than dirt so this guy decides to do a favor for his neighbor and he walks his neighbor's dog who's named turbo now was that a smart idea turbo guess what happened turbo bolted turbo got the leash wrapped around this guy's legs boom broken hip so that kind of delayed the book Thank You turbo so I'm only five minutes into your drinking time and this is the five minutes that were given me so I finished in well actually 10 minutes over now that i think about it but thank you for your patience
