 hello this is Kirk born and looking forward to talking with you at BOTS camp this year our presentation will focus on cognitive computing artificial intelligence and machine learning do you recall the story when Siri was first released by apple and someone said to their iPhone Siri please call me a taxi in series response was ok from now on I will call you a taxi well this isn't exactly what the person had in mind but Apple soon fixed the app so that i gave a better response now wouldn't it be better if we can train algorithms to learn from experience to learn from their interactions with the world well that's what I'm going to focus on in my bots camp talk is how machine learning algorithms are able to learn from the world that has learned from experience and from interactions with the world I look forward to seeing you virtually that is at BOTS camp thanks very much
