 I appreciate this opportunity and you know we're not unlike most folks here were not a vpm vendor and so when we were talking about it you know this is a what I'm going to share with you is something that comes out of our labs team so I know this is on a 15 second timer so let me let me get started is I'm going to get out of sync so Princeton blue was founded in 2006 we've been doing this for nine and a half years our focus has been to deliver business transformation through BPM and rules and actually we did account just recently and we have done over 300 projects in this domain across a variety of technologies so what's relevant to us is how do you use BPM rules and a few other things which are like that I'm going to get into like cognitive and so on to improve the user experience to improve operational efficiency and to externalize and automate business rules of course everything you see at the bottom is now a part of it right cloud and mobile etc so this is a solution that I'm here to talk to you about and this was touched on in the panel discussion earlier today every every process a process aware app that we build today looks at internal systems for signals to make decisions on and most of the data comes from variety of touch points with a customer whether it be called center website point-of-sale etc you know actually there's a study from IBM that says that eighty percent of the data is out an unstructured format whether it's a blogs forums website etc this is actually based on a real story so last year I I'm a frequent flyer on United I don't have any buddies here from united and i had a not so thrilling experience and i happen to tweet about it I got a feedback from them saying please call our call center at one eight hundred etc now if they knew that I was 1k if they knew where I had traveled if they knew that I had already complained three times and you know would that response have been a little different certainly from a customer perspective I think would have been a Shadid if it was a little different rather than a canned response and that's what we're trying to get to right how do you collect all this information that's out there not just within your systems but beyond that and use that to understand the signals that is within that unstructured data analyze it and look for patterns that are meaningful to you depending on the use case that you're trying to go after and so this you know this this graphic here kind of summarizes it right on the left you see stuff that we've all been doing we've been integrating with your systems and collecting this information on the right is where you know we get to see how will this influence our decisions better right so credit card companies I've always been had a variety of algorithms to say hey this is suspicious activity because the amount is too large or the geography or the location is elsewhere hear what we're saying is imagine if you combine that pointer transaction information with social media because you get the geolocation from both and you can say hey it's not possible to travel a thousand miles in an hour there for one of the two is suspicious right it's just an example of a use case that you couldn't pursue if you were doing that we're going to I need a little bit more time on the slide so after this automated stuff is we were through this I will actually talk to this at right at the start of the the demo this is what it looks like today there was an earlier version of this what we started with two years ago and as newer technologies have become available and affordable and accessible to us we have evolved this this R&D initiative over the last two years you can tell that use cases here are endless right we've developed three use cases but you know you could just and I've spoken to customers and variety of industries everything from banking retailers insurance companies telcos healthcare providers everybody's got use cases that are relevant here so i'm gonna i'm going to show you issue escalation and brand ambassador as we go through the demo so that was i made it through the ignite part so about two years ago when we first started this this solution came about because as we've been working with clients we see that most organizations have you know some form of Lean Six Sigma going on for process improvement BPM going on they're not talking to each other they are separate the technology folks and then there's a marketing team somewhere in the corner that's doing what i would call social listening you know if you put it on the process modeling maturity curve that's probably one right you're listening that's what that's what united did they heard my tweet and they responded we'd like to get them past the social listening part to the point where you're taking actionable customer insight right you get that insight that you can actually make a decision on and improve the customer experience improve retention and and so on so back then we use a lot of open source capabilities that were out there we build some api's to the various social media capability we used some open source sentiment engines we used some complex event processing capability in open source as well and we used we used ibm's rule engine operational decision manager and over the years a year later Watson became available as a service and accessible like that's a lot of you know cognitive compute power that's now available to us that wasn't few other services came out on the bluemix cloud offering and the new version of the rules engine came out which combined complex event processing and rules into one and so combining all of these technologies this is the second generation of this this capability so here's what here's one of the use cases that I'll show you right now I know because I've been mining social media for you know for certain individuals I know what their social influence statuses based on that I can and I can see what else has occurred so if I know that this customer had opened a service request and that request was then followed by some negative or angry tweeting or you know or other activities and all happened within a certain amount of time that's relevant to me I'm I may want to you know do an escalation of that process right which I which in the traditional world would have been a very simple thing right it you wouldn't have this ability to combine all this similarly the other way around you got a brand ambassador you got somebody out there that's saying a lot of good stuff about you you know and it's done it frequently enough that you care about it right so these are the two use cases which I'll show you in a second but really this is not just about social media right there is unstructured data even within your own organization right every company has internets there is full of information there's public records there's new sites these blogs forums anything that's relevant I mean we're talking to a health care provider and the use cases we're talking about have nothing to do with social media because they're in a b2b business model not in a b2c right I just want to show you that you know in terms of what's available right now from a cognitive perspective I mean we just use one of the services and I think every day more and more services are being made available and this is that this is the capability that was you know beyond reach for most of us even as partners or as customers because you know Watson was Watson right and this is now how we can represent rules so i can actually described using this language i can actually combine events and rules into one which is I think a pretty pretty powerful statement so I can I can save the sentiment was negative and the anger school was more than this and you know it hasn't happened before in the last seven days and it was preceded by this or followed by that then I care about it right so with that let me so John is our social influencer in this example so John's been tweeting and you can see that he's he's got some issues going on with the bank right these these tweets go back like last nine hours 12 hours 14 hours so he's he's not happy apparently right so what's happened as a result and I asked my team when I landed here yesterday I asked my team to start sending out tweets right so you can in that's what that's what they've been doing they've been sending out some tweets about this guy and here is what the dashboard looks like that's now listening to all these signals and and and picking them up it turns out that John actually used to be a brand ambassador for us and you know he was because of all the good things that he was saying and the tone has gone quite negative so this dashboard actually is listening to all this activity that's coming out of all this unstructured data that's been coming in signals that have been picked up from that and all that is then fed into dashboard in you know once this actually gets out to be implemented the next thing you'd want to do is you'd want to actually use BPM for actioning it right because you're going to pick up 30 40 50 signals a day you're not going to manually action them right you're going to have a structured process that make sure that there's some follow-up it gets routed to the right people and so on but in this case we can see this is how it's so this is now what we see about John right we can see that in addition to traditional information we have about it we can see the demographics and stuff but by looking at what he's been doing in the unstructured data world we actually have an idea of what his presence is what his following is he's got three profiles he's got a pretty high reach count he's got influence because whenever he put something out there people like it and he's his volume is fairly high so this is what we consider to be an influencer right and I know you're probably wondering well how do you know so much about this guy because that's question we get all the time you know you actually ask them to provide it you'll be amazed how many people give it to you as part of their profile as long as you provide a value as service on that channel right we never give out our cell phone numbers or email addresses if you go back a few years but we do now because I want to know what my flights delayed so I'm happy for them to have my cell phone number so but there are other ways to get this information as well through api's and emails and so on but the most reliable ways to just ask them to give provided to you and in most cases they do so you know we also have things that based on whatever he is like we can see what his interested so if we're going to reward him with some form of a loyalty program we're actually gonna we can actually see what he's interested in so that that loyalty program can be tied to that right a discount at an auto part store or whatever because he likes cars right so now you can see here that the tweets and everything else that we did earlier on and you can see this was from pretty early this morning the 9 14 hours ago you know that that same stuff has come through here so it's been categorized as a sentiment is is red that means it's negative the mood is kind of sad face so that's why this got picked up an escalation rule got triggered because of because of these two indicators here right you've got the sentiment coming in and you've got the mood coming in and if I go and see the source you can see that this was this was the the tweet that actually triggered it there were many because remember the use case calls for multiple tweeting so just because you tweet once it doesn't pick it up our rule says you must tweet three times over a certain period of time in order for it to be triggered right because we don't want we're trying to eliminate some false positives right sir and so you get a history of of this of this individual in terms of you know what the sentiment and what the tone of what's happening in the social world and and that's now determining you know how I escalate issues how I resolve them so in the case of United Airlines you know if there was this contextual information available to them in terms of how many times I've tweeted in terms of whether I am a social influencer or not in they obviously know about my travel patterns because they have all that information but if they had the rest of the information maybe the response would have been different right and so in terms of who is this relevant to you know the specific use case that I shared with you is relevant to organizations that are dealing with consumers directly and particularly the demographic that is you know the millennial types or or you know in that age group that are more active in these social platforms but having said that you know the reason why I look at it as beyond just social media is I can get I can use that same service to get sentiment from any you know any site where I have natural language right so i can pick up the natural language and i can analyze it to understand what's being said and how it's you know how it's perceived how does the sentiment and tone are perceived to be so based on that i can make decision so in talking to a health care provider they said yes while we don't sell our products and their products our plans and they sell them to the insurance companies and to the employers but you know when you go and use that card at a doctors or a drugstore if it doesn't go through you're going to the brand that first comes to your mind is the insurance company and the plan provider right so they believe that while they're in a b2b model their customers customers input is just as important them right in in in talking to in talking to retail banks very similar feedback retailers of course you know that are selling apparel and so on very very interested in in this type of a capability but we've even found interest with the telcos you know so your ISPs right I mean how many you go to youtube and look up comcast service issues that you'll see how much stuff comes up so I think at the end of the day you know yes it's more applicable in a b2c but there's definitely some use cases for b2b when you go after health records you go after certain blogs news media sites and so on
