 the measures of dispersion follow the measures of central tendency so the common measures of dispersion are standard deviation and variance and if you are ethically works at your college by now you know about the bell curve which looks like this and you know often hear that this is one standard deviation of the mean or within two standard deviation of the mean so let's see what it means what is standard deviation and how we compute it let's look at the age of an instructor so let's say if the average age is 52 what does it mean it means that the individual ages may differ some may be 48 or maybe 55 or 75 so the average age is an estimate but what we also need is an estimate for the dispersion in the data set the other thing to note is we range in in our data set for example the difference of the range is from a minimum of 29 years of age to a maximum of 73 years and this to you it's a distance or the difference between the minimum and the maximum now unlike the mean the the main difference between a variance for the population and sample is that when you compute the population variance you divided by the total number of observations these are the deviations between observation and the mean squared and then add them and then divided by the total number of observations and for sample you divided by n minus 1 we usually talk about squares called standard deviation rather than the variance and standard deviation is essentially the square root of the variance and the variances in square units so it's good to use the standard deviation because it's is exactly the same units as the variable so during standard deviation of age will also be measured in years rather than square years which could be various so here you see we just taken the square root of variance and that becomes standard deviation so we will return to our data set and we will look at the variables then we've computed the mid the the mean and the maximum before but now this time we'll add 10 deviation to it we will return to our data set now and use another command called descriptive statistics and click on on descriptives and we select the variables of choice and then example aid of the instructor and under options we have the mean the standard deviation minimum and maximum and let's select the other variables as well so we click on OK and we have the same variables computed with the number of observations minimum maximum mean and standard deviation now let me explain why mean and standard deviation have to go hand in hand and I will revert to this example from basketball and talk about the two giants of basketball Michael Jordan my favorite and Wilt Chamberlain who preceded Michael Jordan now if you consider their average score per game you would notice that they didn't differ much their average was around 30 points for both Jordan and Chamberlain however when you look at the standard deviation or variance with their performance and michael jordan was at around four point seven six compared to chamberlain who was it around 10.59 and here if you were to plot this distribution to see how a Michael Jordan using the mean and standard deviation assuming that their scores are normally distributed you would notice that Michael Jordan's consistency comes out and it's a very different distribution very focused distribution compared to the one for Wilt Chamberlain and same mean 30 but you see that the distribution is different suggesting that Jordan was much more consistent in his performance than Wilt Chamberlain we can also plot the variance using histogram in SPSS so let's say we want to do this we return to our data set click on crafts we have several choices let's say we use a legacy dialog box and say histogram select the variable which is the teaching evaluations score and then say ok and the output comes out here now you could see it's similar to the one that we've got in our slide we can add titles and footnotes to our chart and we can produce multiple histograms based on a variable let's say some gender we click here and then to okay you see that we have got one drawn for females and one got drawn for males so the the main argument in praise of standard deviation or variance is that average will out the mean will paint a partial picture if you really want to understand the complete and picture for a variable or for your data set you have to compute both the average ends and the standard deviation to understand the variance and notice that all risk metrics and Finance have much to do with with standard deviation so a mean with the standard deviation means something more useful than the mean itself
