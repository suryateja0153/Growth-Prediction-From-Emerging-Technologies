 [Music] butum all this is Vijay Quixote so welcome to this webinar for application of artificial intelligence and big data in IOT series basically I am working as a data scientist and have seven years of work experience and I work across multiple problem statements and IOT is one of my favorite areas the agenda for this webinar is going to be a highly simple so what I'm going to do is I will introduce you to a IOT and then there is going to be a Big Data introduction artificial intelligence introduction and there are two case studies which would you know I want you guys to have a look at it and then we will end up with career paths in IOT space and machine learning followed by you know questions and discussions so this is going to be the agenda and let's get this started so what is IOT so IOT is basically you know connected devices with lot of interactions happening among themselves and you know there is no hard fast rule that this is going to be your IOT and this is not so it's about you know X number of devices getting connected with each other talking to each other and doing lot of communications and this IOT you know Internet of Things how it is being used across Big Data artificial intelligence is something fascinating and you know what we will be doing this have a look at what is the trend of IOT and then we will quickly move on to Big Data and artificial intelligence so let's have a look at this particular infographic which I would like to show so this is something which we are talking on the growth of Internet of Things and they have taken the trends for the past few decades and the thing is by 2020 it is estimated to be 50 billion devices and currently we are close to 29 million which means you know we are going to see a 50 percent increase in the number of devices which are getting connected to each other and having a lot of interactions and on top of that what is fascinating is machine learning artificial intelligence and the tools required to pull insights and have recommendations on top of it now when it comes to Big Data and Internet of Things it's more about understanding the basics of Big Data which is you know volume velocity variety and how good the data is how fast that it does is that extreme or is it contains continuously streaming data when I talk about artificial intelligence it's more of a huge you know application oriented space let's say you know self-driving cars traffic recognition on-board diagnostics and as an equal based alert system and things like that so the key focus areas are going to be you know as listed below it's going to be home automation self-driving cars and there are a lot of applications across telecom automobile wearables is one of the most upcoming areas let's say you know Google glass or Samsung or people and you will also have a lot of applications across oil and gas when I talk about oil and gas it's more into safety planning optimization problems and how good and how efficient we can carry out things and the last one manufacturing it's more of predictive maintenance and you know preventive maintenance as well we are looking into how we can use the existing systems and have a better service and cancel so this is something we are going to talk with respect to IOT but this is not you know again limited now the basics of Big Data this is something you know almost everyone would have heard of but I would say this is the most basic thing which you know any data science or machine learning or you know somebody's interested in IOT must know so volume velocity variety and velocity again you know volume we are talking about petabytes and Zeta bytes of data and you know when I talk about velocity how fast the streaming data is is it per second or is it per minute or is it just per day or even instructions or seconds so that will again impact your you know IOT platform and then and then the most important thing what kind of big data tools you are using when I say streaming data the tool which you use should be highly performance oriented and the LA third one is going to be variety of data let's say social media and I'm talking about video data or image data so any big data tool which you are using again should support the different varieties of data and the veracity now porosity is most difficult to handle you know it's highly uncertain we do not know what kind of data it is going to give what kind of users are going to us and what kind of you know uncertain things are going to happen the reason is you know multiple people are using and multiple geographies are linked to each other now considering all these four criterias I would say whenever you want to choose a big data tool this is going to be our basics you know one out of these four will definitely impact the business and the point is you know out of my experience and knowledge and whatever I have heard at least two should get you know a dirt to that big data tool whichever you select when we are going to address any platform it's not just about IOT it's about any platform and you know when you are able to see that you know at least two are getting solved then that you know we it means that we are on the right track so this is about you know the basics of Big Data but you know any any if whether it be you who wants to really use this particular platform should be very aware of these particular concepts now artificial intelligence so I will be spending you know enough time on this what I would say is this is not again limited it's more of you know using multiple things to you know improvise the in size and use how good you can now let's say chatbots so this pyramid will clearly tell you you know how the particular business is being driven how people are using multiple technology tools to use artificial intelligence in IOT space now you know I would like to highlight on the first one chat board so we have heard a lot of you know frameworks on chat boards lot of applications on chat boards and how it is being used across multiple scenarios the point is you know chat boards is something which people used to gather information and then give the required answers when it comes to IOT space the chat board is going to slightly work in a different way you want to understand how much information you will get across devices and what is the information the other device is seeking it can be in you know safety areas it can be in let's say optimization areas so the chat bots are you know works in the way that you know the more the data you feed it understands better and it starts responding in a better manner now when I talk about a deep learning and you know natural language understanding it's more of you know high-end processing algorithms where you use let's say you know CNN RN and you know lsdm and gr use of the world and try to make the algorithm understand that whenever such a pattern is available it means that you need to do a say let's say you know an X or Y I think but the point is you know what we want to grab out of this particular sliders how much of you know companies are working how much of research is being done on all these areas and again everything is very specific to you know Internet of Things so let's say in natural language understanding a quick example is nowadays we can see that you know there are support executives who will answer to your queries now when we find that you know we are able to train the chat board and make it understand using NLP algorithms then there is going to be you know an automated tool or an automated software which can answer any question and you know give you better answers so that's the you know kind of research and you know people have come up with some wonderful tools which can answer any question and then you know gives the appropriate answer so that is something you know NLP does and you know what we tried to do was let's say an IOT company wants to use NLP as a support platform what they tried to do was you know they use these chat BOTS training them with lot of NLP algorithms and you know make the people understand on multiple IOT products let's say you know I want to have a you know a Wi-Fi router you know which can control my PC and I just you know you know give let's say in a chat board that you know I want a Wi-Fi router to control the TC now what it understands using NLP algorithms is that a person a or b wants to control the you know laptop or desktop using Wi-Fi as a medium of you know controlling mechanism so there is going to be a you know frequent block between a laptop or desktop towards the Wi-Fi and it's going to happen you know vice versa but the point you know overall the understanding should be that you know you need to train the machine learning algorithm and the reason artificial intelligence is that you don't need to do it everything it lets say you know if the chat bot is not sure of any question what it does is it tries to say in a very different way in it I'm not sure of this I would like to answer it sometime later so what it does is meanwhile when it gets the actual answer from let's say some other person the next time you come up you will get the answer that's the you know best part of artificial intelligence and it is highly automated we don't do you know we don't repeat multiple tasks what it does is it tries to understand on its own and give us the answers so this is about you know artificial intelligence in you know IOT space so what I will be doing in the next you know let's say fifteen or twenty minutes I would want to you know cover of two case studies one big data in IOT and artificial intelligence in IOT so this particular you know big data in IOT case study is a real implementation it has been done by a lot of companies across the world you know AG Rowland and multiple other companies who try to use you know big data and IOT as a couple technology platform to improve a lot of you know a to improve efficiency you know increase the number of e's and also lower cost it tries to optimize everything and you know on a high level I do not want to get into the you know Lola in depth of the technology but on a high level I would say the people have used you know our Hadoop and you know geospatial tools and the technology is more of using RF IDs and you know biosensors gates and let's say you know techniques it's again a random forestry models but not limited to again it's going to have very high sense of using neural networks as a algorithm to implement this particular case tree now coming to the business problem there are a lot of you know livestock a lot of images there's going to be huge amount of streaming data and you can see that you know the livestock is moving here and there and you know there are other parties you have a lot of you know weather factors biological factors which again would add to the challenge now the question here is how do I increase my eel and lower my cost both in parallel so these people have actually you know used all these tools and technologies they have come up with or say you know a huge implementation by using these tools there is going to be two parts to this one you know a real-time algorithm which runs on the live data and as well you know you will have a batch processing which does lot of you know activities behind the screen to understand how to improve yields and again you know how do i lower my cost so the solution is highly you know technology oriented it has a lot of scope in image processing again but overall what we try to focus here is how are these devices connected with each other and how are we using multiple sources of data let's say you know I use satellite imagery data I use RFID tag data and I also have my you know biological and you know weather-related factors which is again stored in some database and I have to couple all these things because each one has you know its own frequency let's say I talk about you know satellite imaging I'm not going to get up you know say every second it's more of you know over a long period whereas you know RFID data I'm going to give it every second so remember we were talking about uncertainity of data this is more on those lines you know I don't know and I'm not sure how frequent am I going to get and what is the different type of data am I going to get so this is these kind of challenges are you know always posed in any big data tool and when it comes to IOT these challenges are something which should be handled and you know should be trained before you know real-time challenge occurs that's why you know we do a lot of testing of algorithms we do a lot of you know even training of algorithms we try to focus more on the efficiency of the model so this you know helps on understanding what kind of technology challenges we have and also where do we use you know machine learning algorithms coupled with you know big data and IOT platforms so this is more of implementation and you know let's say you know the company was able to understand all the complications and you know they were implementing it and yes they were able to lower significant amount of cost as well as the yields were really huge more than the cost you know they were able to have lot of you know output factors which actually was consumed to the N business so this is more on a practical you know application oriented case study this is again not limited to you know using only these kind of tools and technologies probably you can use multiple other tools for the same case study but you know this is more on understanding perspective how are we using the multi you know all the tools in the market and bringing out the best of it this again ties back with your basics of big data you need to understand you know how complicated and how well equipped are to create a platform so this is on the lines of you know a big data case study in Internet of Things now the next state case study is going to be more of using artificial intelligence and IOT so these are something which you know people might have you know heard of let's say you know in a realistic scenario when you go to a manufacturing industry you have lot of managers you have lot of workers and there is chances of you know immediate issues coming there on field technician should go and look at it now these people you know who did this particular implementation used Amazon eco and what they did is you know breathtaking they understood the multiple you know data platforms they processed it they use artificial intelligence on top of it and basically what they did is they tried to simulate a human being handling multiple other situations let's say when I understand that you know a machine is going to you know have some problem using the historical later the algorithms are able to predict that you know this machine a is going to face such a problem at this particular time or let's say you know in the next 24 US and what this device does is it opens up for the technician who is going to you know work on this particular issue and once in that this is the time limit which you can have and you need to solve this and if you're not solving these are the complications now coming back to the you know situation of where the industry is located right you have let's say you have 100 technicians when you actually implement this particular platform you only really need 100 technicians because it also prioritizes the issues and says that these are the set of issues which you need to solve at the first and these you not you know solve in the next upcoming you know 24 hours or 48 hours and this is one of the complicated you know platform I would say again the tools used are you know are or you know you can also use Python or you can use any particular machine learning you know tool there are big data platforms and there is also a wise recognition now I would like to highlight something on voice recognition this is a very huge area and people explore a lot of things what we see that you know we use neural networks we use LS schemes to make it understand that this is what a you know a particular person is responding let's say I predicts that an issue a is going to pop up in the next 20 for us and what the technician does is in return he also asks set a set of questions okay tell me where is the you know location available tell me how many number of backup machines I have so many then the person ask these kind of questions what it does is it understands it the person voice it decrypt that you know this is the text for it this is the transcript he was talking about and then goes and searches the database whether that's such a you know possibility is available and takes observe you know and this is required for that and again comes up with the end solution that you know the location is let's say you know 500 meters to observe you know south of this particular point and you have you know other tools like this available in that location for it to solve so the you know the intelligence level is very high but you know there is a lot of complications in you know training the algorithms you know let's say even if you want to train your neural networks or if you want to train your LS DMS what we try to do is you know increase the amount of training data and make it understand what you know these are the possible challenges which occur and these are the questions we ask the more the questions are asked the more the algorithm is getting now coming back to the you know actual problem you can see that I have violated two different things right to voice base alerts which we were talking about where you know Amazon eco or you know any any device would do that I can google also has come up a latest device which can you know put down alerts which can you know do voice recognition and process the data then voice recognition based initiating system changes now let's say a technician wants to switch off machine B all he would do is he will understand that you know based on the alert I don't want my machinery to run further so he goes and gives a command switch off machine B now what it does is it understands that person B has asked him to switch it off and since these guys are you know highly connected with Jeter using Internet of Things platforms or let's say you know they are connected in some mode of communication it goes and switches off now what happens as the result is the Machine B is safe from you know a huge you know problem as well as the efficiency is not being disturbed at any cost and thereby the throughput is also existent because you know as a result let's say you have hundred machines and one particular machine is being switched it off now the remaining 19 has to work in such a way that you know the demands are kept up and you know the complexity is not being brought to the table in the form of you know low low output so this is more of you know highly intelligent platform and we can see that you know lot of you know startups and lot of companies have started using this I would say that you know Tesla is one such company who does wonderful things using artificial intelligence voice recognition and all these guys are highly connected to each other so there is no way that you know we can see just an alert we also see a solution we also see what is can be done to compensate that you know the business problem being talked about now coming to the solution but there are three parts to it one you have your you know IOT space where all these guys are connected number two you also need to understand that whenever there is an IOT a proper big data tool or a platform should be made available let's say you know I use Hadoop or you know any any particular in technology or a tool to capture that data the third part is your you know core machine learning engine on top of in on the data and what I mean by artificial intelligence is not just building a model but taking it to the next level making people understand that you know there is going to be a precautionary alert or there is going to be an emergency alert or this is just you know caution al you know alert and apart from that you need to answer the questions being asked by the field technician because there are a lot of complications on the field which you know he would like to solve let's say you know I raised an issue the algorithm says that the probability of a machine failure is just 60 percent now it's up to the technician to you know either continue or you know discontinue so what he says is know it since it's just 60 percent I would say you know let's go ahead for the next 24 hours so it means that you know after 24 hours whether the person is present or not these you know these communication divisor the use unrest and the you know answer / that particular technician and switch it off just up to 24 us thereby you know increasing the efficiency and also understanding what is being asked and what is not being asked so the differentiation between you know what is being asked and not asked is more of you know intelligent algorithms can understand it and in practically you know you know it understands the other complexities and prioritizes so you know I think even uber uses artificial intelligence one of the best use cases is of a self-driving class though this is more of a research area but we can see that you know Google and Tesla were able to come up with successful implementations but still you know there are certain challenges available you know one of the cases where Google wasn't able to figure out was highly moving you know traffic so there are multiple people coming in and the face recognition uh you know was absolutely a big problem because what it can seem that you're nearby is more prominent what it can see farther from the our car is prone to error so this is more of a safety issue and you know there is a lot of complications and humans are involved so hence you know the better algorithm is being implemented the better output when it comes to a you know Tesla I would say that particular artificial intelligence implementation is slightly different they are focusing on self-driving mechanisms and also safety they are focusing on engine performance one such part of engine performance monitoring using IOT is onboard diagnostics we try to see you know how we can improve the Diagnostics characters and all eight people are using it as a surface mechanism let's say you know any luxury car provider wants to understand how his customers are currently is are they running towards problem or I know they are going good what I do is I try to understand their data I just say that you know being on the past historical data I feel that it's time for you to come for a service or it's time for you to change such a part or you know just come for a general you know checkup and things like that because that's the service impact towards the brand value let's say you know BMW or bends or Volvo comes at such a feature it's more of giving the customer the highly sophisticated you know service mechanisms without the customer being prompting and you know say you know I'm facing some issues so it is more of a proactive approach is being used and you know such a way that you know it's not just about using you know neural networks or LS games it's more of understanding customers ones customers needs and then coming up with solution which actually is in demand so let's say you know I do when artificial intelligent you know platform which the customer doesn't want however you know best it be still the customer doesn't want it right so it's not going to have a huge impact so even if it's going to be a simple impact let's say I think a reason we were able to see that in Ross Joyce kind of cars it has a night vision view which is able to clearly understand the difference between roads and you know traffic signals and also you know human beings and animals so what it says that you know in the next 100 meters or 200 meters you know I can see someone standing and there is a change in the technology they don't just use you know normal technology I think they use infrared rays and other technology based approaches to understand that such an object is existing and coming to the traffic signals that's the best you know rolls-royce could come up with when it when we talk about especially night night driving so they have an enhanced feature called night vision where you can see in your touchscreen that such a feature is available and I just want to you know give you a caution this is you know putting the customers for friend and having them surrounded with all these artificial intelligence tools to come up with the best you know approaches and best solving mechanisms now this particular you know artificial intelligent based approaches more of using voice recognition speech recognition and you know coming out with wonderful algorithms to trigger a caution node and also understand you know the technician questions and answer them so this is more of you know an implementation oriented case study there are this is going to be a highly complex one compared to the earlier one the earlier one you know again image recognition and still complex but you know the shortcut to do the earlier use cases you can still go ahead and create a platform without image recognition this one is more of a complex feature that we use voice recognition and this is not going something which you know can be avoided so basically what we are trying to say is try to do things which are intelligent enough and which customer really wants thereby you know you should show a lot of you know implementation based advantages rather than you know being highly costly or you know difficult enough to implement because when it comes to the you know business at the end of the day it's more on understanding customers once rather than you know whatever rnd we want to do so you know just give a thought before whenever you want to build a platform and then you know you can build it by you know changing certain things understanding certain things and then coming up with the best set of solutions now I think this is the last part you know I wanted to cover and after that you know it will be put open to questions and discussions now out of what I have seen in you know the carrier track I I kind of have divided into three different flavors one is going to be functional the other one is going to be technical so these are going to be an end to end and now there is something which is involving you know both technology and functional let's say you know when I talk about functional it's going to be your BD guy your Sales Lead and it's going to be a product manager and it's highly you know towards consulting you know and product development and also you know bringing in more you know pcs or projects so these kind of you know rows are highly functional when I talk about technical I would say you know all the research oriented roles like say you know artificial intelligent engineer or a ml researcher can be clubbed under you know technical I do not want to say data scientist as a highly technical role because what we data scientists do is understand both the business problem and try to come up with a solution which actually solves the business problem and there is a chance that you know you have a project manager for any IOT platform or IOT project or IOT application so when I say you know these distinctions it's always good to have a clear understanding of the rules do's and don'ts or the expectations let's say when I talk about ml research it's about bringing up new algorithms or changing the existing algorithms to come up with the extra feature or you know make it highly efficient so this is going to be highly research oriented and people who work here are you know highly geared towards coming up with new new algorithms or new techniques which can improve the efficiency when I talk about functional it's going to be the other and you know I want to understand what is the want in the industry and you know what these functional guys does do is you know talk the techno functional people or talk with technical people and make them understand that this is something which you know is wanted more in the industry can you come up with a good algorithm or can you come up with a good mechanism whereby I can you know solve these problems so this is more of you know they work together there's no way you know only one particular chunk of people come and solve the problem and you know it just happens after that that is a very risky factor because you know once your algorithm is fail there's no way you know to get saved by you know at any cost so the algorithm is to be retrain and hence you need a data scientist the other way around you know when I talk about project manager it is more of you know prioritizing things understanding the complications of the algorithms and also understanding the business requirements of the clients or customers let's say you know I want an algorithm which you know tells me how to improve my sins now the question of how to improve my sales is you know you can divide it into multiple things I need lot of insights towards my sales positive and negative and I also need to predict my sins so thereby you know you should build an algorithm which will give you more towards you know prediction as well as insights your prescriptive analytics part so hence you know you can't come up with you know any black box algorithm which doesn't give you let's say insights or any any depth into how can I improve my cells because these are things which people will really want to you know have a real time approach and I want to see how good I'll give them this so this is more towards a you know implementation perspective whereas your technical roles are going to be highly towards you know using the existing algorithms coming up with new algorithms I have seen people you know changing the way SVM works your support vector machine and trying to build a new support vector you know algorithms which can you know come up with better efficiency you can see a lot of white papers which are being published and one such you know outcome which is very you know this is being used across a lot of industry is this your you know industry we we all know how you know this came up Andrew ng the most you know prominent personality and professor across artificial intelligence stream was the you know master brain behind these kind of you know algorithms particularly LS teams is something which you know they had device and come up with you know understanding how can I use neural networks without forgetting the past and hence you know I can give the best output so these are some you know complicated things but it's more towards research where as your functional and techno function you don't try to you know create something new what you try to do is use the existing things improve the way it is working and hence you know solve the business problem you try to understand the clients requirements and focus on you know how can this being so these are you know a lot of carrier but again you know this is a very high level so the reason I have color coded in red is to understand the distinguishing between functional and techno functional obviously technical is something which you know people will be very clear but this a distinction between functional and technical tional rules are very you know sensitive and people need to understand the ins and outs and hence you know you can choose your career path you know I would say there are a lot of universities which offer both techno functional programs or technical programs as well as functional programs so it depends on your aspirations and I would say you know try to talk with these set of people data scientists try to talk with consulting people you will get more insights towards you know how these are being used across industry so this is the you know my take on career path again you know there can be multiple flavors of this but on a high level these are the three distinctions and you know the difference and similarities there are obviously going to be a lot of similarities and differences similarities you try to create a you know you try to solve the business problem in a different way you don't use your conventional approach now the difference is something where you know multiple teams work I don't want to have a researcher at this point of time this is something you know will get decided upon the business problem if the clients requirement is you know towards come up with a new algorithm then yes you wouldn't you would have to do it so when I say you know come up with an algorithm which solves my business problem it is more towards you know a data scientist or a team of data scientists would work together and hence you know solve a business problem so this is my you know high high level over B one the career path the this applies both to IOT analytics you know artificial intelligence because all these guys work together hand in hand and you know there is very less chance of you know distinguishing between each other so you know we have lot of firms which offer functional roles let's say you know consulting KPMG and you know a lot of Accenture and other consulting companies do it technical roles I could see a lot of startups coming up the highly technical roles there you know lot of research is being implemented and being used
