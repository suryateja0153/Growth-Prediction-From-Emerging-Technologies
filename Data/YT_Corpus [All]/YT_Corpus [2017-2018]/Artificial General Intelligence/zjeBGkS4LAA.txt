 Artificial intelligence is, really, techniques that help machines and computers mimic human behavior. It's like a Russian nesting doll… Artificial intelligence, at the highest level, is the device being smart. How it becomes smart under the hood then is the next layer of machine learning, which are the general techniques or variety of techniques that are used to make that device smart. And then there's a further subset of algorithms or techniques called deep learning. Artificial intelligence is going to be used in everything. So I'll give you two examples: If a car has intelligence built in, if it can see the world, so looking at what's on the road, looking at you as the driver, and being able to anticipate and course correct when something goes wrong, something jumps into the road. Autonomous vehicles of any kind are not going to be autonomous without artificial intelligence. In the medical field, new treatments that’ll come from the analysis of reams of data to detect cancers and diseases. Today, machines are smart. And they're smart because of AI. But AI still has a dependency on us, people. We're making it possible. The next phase is when artificial intelligence is able to walk on its own. Companies, like Qualcomm, if we do our jobs right and if artificial intelligence is done right, the actual implementation is totally transparent to a consumer. What they end up with is devices in their world that are more than utilities. They're actually experiential. And they will make your life easier, more exciting. This is truly a transformational technology. It's that big.
