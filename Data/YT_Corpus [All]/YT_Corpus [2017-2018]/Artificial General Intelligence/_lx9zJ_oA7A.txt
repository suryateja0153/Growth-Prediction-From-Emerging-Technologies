 Elon Musk seems to have a phobia about artificial intelligence but I'm not sure if it's warranted neither are Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg hi I'm Ben sullens at AZ dynamics and today we're gonna take a look at why e LAN is so concerned about this and why others are less so to understand why Elon is so afraid we need to first understand what artificial intelligence or AI is in computers artificial intelligence is the field of work that involves creating programs that can mimic human intelligence such as playing chess or solving algebra problems while today we think of those as obvious examples that a computer can perform exceedingly well when the field of AI research started at Dartmouth College in 1956 these were astonishing feats some of the founders at the time were so excited about the field of AI that they proclaimed machines will be capable within 20 years of doing any work a man can do so remember this was the 1960s when the field of AI really started to ramp up not exactly the era you think of when you think about the advancements and all of technology and computers in fact computers around then we're barely a thing and mostly focused on processing complex equations which actually led to some pretty amazing things such as putting a man on the moon think about that for a second in the era where a 5 megabyte hard drive barely enough to hold a couple of photos by today's standards had to be hauled onto a freight container and lifted using heavy machinery we were able to combine what humans know and the calculation power that a computer gives us to figure out exactly what we need to to put a person on the moon and return them back to earth safely so with as primitive as things were remember 5 megabytes was had to be hauled on a truck and on an airplane with heavy machinery and here I have 64 gigabytes of full 13 thousand times more storage about the size of a fingernail I mean it's it's unfathomable how far we've come since those days and it only was about 60 years ago so was that the first AI system was that really something that was artificially intelligent that mimicked human behavior by today's standards many would say no if you zoom out a bit you could argue that the computers used in 60s to land a man on the moon were merely imitating what humans could do if given the time they just were able to do it faster and more accurately so if artificial intelligence is merely creating machines and programs and things that mimic human intelligence what's the big worry why are we so afraid of this well we've come a long way since the 1960s and along the way we had many advancements in technology namely the Internet now the Internet is when things started to get a little bit more science fiction like and visions of the world where machines had taken over started to become or at least seem a bit more real because now with the internet computers and machines could be controlled remotely giving us that global sense of there could be something that takes over and turns the machines against us here now that they're all connected together in this giant Network as well data could be transferred which led to some major innovations in the field of artificial intelligence with the practice of machine learning with machine learning the idea was that we could teach the computer how to learn on its own given just a little bit of instruction this has led to many advancements that are fueling the AI hype cycle that we're in today no longer just an advanced calculator the AI systems we know of today are doing complex things like feeding people at jeopardy translating hundreds of languages instantly and soon they'll be able to drive us home after a night out with friends so far what we're talking about here are systems that are known as artificial narrow intelligence and some may call it weak AI artificial narrow intelligence is when the system is focused on a specific task and really incapable of doing anything else all of the examples we've seen so far fall into this category although IBM's Watson is pushing the boundary a little bit with its ability to understand a multitude of topics so far so good right we have these incredibly smart computers that can do really cool things but there's no big fear of them taking over and becoming self-aware is there well maybe and it has to do with the next level of AI called artificial general intelligence or strong AI this is where AI systems will be able to reason plan understand complex ideas and find solutions to problems quickly by learning from experience ok this is where things start to get a little scary if you've seen the sci-fi movie ex machina you'll remember Ava a human like Android that is generally intelligent she's able to trick her guests into helping her escape if we achieve this level of AI things could get bad quick as they did in the movie for her friend so if that wasn't enough there is yet another level called artificial super intelligence leading AI think er Nick Bostrom defines super intelligence as an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills this is where Elon and others like Ray Kurzweil and Stephen Hawking are really worried if rather when we as humans create something this intelligent we will no longer be able to control it and it could easily run wild killing us all and once we lose control of a system like this we won't even know how to stop it the intelligence it has will be so far beyond our own that we won't even be able to figure out how it works even if we assume it's good versus being evil the needs it has will differ greatly from our own likely resulting in a conflict that we just can't win so yeah it could happen and we probably should be a little concerned however the rate we're going it's still a ways out I mean Siri can't even play songs from Spotify yet in the meantime the battle between Elon Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg and our other tech leaders will wage on hopefully bringing some sense to the discussion just not the super intelligent self-aware type of sense yeah so thanks for watching if you like this video please give it a big thumbs up and if you're new here consider subscribing each week we break down the data and economics and some of
