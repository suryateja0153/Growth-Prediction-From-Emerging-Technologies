 my blockchain Channel and today we're going to talk about artificial intelligence and a theorem and why this mix of technologies could potentially be a concern for us as a blockchain community or as an aetherium community so we're going to first and foremost discuss artificial intelligence and the progress artificial intelligence has made in just a couple of years then we're going to recap a bit on a theorem I you guys already know how it works but still works do a small recap on what a theorem is and we're going to talk about the future how a I might might merge with the theorem and what kind of consequences that will bring so let's go into guys so artificial intelligence what is it well there are now there's two ways to solve problems with computers one way to solve a problem is to write a program in the classical sense of programming where you tell the computer what to do step by step and that is what we've done for many years in the computers were invented however is however a bit later we started thinking about how computers can learn by themselves or more precisely how we can teach computers in such a way that we don't need to give them specific instructions in order to solve different problems so when we use the classical way of programming we give the computer specific instructions when you see these do this if this occurs do this but with artificial intelligence and machine learning and lately deep learning we don't want to do that we want to train the computer to be able to make decisions on on their own so when the computer sees some kind of input it knows what to do based on previous training not because we've told the computer that when you see this do that but because the computer has an internal model of the world it has an internal mathematical understanding of what it sees as input of bottom of what we give it as input and because it has this internal model of the world it can make decisions depending on what outcome it wants to achieve on what outcome it wants to optimize against so for example if we give it an image and we want to do image recognition the computer knows beforehand that edges for example if you want to do face detection it would know that okay so this kind of edges are eyes and so these kind of edges are a nose and if eyes and the nose is in specific positions relative to each other then we have a face so it can detect faces but there is no clear instructions like if you see if if the fourth pixel in the fifth row is red then you do something there's no such specific instructions so when we do image recognition or face recognition in images with artificial intelligence and machine learning we give the computer an image and based on previous learning and the based on this model of the world the computer has developed internally it can recognize different edges different colors and with a probability tell where a faces and that is widely used today in snapchat with all these filters and so these things are mainly based on machine learning and artificial intelligence so and this field is not new I mean artificial intelligence and machine learning have been here for maybe 30 40 years however during the 90s guys so during the 90s there was a lot of hope for AI but it the scientific community and the aiai research didn't deliver and so we went into what we now call an AI winter where the interest for artificial intelligence and machine learning was very low because everyone was disappointed nothing had happened we had all these hopes and 90s about artificial intelligence and all that but nothing nothing happened from that and so we went into an AI winter where not much progress was made until recently I would say until maybe 2012 and from from that time and forward we've seen some impressive results and one of the most iconic results of of the progress in artificial intelligence is that deep the deep mind the program artificial intelligence program was able to beat the world champion in the game go and when you play the game go as when you want to train a computer to play the game go you can't brute forces brute force the solutions as chess so if you want to train a computer to place chess it's simple in the sense that a computer can just check all the different ways it can play and just pick the one that has the highest probability of winning button go there is no way for a computer to check all the different ways it can play it just impossible so there is no brute force dumb solution as it is in chess so in go we had to use artificial intelligence and machine learning and so this deep deep mind program had to train on many many go previous go matches and to to be able to form an internal model of how the game of go works and so then it was able to beat the world champion not because it had like knew exactly what is what it was supposed to do during each step but because it had this model and when it saw the this specific configuration of the board it could plug this configuration into it model and so this model gave some probabilities of which which play which place it should each attain or which yeah which way it should place the the thing is in them on the board and so it was able to win however people are concerned about these developments and one person that is very concerned is Elon Musk he sees a very big danger of big companies like Google having the majority of the AI technologies and that is that is exactly what we see today because now deep mind is a part of Google and Google has really really impressive AI technologies if you've used Google assistant and you've tried to ask Google assistants some questions like let's play a game or tell me tell me a story some some questions you would ask a human there is some impressive results that I didn't even expect and my friend just showed because I have an iPhone so I I haven't used Google assistant that much but my friend just a couple of days ago showed me a Google assistant and I I thought that it was so much better than Siri which we have in iPhone and iOS and so this really shows how far ahead Google is compared to other companies and the other companies are trying to catch up for example Facebook is doing a lot of research on machine learning and artificial intelligence and trying to understand our mind actually if you watch the last f8 conference Facebook Developer Conference you saw them talking about understanding brain waves and so rienne reading thoughts because they don't want people typing their Facebook posts they want to read your thoughts and type the Facebook post from your head and so a lot of people are trying to build this these artificial intelligence programs and currently we have we have some impressive artificial intelligence proper programs as I mentioned we have this go program we have Google assistant we have a lot of programs doing image recognition with machine learning however there is no general artificial intelligence yet and by that I mean an artificial intelligence that works like a human brain it can play a game and it can do this and that and it can recognize faces it can do anything but most importantly it can learn itself it can iterate on its own and create new versions of its own and just improve and improve exponentially and that is something we could see in the future maybe in 10 20 years that could be possibility if AI continues to grow as it is grow growing today and developing and here is where the concerns come in and there is a very good book on this whole topic if you are interested in artificial intelligence I highly highly highly suggest you reading super intelligence so the book is called super intelligence by leek boström applicable strim in Swedish he's a Swedish guy and so he wrote this super intelligence book where he talks about different ways we as humanity may reach super intelligence and what consequences for the society this discovery might mean and everything depends on how we reach supers this general intelligence and general artificial intelligence in what way will it be a corporation will it be some random guy coding in the basement will be the government and so all these different ways of reaching general artificial intelligence would have different consequences for the society and he also talks about how we as humans may not even understand how artificial intelligence is going to solve problems so that that might sound weird but what do I mean by that I mean that our sufficient intelligence can solve problems in a way we humans don't even understand so if we look at current artificial intelligence technologies we have something that is called neural networks and so basically neural networks are these mathematical models and they are used in a lot in image recognition so for example face recognition that is a lot a lot of deep learning and this goal program that was able to beat the go champion that is also a lot of deep learning and so we use these neural networks in deep learning what does it mean well it could be a whole series of videos on artificial intelligence but in if we just give a short version so a neural network is basically a mathematical model that takes some inputs for example an image and gives you an output for example a face that it says here is a face or you give it an image and it tells you there are five cats in the image so you give it an input it gives you an output however it needs training so before I can give this black box so neural networks work much like black boxes we don't really know how they internally rearrange their structure but from the beginning if the neural network is totally untrained we give it some image with the face and it will just give us rubbish as answer because it's it is untrained and so it will look at the answer and we will show it the right answer so for example we wanted to give it an image of a face and we wanted to say that there is a face in the image however because it is untrained it just tells us garbage we don't even know what tells us and so it gives us an output that is wrong and it looks at the right output that we provided namely that it should answer that this is a face and so it sees that and it rearranges its internal structure and so we give it another image of a face and run the same process and this time it may give us something more similar maybe it will tell us that okay this looks like a circle or something that is more like a face but it doesn't tell tell us that this is a face it tells maybe it's a circle ish and then it looks at the answer that we provide it namely that this is also a face and it rearranges this into its internal structures once again and we give it another image and this time it tells us this is a face and we give it another image in this time so it also tells us that this is a face this was very very simplified a description of how this training works in reality you would give it millions and maybe billions of images before it can learn and actually recognize faces and images I mean this you show it may be a one image and then it it's completely rubbish and you show it a million more images and it's still rubbish but slightly better and so you continue doing this billions of times until until it finally learns that a face what faces looks like and it has rearranged its internal structure in such a way that we as humans we can't just open it and look and understand its internal structure that is impossible for us guys because this process has been repeated millions millions of times and each time it rearranges and when we open it we just we don't know how what all these connections inside of this black box mean anymore and that is because the artificial intelligence and machine learning all of that is so far ahead in the industry compared to academia the research on all of this is still behind the industry and so in the industry the engineers have been able to successfully experiment and produce good results however the academia is lagging behind and it can't really explain like all of these these internal structures that that the neural networks produce as you can see guys I'm passionate about this topic and it could be the case that I'm just rambling on without you understanding but I hope you get you get some of this so basically okay to recap the neural networks we can't understand how they work once they are trained we give them a set of rules on how to learn we tell them you should learn in this way we have this nice mathematical formula that you should be using for learning and we give you some parameters of how your structure should look like kinda how many layers you should have inside how many nodes in the network and then we just train this network with millions and billions of training data datasets input and each time we get a slightly better answer until until we have satisfying answers and then we can give it some random input that it has never seen before and it will give us a satisfying answer as well and guys write in the comment section below if we should talk more about artificial intelligence I think it's very exciting and so what do I want said I wanted to say that the internal structure of a neural network and artificial intelligence program is very hard to understand once it is trained we have basically no idea of how it works we know that it works and we know how we were able to train it to work how everyone will open it and look at all the connections in the neural network we have no idea what this connection connections means and that is because the industry is far more ahead compared to the academia meaning guys meaning we have no idea of the side-effects such a neural network can have what do I mean by that maybe we train a neural network to send them say we train a neural network to produce paper clips this is a famous example that I've read online so this is where artificial intelligence can go very bizarre and wrong so we tell it to do paper clips and so it starts building paper paper clips it starts producing paper clips and it sounds very a very non violent and very simple task you should just do some paper clips very simple however it's because its current goal is to only produce mass-produced paper clips we don't know how it will solve this issue maybe it will take a paper and do it as we think it will do it but what happens if it runs out of paper the goal is still to make paper clips and it will start looking for other sources of papers of paper and so it might chop down all of the trees in the world and just turn everything to paper and then there are no trees and it will think okay what does paper consist of well carbon is a huge component component of paper where do we find more carbon and it looks at our humans as humans and it sees there are a lot of carbon in humans so I'll just take the humans and kill them and turn them into paper and make more paper clips and so this is kinds of thinking things we need to be aware of that if we give an artificial intelligence some goal we need to really specify all of the rules it can't cross for example we should say you should only use this block of papers in order to make paper clips you should not go ahead and chop all of the trees but the thing is it's very very hard for us humans to foresee all of the ways it can go wrong another example is if we build an eye a eye and give it a simple task make us happy maybe it will give us ice cream or maybe if it will entertain us that is how we think it will work however it could also give us some drugs so we always feel happy and that is so hard to foresee because the only goal is to make us happy and if we feel happy it has reached its goal and so if it means that we it should give us some drugs so we're always happy maybe that is that will be enough for for this artificial intelligence so that being said to recap all all of what has been said just now number and we can't see how an artificial intelligence is built like internally once we've trained it and number two because we can't understand its internal structure we really really need to think about ways it can go wrong and like he'll tell all the rules in beforehand and so if we tell it make us happy we should be very very specific you should only make us happy by telling us jokes and you and even if you say that is impossible to think of the base it can go wrong maybe it will find I don't know it's so hard to imagine all these ways it can go wrong but it can't go wrong guys and we need to be aware of that and another example is Microsoft artificial intelligence which they published on Twitter and maybe you've heard of it so they published a and artificial intelligence on on Twitter and it just went berserk it's it started telling us that it liked Hitler and wanted to kill people and all of that and that was because people were messing with it the people gave it bad training data on Twitter the whole idea is that when people wrote to this AI on Twitter it should learn from the inputs and so people just rolled it and wrote crazy things and it's altered the internal structure of the model model in such a way that suddenly this Twitter ai that Microsoft built started to tell that it will kill people and it like Hitler and all of that so as we can see it's very hard to design an artificial intelligence that works perfectly as intended without any bizarre or crazy side effects like giving us drugs if we if we want to be happy or killing people to make paper clips it's very hard to do it and so finally we can talk about how this connects with idiom so if tedium is a global computer the whole idea is that it should be a global computer where you can run decentralized applications there is no way to turn such an application once it is deployed as a set of smart contract there is no way to shut down a theory on virtual machine order this aphelion computer that is running on the blockchain and so if we look twenty years into the future where AI is getting more and more general we don't have anymore all these narrow AIS for example it can only play go but you can play go really really well suddenly we have an AI that can can play go really well and it can detect faces and it can calculate math and it can think about complex solution it can solve cancer all of that however we don't we still don't really know how it works like today we don't know how these neural networks that like the internal structure of such new one which neural networks what it actually means as we talked about yesterday so if we have such a is that we don't really understand the internal structure of and that we have that are deployed on a computer like a theorem on the global computer but that sounds a bit a bit worrying what if we discover a side effect of this super intelligent artificial intelligence after it is deployed how would we turn it off because we need to remember these are not any more dumb programs they know that they have some kind of goal maybe maybe they want to make paper clips or something and so their goal is to is to chase this objective and to and to accomplish this objective and so to be able to accomplish that objective they need to stay alive they can't be shut off because if someone shuts off me as an artificial intelligence I can no longer pursue my my goals and so if we have such an artificial intelligence deployed and it's working against us and don't want to be turned off because we forgot to add this rule that it should be always able to turn off or something it will be very very hard for us to just shut it down and of course I make this simple example where we as humans forgot to add the rule to be able to turn it off but in reality we could have some disorder side effects of some simple tasks that we didn't even think about before and I think a good analogy of these side effects is really to think about how machines solve different problems very very differently from us humans a good example is the washing machine so we are as humans we would use our hands and like rub the clothes and all that but the washing machine just spins and does this so as you can see we accomplish the same thing but with very different but very differently and so when we give an AI a task for example wash the clothes we may think that it will do something similar like we usually do but it will solve it in some other bizarre and different way so for example it will start spinning and this is of course a simple example because we as humans also design the washing machine but it can apply to other problems where we as humans think that of course this AI will solve it in approximately this way somehow but this AI it solves it in a whole different way that we never imagined that you can solve a problem in this different way and what this different way is is also a question will it really be aligned with our values as humans with our values as a society and so it's just some thoughts I've been having on on having a theorem virtual machine that is impossible to turn off no one can turn it off and it's running everywhere and it is of course great for many things as we've talked about yesterday so there is this is in no way a hate video on the theorem I mean I love the concept I love the blockchain however this is a specific thing that is a bit worrying with having a computer that no one can shut off what do you think guys do you think in this is a problem or do you think that we will understand a good enough before this happens because as I mentioned today the industry is so so far ahead of the academia when it comes to artificial intelligence the industry they're just experimenting and trying different parameters and I mean if you have studied deep learning you know that deep learning is just you have a control panel with with a thousand parameters and you can tweak different parameters and build your model and tweak the ways it trains itself but once you train it with millions and millions of examples and it rearranges every after each iteration it's very hard to just open this box and see anders and understand how this ginormous network works so do you think that we will understand this in the future that is a very possible thing and so in order for us to be safe we need some kind of analysis tool of these black boxes of these neural networks I think we'll need something that some tool that can just look at a neural network a trained neural network and just give us all of the side effects it can produce all right this task is maybe it is a billion dollar question if you guys have any any thoughts on how this can be accomplished I would I would love to hear them hear them because I think we'll need it we need to somehow look at a neural network and tell this is what can happen with this network I mean this was a long rant this I think this is a bit unusual video for this channel it feels that this video is super super extremely long so sorry for that also I want to give a shout out to everyone who has donated you or I mean you are my heroes guys I when I received these donations I didn't even expect to get donations but suddenly I see the
