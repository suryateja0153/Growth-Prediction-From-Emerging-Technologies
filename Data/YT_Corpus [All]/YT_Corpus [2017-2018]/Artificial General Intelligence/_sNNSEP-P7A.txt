 well I think the public is fascinated with self-driving cars and it's because there's such a visceral human response to the automobile you know many of us had our first date in a car for many of us getting that you know driver's license was our first real taste of freedom so the idea of turning over that authority that driving authority to a machine it's a big deal it's a big step you know this isn't an academic exercise when you put a car on the road very literally lives are at stake we care about sending our kids to drivers train why do we do we do it so they help you so then questions how do you send our cars [Music] each week [Music] so would you hear the word artificial intelligence what's the first thing that comes to your mind not real both aliens thousand percent alien like Mars Attacks alien I mean there's it's a little scary but it's exciting I guess I think of how computers can make decisions can be programmed to make decisions like Amos yeah machinery is programmed but just a kind of the same but I don't think if software's artificial intelligence I just don't I would say that it is when computers or robot becomes self-aware and is able to think like a person but lesser piping's me a little I'm not frightened like oh you know just freaks me out a little that way like how do you honey teach a machine to learn [Music] so the question is can we develop an AI powered engine to perceive the world to make decisions and have it reach a level of performance and reliability that we're confident in and confident not to put it on the road the easiest way to think about it is to think of AI is a box with math and code well AI is math enjoyed the box the data goes into the box and decisions come out those are decisions about the data with classical programming you're starting with input and rules that's what you're specifying on you're getting outputs and reasoning you're starting with examples of inputs and outputs and what you're getting is rules there's a bad food because for many problems these rules are very much non-obvious they're not something that you can get a human programmer to specify so an example that will be I want to apply names to photographs photographs going right JPEG files going and names come out like that's christenings that's Chris's mom stays right or maybe transactions financial transactions and the decisions are that looks like fraud that's not from right or or emails looks like spam or doesn't look like me so those decisions that are important and that affect the way we live our lives because if my inbox is full of spam I waste time and I'm annoying so it's like a thermostat in the back right it is invisibly adjusting parameters of your life to make it easier for you to do something more interesting and not struggle with something basically [Music] so what is going to happen is AI will become increasingly integral to our lives so society it can become part of the basic infrastructure society will become our interface to the world to a world that will be increasingly information rich and complex ai is going to change what it means to be human [Music] [Applause] the application of AI to self-driving cars is the living edge of the eye it's really a great test of let's say whether a eye is really ready for the real world if we're really going to test and figure out whether we can trust a eye it's going to be in allowing cars to get us where we want to go without killing anyone if you had to guess how does the self-driving car work how does a self-driving car work I would assume that there's some kind of computers involved definitely some cameras it's more computerized in the dashboard and that there's probably human I don't even know how many cameras would be equipped another sensors I've seen so many commercials about that they could park themselves and they can do this and my mom has one that'll break you know to car in front of her breaks her car starts to break you're like whoa that's you know a surprise is shock it's an outside force entering into the environment that you're in she didn't expect that you weren't prepared for to be perfectly honest I don't have a lot of ideas as to how all of that gets put into a functional system driving has a lot to do with personality so it's kind of like telling the artificial intelligence to get a personality so whoever is running the software behind that I guess is teaching it how to drive so when we talk about autonomous vehicles and how they work they all kind of work the same way regardless of whether or not we're talking about a drone or an automated car automated train any automated transportation device has to develop something we call the world model so that if you understand what the world around you is then you then make decisions based on your world model because it can convert raw sensory data into an interpretation that allows you to act it can be there as an important part of that interface between the cards where it recognizes the stop signs or pedestrians or the lane industry so the thinking part the decision-making part of any driver's car really comes down to what kind of algorithms were embedded in it so an algorithm is a series of instructions for going from linguistics about good so when I talk about mapping inputs absolutes talking about the relationship of one thing to another relationship of a face to a name so self-driving cars are really just a form of robots on wheels they use sensors to look at the world and detect what's relevant it uses algorithms to decide where it's going to drive and how to obey the rules in the road it's building a lot of artificial intelligence perception mapping localization technology that's all drawn from robotics communities and so that's where the big leap and Technology are going to have to come in the next few years are the development of the perception system [Music] so so probably the question we get the most is why ducks we're really trying to rebrand robotics in a way our perception is that robotics has a bit of a scary image and a bit of a masculine image and so that was really the reason to add this sort of element of cuteness and really the duck was the sort of perfect example for that duckie town is a scaled-down autonomous driving platform that we use for research and education the only sensor on the duckie bot is a monocular camera one cheap camera that sits on the front for the robot to be able to just follow the roads it needs to be able to take the camera and figure out where the road markings are and then have a feedback control loop that's keeping it in the lane in a sense it's doing exactly the same thing that what a current state-of-the-art vehicle does to follow the highway self-driving cars is very much like a problem of scale so in ducking down we all worked on different parts of that problem and then we should all share our code with each other so you knew that while you were working on a particular issue there was going to be updates coming from other people and by sharing that was the only way that anyone would have it talked about that work we can break up the big problem into a sequence of much smaller problems that can all be worked on in parallel and then merge these things all back together again so this is part of us all working out what the right development cycle and how to most efficiently allocate our resources to do this kind of research and to make the most progress [Music] the big challenge of doing autonomous vehicle research is actually logistic getting a car putting sensors on it and then driving it around and developing algorithms without running anybody over or putting people in harm's way is a real problem and so while this makes it seem a little bit unrealistic as compared to a real-life system it's powerful in the sense that you can demonstrate algorithms by being very confident that you've captured all of the possible input that you're likely to see in ducky town and then see what how your algorithms actually work what was here talking about that on a normal Street like just having the trust that it would be able to see a green light you know and be able to know lights are green and or there's a yield sign or if a cat ran into a street and it just being able to anticipate all this really for me cetera I do enjoy driving sir the self-driving vehicle would be great to break the monotony of driving like on a long distance on a long trip that idea of how much people want to invest in self-driving cars or have it I think there are a lot of social goods can be had out of it do you think that self-driving cars will be better at driving than humans I think I believe you because the human reaction time is infinitely slower than a computer's reaction time if you have a self-driving car they're not going to be texting and driving they're not going to be flipping through the radio and out of a whole community I really do believe there's going to be less car racks that we use self-driving cars now we think reactive and in that moment no do you remember to steer into your fishtail remember to see her out of it you know well the computer wouldn't know what to do and a computer would think for you and in that instance that could help save your life [Music] well the self-driving car industry is really at an interesting moment we're kind of sewing the parachute on the way down if you will there's immense promise in this technology because you could argue that it's a moral imperative that we should move quickly we have within our grasp a technology that once we get it right we can put on the road and reduce or eliminate the tens of thousands of lives that are lost in the US alone from motor vehicle accidents so we have to move fast but the technology to be honest is still in and R&D things it's not yet ready for product ization one of the really interesting things about the AI is that it gets smarter the more experiences of the way right so you want as much as possible to get it out and exposed to as many things as possible then the rational thing to the rational strategy is to get it to compete against as many people as possible and so the question is how do we want to do that is there a commons right that serves the general welfare right that we should all contribute to and that by contributing to we can ensure everyone's life is better and open-source is a way to enable at the sharing this collaboration and it's looking more and more like this is really a problem that is going to be solved with data that this is a data driven problem the better the data is that's going into the algorithm the better the decisions are that they're going to produce and the better decisions you can produce more lives you can say in a life-and-death situation like a self-driving car so self-driving cars collect an immense amount of data there's data coming from vision sensors at a high frame rate from these lidar sensors from radar sensors from the internal motion of the car it tells us not only about what the world looks like to a very very high degree of precision it tells us about what other road users are doing how they're behaving tells us about the conditions of roads it can tell us about the conditions of trees on the side of the road most of the big players in this industry have held everything pretty close to their chest well the data today is really a prized commodity you know everybody is putting a fleet of cars on the road with a primary goal of collecting as much data as they can and so I think that it's really important that these resources become available to the community at large you're one of the halves with the big fleet of cars on the road and a huge treasure trove of data you're less incentivized to share but if we think about pushing the industry forward and getting to a point where we have safe technology on the road that's saving lives every day a way to speed up that process is to share the data it's an integral choice we have to make between the status quo where we have millions of people are dying on the roads and a better future you know that's why it's so important that people talk about this to make sure that they understand what the ramifications are of being so secretive where there's still so much to be learned that that can be detrimental and may not be survivable by any individual company autonomous vehicles is an incredibly ambitious project who no single company can just force to develop everything on its own if we want to get there we need to be standing on the shoulders of child the question is you know will we as an automotive and a technology community get to the point where we can look at each other in the eye and say it's everybody's benefit to share this data and as a society because we share these rims right and because we're all exposed to the risk of other cars that we need to be making decisions about how to share the best image of the cars and open-sourcing can do that get it out of the lab [Music] [Music] on my own even [Music]
