 candy hi I'm Samir who is a from Tokyo Institute of Technology and today I'd like to talk about Kim an interactive omnidirectional for display in recent years computer system have been developing directory and display disparate digital contents have changed from conventional 2d images to 3d to graphics omnidirectional images and 3d visualizations are example of the contents today to display to show them our 2d flat screen we are HMD and dorm screens and people have been struggling to match these contents with suite about displays an alternative choice is to disfigure the spray there are several examples displaying the answer for occur displays let me show you some this spherical displays are non interactive display the display in the left side is hemispherical the cephalic L display called the world are sold by gakuen and this play in the right side is holes work of the spray called the air cosmos this display have capability of displaying images on the surface of severe but they don't have interactive input function this research have proposed the interactive spherical displays banker at all proposed the Saffir which is our interactive Spector display a projector is under the severe to project images on the surface of a spherical display and also an IR camera is under the display to detect precise touch position Kettner are all proposed a supercar display by utilizing projection set outside of the display this display uses rotation or itself as an improved function where it can detect heart humor and all showed an example to display a globe on the surface of a sphere all these displays are interactive but didn t realize the feature of a sphere so much and limited the interaction that they use as a sphere object we focus on the ball which is friendly shape to human beings for hundreds of years ball is familiar instrument that directly contact with human bodies such as fingers hand hood or head and it has been used in sports and games for many years ball has interesting aspects we should utilize the first aspect is that the ball has various ways for interaction with human such as hunting touching rotating throwing and so on the second aspect is high endurance tool that can be strong kicked or hit without being broken we extend these characteristics of the ball with various interactive display technologies this image on the slide is the office of the future with Valda space this is what we think about this play will be like the same requirements for of all displays are these first to make a display spherical and to be able to take it in hand there are many conceivable ways to implement it for example attachment of LEDs or LCDs projection from projector built inside this device sphere device or projection from external projectors however with the first three methods the limit of impact resistance and reduction in size and weight of the device becomes a problem therefore in this research we adopted adopted our method of displaying the entire surface of a supercut device from multi products multiple tunnel projectors in real time and the second requirement is wireless and the lightweight in order to utilize the features of a ball in interaction capabilities of being handled in users hand and being rotated are essential to meet these demands this display must be lightweight impact resistance and Wireless so we use wireless communications to send the ball device data and as the body of the display we use light ball shaped material furthermore in order to be able to perform a touch I our camera may be used in the display but in this system to satisfy the light weight we use electric electrostatic capacitance on the surface of the device considering the debar the goal of this research are these three the first goal is to make portable supercar interactive display port of all we use means to be able to handle handle the display in hands the second is to design and implement interactions sweet a ball for ball displays the third is to implement applications utilizing the ball display interactions and to show the utility of this display first let me explain the implementation based on the design requirements following three technologies must be included in implementation first real-time tracking and projection using a motion capture cameras and the second supercar projection using multiple projectors the last one is touch and the rotation detection let me explain these techniques one by one first about real-time tracking and the projection the whole system looks like this we have constructed a projection mapping environment with multiple projectors like this in this configuration 6 motion capture cameras were installed for real-time tracking and this prey device is wrapped with retro-reflective acid to be tracked from these cameras to achieve precise projection we use tracking system and our prediction method if you project any images on if you project the images onto a moving object based on the rotator projection will be stripped from the target like the video in the left so we use prediction method for the target position and succeed in precise projection as you can see in the video on the light we don't have enough time to explain the method so please refer our previous paper to achieve this record projection we put multiple projectors in the environment each projector is calibrated and based on the corporation data the system renders the with respective view for each projector this image this image is shown an example of sphere mapping different images are projected from different directions by using multiple projectors figure a and C are the pictures taken from the left side and the right side figure B is taken from the middle of the two projectors in Figure B the projection from both sides are matched boundaries of projection tend to be distorted because of shape of sphere there is a little gap between the projected images to assure a real-time projection the system overlays images at the same position from each projector without considering the overlapping part but the images are matched well as you can see next the device configuration it's like this sensors in the cube the cube device are changed as excuse me sensor in the cube device are arranged as shown in this figure this is a cross-section of a cube device in order to detect the rotation and touch this device contains our gel sensor module for posture measurement and the capacitance measurement module for touch the severe outer shell is made of performed rubber and the 32 aluminium plates are attached on the surface and the capacitance of each panel is measured each panel and the capacitance measurement module are connected by conductors the circuit board with the sensor is fixed to the center of the sapir by a nylon string this structure enables weight reduction and the impact resistance and it will be not be broken even if you throw or kick it like a ball the system configuration diagram is like this first data from cameras and sensors are sent to the PC for rendering for this information this system applies the delay reduction algorithm for real-time tracking and the projection then this data are applied to the position and orientation of the corresponding texture the bottom of the model and the system generates an image to be projection on the ball finally those images are projected onto the device this is a flower of the system next let's move on interaction design we implemented several interactions with based on the affordance of a ball we conducted our preliminary experiment to see how people interact with the ball and these four interactions were mostly observed so we choose touch rotation bouncing and drawing as inputs to the display and assign the basic operation to the supercar interactive display for each action let me briefly explain this interaction first touch is used for selection and the rotation is used as voltage voltage and operation of the images displayed on the Saffir surface after pounding can be associated with being bored with something we attach a meaning to reset the applications so the operation of bounce to the floor is is the transition to the home screen with throwing operation we added an automatic rotation function and the reset function this system calculate the direction of revolt speed and rotate the display to the direction so users can pass and show the images right even images that they look at to another user and when users close the device in vertically the direction will reset at that point these are the basic operations of the cube display next let me show some application examples to show how a ball display can be used first we implemented the omnidirectional image viewer named Panna ball supergirl image can be browsed more naturally by displaying on the Saffir for example in the conventional flat display users drug the images to select the point of view and often fall into this order of positional relationship in that kind of picture with the proposed system by rotating the device with their hands they can see the images from their favorite angle at the same time by changing the point of view with their body moving around the Saffir like this it is easy to search and well the position they want to see at the Super Cub video chat application we build panel chat this application displays the live stream taken from an educational camera one possible use scenario of this application it's remote conference in which two locations are connected through this application users can easily grasp the information of remote environment and the directional relationships of attendees from it like the conventional display you can see and control a table data such as a calendar in the vault display in this application uses can the days in the week with action of rotation horizontally and to change the week by rotating the display practically this is an example for searching the three data involve display user can browse the folder by rotation and get into the direction by the changes changing the direction of rotation this is a game application named the phase matching we demonstrated the system at the lover virtual 2016 into the industry in this demonstration most people didn't need any explanation about control and understood intuitively that rotating the ball change the orientation of the images and they also moved their heads to get better of the patient angles of course you can enjoy Pokemon go by throwing the ball this way like this you can experience the front of a church in Pokemon okay let me move on discussion part in this paper we implemented the cube which is a fully supergirl interactive display but the implementation and set up or vacuum our rather complex human interaction is limited by the bounds of the mocap system and projectors it is also difficult to use in flight environment the reason we choose the this implementation is that the cubes focus is on is on exploring the interactions of all display which is light durable and the coolest vehicle so projection from inside the ball or flat panel displays on the surface could not meet these requirements occlusion of the projection image is an issue that needs to be solved in our current set-up even if the body blocks the light from one project another projector covers the uploaded region however the corrosion problem cannot be completely solved as long as we use external projectors small internal internal projectors or flexible display may overcome the program in near future and interruption of the tracking system by a user's body may also be a problem this problem can be overcome and bring IR LEDs on the surface of the device and tracking other visits body and now we are working on new also in the current implementation there are problems with with ball device such as setting by Armenian furnace and low resolution of touch judgment for this problems we will solve them by improving the device such as using registers films for touch judgment and in the current set-up we selected the for primitive interactions based on our observation of how people interact with both but other interactions may be considered depends on applications okay this is the end of my presentation thank you very much yes do you find at Columbia University she wanted to throw out a question so you showed it an interaction that involved a teleconferencing video conferencing situation and it seemed a very very strange one I've been in video conferences where I'm carried for example in someone's laptop from one room to another that looks really weird to me and weird to other people and now you're going to be throwing someone back and forth at least to the laptop there's a camera in there looking out and yet you have no camera inside of your system looking out so here I am holding you in my hand and you're looking from somewhere over there and I'm waving at you but you're seeing me waving at a ball and so I was just trying to think of you know why did you pick that particular application because it seems like a very strange one that's right in the current set up we we didn't pay to come right inside to the ball but we are working on varying camera what do you think people really want to have a teleconference with a ball that has someone inside of it as opposed to you trying to interact with someone who might occupy a more normal relationship to them yes in yes we'd current display current to the front display or h md said we can't see the we can't see their environment of the speaker's surroundings or speakers so we I think it is important to know the the the relationships of the people sososo arrangement of the people where the people is or okay thank you thank you hello Diego from the University of Sussex I've really loved it it's it's really really nice it was more than a doubt because maybe you do mention it in the paper but I didn't get the chance to read it yet does it change the center of mass of the ball because if if you want to roll it for it to roll nicely like the center of mass would be in the center of the sphere and all that does it change much or how does it matter I can get a centre of centre of mass the center of mass once you add all your sensors inside the ball maybe like the way it is to the bottom or the way it is to the top and then you cannot roll it in in the same way than a ball - - then I just wanted to see if that happens or doesn't happen we will have a chat after a talk it's okay right it's really really nice
