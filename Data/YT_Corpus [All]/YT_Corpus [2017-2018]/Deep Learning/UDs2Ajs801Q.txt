 Students in deeper learning classrooms graduate from high school as confident, life-long learners, equipped with the knowledge, skills, and mindset they need to succeed and lead productive, fulfilling lives. But what, exactly, does deeper learning look like? With the help of The Verbatim Agency and photojournalist Allison Shelley, the Alliance for Excellent Education visited three schools actively engaged in deeper learning experiences: Capital City Public Charter School in Washington, DC; MC Squared STEM High School in Cleveland, Ohio; and Skyline High School in Oakland, California. Each school’s unique instructional approach shows that deeper learning can succeed in schools of every type with students from all backgrounds. And that there are multiple ways to achieve deeper learning outcomes. From these visits, the Alliance created “American Education: Images of Teachers and Students in Action,” an online photo gallery featuring nearly 300 original print-quality images of teachers and students of all ages and races, from preschool through high school. These images show that today’s classrooms look different and how students spend more time working together in groups than ever before. But traditional education stock photos don’t reflect these changes. That’s why the Alliance is making photos from the gallery available for free to nonprofits, schools, media outlets, and the public under the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial License.
