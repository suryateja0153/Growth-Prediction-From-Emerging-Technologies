 Oh in a nutshell 4d printing refers to 3d printed objects that have the ability to reshape or self-assemble over time now recognized that's quite a complicated nutshell to get your head around so here's a bit more detail 4d printing was born out of the self-assembly lab established by Skylar Tibbits at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT it was a concept he developed alongside strata C's and Autodesk it involves strategically positioning rigid and expandable materials next to each other within one 3d printed components when the expand materials come into contact with water they grow up to 200% of their original volume changing their shape and effectively repositioning the rigid materials either side of them the expandable materials effectively create joints and the components that are activated in certain conditions causing the entire component to adopt a different form depending on the expandable material used the contact substance necessary for it to change shape could be water or it could be heat lights or a range of other simple energy inputs software enables components we programmed on-screen before they are created and for that data to have effectively been programmed into the components once it's been created go and beyond this range of small scale demonstration pieces it's thought the technology could be used in some form of self repairing water pipes in pipe work that changes size in relation to water flow or in hot and cold temperature water valves beyond plumbing it also has potential in medicine clothing and footwear that adapts to climatic conditions or in childcare products that respond to temperature changes if you enjoyed this video and would like to get more from a definitive video channel for construction subscribe to the b1m [Music]
