bringing this industry technology to your desk last summer we lived in a factory with over 30 years of experience building industrial nailing machines and now we're ready to make net rate for you but we need your support to create them cost-effectively so please back us now thank you hi I'm Tom I'm one of the cofounders of misery and I'm just going to talk to you today about how you use the machine in a workshop oK we've got a design for a scarf here that we need to turn into co2 the machine can understand at the moment it's just an image in Photoshop so what the machine wants is basically a bunch of ones and zeros and some other numbers that tell it where it's going to make a stitch and where it's not going to make a stitch and what yarn Kerry is going to use and how fast it's going to go and all this kind of stuff so we've got a script that does this and we work with this what we call K code quite a lot in development but in the end it will be hidden from the user if they want or you can go in manually and change things because it's quite understandable to a human as well as the Machine okay so now we've got our K code on the SD card I come over to the machine and insert it and then I've got doing a little bit of setup because these aren't by the colors that I want so I've got my arms up here going down into the yarn carriers this is my waste yarn the color doesn't matter fill up that's just knitted for a little bit of the stop to get the garment down into the rollers and saw the tension art and stuff this is the draw thread which is going to let me separate the waste yarn from the garment at the end so you just pull it out and in the to come apart easily but this yarn I'm going to use but I don't want it to be black I want it to be blue so I'm going to change the yarn over so to do that I got my blue yarn I'm going to break the back yarn get rid of it and tie the blue yarn in its place and then I come over to the machine and I'm just going to pull the black yarn through until I get the blue yarn through the yarn carrier and just took it then I've got to put the yarn carrier back into position so the machine can pick it up and then you to close the machine before I let you run it and then simply turn the Machine up pressing it so the machines going to go through some homing operations so it knows where the carriages and knows where all the gates and the young carriers and everything are and then it's going to start knitting with some rows of waste yarn [Music] you [Music] so for the purpose of this video we've told the machine to stop in between each of these operations but normally we just carry on by itself so it's it's done the waste yarn now so the waste is all down inside the rollers and the tension is good and now it's about to do the draw thread so here we go so draw Fred's done and the next thing we'll do is cast on with the main yarn so it just kind of uses all the needles to get nice loops on all the stitches so I press the button again and it'll do that [Music] so now it's cast on we've got a waste job and you've got a draw thread then we've got a casting on so the machines also up and ready to go and the next thing you will do is it will start knitting the pattern that you saw on Photoshop at the start [Music] so this is the last row who have pattern being knitted now and the scoffs nearly finished so after this we need to find off so again my machine is going to stop so I can talk about it but normally we just carry on and do this and this is the process of closing the garment so that it doesn't come unraveled so machine is going to start doing this it's quite a slow process so it passes all the needles to the all the stitches to the back and then it has to kind of join them all through each other one by one so the garments finished now and the machine is going to reject it and then I'm just going to snip the last couple of threads so the rollers kind of push it out so the garments finished now and we have to do one more thing and that's just separate off the waste yarn so we come over here and we've got the draw thread which you just pull that uh I know it's done haha
