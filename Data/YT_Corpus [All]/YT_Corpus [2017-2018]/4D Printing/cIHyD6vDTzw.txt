 so where do we use social presence in theater and a particular kind of the practice you are going to see in a few minutes from now we use it in the coal sensing space which the same activity we talked about before the break and coal same thing basically is two things number one you have to take a deep dive into the front line and the periphery of the system now that's kind of you do that in a million different ways kind of million different methods for that but that's only part one part two is you come back together as a team and then you make sense together of all the different kind of golden nuggets that you are returned with now what are the methods you can use for this collective sense making there is like systems thinking this scenario thinking there's a bunch of other useful methodologies but are in our practice and we use kind of all of them in different contexts but what we are more and more gravitating towards is using social presence in theater for two reasons as far as I am concerned one is that it makes particularly visible the deep transformation structure of a social field which otherwise you often tend to miss and number two it's fast it doesn't take weeks or months time is money we don't have money in our projects we all know the problem right so we have like a finite amount of time how can you use that finite amount of time to have deep impact well social problems in theater in our experience is a methodology that in a relatively short amount of time allows you to crystallize the essence of all this research that went on before in a particularly effective way and for example in China I remember kind of having gone with you know cross-sector crew but many from the public sector through learning juries they went through prototyping initiatives they did a lot of like then same thing journeys with all the stakeholder they wanted to engage and then they make sense of that and kind of revised their the way they wanted to run prototype and it all felt wrong right so it's all the right things on paper but it didn't feel like really transformative it's like the old mindset basically and then we asked them so basically synthesize their stakeholder sensing activities around each of their prototype initiatives which we are groups of five six seven usually in a mapping right gotcha one current reality sculpture two kind of emerging future and that then it happened that it you know suddenly clarified what was wrong with both social sculpture and why they needed to change their intervention they needed to really rethink and reinvent what they want to do in terms of that prototype in order to transform the autism I remember kind of there was one the government in the center's culture one telling the citizens what you need right that never asked the question so what they need and how they would you know get the the services of the solutions for what supposedly was their needs while in the sculpture to kind of this central structure of the government and all the disempowered people was more moving to the periphery and holding the space for the other stakeholders to more directly interact and listen to each other and interact and co-create around these needs that got clarified that way so that's like a simple example but they from all the em talking to the stakeholders they couldn't really bring all that together they had the data but they couldn't bring it together in a collective sense making mechanism so why SBT why such a fanzine theater because it gives you immediately and this thing doesn't take longer than 60 or 90 minutes immediately you have a collective language in a collective perception of what's wrong and broken with the current system and what are potential pathways of moving it into a different direction and if in a team of very different stakeholders with very different mental models you have a collective language in image as a reference point so you talk about the same thing because we all saw what happened and we all heard everyone's debrief that's worth a lot because it's like you know when you build a house you have a firm ground to build something on if you have this perception I have another one we have like you know sand kind of it's now it's moving we have nothing firm to build to construct a shared building on so it's worth a lot this kind of foundation and that's exactly what social presence saying theater does
