 [Music] so this is the nylon 12 carbon filled material it's the first reinforced FDM composite from strategy offering excellent mechanical strength and a very high stiffness to weight ratio 3d printing with such a strong stiff material means that you can overcome many of the restrictions that you usually encounter when trying to build prototypes out of composites or metal instead of worrying about how you'll shape the metal will help them make the mold and you can now go straight from your design on screen to a fully functional carbon filled nylon swirl prototype in house with virtually no limits your design freedom and creative process I think your ease of use is the dissolvable FDM support material that makes it easy to produce intricate parts such as this without the need for manual and metal support removal featuring a carbon-fiber length and fill ratio that's optimized with 3d printing the result a highly functional detailed part that can be tested in demanding the real-world conditions being able to come up with a design validated and then comprehensively tested all on the same day also provides an extremely powerful competitive advantage it means companies can deliver better performing products at the same time as compressing lead time and making development cost more predictable the material is so stiff that it feels like you're trying to bend steel and yet it's light and stiff enough to make it efficient for a wide range of manufacturing and cooling applications where the stiffness of the tool is critical to its function such as in drill guide end of arm tool bracket jig fixture and metal filming so whether you want to compress your product development cycle with high-performance prototypes or improve your manufacturing floor efficiently Stratasys nylon 12 carbon filter tool is now a very strong and most practical material choice you
