 [Music, footage of liquid medal being printed] [Scott Vader] So existing technologies use very expensive input materials and operate slowly so that means that your price per printed part is extraordinarily high. [Zach Vader] Right now it's about a hundred thousand dollars a kilowatt. It's quite slow with just 1 kilowatt laser so you need two and then you need three. To keep going fast you have to keep stepping up. [Scott] Our metal printing system works by taking in commodity priced aluminum wires. [Zach] They feed this solid wire into our ceramic nozzle. We heat up our nozzle to the melting point of aluminum, well actually well beyond, we heat to 750 degrees Celsius which is 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit. Solid wire goes in, melts into this nozzle. Then we have an electromagnetic coil that sits outside the ceramic nozzle and we energize this coil. When we energize this coil we create a magnetic field which pushes inward on the metal and that produces a droplet. Every time we produce a magnetic field it squeezes a droplet and so we do that about a thousand times a second. [Scott] Similar to the way an ink jet printer prints with droplets of ink to make your image, we print with very fine droplets of metal. [Zach] One of the tenants that my father taught me in engineering is use off-the-shelf parts as much as possible. So, don't reinvent the wheel, right? [Scott] University at Buffalo has been a great help from very early on when we were in the basement trying to understand the parameters of the physics. [Zach] Pretty much to our whole staff is from UB's School of Engineering. Our only interaction with our competitors was at the IMTS show. [Scott] We were swamped. I mean, we had six people going all week long and met over 2,000 people. It's an idea that's time has come I think. It was very exciting.
