 numerous innovations in technology are fast advancing the world of construction materials bringing new products to market that could make a big difference to our built environment here we take a look at three particularly impressive developments while cement is one of the most widely used materials in construction for its strength and durability properties it can crack when exposed to water or chemicals over time undermining structures a research team at the University of Bath in the UK are now developing a form of self-healing concrete for adding microcapsules to mixes that contain calcite precipitating bacteria when water enters cracks in the concrete these bacteria germinated to produce limestone filling the cracks and preventing any steel reinforcement from corroding due to prolonged exposure if scaled and applied effectively this self-healing solution could extend the life concrete structures and reduce maintenance cost [Applause] [Music] kinetic paving is a new concept at harvest energy from the footsteps of pedestrians moving around a building or public space and converts energy into electricity a uk-based startup called pavegen have developed the energy harvesting paving slabs made almost entirely from recycled tires the slabs flex 5 millimeters when steps on generating 8 watts of kinetic energy each tile has its own wireless transmitter that uses 1% of its power to store and send data on its performance to a central database the tiles can be installed on a permanent basis or temporarily as events they were used on a main thoroughfare in the London 2012 Olympic Park while a portion of the Parish Madison and under a football pitch in Rio de Janeiro powering the PUD lies the key to success with this technology is of course traffic volume pavegen estimated some 12 million steps fell onto their tiles during the London 2012 games generating 20 kilowatt hours of electricity [Music] in a nutshell 4d printing refers to 3d printed objects that have ability to reshape or self-assemble over time now recognize that quite a complicated nutshell to get your head around so here's a bit more detail 4d printing was born out of self-assembly lab established by Skylar Tibbits at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or MIT it was a concept developed amongst other strategies and Autodesk it involves strategically positioning rigid and expandable materials next to each other within one 3d printed components when the expandable materials come into contact with water they grow up 200% of their original volume changing their shape and effectively repositioning the rigid materials either side of them the expandable materials effectively create joint in the components that are activated in certain conditions causing the entire component to adopt a different form depending on the expandable material used the contact substance necessary for it to change shape could be water or it could be heat light or a range of other simple energy inputs software enables components be programmed on the screen before they are created and for that basis have effectively been programmed into the components once it's been created going beyond this range of small scale demonstration pieces it's thought the technology could be using some form of self repairing water pipes in pipe work that changes size in relation to water flow or in hot and cold temperature water valves beyond plumbing it also has potential in medicine clothing and footwear to adapt to climatic conditions or in childcare products that respond to temperature changes if you enjoyed this video and would like to get more in the definitive video channel for construction subscribe to the BLM [Music]
