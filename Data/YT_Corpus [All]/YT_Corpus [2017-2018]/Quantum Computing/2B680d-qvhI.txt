 [Music] there's tremendous mindshare out there that we can bring into IBM from using our comm experience it is kind of like peering into the unknown our quantum experience is currently open to the entire world anybody can sign on register and start using it we want to see the best ideas out there we want to be able to find new algorithms and we'd love to work together with different individuals different organizations to help explore that frontier one of the real surprises to me has been the amount of usage that we've seen in the in the past six months we're seeing researchers who are actually writing papers and doing new algorithms and testing new theories using it educational institutions professors using it as part of their coursework so we're really starting to see this ecosystem building and we're really hoping to continue that as we get towards these larger systems where we really want to find the areas of application in terms of applications I think the one type of really big challenge that many of us in the who are working on this really want to be able to solve is to see the simulation of chemistry relation of nature but what we care about is unlocking those secrets if you're going to try to understand nature which is naturally quantum mechanical there's no reason to use bits zeros and ones to do it but to actually use other objects that follow those same natural laws quantum bits to try and simulate them and try and understand them the implications for this are huge with regards to designing new drugs in designing new materials understanding catalytic interactions and and four types of molecular interactions that are just too difficult in too complex to who'd force calculates a bit with quantum computers we really have that potential to look for solutions and calculate things which we never thought about before you [Music] you
