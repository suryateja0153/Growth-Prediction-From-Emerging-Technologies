 hey what up guys welcome back to my programming channel and today we're going to discuss the threat we might face as a blockchain community guys in the future when quantum computers become more popular and more developed and more widely used compared to today's quantum computers so let's talk about it why are quantum computers a threat to us si Bitcoin community or as a and aetherium community guys that is because both of these technologies are based on cryptography that is why they're called crypto currencies because they are based on cryptography guys and there are two different types of cryptography there is symmetric crypto cryptography and asymmetric cryptography and for example in Bitcoin we use both symmetric cryptography which is the hashing when we do hashing it's called symmetric cryptography and also we use asymmetric cryptography cryptography and that is when we have a public and private key architecture which we have in Bitcoin because when you send your bitcoins to someone when you initiate a transaction then you use your private key and your public key is also used to verify your identity so we have both symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography in the blockchain world so what are the threats that come from quantum computers and why are quantum computers a thread guys well one reason is because quantum computers will be very very efficient at the producing factors to prime numbers and you might ask guess you might ask Ivan what have prime factors to do with cryptography and the whole asymmetric cryptography the whole private public key infrastructure is actually based on prime numbers and and prime factors and so if you and the whole reason why it is secure today is because with current normal computers it would be practically impossible to find the correct factor of a huge prime number and to break the encryption that is how we would do today if you want to crack two days for example if you want to hack an SSL encryption or a TLS encryption on the web you would need to find a prime factor - - a gigantic prime number and that is with the day technology practically impossible however it will be very very possible with quantum computers because with quantum computers we could use an algorithm that is called Shor's algorithm and so with Shor's algorithm the number of steps required to break a private public key encryption so number of steps decreased dramatically mainly they decrease from two to the power of 188 guys which would take with them so many step steps we would need with the normal computers to ^ 128 and so this number goes down to 108 28 so 128 ^ 3 which is significant significantly lower guys and so the whole private and public key asymmetric cryptography is in deep trouble if quantum computers become so developed that they are able to run Shor's algorithm in an efficient way and we want the scientific community and the cryptography standards organization which is called equipped standards they they say that Bitcoin cryptography will be safe until 2030 or 2040 so we have yeah we have 20 15 to 20 years in order to find a solution and the Bitcoin protocol itself is built with the quantum threat in mind so the Bitcoin protocol itself can be extended and we can build on top of the current protocol and improve it in such a way so that we are protected against the quantum threat that may come in the future so now we talked about asymmetric cryptography with private and public key and so it is vulnerable yes because quantum computers will be very efficient at finding prime factors to a prime number and the whole private and public key architecture is based on prime prime factors and prime numbers so that is why asymmetric cryptography is vulnerable so now let's talk about symmetric cryptography meaning the hashes will hashes be as vulnerable as public and private keys and the answer is no they are a bit safer however there is an algorithm a quantum algorithm that would make this easier as well and this algorithm is called Grover's algorithm and so this algorithm would take 2 to the power of 256 steps with today's computers and now I'm talking about sha-256 hash so if you would break this algorithm today you would require 2 to the power of 256 guy's basic operations and that is just mind-blowing this number is so ginormous so it's it's practically impossible however with Grover's algorithm it would take 2 to the power of 128 a number of basic operations and it's still mind-blowing and it would be practically impossible even when quantum computers become more developed so in that sense guys symmetric cryptography is more secure and less vulnerable compared to asymmetric cryptography however guys however because both of those are used in for example Bitcoin this makes the Bitcoin technology Bitcoin network and blockchain vulnerable to quantum threats so what can we do how can we solve this so one well one solution the end as I mentioned before is to expand the Bitcoin protocol and to make it more resistant to quantum quantum threats and that is possible because Bitcoin protocol which was built with that threat in mind and so it is extendable there is one solution the second solution if if we have if we find ourselves in such cells in a situation where the quantum computers are developed and we haven't really found an answer and have extended the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin architecture what we could do is to use each Bitcoin address only once that way guys that way it would be really really hard for quantum computers to break your public private key encryption in such a small amount of time because if you only use a Bitcoin address once the attacker would need to crack your encryption before it gets processed by by a miner and before it gets placed in a block and so that would be really hard even when quantum computers get developed and so if you use each address only once for one transaction it will be very very safe even with quantum computers however if you use your Bitcoin address multiple times for multiple transactions then the attacker would have would pick up your encryption the first time you send it but he will not be able to crack it and to to correct this transaction on the first time however the second time you send something then the attacker will have the possibility to break your encryption because the attacker has already seen you send a transaction before and so that way in the so in that way the attacker has had time to break your encryption and so the next time you send then the attacker can use can use your broken encryption too to mess with the system to mess with your transaction so that's it guys we discussed the quantum threat and we discussed how it will affect asymmetric and symmetric cryptography guys what do you think do you do you think that the quantum threat is serious and do you think that Bitcoin and Experian will suffer from the quantum threat or will we be able to come up with new block chains or extend the current block chains in such a way that we are safe would you think leave your comments in the comment section below guess and if you are a new viewer guys you should definitely subscribe if you like technology you like the blockchain you like development and programming because I myself am a software developer and you will find this channel interesting guys so that's it for today we talked about the quantum computers and the threat they made they might bring to us as a blockchain community and they possibly use every single day guys I'll see you guys tomorrow
