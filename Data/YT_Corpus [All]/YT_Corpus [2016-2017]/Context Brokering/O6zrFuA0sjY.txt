testament to that and so we'll take it away Hi Vee Rolin Thank You Victor and thank you ever in for joining let's jump right in just a line working to cover today in the webinar first we'll start with general real estate tech what it is why it's popular and the emerging company landscape then we'll examine what real estate tech is driving investment seeing what the global trends are looking like who the active investors investors are and more after that we'll dive into real estate takn Asia looking at the subset of cities that are seeing a lot of deal activity as well as the specific startups and Asia that are raising large amounts of funding following the Asia breakdown we'll discuss some of the emerging category as we're seeing within a real estate tech such as the commercial residential mortgage space etc will then wrap up with some notable news and thoughts on real estate tech moving forward so one note before we begin please do not worry about that's moving too quickly we're going to send out the slide deck and webinar recording at the end of the presentation which would be which you will be able to revisit at your convenience so what are we talking about when we talk about real estate tack ceatec defined in short encompasses all the software tools and platforms used by different participants in the real estate industry that includes brokers investors realestate focused lenders commercial property owners and managers as well as buyers and that excludes construction tech and software and office management services and buildings such as cleaning services so what does the real estate techie text RP this doesn't look like right now here's a market map with some of the real estate tech startups broken down into various categories when someone says real estate tech well first comes to mind might be the listing sites of Zillow or zoopla but real estate detecting compasses applications that span way beyond that and if you look at the map nearly all of the categories in real estate are being touched by technology to go through just a few examples on the map let's start from the top middle we have tech enabled brokerages these are startups that employee in-house brokers with their own listing services the category includes both compass and red fin which of each raised over 100 million in funding to date another example this property management software these are primarily tools for property managers landlords home owners and tenants we are seeing an increasing number of companies vertically focused and cater their tools as either commercial or residential property management software classes example discusses virtual property viewing stirrups here are creating the opportunity to use cutting-edge technology like 3d video to view properties remotely and that's both commercial and residential property gaming companies that have gained the most traction thus far our matter port and forward so how much is funny booming for global real estate tag looking into the annual history trend you can see that real estate tech companies raised over 1.7 billion dollars in investment in 2015 the strongest year by far this represents an impressive fifty percent increase in funding to the space when compared to 2014 figures quarterly trend reveals that 2016 is showing no signs of slowing down he wants 16 actually hit a record in deal activity with 56 deals recorded and 420 million dollars put to work for those of you who follow our CBN sets global VC reports you'll remember large pull backs and global will be seed funding and deal activity in q4 15 and q1 16 which is why the two consecutive quarters of deal growth in q4 15 and he won 16 to real estate tech is even more impressive when thinking about the macro investment climate if you want 16 also had some notable deals crowdfunding market places such as realty shares raised a 20 million series be led by union square ventures and property partner raised a twenty two point four million series be led by octopus ventures and index vendors although it's too early to tell q2 q2 16 looks little shape to be a healthy quarter quarter will hit a record in funding on one deal alone in Chinese online to offline services company home link which raised over 900 million in their series be in April 2016 will dig into what's happening in Asia later on so how do we know real estate tech has a rock piped often the best indicator to know that in industry is here is one of the most widely recognized intelligent investors start investing in space at CB insights we refer to this list of 24 investors as smart money bcs to see where these more money be seen fewer these books more money VCS are investing looking into the business social graph which shows the connectivity between top investors in order to answer these of the 24th more money VCS 16 are already betting on real estate tech in terms of broader categories these smart Wendy PCs are betting on we see that crowdfunding platforms are an area that investors are bullish on realty shares property partner cadre and real crowd to all raise financings from these investors another category smart on TV smart money VCS are betting on our tech enabled brokerages compass is backed by founders phone and run fitness backed by Greylock we also identified where some are 20 pcs have overlapping investments ones that stand out are commercial real estate crowdfunding platform cadre which is Jenner finders fun and khosla ventures and apartment search companies m / which we highlight later on and for in this presentation and that they share for investors in Greylock and Driessen kleiner perkins and nea so who are some of the most active investors outside of the smart money VCS taking a look at this graphic we see the most act that we see the most active investors in real estate tech among them are a bunch of well-known names that invest across stages but what's really notable here is that among the top nine investors four of them are new york-based including Josh scribners thrive capital box group are read ventures and meta prob what's so interesting here are some of their overlapping investments across investors for example commercial real estate search company 42 Flores has four separate overlapping investors in 500 startups box group sv angel and thrive capital and renren leann holdings the venture arm of chinese social network run run and Kimber Greek both participated in the series 8 fundrise now let's take a look at how some of the most active investors and acquires are related there's a lot going on in this visualization but perhaps the most notable fact here is that zillow has quietly been an active acquirer in the space they've acquired companies like trulia for three and a half billion dollars in july twenty fourteen and streeteasy 450 million dollars in august 2013 and they've recorded 11 disclosed acquisitions to date commercial real estate from costar group has an active acquire as well and some other acquisitions can be seen on the bottom left there are only been a handful of exits and real estate taxes for both funding reaching record highs we expect both the absolute number of exits and a few highly valued at you exits to make noise in the coming months exit activity is coming from companies headquartered all over the world for example real estate search zoopla is headquartered in the united kingdom real estate portal common floor is based in india an online to offline services Lazoo holdings is based in China so let's see if your company's striking the most deals when taking a look at the numbers what stands out is the overwhelming overwhelming majority or 71 percent of fuels are happening at the seed and series a stage and eleven percent of deals are current the series be in serious these stages illustrating that real estate attack is still in its early days taking a little deeper here here we see that we see the global breakdown of deal activity by city what's most impressive is that New York Trump's Silicon Valley and rounds to real estate tech companies given the given that New York has the greatest density of real estate tech investors it's not surprising that has become the biggest tub for real estate additionally among the other cities to see the most activity includes two cities in india bangalore and mumbai which we'll talk about more in the asia section dollar sugar is very considerably when looking at the u.s. first thrust the world but the general trend over the past years has been towards a greater share for markets outside the united states in terms of dollars invested china to sing up take an investment so what's happening in Asia real estate tech is really hot mark here so let's dig into some of the numbers to see just how much here we see if I entrance to a tree-based real estate tax startups in 2015 a today's real estate tech startups raised 848 million compared to 580 million in 2014 this represents a forty six percent increase in funding dollars deployed investment in China is not slowing down and some of the most well funded real estate tech startups are headquartered in Asia will show a breakdown of them in a bit but first let's but first let's take a look at some of the lord is around surreal estate tech startups in asia there were 9 15 million dollar plus round invest in real estate tech startup since 2011 but what's telling in this graphic is that there was an uptick in rounds in 2015 which mirrors the jump we saw in mega rounds to global vc-backed companies but there's only been a 150 million dollar plus round to email servers in the sector in 2016 and liana home link which we highlight in a bit when taking a closer look at the electricity by country and aided in view it was responsible for the plurality of deal share accounting for thirty-nine percent of real estate tech deals some recent deals in india include rental management platform zenifi as well as real estate marketplace nest away other countries to account for a significant electra include China Japan and Singapore so which cities are attracting the most deals here is a ranking of deal volume by aidan City three of the top four cities or Indian cities while others like Shanghai and Shenzhen are Chinese cities Japan's capital in Tokyo is all sterling this is to see some real estate tech activity and which countries are attracting those dollars in within Asia while china accounts for nineteen percent of do share in Asia they're actually accounting for sixty-two percent of dollars going to Asia base real estate tech startups this indicates that there are a few relatively Lord financings taking place in China companies drawing in these dollars in Asia three out of the foie Oh is there based in cha I 1.8 billion in funding as I mentioned earlier we expect a record in funding for Cutie 16 off one day alone and that's because of homeless in at the top which is the most well-funded real estate tech company in it in Asia and actually globally real estate tech companies names are not struggling to raise funding that's for sure other well-funded companies here includes Singapore's property guru which is backed by tpg m.tech and square peg capital as well as India's housing com which is backed by softbank capital among others now we'll discuss some emerging categories in real estate using CB insights data we created a breakdown of the residential real estate tech market we mapped out 96 startups across 15 categories to visualize what the current residential tech market looks like it's worth noting more and more startups are joining the space every day and we expect new categories to emerge as the space grows on left side we see listing and search services these include startups that help users search for residential real estate and what's interesting here is that syrups are somewhat picking at Zillow by focusing on apartments or in some cases focusing their efforts on certain geographies another category to find interesting is marketplaces which you'll find second to the left at the top of the section you'll see open to our labs which is founded by Keith turbo and also backed by as ferm Khosla Ventures there are one of the more unique marketplaces as they enable homeowners to sell their properties in a very short period other startups here in Cleveland America focused Vivah rial which has raised over 60 1,000,000 to date towards the top we have residential brokerage is like real which raised the six million series eight from magma Venture Partners real hopes to be an agent friendly brokerage building technology products fully catered to its residential agents others in the category include compass and redfin which we talked about a bit earlier bluetech brokered is we have property management software solutions like we mentioned earlier these are primarily tools for property managers landlords home owners and tenants Castle and rent illusions are both in this section and every is financing in 2016 the listing services we have agent matching startups here are connecting users directly to qualified residential agents homelite is one of the startups in this category and they've raised an 11 million series a led by Z ventures in April 2016 moving on we'll dig into the commercial real estate tax seen the Serie tech landscape is still quite nascent we broke down the growing vertical into its 11 emerging categories it's worth noting that there aren't as many companies in this market map as the residential market map but the map below is certainly growing on the top towards the middle you can see leasing mavin software companies like Hightower and BTS startups here how brokers and owners manage deal activity identify trends quantify portfolio performance among other tools data valuation and analytics which can be found on the right side is also one of the emerging categories in the CRE tech space among them is comp stacked which crowdsources building data from real estate agents to create leasing comparables cop SEC has raised over 9 million today another in the category is rental it exceeds analytics and intelligence to multifamily owners and operators they raise their nine million series a in January 2016 we expect smaller categories like mortgage debt to grow in the coming months as more startups tackle the commercial real estate space an area that has seen a large amount of investment has been crowdfunding a new investment platforms the break down below we highlight well-known platforms like cadre just which raised over 68 million to lesser-known companies like crowd street which is raised just 4.4 million in disclosed funding there's a desire to bring commercial and residential investment opportunities to individual investors and these platforms do just that it's worth noting however that crowdfunding has had a shadow cast on it as news earlier this year highlighted alleged impropriety happening at fund rise and broader questions are out crime lending after issues at Lending Club surface earlier this month despite this there are a number of companies looking to bring individuals unique real estate opportunities either in the form of debt or equity investment you don't see a breakdown us on the real estate tech startups attacking the mortgage space the breakdown includes a plan labs which gathers data sources such as digitized pay stubs tax forms and bank statements for borrowers to get to the lender Scindia which provides consumers with guidance information and tools to find the right mortgage and lender reduced by which helps lenders process loans faster by tracking information in the mortgage application and closing process glenda which is a mortgage refinancing software that enables homeowners to compare loan options complete their application securely manage documents and keep track of their loan status annabi don't rustle which are digital mortgage brokers that fully automate the brokering service to help you find the best mortgage towards the bottom we included some news in the mortgage deck space it's a little bit old but worth mentioning so Phi a company primarily known for their student loans began doing mortgages and refinancings as i mentioned then this is a space with opportunity and I expect more startups to emerge in both the commercial and residential mortgage space now we'll take a look at some real estate tech companies using CB insights mosaic the CB intense was a algorithm tracks the health of private companies we've highlighted a couple real estate tech companies with high mosaic scores all six these companies have mosaic scores above 800 those includes pakistan-based listing services a mean which raises the 20 million Serie C in January 2016 as well as virtual viewing company matter port which has raised over 58 million in funding to date so what are some things happening in real estate tax I know these are the deals that stood out to us in q1 16 and roughly halfway through key to 16 some big news for the commercial real estate tech space came out earlier this may when BTS the Lisa an asset management software company we discussed earlier raised one of the largest financing was for a commercial real estate tech startup it was a 55 million series c led by insight Venture Partners it'll be interesting to see if this has a domino effect on other commercial real estate tech startups and if we'll see water financings in the coming months london must the online mortgage platform based in the UK raise the twenty four point four million series be in march 2016 this is a promising deal as the mortgage tax base the mortgage space begins to pick up more speed nest way technology is a real estate marketplace in india the company raised the 30 million screws be in april 2016 this is notable because the majority of our deals in asia have been taking place in china so maybe we'll continue to see more and mid and late saved financings to india-based real estate tech startups to get a better sense of what's next we use seeping insights news tracker to a great relevant news relevant real estate tech news meta prop the new york-based real estate tech-focused accelerator kicked off the second batch sure that our accelerator earlier this month it invested in a number of real estate tech startups such as lease flipping marketplace flip as well as property management software startup rent illusions Whedon have a chance to cover this but the blockchain is presenting some promising opportunity for real estate the block can presents opportunities like making real estate and more efficient and expedited process helping reduce fraud and proving transparency to the market improving and providing transparency to the market I'm sure we'll see other applications without real estate relates to the blockchain and we'll be keeping an eye out for companies attacking this lastly in a time where we are seeing a number of thesis driven venture capital firms emerge in focus on either Bitcoin or frontier tech it's important for the real estate tech startup landscape that firm like firms like this as well while there are a number of CBC's like chamber Creek corrigan and expansion venture capital have been active california-based grey wolf founded in 2015 has built their entire thesis around real estate technology has become an active investor recently as well it's important for the entire real estate tech ecosystem tab focused VC
