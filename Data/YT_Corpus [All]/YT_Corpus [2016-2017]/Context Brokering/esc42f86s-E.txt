 I've been asked to talk about metadata at research data alliance so what i thought i would do if i can make the slides go hmm that's strange oh there we go so what I wanted to do is give a brief overview of the RDA research data Alliance and then talk about the difference between working groups and interest groups and then let you know what's happening with at least the metadata groups I'm associated with as you'll find out there there are many groups within our da so r da has actually been around since 2013 there was a it began in actually could have been before that but anyway it began with a meeting in göteborg sweden and to date they have many working groups interest groups there are a lot of people involved but the vision of RDA is for researchers and innovators to share data across disciplines technologies and countries and its mission in order to accomplish this vision is to build the social and technical bridges for open data sharing so it's an international organization and currently has more than 4,500 members from a hundred and fifteen different countries and again that division is down there the way they come together is is basically self formed and totally volunteer working groups interest groups and even birds of a feather so they collaborate on a lot of different areas in fact so some of them down there are reproducibility data preservation domain repositories and best practices for those there are groups dealing with legal interoperability data type registries data citation and actually quite a few groups dealing with metadata so who can join rd8 anybody it doesn't cost any it doesn't cost individuals to join our da and basically all you have to do is go to their website and sign up organizations can support our da but that does cost money and that information is actually on their website so here's what the community this is current as of the beginning of november so like i said there are 115 countries involved it's been growing rather rapidly as you can tell so started out with at the first plenary that started out with just under a thousand members and has grown considerably most forty-eight percent of the membership is from Europe thirty-three percent from North America and then the rest of the countries are also shown on this package art by and far the majority of the people who belong to our da and are active with an RDA come out of the research community in academia the next big piece of the pie is government or public services and then it goes down from there one of the things that they're actually trying to do is to get more businesses involved they're working on that so I think that's where the the other comes in so now to talk about the difference between working groups and interest groups working groups have to be formally approved they have to have a very pacific reason for farming that has to fit within the RDA vision and vision and mission ideally they want international membership and now they've actually added the part about three or more continents but usually if you have somebody from US and Europe or Asia Eurasia and Europe that's good you can have between two and four co-chairs to lead the initiative the big thing about working groups is that you need to have an outcome that is measurable and you only get 12 to 18 months to do this so what you do is you submit a case statement to the technical advisory board they review it and if it passes them then it is sent to the lead to the Oh organizational board and they review it and then they come back and say yes you can do this or here are some suggestions for that we think would help your working group and then you address those concerns and then you can get started but the big difference between working groups and interest groups is you only have 12 to 18 months to do things and that for a volunteer organization that time goes by rather rapidly interest groups on the other hand are they need to write a case statement to talk about what they're going to do but there's no timeline necessarily involved with it they can you have to stay active if you haven't been active in a while then the group can be dissolved but once you're an interest group and your case statement has been approved then it's up to the interest group to they get a web page on the RDA website and the most entered interest groups said about recruiting members who are interested in a particular topic interest groups are also really good for they can act as an umbrella organization for spawning off working groups so an interest group has a much wider range of interest and then when there is something that they think that can be done within 12 to 18 months a working group is spun off and again interest groups have two to four co-leads and ideally again there it's an international set of people which helps with calls something so that if there's called people from Australia or Europe it's easier to have a particular co-lead lead that particular one it's that's one of the difficulties of getting calls under way is just because of the timezone differences so r da has quite a lot of groups 72 groups in total right now there are 27 working groups and 45 interest groups and as you might imagine scheduling the plenaries is difficult because trying to find time for all of these groups to meet is a scheduling headache a lot of the working groups and interest groups meet together which helps out a lot I'm not going to read all of the groups together but there are domain science working groups and interest groups that focus on particular things they have once that our focused on community needs other ones are more on reference or sharing and as you can see you'll see metadata pop up there there's a humanities metadata working group that's relatively new and their partnership lawns again you'll see that tad wig metadata standards working group that is working together so it's RDA people and people in the tad wig metadata standards group working together there are groups involved in data store trip and services and then just base infrastructure and the metadata groups that I'm going to talk about today are the ones in the base infrastructure the metadata standards catalog the metadata standards directory working groups and the metadata interest group which is the umbrella one and then data in context interest groups so right now the the metadata interest group is led by three people Alex ball who's from the UK Keith Geoffrey is also from the UK and myself from the US and my day job is executive director of data one so the primary goal of the metadata interest group here is shown in pink fuchsia is essentially the young an umbrella group and we spawned off the metadata standards directory working group which has actually it started and the ended and is completely done and it was the precursor to the metadata standards catalog working group the data in context is an interest group and then our d stands for read research data provenance interest group because there's a great deal of overlap with that group and we work with them we also work with the brokering interest groups and some of the other interoperation services group so because metadata is involved in so many things we actually work with quite a few different groups and at each plenary we always have shared meetings we had been focusing on the different domains to see if to get their input to see if what we were working on made sense to them and to get their input for a month but we we work with a lot of different groups and see okay and as most people on the call are aware of metadata can be used for or discovery contextualization and access so the first meta data working group that we had was the metadata standards directory and let's see okay so this is just an overview of all the different things so that the eventual or the the original plan was to do the put standards into a metadata standards direct directory working group and then that worked off the follow on to that and this is some of the things that we have been working on is to come up with a package which is essentially a common set of metadata elements that could be used across different domains and we're getting feedback on that right now so a little bit of history part of the reason for starting that metadata standards directory is that data one had had done a lot of survey of researchers and one of the outcomes of the first survey that we had was when they were asked about what metadata standard they were using by and large most respondents said none and the second largest group said my lab meaning whatever they came up with and not necessarily and then the actual standards showed up but again not in the second number of people that were doing either none or my lab and so what we thought and data one gets a lot of queries about what metadata standard should we be using so that was the focus and drink Jane Greenberg was involved in the first working group so our idea was to come up with a directory that would list data standards and as we were getting the group going we found out that they're actually one already existed at the digital curation center in the UK and they had a metadata standards directory and it still exists today and it's divided up as this is for humans to search but it's divided up by discipline and it has links to the standard it has some use cases has links to the tools that you can use with it but the problem with that is that there was no longer any funding to keep it up and what we found out when we proposed our group was that people wanted they would go here and then they'd say well there's some errors and they wanted to be able to correct it so the whole outcome from the metadata standards directory working group was that we actually implemented this standards directory from DCC in github to make it much easier for people to update add new standards to the directory if they weren't already there so what we've done is to have a sustainable community driven metadata standards directory so we do review all the suggestions that come in to the github version of that work of that directory and if they're fine then we go ahead and add them to it and this is a way of sustaining a directory there have been at least 15 new standards added to what was previously there and many corrections have been made and additions if there were two new tools that could be used with a particular standard those have been added so we also come combined we also requested use cases for how people wanted to you use metadata standards directory and one of the things that came out of that was that people wanted not only a human readable directory but a machine-readable so that it could be used both ways and that is what led whoops sorry wrong way and that's what led to the follow-on catalogue group another outcome of the metadata groups were to come up with a set of principles about metadata and those are the ones listed and basically to the only difference between metadata and data is the way they're used so to say that metadata is data that data really is too limiting and that's why we want to include the first principle that it's out there and these are not unique to just our group say a lot of different groups are coming up with principles about metadata the other thing is to make people aware that metadata can is also you know meditate about users you can have metadata about software services as well as computing resources and that it's not just for description and discovery but also contextualization and also a way to do a virtual research environment so that you can have software and computing resources available to people too again it needs to be machine understandable and readable as well as by humans and it's also the management metadata is also very important and a lot of groups in Europe track the research infrastructure so they keep track of grants funding opportunities experts in their particular area some universities in the u.s. do it but not to the degree that the Europeans are doing it which is actually another good thing about RDA is it gives you a chance to collaborate with people internationally and not just in the US so the follow-on group that is active right now is the metadata standards catalog and we have 89 members from across the world representing many different groups functions researchers librarians data archivists we started in january of this year and we have to be finished by July of 2017 so we started with the standards directory from the last working group and we are adding new detail and functions to that so this includes a schema level information and also an API for the machine access so the elements that we came up with are listed here and if you go to the website there's actually a lot more information about this but this is the the key set of elements that we are trying to find out if and getting feedback on these if these are sufficient and will work across different domains I think one of the interesting things the feedback we got especially on spatial coordinates were we had people from astronomy and they would give us some really good feedback that special coordinates really weren't relevant to their area so anytime you try and go across domains it becomes really really challenging but we had to start somewhere and this is where we're starting so of those elements some of them are single value but not all of them are and there you also have to be able to handle different languages and so well we are working on now is structured metadata more along the lines of a relational database so that you can capture not only a particular moment in time but the temporal aspect of metadata so that someone can be in a role at one port one point in time but then at another point in time somebody new could come into that role so in addition to those elements we have to be able to structure them such that you capture all the information that you need about that the relationships and the time element so here's how we did we started out with use case templates and actually the data in context interest group is the one that worked with us to come up with the use case templates and there'll be a if you go to the rd Alliance website and go to the metadata into interest group you'll see all the different things that i'm referring to here so so we started out with use case templates that list elements that the various use case is used we extracted the comment and required element so the use cases the template asked whether they were required or just nice to have so we went through all those and analyzed use cases came up with we extracted the common and required elements and then tried to figure out the structure using semantic Clint linking and then reduced that to that minimum set that I just showed you and all these different worksheets are available from the website and this is just um shows you what they're like but what we found out is when we first started yet with use cases using just descriptive language or a word document was not very helpful it makes analyzing use cases very difficult which is why we came up with a template to use and actually that's that was a side effect of our working group is that other groups have actually picked up our template and refined it for their use too and they found that it's much easier to analyze use cases if there's a template involved so where we are right now is we have a draft data model out and this and that draft data model is in the metadata standards catalog working group what web page on our research did Alliance and we also have two proposals for a disciplinary taxonomy and what we are doing now is requesting feedback and comments on those on the draft data model as well as the two draft proposals for the Disciplinary taxonomy in addition this we also found out that people needed more information about the elements that I listed on a previous slide and so the in the Tokyo plenary that was part of what came out of that was that a group got together and worked on to better definitions of those elements so that people would know what we're talking about and be bitter better able to give us some comments and review on that so I wanted to let you know that the next plenary will be in April in barcelona spain and you can find out all the information about this and they're also looking for until actually next week actually 27 which i think is a monday they're looking for other groups that want to kuwait co-locate with this plenary to have their meetings usually there are workshops before and after the RDA plenaries and it also has all the information about how to register for the meeting and just the information the logistics information for it the plenary there are 2 r.d a plenary a year one in the spring and one in the fall the one in September following the Barcelona planaria will be back in North America in canada in montreal so that should be a meeting that's probably easier to get to than barcelona i encourage you to sign up to become a member of any of the RDA groups but in particular if you're interested in metadata please join the metadata interest group or the metadata standards catalog working group if you'd like to get involved with that and although I'm co-lead of the data in context interest group I am spread way too thin so I have been looking for help giving up my co-lead of that particular group so if data in context is something that interests you please do get in touch with me I have a volunteer from Australia and see the Netherlands but that would mean that that particular interest group is doesn't have anybody from from the US coal edina anymore so if anybody's interest in it do let me know and i would tell you what's involved and how you can get involved and that's it well thank you for joining us today Rebecca and so letting us know about everything that's going on in RDA met with metadata world will certainly appreciate it like to open up the floor to any questions that anyone may have had about the presentation ah can you guys shoot me yep hey um oh how dead thanks a lot um couple things you mentioned sort of the in the relational model you were naming you you were talking about you know the same person being used in different places in the record and things like that it seems the Lord to this idea that we implemented a while going Noah called components where we then you know we wrote we wrote metadata for a person or an organization or a set of keywords or something like that just once and then we were able to reference it multiple times from multiple records is that is that though I I'm trying to connect what you were talking about with some of the things that we've been thinking about both at NOAA and then other places but is that is that connection correct um it's definitely the start so how would you handle the situation where let's say that the person Oh like the creator of a data set changes over time would you be able to track when that change took place but not lose track of the history of who was in that role in the most recent version of I so we added to the responsibility class an extent and that extent has is both temporal and spatial so we did that for four people in in any role anywhere in I so you can now specify that person's responsibility in terms of time and space as subsets of the data set so you could have a situation where you have a data set that's you know global and you know one person or organization maintain say the North American part of that data set or the u.s. part or the Canadian part or something and another group or organization controls or is responsible for the European or Asian or however you wanted to divide that up and each of those each of those responsibilities could vary as a function of time so in in the way that that's implemented in in I so you could certainly do that even with component we're going to have people organizations with different a temporal or spatial extents of responsibility perfect no that that sounds exactly what we need yeah that was why we why we did that in you know in the gut in the federal government data centers where I have a little of experience there were a number of people that were tiring on we know that graying of the the federal workforce is an interesting problem but so we had to have a template varying responsibility that's good to know the other thing about the use the use case templates mm-hmm so the use case templates are a set of metadata elements that are either your required or recommended for addressing a particular use case is that right that's right yeah very similar to some of the work you do yeah yeah I mean that's it provides an interesting set of what we would call recommendations for different use cases I mean that's exactly our definition of of recommendation so we would be interesting to try to apply some of those sort of metadata completeness evaluation ideas to those different use cases yes actually it would with the complexity of multiple dis dialects also thrown in right yeah so um you're working on a tool right or is it already done that allows you to think about the tools that I work on there never actually fun ok so like metadata catalogues but yeah we're working on a tool and you know the idea of the tool is that it could be the easiest to apply is this recommendation analysis dashboard tool that Sean's actually been working on which allows you to take a metadata collection and compare it with multiple dialects or take a metadata collection and compare it to multiple recommendations sorry dialects that we have are you typically in 11 the collections are typically in one dialect it's all be interesting to do to try that tool um maybe we should try and set up something for that next plenary that's what I was just gonna say I think that would be really interesting and a lot of people would be interested in that first then I guess you have to go to Barcelona yeah I know it's rough yeah okay well maybe I'll talk to Sean about that okay yeah let me know cuz that would be really really interesting would you say there was a deadline for that ah no that was only if you want to hold a workshop or a meeting co-located with a plenary I think the call for sessions just came out today so there's there's time to and I'm going to be requesting the session anyway so I would love to have this is part of one of the presentations during our sessions yeah okay well any other questions I'm gonna mute again and turn it back go of the showing thanks again Rebecca that was really interesting oh thanks Ted so Sean I'm going to give it back to you okay you okay can you all see the wiki page that I and put up for the documentation sessions for winter 17 okay great thank you so I'd like to make sure that you are all aware of a slight change to the the three sessions that are the the four sessions that we had our changing to three sessions moving forward the the first two proposals that are listed here the improvement lab and the ISO building blocks are going to be combined into a session that is going to be directed at showcasing ways that the ECF wiki is used as a place to provide documentation guidance so we'll include some of the ways on how you would use a recommendations analysis dashboard to link in with guidance documentation as well as a new section on the wiki the Ted and John ko's moraband spearheading that is you may have seen before on the NOAA wiki for iso the iso explorer it is being redone for the new iso standard version and so it'll be an interesting way to be able to connect into documentation that will help guide your creation of the newest version of iso records and so then we will also be looking at curation efforts and automating documentation we do need to think about revising rebuilding the documentation close to home page and also in a similar vein we need to create a poster for the cluster so that people who may not be as familiar with esup when they come to a meeting they can learn about clusters and you know perhaps find areas of interest but they would like to hook into so I would be happy to have someone take over that responsibility and also we need to think about if there are any of these sessions that we would like to give a talk at so if anybody has any thing to add on either those fronts please do speak up or if you have any questions about how how things are going let me know Sean ed I'm not exactly sure if we've got time in the agenda but I would if there is some time I'd be happy to show a little bit of the new explorer yeah sure why don't you take a couple of minutes to do that I think I put that my metadata page up yeah i will link to it in the in the chat yep so you want to give me the presenter per minute all right you've got presentation so many people in this call are no doubt familiar with the at least the older older with the fgdc graphic the graphic guide to the fgdc standard so this was a guide that was created back in the old days for the fgdc standard and both Anna Milan and I and many other people that we knew really liked using that guide and we always talked about doing something about iso so on the NOAA wiki there is something that anna developed called the metadata the iso Explorer and we are removing that too on the east of wiki and then we're updating it at the same time for a 1911 five dash one so the whole page of the starting page for most for this the highest level gauge is mi metadata and that's actually going to have to become ND metadata or something but you know it's it's for each class in the metadata standard there are there's a table that has background colors the background colors are explained down here on the bottom of every page yellow mandatory green conditional blue optional and each of these things is a is a click something that you can click on and in this case I clicked on contact the contact is a CI responsibility in this case it used to be a responsible party so responsibility is a new element in 1915 there's a UML diagram which shows what that what the what that class and subclass just look like ah there's you know the three things the three properties that exist in or all of the properties in this case three show up in the table they each have definitions and as we build this out they'll have examples then down here is also possible parent elements so CI responsibility is used in quite a few different places in the standard so you can click on on that possible parent elements and see all the places where CI responsibility is used in the standard and then we're also working on these guidance pages and this is a this is a page that we copied over from actually this page existed the page with this title existed on this wiki earlier but the idea is these guidance pages would give guidance and examples of how CI responsibilities used throughout the standard the reason that we're we're I mean we're excited about moving this to the east of wiki because we'd like to have members of the documentation cluster or others contribute to building it out and and then building it up it be there's a single category called iso Explorer which you can also click on and see all of the pages that are in this category and in the iso explorer and if you then want to look at one of them for instance browse graphic you can click on that and see you know what the descriptions are for brows graphic of course this read a box here means there's a graphic that's missing we're working on trying to build those out and then we're also in a category of pages with broken file links so we're trying to use some of the wiki maintenance capabilities so all these are files or pages that currently have miss file links and a lot of those are our graphic files that are missing so we're working on building this out now and our hope is to have it you know have the framework in place before the winter meeting so if there are people out there that would be interested in helping either build the wiring or to build those guidance pages that would be great and again in the chat there is a link to that whole age are thankful and people know the more about that did anybody have any questions on the the new iso explorer or wanted to reach out and say that they take on some of the work now the second group is of course more welcome than the first if you do have desires you're going to contact me or or Sean or hopefully attend a session at winter where we'll talk about this a little bit more thanks Sean let's stay you can take back please enter thank you alright so we have that session on the SIP wiki and then if you are interested in the curation efforts session giving a talk please reach out to Kahlan or myself and also if you're interested in the automating your documentation this seems to be something that's maybe a more no flavor session and curation efforts may be more of a NASA although i do encourage crosstalk i think there's a more diverse we have a cross-section of speakers from all of the different organizations that have a stake in assess the stronger that our sessions will be but like i said please get in contact with me you can do that now you can do that offline and then additionally as i mentioned the documentation cluster page is in need of a revamp and i would expect that a good explanation home page would lend itself to creating a good poster to help get the word out about the cloth in the greater estep community so if if anyone has anything to add on that please speak up now otherwise I think we can go ahead and end a couple of minutes early and keep up that chatter offline right well thank you everyone for joining us today i will make a recording of this and push it out on in case you know of anyone that you would like to share Rebecca Rebecca's talk with but please do contact me and get some get some talks into these sessions thanks everyone thanks Don you
