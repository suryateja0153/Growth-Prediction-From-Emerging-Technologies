 do you say who you are Thanks yet Jonathan Danny would save the children not sure what I'm about to say is saving children's line I'm told fairly soon if it isn't so you use thanks everyone it's a really great it's a great event I'm learning a lot and I think it's really really great discussions I did expect it to be some kind of more I guess controversy about whether or not this whole push toward private sector was a good thing that's the kind of that's the kind of control see that there's been in the public to be a little bit especially from I guess the civil society sector not perhaps as strongly in this country but certainly across the world is it the case that everyone in this room basically agrees that in theory the idea of some aid money going towards the kind of things we've discussed building a private sector in developing countries building the market all that stuff is it the case we're all agreed on that that the theory is basically in it we're in agreement now and the only question is the hell the question is the impact the question is the the value for money and how to separate out the money and all that stuff but that I think is a quite an interesting step forward and implies that we're not in an ideological debate here or even really much of a theoretical debate we're in a practical debate so that my question if the chair doesn't mind but I'm asking really everyone in this room did be quite interesting thing and then going on to the impact thing I think it's quite right that everyone who's engaged in this debate about a to the private sector is forced to answer the impact question but I don't think we should assume that the rest of aid 140 billion or whatever is at the moment is answering that question well now answering impact questions is incredibly difficult whatever type of aid it is and and the non private sector aid is massively diverse as well especially if we're talking about sustainable impact jobs and long-term changes for your family and community not just in immediate impacts incredibly difficult and it's very diverse type so for instance you know vaccinating children I can pretty much demonstrate the impact of that support to civil society in the rest of the world how how do you demonstrate that kind of impact is so diverse it so difficult so I mean you know again other questions we're asking the private sector any from really to the questions we're actually asking all aid and I think you know my concern is that the kind of learnings we've had about impact you know can anyone remember the parents agenda no one if it seems to be able to at the moment you know do we need to just remember those basic things that we've learned throughout you know our research and apply them to the private sector in the same way we reply to to anything and then just finally you know on Kenya I think the danger of this debate I i I'm relaxed about putting money in it in the way we've discussed i think it's going to be useful as a part of the aid debate but the danger is that we start to say things like I thought a brilliant presentation from from mr. ridolfi but I don't agree that Kenya doesn't need aid donor don't agree that it won't need grant aid for many years to come I think there's a case to be is it's forty percent of Kenyans live below the poverty line the Kenyan poverty line I believe that is will the one dollar a pox on dunno which but is very very very very poor the idea that Kenya is somewhere now moved out that or other middle-income countries have moved out the need for grant aid is a very very dangerous one if we in the North don't want to give them money because we haven't got enough and want to spend on ourselves let's say so and it's a limited pot fine but let's not say they don't need it great thank you very much your first question was also yeah i was thinking about who was someone here had a question so paddy was it you okay and then we have quite a few so um well very quick first of all I man was regretting publishing that blog this week and not next week I quite agree that the importance of Hell where odor is school is you know I wouldn't call a side issue for anyway and I agree that it what I'm asking about might not be feasible so not been honest really feasible ok so and on this concern that people have that by offering all these inducements to private sector investors what we're really doing is creating excess profits for private sector investors um I don't know whether I just like to hear what the panel think about this would it be a crazy idea to ask to look at the returns of the private sector investors that are involved in blending and to see whether the distribution of returns the Prophet they're making looks like they're making it profits or not is that a way of getting our additionality via a sort of indirect route and then on this question of additionality I mean I bear in mind what I think everybody's quite accurately said that what you should expect changes depending on you know whether your market building or whether you're pushing about that commercial frontier if we if we subsidize the the price of a loaf of bread we expect the quantity of bread purchase to go up but we don't expect to be able to look at every potent every purchase of bread and so that that bread wouldn't have been bought without this subsidy and that bread would have been otherwise if you know if we're looking at what the dfi is do is it acceptable to say look we know that we're making investment cheaper and easier in these markets um we don't have a lot more we know we can't get rigorous evidence but we thought you know not proper kind of our CT style rigorous evidence that we're having additionality is that I mean I see that described as weak evidence of additionality but it is that the best evidence that we're going to get what I'm trying to get at is this good enough thing is what we currently have on additionality good enough thank you and there's a question right at the back yes by the window please thank you I'm will fit simons from publish we fund and and I wanted to pick up on the point that Roberto Rudolph he made on the the challenge of getting business and others to care about the SDGs you said give them an index and they will they will care about it you gave biodiversity as an example and they won't care about the content they'll just try and do well I I wish I agreed with you our experience campaigning for transparency is that business and the DF eyes in particular do not care well enough do not care enough about doing well in the aid transparency index which we run roughly once a year to evaluate the quality and quantity of data produced on on foreign aid and the next one comes out in about two weeks and without giving you the exact results what I can tell you is that there are agencies of all shapes and sizes that do well in that index that are very transparent in their activities with one big exception which is the DF eyes and generally speaking most the DF eyes when I write them each year with the results of the index and say you know you're in the middle or you're at the bottom of our index please be more transparent publish more data on your activities they generally write back and say look we'd love to but we can't because of commercial confidentiality and Amy's touched on this there are some of the briefing papers touch on this so my question is how big a deal is commercial confidentiality really and if it is a big deal is it time to reconsider and how we exempt private investors from the sort of transparency that we are increasingly taking for granted in the public sector thank you thank you very much any more questions yes thank you very much I'm Celine tan from the University of Warwick law school just wanted to go back to Sheila pages original sort of question at the session this morning I think that's quite relevant given the comments that were made questions from Jonathan Glenny and Rupert summons earlier it's regarding this delegation investment decisions national development policy to the private sector and private actors and I think that's quite crucial given you know lots of donors like different moving away from budget support mechanisms as an odor instrument particularly in terms of you know do we trust the private sector I mean the concerns about fragmentation of development finance what is the place of national governments and national institutions for development policy making in an environment where the financing for development is being fragmented into different pots different instruments different actors and different concerns and different priorities so that's sort of my question basically on sort of the coherence the harmonization issues that were discussed quite extensively during the 1990s and 2000's but it'll fallen off the radar recently with the sort of multi actor type instrument and my sort of follow-up question in regards to this subsidy element is I'm not a competition lawyer so my colleagues are I'm not but I've just wondered in terms of the blending mechanisms how does that square up with international trade and investment obligations of countries regarding state aid and public perman if you've got this subsidy element in Oda and so thank you very much Thank You ash he don't groan both briefly and then we try and get you'd some of these Sheila following up Jonathan's point I mean it isn't so much yes but yes but I'm not sure you've realized all of the risks that we know about from aid we talking about wind farms I did have an awful vision of infant industry arguments and yes they sometimes work and some infants grow up into decent self-sustaining adults but some didn't and sometimes infant industry arguments are used for senile in this I don't want to look at today's newspaper headlines but I think I wonder if there is sufficient emphasis on exiting from any of these types of support and the other but when I was on assessing the impact I was a bit concerned with some of the talk about looking at the impact of an investment and then on those who use it and the other interesting tidbits and so forth you if you do that for any individual industry you will end up saying that the entire economy is dependent on that one industry which you invested in and a few cents are adding leads up you end up with a slight accumulation problem so I think that we do need to be a little more careful about attributing indirect effects to our pet projects Thank You Graham hi graham gordon from cathode should anything be off-limits in this discussion in terms of what public money is used to invest or to blend with private for example you have a recent report from un from un desa that looks at experience of public private partnerships and the overall conclusion is it has worked reasonably well in things like infrastructure communications in social sectors the results are patchy at best so if we look at some of the those decisions within donors at the moment about how money is distributed if more money is going to be going into through DF eyes or directed private sector that money it's a negative sum game that money is coming from somewhere traditionally that money is likely be coming from healthcare education or some of the more social services that are still not up to the standard we require the world over so are we actually in some cases robbing Peter to pay Paul and should they be limits and should that actually seems that there needs to be more research done and maybe more guidance into what is this blending actually going where is it going to produce the of impacts we're talking about which are more the indirect and induced ones and we're actually do we need to make sure that aid is still going to be going to some of the the other sectors where the money isn't going to come from elsewhere great thank you so I think we're getting to some of these who have contextual issues and some underlying issues that we haven't been specifically talking about i think most of us know that set in the UK context if it is managing to meet the north point seven percent through a certain amount of what some call smoke and mirrors other call others call reallocation where the allocation to development capital gets you there to the north point seven but doesn't come off the national debt and it's a good way of from the chancellor's point of view of spending money so there is definitely some reallocation going on and the amount being allocated to capital is definitely going up so Rob although you said we need all these things and they complement each other I decided not to push back on you say yeah actually you are shifting money from one to the other but I think that is the context of Jonathan your question of are we all buying into supporting the private sector per se and are we actually buying into this shift and where does that begin and end and I had already thought in the coffee break actually I wish we had started with a bit of a show of hands and then see if it had changed but let's do it anyway I'm assuming there might not be people that if you had 100 million and you're in charge of it and it's its owner money it's official development assistance it's your ended is there anyone here who would allocate one hundred percent of that to private sector and private sector instruments okay didn't expect that is anyone here who would allocate zero percent of that what okay yep and sorry I should have expected that I'm so I think you're right on the whole people have bought into it with some important exceptions but the question is roughly what who here would allocate up to thirty percent okay a few who here would allocate between thirty and sixty percent not many gosh so who dunna Kate between 60 oh sorry okay I was going to give us three bands so all right who would allocate up to ten percent okay a lot of people now i'm going to go 10 to 30 and then who would allocate between ten percent and thirty percent good sprinkling thirty percent to sixty percent Oh still a reason sprinkling and sixty percent to ninety-nine percent because we've already ruled out a hundred okay 111 fund manager over there sorry i'm using my internal knowledge okay so we have a lot in sort of up to ten percent and up to 10 to 30 i think that really is a ship from where we were before i was on a panel a few years ago and seeing that partnerships and someone said to me does it worry you that your partner's make a profit and my response was it would really worry me if they wouldn't make a profit because the whole reason I'm in this as a development person is there supposed to reach scale and how they're going to reach scale without a profit and that was only a few years ago and the audience was really worried that my development by commercial partners are going to make a profit I do think we have seen a big shift in reply to that I'm panelists you have some interesting questions here before you we have a very specific one on transparency on which I completely agree the DF is a rubbish but pitch is a good example so if you have comments on transparency let's deal with that as a specific thing but let's cut also come to the bigger picture questions how do we know if there are excessive returns and how do you think this fits with the fragmentation of the ADA gender versus the attempt to be more strategic national more harmonized and let's perhaps take those two first excessive profits and the overall shifts in the ADA gender and the DVD devolution lots of fragmented players let's let's run with those um try to start yeah I would have liked to address a little bit or all of them okay quickly show quickly the frame from Save the Children the discussion is not only on giving money to the private sector but also getting money out of the private sector which is even more important if we are able to show that we have convening power and brokering a function then we get a lot of money for what you like to do every day from private sector I can tell you that initiatives Electrify agri fire showing that private sector is willing to give money and there we have another risk which is reputational is reputation for me to only level because they can do lab land-grabbing and we don't want to be associated to that but it in on Kenya I think you got it wrong I didn't say that they don't need grant they do like China China they have 200 people below poverty line shall we give money to China well I respect your view the point is the Kenya today can do policy inside the government to address we have a line in the European Union that we are targeting poor countries and of course there are middle-income countries even some our rich countries that have four people in them and the question is shall we do something of course we shall but that's a different discussion from the discussion of today on the ODA I think who are we creating excessive profit this is not the question this is not the question I think the question is are we opening up markets that do not exist excessive profit that was an example on PPP's on a certain excessive project is impossible to evaluate I want to bring you an example electrification of road areas in the past we were doing with call for proposals for NGOs and we have done some 250 million euros of that what is the sustainability evaluation of that operation 00 after the project was finished everything was finished we have seen that when there was a private operator deriving a legitimate profit if he is able to derive profit because in rural area booking a father I challenge you to drive a profit from electricity bills but if they were deriving a profitable then they were expanding the access because it's in their interest to have more connections and in senior and my interest to have more people connected to electricity because of poverty alleviation right so the two interests coincide that's the best example and I tell you that NGOs CSO's are cold to cooperate with a private operator in that area because we want also safety nets and solidarity schemes in the way he operates the mini grid for the three thousand people traditionally you start from the blacksmith from the timber and then you go to the houses because houses they don't have money you start from the economic activities in the village to generate cash for the electricity connections and then you go on this is a beautiful model to show you that it works on the on the transparency Infanta well I agree with you and that is our day by day fight on this confidentiality aspect of course and the fifth question goes on on risk i think the the role of some somebody can makes it somebody doesn't make it that's nature isn't it so we can't talk we cannot expect that every action is a successful to 100% the biodiversity the rob was mentioning there are more commercial operations and very less commercial operation by doing both you ensure that a failure on one side is compensated by success on the other that is a game portfolio theory we shall apply to our own risk approach off limit is there anything of limit or not I think that the question on freeing space for money and that is also would be the last point on budget support or not you ask the question how many what percentage well today out of 70 billion euro which is the financial perspective of the European Commission about four or five six percent is for private sector strictly speaking it's about ten percent for blending but of this time % the majority's for public blending that is infrastructure with sovereign debt only for five percent so that your percentages the reality is that we are very hot and very very driven by discussing about the four five percent well let's look at the budget support i am a supporter of budget support when it works it does not always work but where where and when it worked we shall do it so we shall continue to do it Thank sustainability I'm I'm impressed that you know questions the work the word the sustainability didn't appear once I might cook without I'm just briefing i do want to come back to the other panelists could you comment on the question of state aid and competition obligations that we clearly you and could you also just answer this question we from online what are the prospects of the upcoming ECOSOC forum on financing for development regarding investment in 169 sdg targets and will the private sector be at the table of this ecosoc meeting kelly from fair trade thank you I'm not organizing echo socks right no I'm certainly I'm certainly that the private sector would be at the table what I'm perspective of an accord I don't know I told you that I trust very much mainstreaming of 169 rather than a dog thing but that's the future on the on the on the other issue over state aid yeah it's a known question rather the subsidy that we are talking in this room today is the subsidy of Oda into operations of development is not the subsidy intended as a state aid approach because when we do provide the cds see I guess 4d if it is the same or EAB with a subsidized tranche of Oda to do an operation with private companies they shall respect in the countries where they go state aid rules or whatever other routes so the subsidies will be offered in a competitor and open and transparent math manner to everybody and therefore the stated principle is out of the question thank you very much Amy can we come to you on this question of well any of the answers but particularly do we trust the private sector is a sort of underlying theme there and have you looked at all at issue of transparency yeah so do we trust the private sector I guess this kind of goes to Jonathan's question and grams and a bunch of others I I'm not sure it's a question of trust or not i think the private sector is motivated and governed by their own set of rules and that's as it is and governments have a wall and setting those rules what I do trust I suppose is that yes the private sector is there to make coffee until we set the rules up riding the conditions right they don't have to think about development and that's it there's not a criticism of private sector actors I think it's just a reality and that's okay so it is up to us to kind of set the right conditions so I guess that kind of comes to Jonathan's question very much around you know I guess there was a consensus that we need we know we need money beyond aid but there is still very much for me as some society a question about is it like to use aid in the ways that we're talking about to mobilize that money because can we answer that question about the opportunity a relative cost of not using that public money to do something else which isn't to say that we wouldn't come here on the side of saying yes we absolutely should do that but I think we need a much a much better answer um yeah I guess so i don't know i don't suppose it's really question whether or not we trust the private sector i think as well or not we trust the governor's working with the private sector maybe that's the right way to put it transparency yeah I mean I think this is a really tricky one and it's something that you know we fought really hard in the eighth sector to get this and it's part of the the person be sun aid effectiveness stuff that Jonathan also mentioned which you know I think we have forgotten and is the kind of aid landscape and the development finance landscape has gotten more complicated we haven't necessarily taken that stuff that we learnt through you know lots of blood sweat and tears I notice you know people on this man we've been working on that for a long time we haven't necessary taken those lessons and transfer them across so I think what for safely the kind of principle of transparency would mean for a door donor money is probably going to be different than how we might interpret that for a private development act or something but we do need to kind of start copying those principles across and thinking them through we have to kind of answer this the commercial confidentiality when it's not one that comes out again and again and again and it's just you know we have to come up with a better answer there now it's a little bit complicated i suppose isn't it some some challenge phones just say if you get our money we'll put you on the website and of that employer might interested yeah anyway there's another story yeah we're definitely behind on that one Richard oh no I'm going to ask you well I mean similar set of questions you know are you worried from where you sit in your respective organizations about excess profit are you worried about how this space affects the rest of the aid agenda and eight harmonization agenda you worry about fragmentation and is anything off limits we'd like to go first gens an icon it doesn't do policy so I was really wishing that I'd been on the first panel so with that context there's a really interesting questions and we've been giving quite a lot of thought to the sort of tension there is between the sort of media pressures about giving money to to middle-income countries and and the very real challenges of the global goals about leaving it all behind particularly implications for the rural poor and you know I think that there is an opportunity potentially to to bridge that gap a little bit with with some of the government thinking on on beyond data I think one of the real challenges is where you know it may not matter so much if if if the UK moves from one area to another and focuses on more on fragile states but have all donors are doing the same thing around the world then you've got a real shift in economic power witcher i think is a challenge for for everyone to worry about but but as I say we don't do policy so that's not my my issue I mean I think the the question about super profits yeah import it's about the design and it's the part about the governance of mechanisms and avoiding unintended consequences and and in the way it's in everyone's interest to get that right I mean it isn't in the private sector interest to have you know banner headlines in you know a newspaper that we might not mention the name of about excess profits because because ultimately you know it threatens that the mutual benefit that has got through through these activities so so get getting the design right and avoiding those unintended constituting good governance and good accountability and good reporting to demonstrate the positive things you know all of that are ways to address sir thank you very much um I think were the excess profits of it prejudicial is I think what one what very much worried about absolutely worried about is getting the best value for money and I think we we too quickly judge to sort of assuming what we're doing here is subsidizing private companies and their shareholders and I think the key is about trying to use the resources we have B they funds or be the day technical assistance or other capabilities policy capabilities and others to achieve the greatest development impact and how do we set the right incentives to achieve that frame so exactly it's all about getting the governance right getting the incentive payments and prioritization frame what's right and go to remit in a lot of these things that actually the profit level is aligned with the development impact and the successful business correct a lot of jobs and grows and actually in those spaces where there's higher profit levels we're getting more development impact but also we normally pari passu I e on the same terms with the private sector so the public money is also getting that return and that is reinvested into development so it's it's it's a cycle and we should be careful to be too too prejudicial in our language i think but i do think thinking about additionality and and turning it into something where we think really think about what our value-added how can we increase our development impact through this and thinking about at a portfolio level there are always going to be extreme cases which are more or less attractive but we need to think of realtor as part of the overall the overall impact that we're looking at then I think on the on the fragmentation but i think really this comes to to what i tried to speak about about trying to mesh capabilities and i think a lot of this is if we only look through one lens so if the development community we only look to the aid lens and if the private companies are only look to a private lens we're not going to achieve what we want to what we need to do is mesh together the capabilities all the lessons learned so absolutely we should learn from from the aid landscape just as we should learn from the private sector landscape and we need to all go into those conversations with an open mind set of actually what is the right framework within hill what's the right governance structure to achieve the impact we want and I think that's the that's the view we should be thinking about this through thank you very much we're actually you know this clock hasn't gonna fall to spring summer time so we have another hour to go it's only eleven forty two fine ten questions now I think we do need to refer and I think it's been a great discussion I'm really really grateful to all four of you panelists and to our previous panelists we've had a host of different perspectives I think we've done remarkably well at relating some very different actors and perspectives to the questions that paddy posed about impact about how we understand impact and about what the effective subsidy is even though it's quite clear we cannot answer that question what is the effective subsidy and what is the exact impact I mean I don't think we're expecting to answer that question I hope we weren't or you're going home disappointed um I think I'll end with a few few summaries and a few personal reflections and i will i am the editor of the practitioner hub on inclusive business which is all about this that has a direct impact at the base of the pyramid and I will be putting a blog on there with some more thought about reflections of what viewers said today so read that next week if you want something more considered and I think patty with an ODI will be following up on the ODI website so I'm not going to try and do a complete synthesis of everything we've discussed but it seems to me just a few thoughts and we clearly can't just come up with a formula and say this is the input of the public resource and this is the impact and we know that's very difficult we've done well identifying some of the challenges some of which were well known some of them have been very much surface today it's interesting that language has come up so much I really do think that's true and spent the last five years immersed with investors and businesses it's been so nice today to be able to talk about subsidy and profit in the same event because that very rarely happens confidentiality is very interesting one I think there's a lots more that could be done on that to get past that barrier but we're not there yet the burden of monitoring and evaluation yeah came up a lot especially on the practitioner panel do you think this is very good thinking happening on that at the minutes but it's very pocketed isolated some of the more impact first investors investment funds are doing well on that but there's loads more that can be done and we heard so much about the different types of impact and the direct impact versus the systemic and I think on balance what we heard from a lot of both sets of panelists is it's really the systemic change that this is about we shouldn't just be thinking of the deal and the fact is a high-risk beard and you bring down the risk for the other investors and they come in which is sort of the easily understandable bit we heard so much about the different types of systemic change and Rob you really helped us think about this pioneer approach I think the difference between the two is so fundamental that you almost can't have this discussion without looking at one and then the other um and for a long time and development we've been doing that contribution or attribution and I think this is very very relevant to this sector because if you get your financial return it's a financial return on what you put in if you're a private equity investor you look at the social impact you don't tend to talk about the social impact of the bit you put in you about the social impact of the whole thing that comes back to a whole load more double counting if you're worried about double counting boy that's a classic and so in social impact you have to talk about contribution because this whole attribution you say well if I hadn't put my bit back in in 2006 and that other investors wouldn't have come in in 2010 and you get really bogged down and I think there's a lot of unraveling that hasn't been done there but we're definitely shifting I have to shift a contribution on attribution and we also heard about how much information is missing market information impact information they're great gaps and I do think basically it comes down to additionality and only it comes down to excess profits some people need home runs they worried that in the more impactful business they won't get home runs home runs are the big wins you get to compensate for your losses I'll think that's part of the market mechanism if you're additionality is there if you really are making a difference in what happens now the fact that someone gets good profits 10 years from now and that businesses scaling or that market is going fine if you can prove the additionality and that's where I really see this conversation having to go as the investors the donors the DF eyes work out what they're doing it really did happen not that long ago that I was told that financial people do not understand additionality schaller I saw your yacht your frown at that so and delighted we've talked a lot about dish nality today couple of ways that we have seen some of these problems being worked out I just want to share because I do think there's some practical progress I've been results director on the dividend packed programme that we heard about from Robin for Alice for the last three years and the week for Christmas we were sitting in CDC's offices trying to unravel some of these questions about the burden of M&E and what's the value of differed investment on the burden of M&E we've divided businesses up into those that have data because they need it and those that don't because they don't need it those that have it because they need it there's so much more they could often due to understand social impact including who is reached with just a bit of encouragement or maybe a bit of technical support but lots of the businesses operating the base of the pyramid it's very valuable data and they haven't been thinking about how to use it so there's a whole opportunity there you're right in the solar homes and with others those that don't have it there are improving tools for them to collect data relatively efficiently you know 5,000 pounds 20,000 pounds a week or tues work to give you something that is good enough understanding a lot more about some direct poverty in fact not systemic but we took the view that if there's more than that we require we don't want to make these businesses uncompetitive so we're going to fund the extra I'm sorry that sounds so simple you ask businesses to do a bit more do better with what they've got ad on something simple it's going to take a month or 5,000 and then the person that wants the information in this case at the end of a long chain is diff it funds the extra analysis but it's simple but it's not just common standard practice I do think that is one answer I mean we were looking at the question of how do we understand at the end of 15 or actually 18 years because this program is fantastic sits not three years guillotine it's got 18 years how do we understand the value to differed because the money goes from divid to cdc into the impact diffident packed fund dividend pack found in to fund managers from fund managers into businesses that engage at the base of the pyramid and the impact then goes to people advise the pyramid how'd you understand that and some people have used best charitable alternative acumen developed abacoa best charitable alternate option where you look at the impact that is delivered and say how much would it cost to deliver that impact through a charitable approach it's really interesting they actually decided not to pursue that and shame Tom isn't here to explain why there are all kinds of questions there because over what time frame hell pointing it through business is it is sustainable as you were just saying but i think is an interesting approach to consider the way we ended up was actually going to the other end of the chain saying at the end of 1518 years we will be able to understand something to do with the discount rate something to do with what patty calls the subsidy we'll be able to see what the kind of return is how that's different to a market return and we'll have to debate how much to adjust it for risk because these are hugely risky investments so actually you're a turd to be really high and then at the end of 15 to 18 years be able to look at what could if it have done differently with money now this conversation was only just the week before Christmas and it's talking about what will happen in 15 years time and there was real data so i think the point i'm saying is that there is progress there's some really interesting things happening and we've heard about so many of them today but it's a very long journey that we are on before we can get close to answering some of these questions with any real evidence so on a bad day I were thinking this space he'll there's no addition ality business is only going to reach people in the 40th to the 90th percentile let's go home let's leave them to it let's not use public months on the good day I think the scale of what is happening here if whether I don't really care whether it's a 500 time multiple or 5,000 time multiple the multiple is huge that's one thing that makes me positive the innovation is really high we've heard about innovation today and the innovation in the private sector is so high this is not the only answer clearly but it is going to be quite a significant answer and contribution to the SDGs and that's what I feel on a good day so I'll leave you to decide over lunch whether you're a bad day person or a good day person I really thank you I for putting this topic right on the agenda it's here to stay you'll be here for a long time I wish all of you good luck as you continue to have been say muddle through but carve your way through all this and thank you ODI for inviting us for lunch please go and enjoy
