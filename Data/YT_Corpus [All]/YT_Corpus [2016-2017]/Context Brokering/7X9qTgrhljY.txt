 bring my fam how are you that's nice I was wondering if you would like to go on it be a pict activity with me tomorrow we tell in line for like two hours every day so it's a things are getting pretty serious I personally am in favor of such a socio-economic relationship you are asking me to marry you good morning woodland hills good morning you see you all this morning dating is rough stuff would you agree to that oh man I never was any good at we're in a series on relationships and relatives and things of that sort so today we're going to be talking about dating and marriage we're going to see that the principles that make for good Kingdom dating also make for good Kingdom marriages so whether you're single or married I want you to be listening in on this and tuning in on what's going to be happening here so the title of this message this morning is say yes to arranged marriages I think they think we're kidding ain't no okay so hanging and you find out what we're about on this and i have with me this morning the lovely and highly esteemed world-renowned social psychologist dr. Christina Cleveland give her a hand for a lot of reasons one of which is that I haven't been single for a very very long time 32 years last I call so it we thought it'd be good to have somebody on stage actually knows what they're talking about as opposed to what Sherman's usually are like here with the nails church where they have me doing this so he may be good as this sort of a little introductory thing to find out Chris you know what is a memorable experience you've had recently you are single right I am but you are dating I was not really available you're single without available that's probably to get out there away to be a lot later um uh so I yeah any experience you'd like to share with us or would not like to share but I'm forcing you to share sure I'm not too long ago before I was started dating my boyfriend now I went on a date with this guy and he had recently read a book that talked a lot about how women need to be rescued and the point of being a man is rescuing a woman from I don't know what from a lack of a Y chromosome or something i'm not sure like a wet he was go save you yeah so anyways on our first date he started telling me that he felt like he was supposed to rescue me and that's what he was gonna do and i was the woman that he was gonna rescue and he kept saying it over and over and over again and i got tired of to him telling me that he was gonna rescue me and so i said if you do not stop talking about this i am gonna go on the offensive and someone's gonna need to rescue you from me and then he didn't ask me out again ok believe that i know intimidated a little bit all right i never was any good at dating I I would you know most people here know that I've had from the age of five line up this obsession with death I always want to talk about death and just so I and I never was good at small talk so the way I would avoid small talk on dates as I take him to a graveyard and that was like my way of getting to know people a lot of first dates she put the moves on him in the dark yeah yeah that the monster mash before your your time but yeah so I had a lot of first dates not so many second dates it's amazing that I ever got married when I come look look back on so we're looking at dating and and marriage in a kingdom framework we're going to be looking at all of this from a distinctly Kingdom perspective because it changes their everything if you weren't here for the first three of these messages i encourage you to go back and listen to them because it lays a foundation for its kind of a it build each message builds on the other so the paradigm looking at is this in the first century we is by way of review we we saw that the father defined the family the father had complete authority or the family everyone's allegiance was to the father and the family that was the primary allegiance the foundation of the whole social structure in the ancient world and the job of kids was to live in a way that brought honor to the father to carry out the Father's will and then to expand the father's family by getting married and having children everyone just sort of understood that's how it worked because the father had total authority over the family marriages were always the range by the father marriages were for the purpose of bringing on into the father and carrying out the Father's will and expanding the father's family and so he would arrange them sometimes Suns had veto power saying dad no way and depends on the relationship they had with the father sometimes they could say no to something that the father was arranging but daughters never did and first century Judaism and so father marriages were arranged for several purposes usually there was an economic factor involved as in many traditional cultures the the daughter was sold and so the father would sell the daughter to the highest bidder that's called a dowry of a bride price and and so it was defer the economic status of of the family sometimes the emerged to kind of further the social status of the family if if you had a daughter that somebody who is more wealthy or had a family in a higher social strata wanted to marry her well then it would be arranged for that reason so there's sociological financial political factors this the bottom line is that the father arranged the marriage as the father brokered the deal now things have changed a little bit I think and so to get a perspective on more recent times I turn over to my esteemed colleague so yes things are a little bit different nowadays we live in a Western individualistic culture and so our dads don't arrange our marriages we arrange them ourselves we get to broker our own deals and in general that sounds like a good idea but we also live in a really consumeristic society and so we're all about getting what we want when we want it how we want it and so I'm this sort of feeds off of what Greg talked about last week this idea that you know without the father being in our lives got our Father God began our lives we're often kind of operating out of a vacuum or out of a void and so we're just trying to consume anything we kind of see the world with hungry eyes looking for things that might fulfill us and then we apply this to the whole dating scenario too so we might look at people and think you know what can they do to fill the void in my life what can they do to make me feel complete how can they make my life awesome how can they be exactly the person that I want them to be when I need them to be that person for me and so as a result of that men and women are often treated like property so it's kind of similar to that the more historical ancient times because people are reduced to things that can that we can sort of move around in order to make our lives better um so some of the questions that people that I've heard or I've asked myself as I've dated people are like um how much money does he make or will she be able to maintain that figure for the rest of her life maybe we should go see what her mom looks like so we can get a sense of what she's gonna look like 30 years from now does his last name go well with my first name do you stuff like that deep very deep um does she satisfy my sexual needs even the weird ones is he a Jew cated enough um does she have a good sense of humor which i think is code for does she laugh at my jokes and so you know oftentimes we're out there consuming as we're dating I know when I was more of a consumer dater I'm not too long ago I was really trying to I was operating out of the vacuum in my soul I felt like I wasn't beautiful I needed some guy didn't really matter who it was any guy would do to tell me that I was beautiful over and over and over again and it was a little bit unrealistic because I was expecting a guy on a first date to like expressed his sort of irrational undying love for me and tell me that he needed my beauty in his life to survive and if I didn't get that on the first date then I was kind of like yeah he doesn't really meet my needs next you know I'm gonna move on um and so I've been a consumer data I've also been a target or prey of consumer dating and that's not really fun either I can think of a time when this one guy sort of said that he heard from God that we were supposed to start dating and maybe start moving towards marriage and so he called me up and I thought he was gonna ask me out on a date but what he actually did was kind of interview me um it's sort of a um I guess he was pre-screening me before he actually took me out on a date yeah I mean so he was asked he's kind of spent the first 20 minutes of our phone conversation outlining his five to ten year plan and then he asked me to specifically address the ways that I saw myself fitting into and sort of enhancing his plan and helping him move along towards lonely this plan no romantic this one yeah then he asked me whether um you know when I thought about gender roles and then I wasn't sure what he meant until he started talking about how he wanted me to home-school his children his children like these hypothetical children that we were supposed to have but they would be his and then he asked me if I would move into this commune with he and his friends and sort of like be his servant in concubine I mean he didn't use the terms but that sort of seemed to be the gist of it um in this whole time I was working on my dissertation I was busy doing my life and he never once asked me at all like hey what do you care about in life or who are you or you know what what's interesting to you so it's interesting because that's sort of like Christian consumer dating you know we kind of have an agenda and we want someone to fulfill our agenda to see to sort of add to whatever it is that we're doing in life and it might look a little more spiritual but it's still just consumer dating and and um so this consumeristic model really feeds off the idea of the the myth of romantic completeness that that Greg talked a lot about last week if I just find the right person who acts the way that I want them to and does what I need them to do then i will feel complete so if I think that you know sexual intimacy is going to make me feel complete then I might cross tons of physical boundaries i might plow through as many sexual partners as i need to in order to fill that in order to sense that fulfillment even if it's just for a fleeting moment or if I think that emotional intimacy is going to make me feel complete I might try to have what I call emotional one-night stands where you kind of go like really deep with one guy for like one night and bare your soul and maybe he bares his soul and you talk about your deepest desires and it seems like just for that moment you're the only two in the inner the universe only two people in the universe and then the next day it's kind of awkward because you're like I don't know his last name but I know like his greatest fears and it's just weird right so I think of those as emotional when I stands but that can sort of like make us think oh I'm fulfilling this need it doesn't matter whether I'm crossing emotional boundaries I'm getting what I need it doesn't matter what's happening with that other person or I might think that maybe I need some affirmation and some attention that's gonna fulfill me and so if I can find a trophy boyfriend or if I can find a trophy girlfriend who looks awesome and it's hot and everyone says whoa look at that person I can't believe you're with them they can draw attention to me and even if just for a moment i can find fulfillment in that i'm going to do that that's probably shall he married me I'm thinking oh definitely a trophy host definitely for sure you are trophy material could blame her family um so anyways you know the old historical approach um to relationship building was really consumer driven right women were sold off but the current approach is pretty consumer driven too so you don't really want to go back to the old model women were dehumanized that that wasn't a good thing we don't wanna go back to that but the current model is not exactly great either because in the end were consumers and we're kind of stuck in this bottomless pit the myth of romantic completion is in fact a myth we're just going to keep sinking deeper and deeper into this pit because it doesn't satisfy no that's I think true even after you're married in marriages if if people have this their core needs not met and that they're looking at the world through hungry eyes well they they just continue to use their spouses in different ways and maybe it's not quite as overt as it is in the marketplace when you're shopping for the best product but but it is still true after you've got the product and that's why there's sometimes continual conflict in marriages because people keep trying to make each other something that they're not to fill this this hole in the soul the thing that's distinct about the kingdom and everything is found founded on this and we talked about this in previous week's as well but the most distinctive thing that the kingdom does and the first thing that coming into the kingdom does is it fills that hole in the soul when we come into a relationship with Jesus Christ that vacuum that is there it's a god-given vacuum that we all need that you feel loved but unser passively loved and have unsurpassable Worth and I have unsurpassable significance that's why no you and being can possibly meet that need but it's there as a homing device to drive us to God and to become dependent on God and when we come to him there's a fullness we find that nothing in this world can give that no relationship and this work and give that no achievement this world can give it says in Colossians that in Christ the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in bodily form and that that in Christ we have been brought to fullness and the idea there is that that the fullness of all that makes God God is in Jesus Christ and we come into the kingdom we're incorporated into Jesus Christ which means we participate in that fullness he God shares his life with us and so as we come in same way that father's given and mothers give biological life to their children so also when we come into the kingdom we are given that the life of the Father Abba pours his life into us his spirit unto us is fullness in to us and so there is within us it will tap into it which we often don't and but it will tap into it and not be caught in the lies in our head about what we're not we tap into that there is Jesus says a river of living water praise God that flows out of us it just gushes out of us and and so that means you don't need to be doing life with this desperation where you're looking at world through hungry eyes and you're dating through hungry eyes and you're being married through hungry eyes no no now now we can live life out of a center of celebration rather than out of a center of desperation and it changes everything now it's also true that even though we are our core needs can only be met in a relationship with Christ our core identity and significance and security all that can only be given through through a relationship with Christ but it still is the case that were made in the image of the triune God and so we're made for relationships we talked about this last week we only reflect the way god made us when we are in deep committed loving relationships with other that's why it says in Genesis that's not good for a man to be alone or woman hey what's not good for a woman of you oh man or woman you're right it's not good for any human being to be alone I'm going with a tniv translation but see you don't need to be married to do that we all need deep committed loving fulfilling relationships but not all are called to be married we talked about that last week but if a person isn't given the gift of being single then it's going to be natural for them to want to reflect the image of God by entering into a marriage relationship so it's okay to want to be married but we shouldn't need to be married to be fully alive and to feel full and to feel complete where our life is is only found in Jesus Christ which really changes the purpose for dating and also the purpose for marriage because if the purpose isn't to is it to me the innermost needs well then what is the purpose and from a kingdom perspective the purpose is not to meet those inner most needs but rather the purpose is to carry out Ava's will it's to reflect the beauty of God the image of God by carrying out Ava's will and so just like in the first century the earthly father mayor would arrange the marriages to further out further his purposes so also in the kingdom were to be seeking to have our abba father arranged our marriages so that we can carry out his purpose in our relationships and in our dating and in our marriages so that leaves the question then what is the purpose of marriage according to abba father and Christina and I put our heads together and boil it down to three basic things the first one is that marries reflect the image of God to the tri-unity of God the love of God in a unique way all relationships reflect the tri-unity of god but God by his own design made it so that marriage does it in a distinct way at in a superior wave it just in a different way and some are called to enter into this there's something about the one flesh relationship and the sexual intimacy that goes with the one flesh relationship that uniquely puts on display the unity of God and the love of God sexual union is the sign of the Covenant and that's only allowed in God God's will in the context of marriage and so when two couples come together out of fullness it doesn't work if you come out of emptiness but if you come out of fullness and come together and share that fullness and share that intimacy and share that sexual union you're putting on display the beauty of the triune God and that is intended and of itself that's one of his purposes for marriage another thing that's really cool about marriage is that it can often lead to character refinement life in Christ always leads the character a fine man okay I go yeah you know life with Christ is all about character refinement I mean becoming more conformed to to Christ and so sometimes life isn't easy because the point is for us to be more like Christ and that's not always pleasant so if you feel called to marriage then God's gonna use marriage to to conform you to himself which might mean that marriage is not always going to be pleasant and I think that's hard to kind of get your mind around if you're stuck in the consumer mindset of dating because you're just thinking well I'm only going to get married if it makes me happier if it doesn't make me happier than forget about it that's the more consumer mindset but if we have more of a kingdom mindset towards marriage and dating we can think well I'm going to get married because this is what Ava's calling me to do and that's going to make me more like him so I think this really changes the way that we date if I'm a consumer dater and I'm in a relationship and there's some sort of incompatibility that arises some sort of conflict I might be really tempted to bail on the relationship because it's not fun it's not adding more awesomeness to my life in that moment but if I have more of a kingdom mindset as I'm approaching dating I can think well maybe God's trying to do something to my heart and my character in the midst of this conflict or this incompatibility so case in point my dad often says that he's really glad that he married my mom before he got a chance to know her because if he had gotten to know her better he never would have married her and the reason why you said that is because you know he now understands that you know she's the best thing that ever happened to him but they got married young and they got married fast and he didn't realize that they were incompatible in some really significant ways that she has a different perspective than him that she has some idiosyncrasies that um you know that she's she's imperfect in ways that maybe he would want her to be perfect because he was kind of looking at her from a consumer standpoint you know I need someone to be exactly who I want them to be all the time when they he found himself married to her you sort of stuck in in he was just like okay well I'm gonna go with it and it turns out that God was able to refine his character he now realizes that her perspective has actually made him better her her idiosyncrasies hurt her so called imperfections have actually helped him to see the world in a different way and to become more like Christ so now 33 years later they're happily married he's way more awesome than he ever was before and I give a lot of credit to my mom for that because she you know it says in Scripture iron sharpens iron you know so I give credit to my mom I give some credit to god it's great iron sharpens iron I usurp my wife sharpened husband's strong ones yeah there you go um but you might want to you know think about not married couples here and you know your anniversary or something it's not really a good line to say you know I just thank God that if I had known you I never would have married you I thank you that they keep that part to yourself now not the best romantic allure I think my dad told me about that but he's never told her yeah yeah I don't know if I it's a good idea I'm just saying it's just so he knows what to say but it is true it is true and in marriages as well I mean um Mary Mary's is you know one of God's great ideas for character refinement I've often told people you know we often go into marriages think it's gonna make us happier and I think in a long run it will but God's plan is to say I can really I can use this to refine characters and and and bring them into conformity with with Christ and so again in in de in a consumer model people often bail on marriages this isn't making me happy but in a kingdom perspective that's not the point it may not be making you happy right now but it is building your character and so stay in there I guess with the rare exceptions where there's abuse going on her unfaithfulness but otherwise you stay in there and let God do is refining work okay a third way a third purpose like that Abba Father has for marriage is that he wants a couple the function is sort of a dynamic duo for the kingdom when Abba Father sees that there's two individuals who aren't called to be single and when he sees that they could do more for the kingdom to further his reign together than they could do individually well then God will start to work to arrange that marriage and bringing these two together it's like an explosive dynamite thing you get together and there's just you know the sum is more than the parts and so it may be that the duo is there to to just further Ava's family by by having children or by adopting children that's one of the purposes may be that the duel is there to further the Ava's family through evangelism and buy a building bridges with unbelievers and inviting them into their homes it certainly is the case that the dynamic duo that is there for some kinds of ministry to work together in ministry that that furthers the kingdom whatever that ministry and maybe Shelley and I I think make a very good dynamic duo show you is my wife and the truth of the matter is that i could not at all be doing what i do if i did not if I was not in partnership with her so for a pro second day I just kind of scene in operation I mean for example she's the brains behind the operation she's a total brains behind the operation it's a I can't organize a drawer I am just uh you know just frazzled my head's always in the cloud yesterday I made a point we had a time where she and I were gonna get together at three-thirty here in the office to go over our material and I forgot that I had already booked that time because I didn't go through shell easy even friends have to go through Shelley to make appointments cuz I will forget them or double booked or whatever i'm as an organizational train wreck but she's there and we complement each other like this she runs my life and i appreciate that i love that we have very different gifts and very different personalities and that's the iron sharpening iron thing sometimes I kiss is very very different but if you can work through that there's a couple of maturity that is there and she's also just a constant source of encouragement and spiritual insight she sees stuff that I would never see and and so God uses her to grow me and I got used me to grow her and it's a team thing we work together with Providence ministries to help kids in Haiti and we work together to help disabled people in this in a housing complex so this is a lot of ways that God uses us and and and I think we wouldn't be able to do individually what we do for the kingdom what we do together is a dynamic dual and and for married folks who are here you know it may be the case that when you got married the last thing you were thinking about was the kingdom probably most people who get married do so with a consumer model and so you're saying yourself gosh I wish I would have known then what I know now but see doesn't matter you are married and so it's Ava's will that you're married and so now you say Ava how would you arrange our marriage now that is here and let them bring a purpose to it and so there is a purpose for every Kingdom marriage that goes beyond just the family just this nuclear family idea that we have it goes beyond just you and your kids it's a purpose about furthering the kingdom in some way and so I really encourage married couple married couples to sit down say you know what but it's got calling us to do together and and furthers kingdom in that way amen okay now let's get really practical ah Christina what practical difference does this kingdom paradigm make and how people go about entering into marriages and then applying that to marriage is what practical difference does it make well I think that big huge difference is that rather than just going out and looking for someone based on the criteria that you've set for yourself you ask God hey who do you want me to date who do you think I should consider marrying so I mean I think it's important to think about issues of compatibility whether you're attracted to that person of course I mean those issues are important but I think our biggest question our biggest sort of issues should be Abba Father who do you want me to marry do you want me to marry this person or that person we uh dr. person last night who said that a lot of issues compatibility and attraction and stuff are you know play a part in this so we have to be willing to let avos father call us to people that maybe we're not attracted to initially and she talked about how it was really interesting he had no attraction for the guy whatsoever but she had a distinct impression that God was saying marry that person it was until she was walking down the aisle and all of a sudden she started feeling in love with this person which was a very very good thing okay so how do you go about knowing all the Father's will um well what I have one thing that I think it's hard is it's hard to know whether it's possible that God is calling you into a missional marriage relationship if you don't have a personal sense of mission so I think the first thing to do if you're dating or you're single is to think gosh god what do you want me to do what like I know what is your plan for me separate from everybody else any other relationship what are you calling me to do I think that often times especially Christian women think that you know their mission for life is going to come when a guy comes into their life and tells them what their mission is going to be your they just sort of co-opted his mission but I think that God wants to hat wants to give us each a personal mission and the person that he brings into our life will complement that mission but they certainly aren't going to entirely define the mission so I encourage people seek God's will for your life ask him what you want me to do now how do you want me to impact the kingdom now and that might evolve over time but as soon as you get any sense of that mission or that or his will for your life i would say jump right in start serving start moving in that direction you know apply to grad school do whatever it is that you think God's calling to do and move in that direction so don't wait until you're married to start making big impacts in the kingdom and taking it really seriously actually but I'd also say to that when when you do start getting into a relationship to bring that person alongside you in your missions and try to figure out ways that God wants you to serve together for the kingdom so I would say don't wait to get married to be the dynamic duo even as it in a dating relationship you can be a dynamic duo even if that dating relationship doesn't last forever I know my boyfriend and I spent a lot of time asking God praying hey how do you want us to impact the kingdom our church our world now and so we're really involved in ministry together and it's really fun and it's great because I think sometimes dating can be really artificial it's not as much like marriage as we I think it is because you're usually like putting in your like you usually smell good and you like usually put forth your best um you know foot in your business over yeah you know and like you're always in a good mood when you're around each other and that brush exactly it's really different than marriage where it was just gross all the time yeah so I think um you know the more that you can serve together and see each other when maybe you're tired or you're stressed out or when you're tired of giving and serving but you're still doing it anyway then that can give you some insight into whether gods bringing you together I think it's that's so important the way we've set up dating in a culture is based on a consumer model you go out and you try the product really that's what they're doing is like you know testing the product and it's a total official kind of situation yeah you're all dressed up you look good you smell good here's done just right but you started so start serving together I think that's is brilliant and that's the best way I think to discern okay are we a dynamic duo because maybe you know you may go to movies really nice and in whatever but when you get together start serving maybe it's like start rubbing each other wrong and now your discerning that we're not a dynamic duo so we'll just be friends and and move on that's good several months ago I did a series undiscerning God's will and one of the things I talked about there in discerning god's which i think is foundational is for folks to was is rooted in psalms 37 where the psalmist says take delight in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart Ellen what I take that to mean is that if our delight is in the Lord our sense of fullness of life our completeness is found in the Lord then the desires that are on our heart will be the ones that he put there he'll give us the desires of our heart and so what I just need to do is to get in touch with those desires whether there are core desires so I increase people there in a time of prayer to just sort of envision a future with regard to whatever possibilities are before them when there's any major decision in dating its whether I should date this person or not it's really interesting that Christina there said be doing this before you even go out on a date I should do it should I date this person because you shouldn't be doing that unless there's at least the possibility that Abba Father is calling you to enter into a marriage with them so you consider that should I marry them or not or but it can't apply to anything about about you're going to make or other friendships that you're going to be involved in our ministries are going to be involved in and so I encourage people to offer up their imagination to the Lord in a state of prayer and just ask the Holy Spirit to play out a future if you say yes to this option what would that look like if you say yes to that option what will it look like and as you do that over a period of time I just look at which one of those options gives you a sense of congruent or peace or rightness on the inside and all other things being equal that's the one that most likely is as other father's will he's saying yes to that yes i agree i think that it's so great to ask god to like you know take over our imagination and give us some insight into what he's calling us to do i also think that it's good to keep in mind that god is relational and that pretty much everything that he does is is through community and so he can speak to us through community too so I think you know seek his will individually and then also call call some people and asked him to like seek God with you alongside you and discern God's will for you and for your relationship so I would say involve a community of people and then also involve them just so that they can kind of track with you and see if you're still getting your fullness from Christ or if you're starting to get your fullness from the relationship because I think that's an easy temptation when you're dating I know I meet with some women who I trust and they kind of know what questions to ask me and things that are you know just kind of going on in my life and then they can make make sure that I'm just sort of focused on the right things at the time so that's something I think huge community accountability through that I also think it's just good to like keep everything in the open kind of have a covenant about openness I have a couple of rules that i just used to help me sort of stay accountable and just um out of darkness and so one is i just i try to i always leave my boyfriend's house by midnight at the latest and I just probably kind of jokingly talk about how you know nothing good ever happens after midnight because the Holy Spirit goes to sleep which of course we know the Holy Spirit doesn't really go to sleep but you know just this idea that you know it's probably good to just go our separate ways and put on a song but there's a few people after midnight you don't let it all hang out yeah sixties is not after me it is your band thing that you know we don't but with hash I know I shouldn't turn the lyrics to reflect your truth after midnight nothing good happens holy spirit good yes we run so that's one thing another thing is I'm we are really big on bringing everything into the light we meaning my boyfriend and I so um Satan is that Prince of Darkness absolutely when things are secret when things are hidden that's when he can we were just inviting him to come in and wreak havoc in your life and make temptation way harder than it needs to be and so we're really big on just bringing everything in the light we talked very candidly with our parents with our past or with sort of our pastors and spiritual parents with accountability partners we kind of have this understanding that anything that happens in our relationship is fair game to be told to really anyone that we trust your burger um that's really helpful so good that a principle applies to marriage with couples I would I would encourage you to have this rule that you'd never keep any secrets from one another unless it's a good secret that you going to surprise the person with our anniversary or something but you know the minute we the minute we do anything a secret it's like putting a you know cupping our hands over our eyes there's darkness there and and like Christina said the Prince of Darkness is called the Prince of Darkness because he's the Prince of Darkness he needs darkness to operate darkness fuels him secrecy hiddenness nothing good comes after midnight and and and and nothing good comes when it that's because you're closing the doors and and you're keeping things in secrets so I encourage you to have a commitment to one another to speak truth to one another if there's stuff that's going on in your lives that you can't tell your spouse then there probably is stuff that shouldn't be going on all other things being equal it keep an open policy on this it's also true for married couples that they need to be embedded in broader communities what's true for the individual is true for married couples and we need people that we are committed to that we speak truth to that speak truth to us there are unlike in a dating relationship there is in certain things in a marriage that don't need to be shared with anybody else that's the privilege of the marriage covenant but outside of that we needed to have who have we need extra eyes looking into our life and if we're going to be a dynamic duo that means you're going to have to swim upstream in the culture because we manifest the values of the kingdom which fundamentally contradict the values of the world and the thing is is we are such creatures of conformity that if we don't have people around us a broader community that is speaking into our life we will be conforming in ways we don't even notice our lives are just going to be little you know it will just be looking like standard America for you Americans with a little bit of Christian flavoring on it but they're not gonna be fundamentally kingdom we need other people around us and and who can notice when we're starting to go astray with notice we're starting to conform the culture knowest winner when our spending doesn't line up with our values when we're maybe not as spending enough time with our kids or our spouse or million other things and so so we all need community this idea of the new killer family kind of isolated from everybody else is simply extrapolation of this of the individualism that runs rampant in our culture and it's just like the individual family it's all self-contained and that is just it's not double and it's a prescription for disaster we're meant to be part of a broader community III wanna start heading down the runway here but bringing this to a close by by addressing one other issue into this as we're saying you know we were saying say yes to arrange marriages in other words let God arrange the your marriage I know that there are going to be people hearing this may be a lot of people who are going to be saying look at Ivan asking God to arrange a marriage for me for ten years and nothing has happened maybe 20 years maybe 30 years and and maybe there's even a lil bit of anger on that because you don't feel called to being single a part of you wants to be married and yet you've been praying and yet nothing has happened and then you know folks will come around you and give you these cliches about how well you know God's timing is always the right timing or must not be God's will for you to be married or or or maybe not praying enough or you know not fasting enough or maybe guys just trying to teach you something and none of those are of any help and then there are folks who have maybe felt led they felt like God was saying yes to a relationship and they get into that relationship and then it turns out to be terrible well there's a dating relationship or maybe they actually got married in a turn out to be terrible there's unfaithfulness and abuse and other things and these folks can manage God saying thanks a lot nice job arranging things you know this is you were setting me up for this this is the best you could do and there can be a lot of anger and a lot of hurt around that and to that I just say this it's always important to remember that people have free will people have free will and so to say that God arrangers thinks it does not mean at least we don't mean that God's controlling everything or going to manipulate people to bring them into a relationship oh my god ever does that people are free and God and watch them to be free because without the potential of freedom they don't have a capacity to love or the capacity not to love when we say gada ranges things what we mean by that is this that if we're listening to him and seeking his will he will lead us in certain directions that will be conducive to having a kingdom marriage and he'll be influencing things he influences he just never courses he'll be influencing to try to bring together a couple that will be a dynamic duo for the kingdom but because the world's populated with free agents it means that you can be seeking God to arrange your marriage it doesn't mean it's going to happen and even if it does happen it doesn't mean that's goodness there's no guarantee that's going to go right because people change of their own free will and so so those who are frustrated because you've been praying to for to find a spouse and it hasn't happened or or you're hurt because of a relationship that backfired or maybe you're now in a marriage that that you feel is just completely sucky and and and it's not at all what you had planned I just encourage you whatever else you do don't blame God don't blame god it's so sad that when we're in situations where we need God the most when life is at a suckiest we need God the most but many people get mad at God for the suckiness thinking that he was the one arranging it as we push God away now I encourage you to just when you're in a state of frustration and pain like that don't blame God rather go to God go to God Lena and God he's always on your side he's always good god is good all the time all the time god is good life is not life is not dating often isn't marriage often isn't but God is and and and so use the pain of your situation to drive you closer to Christ to get all your life of Christ so even though you may be frustrated because you're not married at least don't be operating out of the center of desperation is what you want to be married yeah that there's a pain in that but but be operating out of a center fullness be a complete human being whether you ever get married or not and then I encourage folks to be cultivating loving friendships whether you're married or not romance is nice but you don't need to have fulfilling wonderful friendships that means other human needs in our life so be seeking God don't push him away embrace him also because there are lots of other variables that influence things besides God's well I think it's really important for single people to be okay with like putting effort into looking for a potential spouse I think we often think oh well I'm gonna let all the father arranged things and so we just sit on our butts and just hope that God like plop someone in our laps which doesn't really make sense because he's abba father wants to partner with us and some of the cool things that he's doing in our lives and in the kingdom and so I think it's important for single people to be seeking his will like what do you want me to do what part do you want me to play in bringing this potential spouse into my life or drawing closer to that person so I think just asking God hey what do you want to do you want me to start volunteering somewhere do you want me to move somewhere else do you want me to start looking online you know just asking God and being willing to participate in the process is really important Thank I'm sorry cool so inside the marriage stork in on the merit the marriage starts some people are like oh god I just trust you to bring me a saucy I think is that same marriage stork is gonna come along with stroke with babies you're getting the connection I don't know if you got and just dropping all the spouse in the lab there's mr. or mrs. right right there not mrs. right no all right if its mythic if some mrs. then that's not right yeah miss right I miss right yeah as I get it does more like that okay so in summary I widow with four points that we think with more boards we're taking away from google okay so number one whether you're single or married get all your life from Christ okay number two whether you're single or married seek first the kingdom of God so if you're single and you're dating date in order to further office office purposes if you're married it's being married in order to further up office purposes be the dynamic duo um number three whether you're single or married do it in community with other people and number four i understands before something whether you're married or food that we doing don't blame God for the succulence of life God is always good he's always working things for our good work with God to bring the suck out of life and transform it with good things yes amen that's nice he said or maybe I said you say I uh bring the suck this sucked out of the suckiness yeah that God sucks to suck out of suckiness and transform the suckiness into something less sucky yeah go suck your second second yeah got his game we're very poetic you know her all right what I'm lame in a minute get something crit got all right I'm going to close in prayer and as I do i want to invite the pro teams to come forward and if you're here and have any need whatsoever that you would like to have prayed for whether it's about dating or marriage or something completely different I encourage you to come and get prayer and everything you share up here will be held in complete confidence Lord we just thank you for being our Abba Father we think you got for being a guy who fills us with fullness of life help us guide to always be tapping into that infinite reservoir of life and living out of that fullness rather than emptiness father we pray for those who are in dating relationships that you would God be working in their hearts and lives to make them a kingdom thing and protect them from the evil one who always would try to use something beautiful for evil purposes and God is helping to bring that relationship that potential relationship in line with you and we pray for the marriages here god I pray that your spirit be working in each couple to give them a complete openness towards one another and to be embedded in a community with with whom they can be open and to be building those marriages to be Kingdom marriages so that they can wherever they're at now they're moving in the direction of becoming a dynamic duo for the kingdom of God in Jesus name we pray and all of God's children said amen god bless you guys go and build the kingdom
