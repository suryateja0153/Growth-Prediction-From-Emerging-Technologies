 we know very much from recent research that life courses of folks are in part related to the neighborhoods that they work in and so while we're talking about community change we're talking about population level change we know that these links need to be made and I'm very excited to introduce this panel to you because we've heard a little bit about the role of philanthropy and so forth and the role of leaders in helping to activate networks of opportunity but this this particular panel has a lot of experience in doing this activating networks of opportunity either with respect to markets or with respect to bringing public resources that had been absent and sometimes had left areas back to areas and so I think we're going to see a lot of interesting examples there but I know that our panelists are not going to be coming to us with quote unquote the answers for everything that they've been trying to work at but they have been working in these communities and have seen successes and also seen what challenges remain so I'm very excited to go ahead and introduce them I'm going ahead go ahead and just read their their BIOS and somewhat of alphabetical order saving our moderator and person who's going to be framing the discussion for us at the last so I'm going to start with David Edwards so he has a really deep and diverse out background in both public private and nonprofit sectors he's worked on innovative initiatives addressing some of the greatest challenges facing our cities so he's currently CEO of purpose-built communities and he's charged with among other things replicating this model across the country to deliver transformative outcomes for families and children prior to joining purpose-built communities David was the global offerings manager for IBM Smarter Cities program and in that role he was responsible for developing innovative solutions to critical issues facing municipal and regional governments around the world and forsake giving balance to the breast of the panelists I'm not going to list any more of the past accomplishments and I would also you know try to do the same thing for all of our panelists here so dr. Tony heightened is is right here he is currently senior vice president of healthy communities at the California Endowment for those of us in California we know much about the endowment in in particular this this initiative is a ten year built initiative looking to transform communities prior to working at the endowment dr. item served as the director and County Health Officer for alameda county's public health department and in that role he oversaw the creation of an innovative public health practice which was designed to eliminate health disparities by tackling root causes and he had many other private sector careers before that and what our third panelist who's worked in the area of comprehensive community initiative certainly needs no introduction in the price school that's Robert price he started his education in government at Pomona College and you spent his entire career in retailing he and his father soul price co-founded the price Club membership warehouses he's most recently the founder and chairman of the board of pricesmart a warehouse club chain operating in Latin America he importantly serves as the president of the price family charitable fund and price philanthropies foundations in in San Diego that was founded by his father sold price and he lives in in San Diego currently and again the city heights community is represented around you here today finally our moderator in person who's going to provide framing discussion for this panel is sahlan jerbear geesh he is currently appointed by secretary Shaun Donovan has heads or actually it's not so I'm Donovan anymore but he is currently serving as HUDs deputy assistant secretary of office of international and philanthropic innovation we had a discussion at lunch about why domestic agency HUD is looking internationally and I I think we both agreed that maybe we can learn things across the world that can help for those agencies that might be focused domestically so in that role is really tasked with leading innovation and engaging philanthropic and cross-sector partnerships internationally and domestically to harnish and apply breast practice is programs and policies for the benefits of our communities and aligning our common efforts with that sullen let me invite you to provide some framing comments for our panel thank you it's great to be not only on this panel but in this conversation today and we were having numbers of sidebar we were listening to the panelists but if you're like me you have numbers of different epiphanies during the course of conversations and one of the epiphanies actually is going to lead me to do a little bit of a at least an icebreaker of this room to get a sense of who's in the room with us how many folks actually in the room are representatives or we call yourself a representative of the public sector raise your hand private sector philanthropic sector nonprofit sector someone who doesn't know what sector there in academic we got some academics here and anybody in the audience this is the real key here who actually has spent time across multiple sectors okay there's a reason why I'm asking this I've spent a good part of today thinking and maybe you guys have had this as well thinking about who else that I work with should be in this room with me having exposures to the ideas that we've been talking about and that struck me a lot today and it probably has struck many of you when Gary mentioned even at the start of the day the priority and prioritizing place conference that was the last time that I was actually out here and had a chance to share some reflections on place-based activity and comprehensive Community Change and I had mentioned then and it will get interspersed I think during the course of our panel conversation today about what I've called the kind of five hours of where we where you often see kind of lessons to be learned in comprehensive Community Change it's not as though they're the only five hours it's an organizing frame work for me I think there are lots of lessons we've learned about roles about responsibilities about the resources that are required in this work about results and Gary will remember when I talked about risk and who shares in the risk or who takes on more of the risks I think there are a lot of lessons across those areas that we have to think about let me add to those five hours by talking about some at least initial reflections and framing on activating markets for social change related to comprehensive community change efforts I believe and I hope we'll start today in this conversation by asking ourselves in comprehensive Community Change what does success look like and perhaps as importantly I think we have to ask ourselves why why things are happening probably with more expectation of rigor why does the change we seek to make for people in places sometimes not often but sometimes not happen with the persistence and frequency across the range of outcomes we seek why seemingly our distressed neighborhoods so difficult to turn around with benefits that accrue to all of the residents why with all of the additional layers of comprehensiveness that we add on with the hopes that there will be alignment and leverage that happens do models sometimes maybe not always become more expensive with fewer efficiencies that appear to be gained is comprehensiveness and inherently more risky and more costly approach to solving problems and why is comprehensiveness so hard and is it required for transformation so I may have some explanations rather than answers and they may be predicated and I'll admit this freely on combinations of evidence and beliefs depending upon the results ought i think the experience with comprehensive community change in the united states is mixed you're going to hear about some exceptions today but i think it's a mixed story we do have and can point to them and you'll hear from our panelists today we do have good results in housing and access to quality amenities depending on the model and the focus we have mixed results on other outcome areas if sometimes housing was the primary focus sometimes mixed results on schools and jobs mixed results on all residents partaking in neighborhood change mixed results sometimes even poor results on work divorce development outcomes and jobs mixed to poor results on whether particularly in the mixed em income development frame whether mix in the neighborhood is actually happening explanations a couple I think built environment for those of us who've been in the housing infrastructure and Community Development change while complicated i think sometimes it's much easier to affect than social and economic change I think persistence and pernicious effects of race and other barriers are hard to overcome and we heard that from Michael and from others this morning we heard in the last panel and other panels the importance of thinking at the appropriate level of scale and I think sometimes we are working at the wrong scale for the magnitude of change we seek housing transportation jobs are not often and almost completely not at neighborhood scale that often at cross jurisdictional and regional scale we heard Myron this morning talk about how we have so much government governance fragmentation it appears to be our chosen model in the United States of how we solve problems we fragment we have not I don't think yet constructed models for shared account abilities and interests across jurisdictional lines there are key values essential for progress that I worry are going in the opposite direction I'm going to end in an optimistic way by the way if you're bummed trust Trust is declining we've talked about that isolation and segregation across cultural groups and ideology is increasing the erosion and opting out of what is public and the inherent value sometimes placed on what is private in daily life appears to be happening more and more so with all those challenges why am I encouraged I think increasingly we are aligning the scope and scale of our challenges with the scope and scale of approaches there is so much more silo busting cross-disciplinary collective impact oriented work that is happening we see that and we have representatives here from the promise zone here in LA with sustainable communities with promise neighborhoods and choice neighborhoods with strong cities strong communities efforts we are building much more cross sector capacity to execute Michael talked about the Promise Neighborhoods Institute the sustainable communities Learning Network living cities integration initiative and so many more we are developing more financial tools that help us leverage comprehensive Community Change better the capital absorption framework pay for success in social impact bonds for those who have been following and here in LA know about the performance partnership pilot there's stronger evidence emerging on approaches that work timely that this week we have another release of results from Raj Chetty and the team if you've seen that we've seen the importance of place for regional housing mobility and in this week on life expectancy for the work on homelessness that the heath brothers in the switch framework gave us for hotspot approaches for purpose built in eastlake there are more communities of practice being created to foster shared learning across sectors the hundred thousand opportunities initiative that Aspen and the foundation strategy group and others are building and I think we are understanding more and more about the effects of gentrification and displacement how to deal with preservation housing production and the balanced approaches I think we know much more as has been said earlier than sometimes we do and I hope as we get into our conversation today with those framing remarks you're going to hear from knowers and doers folks in the business of changing the life trajectories and as I take my seat i'm going to start probably with tony to give you the opportunity to give an overview for the California Endowment Tony on comprehensive Community Change why you all the California Endowment arrived at that and in particular what you've been the most proud of and we'll go down the line with just opening overviews of remarks from our panelists first of all that was really interesting can I have a copy that sure I'm pretty good you have any really depressed you're welcome but you picked me up two words yeah they're so hopefully some of you know about the California some of our partners are in this room but what we've been trying to do we're a health foundation obviously and we define health pretty broadly and one of these sort of underpinnings of our work in building healthy communities is this understanding that basically your zip code is a more important predictor of your health and your longevity than your genetic code and and so the question for us became you know what does that mean and and and why is that the case and how do we decouple essentially these environmental influences that are shaping and constraining people's ability to pursue healthy opportunities from their health we want to essentially figure out what is it we can do kind of at the environmental level to essentially enhance the likelihood that low-income children and families can pursue healthy trajectories and you know the data for which you know all of this of work sort of owes its basic kind of consciousness is is data that looks at the entire state of California at the zip code and down to the census tract level and shows that their life expectancy differences of you know 25 some cases 30 years in the same city between neighborhoods and and that's just it's you've got to kind of put your brain in sort of a different setting to understand what that means when you can move you know a mile and a half and go from a community with a life expectancy of 88 to one that has a life expectancy of 60 or 62 in the same city and so our argument has been and we're gambling a billion dollars on it that there are things that we can do to try to reshape those environments that are conducive to enhancing the likelihood that people will be able to pursue healthy lives and our gamble is also that we're going to try to do this in 14 low-income communities across California over a decade without investing a nickel and health care and and so this is a pure experiment in investing in the so-called social determinants of health and we're halfway through and we have some results which I can talk about later well I wanted to begin by thanking professor painter and Dean not and Richard parks for organizing this conference which is great and thanking all of you for being here and thanking the California Endowment for being a partner in City Heights one of the 14 communities that you partner in which have been a wonderful partner be my background is in retailing but probably as satisfying as that has been the last 20 years of work in City Heights has been equally as satisfying and I'm really an optimist and the reason I'm an optimist is because of the people that I've met in City Heights especially the young people who are doing amazing things mostly because of themselves not necessarily so much because what we and other not-for-profits have done but because the resilience of young people when they're given half a chance is just remarkable and I see it every day and it's inspirational our work in City Heights has been City Heights has about 70,000 people it's an immigrant community primarily and a fair number of non documented people who live in the community and our work has really been focused on youth and trying to create as much opportunity for youth so that they the young people whose parents worked very very hard many of them don't speak English and have come here because of persecution or other hardships that they've suffered in other countries so that their children can do well and I know from very personal experience how hard these family these parents of these children worked in order for their children to have a better life for themselves so our job is what we're trying to do is to provide as much social service support mentoring and not-for-profit agencies in the community to serve the community and we what I think probably one of the things we've done best there is that we've been a catalyst because we invested first almost like a venture capitalist and we we were prepared to put our money into the community and what's happened since then is that many many other investors have come into the community to provide really important services to the particular to youth but to all parts of the community so that's our story Robert said he was an optimist he he pulled our table before we came up here asking who around the table were optimistic about the future and I think we all said yes although I think we all had different reasons for being I'm not sure about the federal government how much optimistic you guys aren't really allowed to be optimistic comment no sorry but the but one of the things that Tony just said which is one of the reasons why we're optimistic of purpose but communities is this notion of how important places in solving some of these problems purpose-built communities has been around now for about five years our mission is to break the cycle of intergenerational urban poverty by creating channels of opportunity for low-income people to live in healthy neighborhoods and we do that by providing free consulting services to local leaders interested in implementing our model for neighborhood revitalization this is a model that was developed in eastlake Atlanta starting about 20 years ago and this model has five components we work in very defined neighborhoods usually in around 55 to 15,000 residents range these are highly distressed neighborhoods we facilitate three major programmatic interventions mixed income housing crave a college education and community wellness and we do this through our the fifth in the key component of our model which is a privately private sector-led community quarterback organization we have 14 projects up and running around the country today everywhere from Oakland to Orlando and we have another 30 or so in development and our theory of change is simply that all of the outcomes that we worry about whether they be health outcomes educational outcomes earnings and productivity outcomes public safety outcomes they're all a consequence of these conditions it needs to stress neighborhoods and that if we can transform these neighborhoods into healthy neighborhoods we can directly improve those outcomes since that's that's my elevator speech and it just got the lobby we talked earlier about in the opening framing gentlemen about success and I'd be curious maybe even down the line Tony if you want to just when years ago the California Endowment set itself out and Robert with what you were doing in City Heights and obviously with purpose built on defining success how do you guys think about what success looks like for you and what are you honing in on in all of the models Tony and then we'll go down the line yeah so that's the question get I get asked you know basically six seven times a week usually asking myself in the mirror but so when we started out you were again we're Health Foundation and you know some of us are sort of you know a little bit more traditional health people so we we kind of you know we're looking at things like obesity and health insurance enrollment levels we looked at violent crime we looked at school attendance these were the four big results that we had set out for ourselves and building healthy communities when we started and one of the things that we quickly discovered was that our communities had different ideas about what success looked like and so we were challenged very early on as I said we're about halfway through when we presented sort of or framework for what we thought success looked like our community said yeah we think that those things are important but in fact you've defined them in the traditional kind of academic way which is in a deficit frame and you also haven't really asked us what we think is important and some of the things our community said were important where things like the school to Prison Pipeline immigration reform a lot of issues around land use gentrification and essentially displacement and so we had to kind of regroup and start thinking about okay so our theory of change is really that everything we do we will do in partnership with our community leaders and if we're true to that theory we actually have to rethink what success looks like and negotiate this with our partners in an ongoing way and that's what we ultimately decided to do which was to engage in this dialectic with our community partners to try to find truth and try to find you know essentially a prioritized agenda that was shared between us and our community and we've come to that and part of the process of doing that you start to realize that this effort is the fundamental driver of the kind of change we want to see happen our is political our goal is to actually build social political economic power and a critical mass of people living in our 14 community so that they can actually engage and hold systems accountable for more equitable outcomes and and the endowment is not apologetic about the fact that those are key things that you're driving and to be to be a foundation actually being explicit about built building political powers a we've talked about before is an interesting dynamic but please well it's just that it's the recognition that when you look at how these communities were created I mean they're not natural I mean they're the result of decisions or the absence of policy in the face of abject need so why you know why we're certain communities disinvested I mean I don't have to go through all this with this audience people understand this so our notion is that if you want to fix a problem that was created politically you have to actually optimize that democracy in these places so that more voices more people can participate in essentially deciding what the priorities are to be for those communities so so now our goals are much more focused on what we call the drivers of change the how as opposed to the what so our goals are to build power and measure it that's social political and economic it's the foster aggressive collaboration across sectors and measure that it's to leverage private capital measure that it's to raise the voice of youth which we think is a great driver particularly in places like City Heights and in Oakland where we're working with a purpose built and then finally to change the narrative about what produces health because we still have a default narrative in this country that health is about a personal responsibility and access to the doctor which is true but woefully inadequate to explain the patterns of health that we see in our society Robert and David I'm curious i'm going to set you up robert this way 20 years ago when city heights as an opportunity presents itself how are you thinking about what what you want to see happen in that place Oh could I place your previous question rather than this one that's power there you go yeah actually I wonder about city heights because City Heights to me is more of a typical story of our country because my grandparents came here as immigrants but they didn't come to City Heights they came to the Bronx or lower east side and they were not well-educated they didn't have money but their children did well and they advanced I think we need places like City Heights and I worry my guess my biggest worry is the city heights and San Diego is becoming so expensive now just to to live there that is it going to be a place for immigrants who need a launching pad and I city and maybe City Heights is different than communities that have had generations of poverty City Heights really has not had generations of poverty what happens is that people come from all parts of the world and their children live the American dream so that may not be typical of some of the work you're doing or some of the work you're doing it may be a little different where there's almost a where people are trapped in communities that just you can't seem to break through so i'm not sure our experience is necessarily typical but i guess what success is in a community like City Heights is that the young people are going to college and they are proud in their community it's amazing the pride in that community David yeah in some ways our job is easy to in that regard because my guess is that most of the people who are in this room live in a healthy neighborhood and you're you know you're in your neighborhood is healthy after you're spending 30 seconds in it I mean you can tell whether healthy neighborhood looks like how it functions how it feels and we're trying to create healthy neighborhoods out of neighborhoods that don't feel that way today so while Tony mentioned the kind of measures the folks typically use and those are those are important to use we think that the real endgame is to the point at which you go into the neighborhoods that we're working in and you don't need to look at statistics to know whether the whether it's working this neighborhood feels safe we were we take about a thousand people through East Lake every year people interested in learning about what we do and oftentimes the first thing they say when they get to eat like is why are you working in this neighborhood doesn't feel hope too stressed and that's that is actually our goal is to make these neighborhoods feel like there any other kind of neighborhood that they're healthy vibrant good schools safe streets all the things that we think aspired to have in our neighborhoods I'm going to throw open a question for the entire panel about how in each of your cases you've had the extent to which you can share this kind of successes and failures or constructive failures things that you've learned as you've deployed philanthropic capital Tony when you talked a moment ago about entering the work that the endowment was doing in a particular frame and then getting some pushback and I could imagine you could have easily said like well nice getting the feedback but that's not what the endowment is about but you chose to recalibrate so have there been those kind of successes and different adjustments that you've had to make as you've deployed philanthropic capital oh absolutely so you know our approach I should have probably said earlier is it's both place base but it's so that we call it place plus because we're also looking at with a statewide policy landscape and trying to intervene in the statewide policy landscape in ways that benefit our places so we kind of toggle between very local and sort of state and even in some cases at the federal level but in terms of mistakes hey we got mistakes in fact a presentation to my board about a year ago which was called our five big failures and my board really loved it which was you know really interesting to me people love to hear about mistakes and failures so now I talk about it all the time you know one of the big mistakes I mean that I can sort of address is your question it's a sort of assumption that you know when you quote unquote come into a community that you can do something that all of the prior actors that have come into this community could not do and so you say I want to create a table where people will collaborate and we'll bring the butcher the baker the candlestick maker all together to make a lovely hearty meal and everybody will get along and then you create this table and people are looking at you yeah yeah yeah it's nice to being your nice being here and as soon as you leave that thing starts to degenerate and factions you know form people that have worked in in sort of government our suspicious of the organizers the organizers are suspicious of some of the other organizers I mean the whole thing will rapidly fall apart for you so this whole notion of collective impact and you know we call it kind of radical collaboration it has to be nurtured it requires a lot of investment a lot of attention a lot of resources and I think that for the most part we don't collaborate well in this country you know people give a lot of lip service to collaboration the collaboration is very hard and it causes heartburn for a lot of people who have agendas and timelines and you know are answerable to different strands of interest you have to really really invest in creating a safe space for people to actually get to know each other and begin to collaborate and takes time in our case I mean we're setting a table for a decade in these places and we think that that's about enough time to really get some radical collaboration lessons learned from investments or strategies that have been deployed well I would say so our model is is really based on leveraging philanthropic dollars so meaning the case tomato to make to a philanthropist is you're taking their investment and and combining it with dollars that are already being spent but just spending those public dollars and nonprofit dollars in a collaborative way so in other words our projects have housing authorities who are going to spend money in that night but it may only be spending my enable but when asked them rest we're asking the housing authority to make those investments in a collaborative way same thing with school same thing with ymca's Boys and Girls Clubs we're asking all of them to say well let's let's go into this neighborhood together with a single vision and let's work together to transform to set of investments that will really change change the course of the neighborhood that's so so the so the fact is I mean the good news is that there's lots of money already being spent in these neighborhoods I was in Dayton Ohio a few weeks ago they were looking at this very distressed neighborhood and they kit and the the city showed me the fact that they have spent 220 million dollars in this neighborhood of course of the past 20 years and would really nothing to show for because those dollars were spent without collaborating and coordinating with other kinds of investments of programs that would have generated results so I think the good news is is that this transformative work can be done without a bunch of new money it's really about taking existing dollars just spending them together in a concentrated way and a way that where they where the investments are complementing each other rather than working independently any lessons learned Robert probably the lesson if I had to do it over again would spend very little money in the area of Education trying to get the school district to do things differently I really think first of all it's very hard to change school districts and I think we have a good one but our conclusion was that if we could get the kids to come to school ready to learn that the schools were good enough in City Heights for them to get a good education and it didn't require a lot of engineering and that we were the wrong ones to do the engineering know that that's interesting to say about because that has not been our experience I mean part our sense is particularly these Indies destress distressed neighborhoods the school in fact should be the most important economic development asset of a neighborhood when you think about all of you have had kids and made decisions about where you're going to live when you have children where that what the quality at school is the key determinants about where you end up choosing to live and these neighborhoods have what's failing schools cannot attract families of choice into those neighborhoods and it perpetuates high poverty schools low-performing schools so we actually spent a lot of time working with school systems to join in this kind of collaboration and we're actually finding nationally more and more school superintendents more more school boards interested in federated models of managing schools innovations and the way schools are managed so I'm actually more optimistic that we can get school systems to embrace these kinds of investments in these kinds of collaborations to change neighborhoods which they never really be thought was their mission before I think the difference maybe not so much the fact that schools are not important it's the question of what our role is and where we can do best and honestly I really believe that the schools and City Heights are good schools the real issue is when kids have the kind of problems they have at home and they don't have good health care where they don't have someone at home to take care of their siblings and they have to stay home all these kinds of issues to me are far more important than worrying about whether the schools are because i think the schools are good enough that's my impression at the top of the morning Michael gave us a charge around now not only what's our number but population level change and I'm wondering what and anyone can bite on this of what you've learned about the kind of threshold investment that is necessary and you can either monetize that in a particular way that there's a billion dollars that's being committed by the California Endowment with the model that David and Robert you guys at what any lessons that you've learned about if folks in this audience who are not a part of the comprehensive Community Change business if you were to actually tell them be ready to spend a minimum or to deploy a minimum of X or Y or Z related to capital and it could be financial or a non-financial but we love your reflections on threshold investment required to do this work well your questions are too good I don't like you anymore so two things one I mean our theory of change is fundamentally about trying to enlist more participation in our community so we're trying to optimize democratic processes and you know if you step back and think about who funds that I mean whose job is it to make sure that your democracy is robust that people are participating that low-income people who don't speak English have an opportunity to have their voice heard in you know the city hall or other decision-making bodies whose job is that it's like it seems like it's nobody's job here it's like it's it's the individuals responsibility to make their voice heard and so we think that you can't do this work well over time in places without investing in in developing robust civic participation and that that has a price to it you have to pay organizers you have to pay people that can work with young people you have to sustain that investment our biggest worry now is that you know in 2020 when we r you know ending building healthy communities how does that continue you know so we're investing in leadership now and we were trying to figure out ways to make that self-perpetuating but that to me is is a critical investment that is a must-have in comprehensive Community Change so can I mention something hmm has you flashed to sign you said it's five minutes left is there a way we could have any questions if there are we're done with my questions and we're going to go to okay if I think if there are any questions okay well I shouldn't but into the system threshold investment anyone else want to bite on that well I'll say yeah so we are projects we end up being about two hundred million dollars in capital investments again these are dollars that are likely to have been spent anyway so we're bringing dollars to the table in a way that doesn't require a bunch of new the new money that sounds like a lot it really is not if you think about we did a study last year to look at how many highly distressed urban neighborhoods are there in this country and which seems like an important question to know if you're in this business of transforming distressed neighborhoods and we conclude there's about eight hundred and twenty five of them that that seems to me like a very Dressel problem we're 12 people working out of Atlanta and we're working at 50 of them so fit so if you again if we had a kind of a concerted effort in this country to to transform these neighborhoods we could do that large you with the resources we've already got in front of us it just takes it just takes effort and aligning the local interests to do that I think so can I just comment briefly I guess so I'm thinking about the the fact of how I would feel I've lived in i was born in San Diego I've lived there all my life and I don't think anybody from the outside could be as committed as people who are san diegoans to making sure that our community is a good community and i would guess that's true in most communities in the united states and as far as the investment it's not so much a matter of money it's really a matter of passion and desire to make your community a good community and we all live in communities where they're rich people and poor people and it's a question we're responsible we're responsible for for the people in our community and it starts it starts locally and that's the way I don't think it's just about money I think it's really about what your values are what you hear about I want to send a signal to the Twitterverse I don't know if the Twitterverse is lighting up and this is a signal to those in the audience for the questions that you would want to ask any we have one gentleman in the blue the gentleman in the blue is asked a couple of questions before what's the gentleman in the Blues named alex morales involved with the magnolia community initiative here in Los Angeles great Alex please it seems a number of you are involved in investments in these kind of strategies I wonder what you would advise other potential investors in terms of what is the message of the outcomes that these efforts can make when we talk about population change it seems to take a long time and so forth but as you reach 20 20 what what is the message then to others why they should invest in what it will do and and the same with Robert and the others how do we word that to capture more investments well I I would in response i have so many answers to that question I I don't even know which one to start with but you know in respect when you look at purpose built in this argument that you know the money is already being spent it's just about organizing and focusing it and getting sort of some common outcomes that are shared amongst investors I think that that's actually a very true statement that if you're talking to other investors you've got to ask them what's what's the alternative I mean if you care about these issues what what really is the alternative so the question for us is how do you align people who are already investing as opposed to trying to get somebody to just take your place that's the best answer I can come up with to that I've got a lot of other small answers but the other thing I would add Tony mentioned earlier about how these neighborhoods got into the condition at the rim and it didn't happen overnight and it happened as a consequence of a lot of sort of mal intended public policy as a consequence of that you know the changes we're talking about don't happen overnight in fact one of the one of the terms i really dislike in this business of community development is people talk about quick wins they want to gets things done and want to show progress and and I hesitate to use those kinds of initiatives because the fact is it takes it's going to take decades to solve this problem we have in this country these are these distressed urban neighborhoods and that's the kind of if I'm an investor's perspective that's the kind of time frame you need to have which is one of the reasons why private these need to be privately led in our opinion because politicians cannot work in those time frames they have to see things happen by the next election they also don't think geographically the way we do I mean it's hard for a politician or a may and I used to work for a mayor I spent eight years this is chief policy advisor to a mayor you know she was very hard for her to say I'm going to do this in this neighborhood I'm not do it anywhere else so so the private sector elite lead long time horizons and also the last piece of it is you got to think big and the reason we believe in these investments need to be a week say at scale we spread too much money around in these neighborhoods we have little things going on and we're not having it's the reason we're not having the impact that we need to have we need to think much bigger in terms of the kind of scale of interventions that we're talking about I'm going to actually take a swing at that Alex Oh privilege of the mic of some sort over a number of decades now but particularly in the administration it's been interesting for me to be in conversations just in relationship to public policy makers on that question and helping other public policy makers in different policy devane's folks in transportation or economic development or in education or health and human services along with HUD begin to to a point that Michael mention at the top of the morning unite under a shared enterprise that we all have a stake in the end game so for the folks in transportation who contrary to maybe even the last panel who again don't think of themselves as in the access to opportunity business but need only look to see what transportation investment in policy has done to neighborhoods around the country or has enabled in terms of access to resource or access to jobs so I think they're at those shared tables Tony that you were talking about i think there has been a need to get everyone to see what's my what's my piece of the pie cross sector and we have we have a way in which we can add value to solving a set of problems at HUD that has meant for many of our place based initiatives that often we have been in the lead because often for those 805 neighborhoods I suspect that there's a lot of public and assisted housing often in a lot of those neighborhoods so we are Exhibit A for needing to come to the table but how is it that we has HUD bring transportation bring other kind of players to make sure that it's a comprehensive kind of solution and I think David's right about the long view it is very hard in public policy often to take the long view I think it is why cross-sector solutions are going to really be necessary for the long game good afternoon I'm Michael banner I run a community of a finance company here in Los Angeles take the point that you just mentioned that bad policy has created highly distressed communities and neighborhoods I think its expression you use when you go in and start an initiative why should you be trusted if somebody can look back and say well somebody came in 20 years ago and said we got the solution for you and in 20 years later you know they're still underwater yeah my answer to that is you shouldn't be trusted you should learn you should earn the trust and that takes time and it takes you know what I described earlier about you know this dialectical process where you're basically trying to negotiate and outcome rather than impose you know a sort of an outcome is really critical because communities I think smart communities will test you well they'll test your sincerity and you can easily fail that test and then people won't come to the table you know with goodwill so I think you should earn that trust and part of earning that trust is actually being open to saying you know what I think we haven't thought this completely through and we want to actually incorporate as much of the community's ideas into the design of this initiative as we can and we will we'll do that in our communities it took us in some of our places not in City Heights City Heights because of the price charities has already got a lot of trust there so we kind of piggyback on on their goodwill but in some of our communities it took three four years before they really you know kind of embraced building healthy communities as a kind of partner in trying to make a change I was in a neighborhood months ago and we started a conversation with some community stakeholders and someone had come into the room and dropped on the desk in front of us the 33 plans that have been done in that neighborhood of the course the previous decades and and so these in these neighborhoods there have been a lot of promises have been made a lot of planning has been done not much has been delivered and so to your point part of what we do is to not go to the community unless we have a pretty good idea that we can get something done their part of this process is about gaining trust but the way to gain trust is actually sure you can deliver something and I think that's in the end of the day the communities have to own this these efforts and this is not something that can be imposed we get invited in by leaders we don't you don't seek out these projects we get invited in to help folks have already decided they want to do something it just needs some help in figuring out a model for getting it done but but the only way to build trust meant ultimately is actually deliver some change that you can point to and if you can do that then then then over time you get more and more trust needs to build itself Robert did you want to weigh in I take us swing at that as well I was in Chicago recently and for folks who have tracked some of the story of comprehensive Community Change in Chicago particular on public housing transformation there's a very rich deep and troubled history and there's nothing like I think a set of residence to Tony's point to hold honest over decades a where failed promises have been and so when I mentioned in my own framing remarks about promises that were made for some of those projects that happen if not many of them promises of jobs were made and many of those jobs haven't been delivered and residents said a very compelling story about we got housing we even got fresh food but we don't have the jobs that were once promised and there were any number of reasons that were offered very legitimate reasons but I think that's part of what happens in these relationships is what what we number one can execute on fairly and reasonably but sometimes it is like there is a there's a different set of scale and a different set of players that are going to have to be mobilized in order to deliver for instance on a promise of jobs I'm Katie am Rebecca I'm a student at the University of Oregon and I'm an NBA mpa who's interested in planning and nonprofits and I was curious really about the how of the collaboration I know I've run into and talked to so many people who want to collaborate and want to kind of break down silos and then when they go to do that they look at their own networks or kind of their own availability bias to like build coalitions with people they already know and then you know they aren't aware of the other people who are building collaborative coalition's you know across the street and so what are some of the tools that yeah that we can really do to to actually create collaboration and see what other people are doing around us to create more of these kind of comprehensive collaborative situations I would say one I don't know whether you ever read the book getting to yes have you read that you have ok well the lesson of the book is you have to start with the idea of what's the interest of the person you're trying to collaborate with right so you want to be sure that what you're you're not coming from something it's going to be good for you you want that person or that organization to see what's in their interest so I would say it's likely the other deal you're trying to make which is that you're attempting to get someone motivated because they feel it's in their interest does that not make sense why are you in the way mm-hmm she's expecting to be in the way and all I don't understand why you start with the idea that somehow you're in the way sorry um kind of you know the availability of bias of you know when so when I'm in that when I'm in the business school world when people want to collaborate they just tend to look in the private sector and they think they're being very diverse if they're looking at a stakeholder who's maybe coming to them but but they don't even think to go across and talk to the planning department that's doing a really similar project and I feel like that's kind of human nature and I'm just wondering if there's like some kind of tool that can help us like get around our humaneness of wanting to be comfortable and wanting to work in the networks we have and use the information we have I think there's any tool I mean you're you're a human being and you're dealing with people so you have to have good people skills and you got to try to tune into first what do you want to accomplish and how does that connect with somebody's interest you're not gonna tell you from our experience I guess that we get invited in so someone will call up and say gee we'd love to do something like what you do elsewhere in our city can you come talk to us and and I can tell you that if I walk into the room at that first meeting and there are more than six people in the room I'm not very optimistic we're getting anything done there in fact the more people in the room the less optimistic i am i've walked into meetings where there's 50 people in the room and so and the reason for that is it's very hard to get 50 people to agree to anything it's not that hard to get to people and then three people and have eight people and then 12 people could you build the case and it's easier to have that dialogue and to understand whatever one's coming from so the only it's not really a tool but our technique well it's two things really it's keep to keep the room small at the beginning and don't let politicians in the room ever I'm gonna disagree a little bit I knew you would and I and maybe I'm not disagreeing directly but i think that there's an art to collaboration and a lot of it has to do with listening up front and which maybe is what was just said to some extent but you've got to understand the landscape of the community in which you're working and so you've got to talk to a lot of people before you propose a collaborative you can understand what's already happening there who are the leaders what are they doing who works with whom well who doesn't work with whom well you know what kind of brokering can you do in that community the this notion and this is what happens with academia a lot is that they get a grant and then the grant says you must collaborate and therefore it you know now they're on a mission to create a collaborative you know come you know hell or high water and and and so they create a parallel collaborative to something else that's already happening in that community haven't listened to what's happening in that community they haven't done that exploration and and and that to me is that this the arrogance of some of the philanthropic the academic government collaborative zits the sort of imposition of sort of an arbitrary collaborative which serves the needs of some grant or some project thank you I'll swing at that as well I I think i think humility is important and I think for any of us who either have been in school or and or would call ourselves experts and you're on a pathway toward being an expert remembering that residents in particular have much to teach you I think is probably exhibit a and you will have a moment when you were in a relationship where you may seemingly know the technical answer and they will revolutionize what you're thinking right in front of you and you may have end up on an entirely different pathway that'll be much more authentic and genuine would be my humility is something I think that is lacking for many of us okay thank you my name is Annette Kim I'm a faculty member here at price David you left me hanging when you're saying that you don't go into places where you can't deliver and so I wondered if you could elaborate on that a little more because there's a lot of talk a lot of community meetings and so little delivery and so what is it that you look for that where you know you can be an agent and maybe some of the others could also speak to that well we'll spend a year maybe more than the year working in a community just understanding really to Tony's point what the opportunity is there to actually create significant change so is there a real estate opportunity does that is the housing authority willing to do something different say with their property that they currently got a net net community is the school superintendent willing to do something significantly different with the school that serves that neighborhood are there other nonprofit providers that YMCAs or are willing to make an investment in that neighborhood so we will do that before you really make any promises to anybody we're looking at what is pot what's the art of the possible in this neighborhood and we might spend a year doing that kind of having those kinds of conversations is trying to understand those dynamics and decide you know is it can't get done here so we're going to we're going to move on that's to us then that period is the most important part of this could be lots of other community development organizations will go in and they'll start with community meetings will have a room like this and they'll start let's vision that's envision what we think it's possible in this community what would you guys like I want to grocery store I want to branch brow we need jobs we need it's easy to collect all that and in fact I've been enough of those to know that you pretty much get the same answer regardless of the neighborhood but then you go back and what can I deliver any of them maybe not so what you know what's the point of getting I'm trying to tell you what it is they need if you can't actually deliver anything so I've Mike my experience both the city government in in my current job is you're much better off going to a community to say look this is what we think is possible here how would you like to see it done you give us some input on specifics of how you what should we do at this school what can we do with this housing how can we how can we collaborate in these kinds of revitalization efforts but let's focus on things that we can actually do that's not pie in the sky this and I think that's why you have 33 plans sitting on tables because they weren't implementable there was nobody there was no engine behind it to get it actually done it was all sort of you know you know brainstorming what how great it would be to have all these things in our neighborhood that weren't really executable any rats David I just even follow up on that question when you're taking the time to kind of assess whether someone is rhetorically making an argument to purpose-built like I'm the school superintendent and I'm interested in delivering change when do you know that they can they are actually because lots of people in applications will state aspiration or will pick up the phone David and say to you I am willing to make XYZ sets of changes but somewhere along the line you get you get to a good feeling like well it's more than feeling I mean we'll have an MOU signed with it with a school super intense this is what we're going to this is what our local team is going to do this is what schools are going to do the schools are green to do in this particular elementary school set or this the same thing with the housing authority same thing so we will we will get to the point at which people are making specific commitments to deliver the work otherwise you know without that you're you're you know you're kind of you're going without a compass you just kind of you can't feel your way through this day if you really want to to deliver this kind of change you've got to have folks who are willing to make those kinds of commitments other questions having had the honor of listening to everything that has been said I've learned a lot but one of the things that I've learned it seems like we have an army of individuals acting individually by themselves to try to defeat the enemy and you know what i mean by the enemy what are some opportunities to bring all these fantastic organizations and people who are trying to individually make a difference together so that we create the synergy that would increase the benefits far far more than it is what about government as inter-sectoral collaboration creating an agency that is only focused on bringing nonprofit efforts together I just wanted why do you assume that being together you're better than doing things individually I don't want to well ok I will go ahead and answer that I was just asking a question well we don't want to buy into your assumption because your assumption might not be right ok all right you know it's very very difficult to go into challenging conversation with Robert price but no yeah you can ask a couple of people work in the foundation they could tell you but well that's not the point the point is you know you don't want to start off on a on a on an assumption that may not be a correct assumption I totally agree with you and so to be serious oh there may be opportunities where individual organizations are the best of doing what they're doing but then there are also opportunities for collaboration cooperation bring synergy that increases the final results that are gained for example if there are certain things that one organization is doing but late lack other things that could enhance their performance and there is another nonprofit organization that actually has a strength in that area if they combine their efforts they could produce far more than they do individually but there may be organizations or situations where that not possible well I think in the case of the three of us it would be difficult to think of too much in the way of I think we were working together in city heights but we do our own thing but the University of Southern California what it should be doing is studying best practices and giving us the information so we can learn from all of these initiatives I assume you're doing that Gary yes yes so then we are on the same page life's a best practices okay I think sometimes we think of the collaboration I think kind of in this ideal idealized way when and when in fact I mean what we're doing in City Heights together is we're just aligned you know we don't you know they're a unique entity we're a unique entity we have common interests that are aligned we're trying to find where we can drive that alignment to sort of optimization and where it's you know where we're not as a line we're like you know god bless you do what you do and we'll do what we do with purpose-built we brought purpose built into oakland and sacramento because they have an aligned mission with what we're trying to achieve and they have some skill set that we don't have we don't build housing we have no idea what that even looks like but we recognize you know an aligned set of goals that could further our community work so i think it's it's always a balance you don't you don't want to you know completely commit yourself to somebody else's mission because they're they're different they have different interests different motivations different timelines but where you can find alignment you know for that moment in time where it's transparent you're like we're going to work along beside you because we like what you're doing and we think it complements what we're doing you should do that night I don't think government does that well at all and and I think that there could be some study of how to find best practices for actually optimizing alignment so let me let me disagree with Tony so not that not that govern I think that that historically is accurate but this is this is actually something I said last year and I'm going to reiterate i do think for all of us in the room when government actually does step forward in a way that's aligned i do think it's really important to actually hear from folks on the ground that that's the right move so when Michael talked about Promise Neighborhoods right Promise Neighborhoods could have been completely an education department of education vehicle but it was designed with collaboration in mind promise zones that is happening here was designed with how do we set a kind of collective impact comprehensive vision and I think part of the role of of government can be that given the taxpayer resources how might we with those taxpayer resources actually send the signals that the expectation is that people have to either a line or collaborate and I think we are learning better about that and my sense is if if we believe these things need to come together then part of the role at least for all of us in the room is can we make claims and demands on government to say what is your role in sending a signal that this work has to come together and we're seeing more and more examples of that sure the role of this dais and you is like completely gone we're having a conversation says you maximize your own utility and if everyone maximizes their utility then the entire society has maximize their utility but as we know not everyone is capable of doing that so therefore there are those who cannot take care of themselves and that's where our government comes in so in reality above not in reality of theoretically conceptually let me take it really to the extreme all that you're doing is basically you're doing the job that government is required to do based on what we believe in I'm not really serious about that but if you really want to think about it so in that respect government should very much appreciate what you're doing and be able to come in and align everywhere where there's an opportunity thanks for sharing that and it should we take another comment are we done any last comments from the panel that may have been the greatest benediction that we were ever given thank you thank you all right let me thank the panel once again for just a terrific enjoyed gardening was especially useful for me in the in the panel and is just to hear how different strategies can can work to achieve the same goal which is population change
