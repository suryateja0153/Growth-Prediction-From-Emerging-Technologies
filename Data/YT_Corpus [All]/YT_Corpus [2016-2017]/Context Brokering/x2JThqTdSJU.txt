 the focus obviously in this session is to zoom out on the conversation a little bit and and look more broadly at the trends that are beginning to become more and more relevant as the regional conversation becomes more and more relevant and so to join us in exploring those issues and to simulate a conversation that we really encourage everyone to be part of it and open free-flowing QA I'm joined by my three colleagues on my left Richard who is the the chair of CSR Asia so they have offices right across the the region I had caught up a secure base in Hong Kong personally these days but also is has a background as an environmental management academic and I think if i'm not mistaken was a visiting fellow at UTS but they never revoked your visiting it's like a tenured still they're technically so um so it's a good gig if you can get it Damien move from from AAA is the the CEO of AAA Australia part of the the AAA group operating in more than 18 countries across the region in Australia I think that looks like about a three and a half million head customer-based second-largest life insurer here and probably most famous organizationally most recently for the vitality platform which Damien begged not to be forced to spend a long time talking about for fear of looking like an advert but I'm sure everyone would like to hear something about it so we're going to force you into that at some point today and Rosemarie Alice of course the the director at impact strategist and one of the founders and directors at impact investing Australia most famously recently named Doug blush but as one of a hundred most influential women in innovation in this country and was the chair of the first federal government task force looking at social innovation 2010 I think that kicked off mark kramer mentioned at the end of his closing remarks earlier that Australia is a unique case study insofar as there are a few if any countries in the world with such energy and momentum built around shared value and so by way of opening remarks I'd love to get everyone's perspective on your personal snapshot of where you feel like the conversation is at regionally right now at the highest level and maybe just working our way down I think mark is right i mean i think the the discussions we've had today and yesterday have probably been second to none in my experience and i think Peter and Helen have done a fantastic job in sort of keeping that momentum going in Australia for the rest of Asia I think most companies are behind in that debate but they're rapidly catching up and I and I think in a few years time we're going to see some of the big asian multinationals talking about shared value with every bit as much of sophistication as we've heard here heard here today china i think is is is particularly encouraging there are companies in China that have sophisticated programs that are essentially shared value if you take a company like China Mobile it's an incredible company China Mobile just in China has 800 million customers and one of the things that China Mobile realizes is that to keep those customers they need to keep adding value to their services so they've been working for example with poor farmers in rural areas sending the messages on their mobile phones about crop prices about weather conditions crop prices are very important to make sure that those farmers are not ripped off by the middlemen we've also been working with Huawei one of the biggest internet and mobile communications providers now who are having really sophisticated discussions about the sustainable development goals and their commitment to help meet those sustainable development goals not only in China but the rest of the world as well because the key message is the key message that is coming from both of those companies both china mobile and Huawei is they don't see that their future is being a Chinese company their future is being a global company and in order to be a global company you need to have a social licence to operate in all the countries where you're operating and what they're saying to me is that social responsibility shared value inclusive business whatever you want to call it gives them that social licence to operate and that's why they're they're so interested in in in in this message so so watch this space because my prediction is those those big asian multinationals will be talking the same language in a few years as we are now talking today well yeah I mean I agree with Richard in terms of where we eyes clearly if we look at Australia we've made significant progress in the in just under two years and that's really starting with understanding that shared value just has a compelling reason to do so and get behind it and then it's taken great leadership by Peter and Helen and others that have been co-founders in sponsors to support getting the initiative out here and look at us today but I would also agree that we're out the early stages when we talk about the region but here's the dynamic I mean you know we talk about Asia nature is not one country Asia is many countries in each country is different and I do life I mean because you know born in Britain Australia and very proud to be so but you know when i come back from from business in Hong Kong or Singapore Thailand I come back and people go oh it's like an Asia and I go well it's like 20 different places yeah and I think what we need to understand is that all of those countries are different stages development and why you're see in Australia move through so quickly is because on a global level we are very mature in terms of our economy in terms of our thinking and our infrastructure and therefore when you put that on the spectrum with all the countries across the region in terms of asia-pacific there are very different stages but they are rapidly developing right and that that rapid pace is happening so quickly I mean 13 million people a year in China organizing and moving through to the middle class annually which is more than the population of Australia so and that development is happening so quickly the other thing I would say is you know there's an interesting insight that if you look back and for me you know the movements happen very quickly and the issue is with shared value it's actually a social change social change will happen far more quickly than businesses are ready to adapt to so if we don't get on board with it then we'll be left behind because it's not about whether it's it's not about a product it's about people making the decision of who they will develop relationships with and so social change happens far more quickly and that's probably related to the last point I'll make is that you know each generation has had challenges and you know I think where our generation is known different in that we face challenges in the future what is different now is that things are happening so quickly in the world that we're not able to assimilate as fast as we as fast as that changes happening so what I'm getting back to is well we might be early I support riches comments that shared value because of its compelling nature and just make sense it will will take off in across the region and you know companies like AIG will be there to support that development thanks Damien I agree that there's been massive amounts of progress made in the last few years and certainly from the time that I started my first consultancy working with corporates about how they could integrate social and economic value in 2003 when we didn't have the term shared value the conversation in Australia has come a huge way I think what we do in the next couple of years is really critically important because we'll either continue along with there being interest in dialogue and fantastic engagement in forums like this but it will still be nation a few interesting projects that people do all we all decide to do a few key things that can actually mean that this becomes more part of business as usual and we take the potential to scale part of the reason that I spend so much of my time on the moment at the moment looking at impact investment or the investment propositions that deliver positive social outcomes and financial return so a shared value proposition is because we need to look at the key pieces of the ecosystem and the infrastructure to be able to achieve that scale if we can't finance these types of initiatives whether it's the feasibility that many of you will know is critically missing even for big corporate sometimes to actually invest in the R&D or whether it's the operating and working capital to be able to undertake some of these initiatives then the reality is they won't get done so we need to work out how we get that kind of infrastructure also how we build the capability so that we can translate what's definitely growing interest in dialogue into action to help people know how do I do that and support the intermediaries and the advisors and the others who are building a professional base in knowing how to connect people who understand what the issues are on the ground to people who have the resources and bring those partnerships together in ways that make sense Australia can play a really fantastic role in this we are really good at taking ideas from other parts of the world adapting them and playing them back into the global context we have all the foundations to be a leader and we also have a really interesting blend of the cultures that come from the United Kingdom the market base of of the u.s. some aspects of the social economy from Europe and the integration that we can have with some of our neighbors in the region here we can and should be playing a leadership role in the region not just in terms of looking at what are the opportunities for business and for the engagement in terms of development investment from Australia into our region but also how we enable that more in the countries around us there's definitely potential to be looking at this through the issue of how we solve things like the sustainable development goals in ways that can have a great impact in the region and I'm working at the moment with a on a project that's looking at the sustainable development goals on road safety for example how can we actually look at it through a different lens of the problem so that we can actually incentivize more investment into the prevention rather than people picking up the costs when things go wrong that work is being led by foundation out of London ironically it's being led by a foundation out of London that recognizes the tastic work that's been done in the Australian insurance industry including in Victoria's own transport Accident Commission we can and should be leading more of this stuff from Australia and there are people looking to us to do that and I think there's fantastic potential there's great examples and there's no silver bullet but there are definitely things that we can be doing to take this to scale and to ensure that Australia really meets the potential that it has to be a leader in the region I mean Rosemarie you use the phrase then that there's a few key things that need to happen in order to shift this from a conversation um you know in for alike this to something that just becomes a part of business as usual and you've already highlighted you know that the financing model basic infrastructure capability on that theme Damian well one of the other I think really acknowledged barriers that we face is this challenge you've highlighted of it's really easy to say Asia as a region but you're talking about a lot of very very different places there as a group that operates in 18 different markets how do you deal with the challenge of the massive diversity that makes it a much more complex question than just replicating and scaling what you do everywhere you go so look to not it's not actually that complicated and I not explainable high because I what we need to respect is that it's different and there are cultural differences in different norms and social acceptances and different ways of doing business and that's different but actually underline we're all humans and you know innately people want to make a difference and and and organisations need to make a profit to be sustainable and where we can intersect business operations was just so in societal issues it's a win-win and a win for government and society as well so I think those things hold up no matter where you are it's just making sure we translate the message in a way that respects the different cultural norms and societies that you take it to but fundamentally you know I don't we shouldn't complicate shared value and I think we do a great job of complicating things right shared value just makes Kim just make intuitive sense you know you heard from Adrienne go earlier today I saw there's been a lot of time on vitality but you know someone asked the question what was your beacon to know that you were doing the right thing well there was no beacon it's just you've just got to sometimes know that it's the right thing now why are we all here because you know when you start talking about shared value I've had a tiring date the last couple of days I came in ran into Paul and Paul wanted to talk about shared value and suddenly my energy levels went up again so you just know that some things are just intuitive and makes sense and you just can't overthink and you just got to do it and what we need to do is though then back that up with great leadership so what has been successful here first and foremost yes as in as a society we believe in doing good as and business has connected with that and we are genuinely trying to change change outcomes in society and connected with what we're doing in business but beyond that what we've had is great leadership so no matter what a country we go to the next in the region we must identify fantastic leaders who will drive this forward who will have the discussion who will put themselves without that to have the courage of the convictions this is just the right thing to do not wait for a business case to be done so it's so the question I won't ask of the back of that is if it's such a compelling and self-made case is why isn't it everybody's standard operating procedure I'll just because I i went there i'll just start and then hand it over to these to give you a far more eloquent answer it's just like any change its human nature's behavioral economics we fear change and its its its understanding so until we are educated and understand what we're actually talking about then making that change is difficult we need to be talking as a consistent language so that you we're not you know having the fear of saying something that may be looked upon us all is that person talking about you know we are running a profitable business here we're not a charity you know we've got to get overcome the fear of change and to do that which starts with education and that's how we empower people to then feel that they can once they know something they can then do something about it and then we need to continue to incentivize and reward and nudge that behavior to keep people on their journey that's my initial start off and listed no i think i think damian is one hundred percent right i mean change takes time and in Asia I think the shared value concept is still not terribly well known we've been working very hard on that we actually had a forum a little bit like this in Hong Kong last year where we had 140 people we've done training courses across the whole of Asia on shared value and there's a great deal of interest once you start talking to businesses about shared value they get interested very fast because the language of shared value is so infectious you know the idea that you can meet social needs and at the same time get a competitive advantage is a very very infectious argument I I can get people interested in the ideas it's taking a bit longer for them to actually implement shared value projects but I'm very enthusiastic because I'm seeing the beginnings of change right now and although change does take a while I think the speed at which shared value has become a common language is increasing very very fast now and we just need to get out there and do what you've done here in Australia I think have more forums like this create more networks in the private sector and really demonstrate to the private sector that this is a great business model and I think it's very easy I mean you're right i mean it once you've got it it's such a natural business discussion that i think we will create that change very soon I think there's a natural transition in any of these changes one dimension of that is it that particularly for larger businesses and for governments to make a gear shift from thinking which of the kind of ideas out there that come to me do I need to choose between to the keeper what's our job what's the stuff we're good at what's the stuff that's actually linked with core business so that you get clear about your role and then look at who else can be part of that I think that's really it's a really important shift and there's also an important element of understanding the aspect of the social dimensions so for a lot of people it's unfamiliar territory to understand what some of those social issues are when I speech people in the finance sector they'll say to me I am quite comfortable working out the risk adjusted return of a complex financial instrument but I you know when you talk to me about homelessness or about how we might affect issues for young people I really don't know and I don't know how to make a good judgment about that and I think there's a couple of things that we can do there one is a paradigm shift which there's how about we start looking at the world not just through risk and return over here or profit over here and doing good things over that over there but look at it in terms of risk return and impact when we're looking at things I say to people that's just like if you buy a red car all of sudden you see red cars everywhere introduced impacting to the conversation introduce the the notion of the social value into the conversation and all of a sudden you'll be seeing it including the stuff you don't like about the way your business or your organization works the other thing is we actually need to value that it is a skill and a competency to have the multilingual leadership of people who've worked across sectors and can bridge that I hear a lot of talk about common language and I think that there are important aspects but I also think that that's something that we may never get to what we need to be clear about is what is it we want to see more of and there are people including some fantastic people who are here today some of whom have been working in this space for a long time and others trained in professional companies around around brokering cross-sector partnerships who have experience who can actually help broker that we wouldn't try and broker illegal deal ourselves who wouldn't necessarily try and get the accounting advice ourselves but we can in appropriate cases build that capability in house and also get people who can bring that to the table so that you don't have to all of a sudden make sense of a whole lot of social issues that are unfamiliar territory at and you can actually go to the people who navigate that and who are seeing a lot of what's going on out there so they can point to who's doing good things and who might be natural partners and I think once we break down some of some of those barriers it becomes easier for people to then work out this fit with my business or where might a business partner fit with what we're trying to achieve in the social setting it's a great diverse set of opinions I mean there's take what works focus on the IP the system's the products the solutions that have been developed as the kind of guiding the decisions between areas where there's perhaps already infrastructure in place versus exploring those where there might be less infrastructure there therefore more space and Greener fields and then obviously from from Damien our focus on the the key areas health education infrastructure that Mather matically represent opportunities so it's certainly been a tour of the region so thank you very much for your time and if I can get everyone to join in me with thank you
