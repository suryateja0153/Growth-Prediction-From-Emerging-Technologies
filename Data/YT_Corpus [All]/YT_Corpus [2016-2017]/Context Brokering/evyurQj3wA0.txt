 welcome to everyone it's a pleasure to be here today we are talking about how we are trying to define a role for the World Bank Group as a global connector and we are multilateral obviously in this South self-knowledge agenda there's a lot of momentum around south south and and it is essentially a country driven agenda and it's an agenda that is owned by the countries and it needs to be owned by the countries and it is an agenda that really begs very hard questions about what the role of multilaterals like the world bank is in this agenda I'm first going to do a little bit of a presentation which gives a little bit of background on how we see this agenda in the world bank group and then how we try to define a useful role for ourselves what are we seeing on this picture here in one sense for me what you're seeing on this picture is very representative for the paradigm shift that we've been seeing over the last few years yeah coming from the World Bank I guess that many people who think that this is a picture of let's say a world bank supervision mission to a construction project in some country in Asia yeah and that's what it looks like at first sight but it's not what it is in reality this is something very very different what this is this is a group of engineers highway engineers from the Caucasus Armenia Azerbaijan and Georgia who are visiting a group of highway engineers in China and they are learning about the maintenance of express highways that are constructed in very difficult terrain now it's not that countries in the Caucasus do not have the financing to build such highways they do in fact there is an abundant amount of financing options for those countries what they are struggling with is with the capacity that one week needs and understanding the one needs to actually bring such projects to a good closure for example in the aspect of the maintenance of such roads are that they're built yeah so what we're seeing here is not a group of World Bank people or consultants hired by a donor to teach something two Caucasian highway engineers what we're seeing here are higher occasion highway engineers going to China and spears learning from each other on body challenges are and the important aspects are of maintaining express roads in very difficult terrain yeah and this is exactly the type of buried paradigm shift that we are talking about we are moving and we have moved in fact from a world where development cooperation is about a transfer from the north to the south of money and expertise yeah what we're seeing more and more is that countries are ready to share their experiences and countries are seeing that they want to learn from the experiences of other developing countries so this begs the question for a organization like the World Bank Group and I think for many other donors as well this this asset this begs the question like what is our role in this changing landscape so let's look at this picture for a moment now this picture is a picture of a typical World Bank Institute activity a few decades ago now what we're seeing there is a seminar of what at the time was called the EDI the Economic Development Institute before it was named the World Bank Institute and in the Economic Development Institute what we used to do for decades we used to bring once or twice or three times a year key policy makers from developing countries over the Washington DC to learn together from the lessons learned from the theories that were underpinning the economic development models of the North it was essentially the north-south transfer of knowledge facilitated by the by the World Bank in this case by Ed I and north south transfer of knowledge through a training format now after some time EDI and then later on the World Bank Institute when in 2000 EDI was renamed into WBAI we became very good at this yeah we became actually we started to scale this up we had more and more of such offerings and at certain point we started to use technology for those offerings we started to broadcast courses and classes and we were reaching many more participants in many more countries but fundamentally the model remained the same the model remained a model of training yeah provided to policymakers and at a certain point also practitioners in developing countries yeah and really the model being learning from models that have succeeded in the north yeah that was the view actually of capacity development that we had for a very long time but at a certain point in time these kinds of ideas and these models really the validity of those came to an end and there are few things that we should point to one thing is that something that form in the world bank itself was a report that really woke us up big time it was it was a report done by the independent evaluation group about training activities financed and organized by the World Bank Group and what the report did was to confirm with numbers what many of us already felt for quite a while yeah the training does not necessarily lead to development capacity yeah by itself training does not lead to result to results what we're seeing that people learn useful things to training through training but they don't necessarily apply those things training does not lead to change and capacity development is all about change so I'm going to show two quotes from this report which I think are quite telling now this was a report that came out in 2008 so over the past decade the report says the bank has financed approximately seven hundred and twenty million dollars in training annually that's a lot of money yeah most of bank finest training was found to result individual participant learning but only about half resulted in substantial changes to workplace behavior or enhance development capacity so there's something wrong with training the other piece that has been changing quite dramatically is that right now as all of us know we live in an inner in a very very different world yeah look at this picture that you're seeing them this is a an outsourcing Center and IT outsourcing Center in Nigeria yeah so if you look at the IT industry and specifically within the IT industry the global business process or the business process outsourcing industry there is a huge potential for this industry yeah so this is a talent driven industry there's a potential globally of 500 billion u.s. dollars per year yeah a majority of that about eighty-five percent people estimate it's still untapped yeah Africa yeah has a long way to go in this and it's very keen to explore these possibilities yeah this can create thousands and thousands of jobs quality jobs new jobs for young people in an industry that is really that is that the radio is really a lot of potential yeah the problem is there's not the right skill sets and so where to find those skill sets yeah so India obviously is that the natural choice India has developed this industry yeah India knows about the management processes india has assess what the skill sets the skill gaps are from people who come out of school and then go into this industry and need some additional professional training and they have specialized firms who can address those trainings now who can address those skills skills gaps India by now has developed an industry associations of organizations that are involved in this industry and it's a very successful industry association so what Nigeria needs to do in this case it needs to go and learn from India this is the type of knowledge and experience that simply is not available in the north now so we live in a world today there's a world of multipolar growth but is also with that multiple melt a multipolar growth we also see that this is a world with many more sources of knowledge and experiences to learn from about conditional cash transfers one can simply not learn in the north yeah this has to be a south-south learning model yeah when a country wants to go and develop a conditional cash transfer scheme yeah they have to learn this experience from another country in the south because that knowledge and experience does not exist in the north yeah and so today is learning that needs to take place is not training it's learning from experience yeah and it's learning from experiences between developing countries yeah it's not a north-south model it's a south-south model yeah and this is a so this brings us to the role that an organization like the bank and played then so far I've been talking about kind of the analysis that we're making and the questions we are asking ourselves now and the reality we're operating in today yeah the question is what can the World Bank contribute to this weird development organization and we need to ask ourselves a question what we can do maybe for those of you not fully familiar with what the world bank group does the world bank group is very much a demand driven organization so we have a presence in 130 countries of this worldwide we work with developing countries and the way the world bank work is that we have a presence in those countries with country managers or country directors who have a dialogue with the usually the Ministry of Finance at the other side sometimes the Ministry of Planning and based on the overall poverty reduction or the development strategy of the country the world bank agrees with the government on a strategic plan of assistance we call this the country assistant strategy in those car or in some cases we call this also that country partnership strategy in what this country assistance strategy does it provides an overall umbrella for the world bank operations that will be undertaken in that country and it captures nicely what the country wants to do what we want to learn but more and more and we've been working with our country offices on this it also captures what the country wants to share with other countries yeah so this is one dimension of what the world bank group has below this strategic level there is a suite of operational instruments that we then apply that we have worked out within our organization to actually deliver on those strategies so far you can group these most into two types of products landing products where we give loans or credits or Follette safe financial products depending on the income level of the country this goes with different types of conditions or knowledge products usually studies and reports yeah we're world bank staff you go into a country work with the country or hire consultants and develop a report on let's say the knowledge I can economy or jobs in a certain country and then use that report to inform policy making yeah so lending products or financial products and knowledge products and the question we are asking ourselves here and this is a question is very burning right now in a in an intense internal debate in the World Bank Group do we need to have a third line of business in the bank which would be connectivity services where the bank would not provide knowledge or provide finance but where the bank would play a role of a connector and that is basically what is this is what the the topic of the day is about yeah and obviously what we need to recognize also is that the World Bank has strong sectoral expertise in certain areas in certain areas were very weak in other areas we're very strong especially in tradition in in the traditional development areas infrastructure and Shin etc private sector development etc yeah so those are the kinds of things that are also part of our analysis when we think what the role of the World Bank in this changing paradigm is and what we think that the world bank can usefully bring to the day so I was talking before about the two traditional lines of business the financing product and the knowledge product and planned probably the need for us to start developing a new line of business which would be the convening or the connecting instrument and and as I say these there is a few countries where the world link is already experimenting with this where we are explicitly talking about the third line of business in our conversation with the country for example Mexico is an example Colombia is another example it's mainly happening in the Latin America region and this is not coincidentally a region where we have a lot of middle income countries where the the need for financing is declining and need for other types of services is coming up so what we're doing in my group in the in the World Bank Institute we have a mandate to think through what such a connecting line of business would operationally look like so if we think of the World Bank as a global connector not an organization that imparts knowledge but an organization that facilitates that the the process of countries connecting to each other to learn from each other how would we how would this look like and so first of all what we did is we try to develop a some sort of a conceptual framework for this and I just quickly show this conceptual framework to you yeah so if you look at knowledge exchange so let's call it south south no six change what an operational approach would look like an apologies for there's some letters on the slide not seen the right spot but if you look at this as a life cycle for knowledge exchange this is just one way of looking at it but for us it has proven to be very helpful to guide us on the kinds of things we would need be we would need to be doing so on the one hand if you start from left to right you had their summer supply yeah typical case is Columbia as a strong desire to share its experience on rapid bus systems in urban environments right so it's a very successful experience and they like to share this experience on the other side there is a demand the and there's some other countries some other capital or some other big city in a country that is actually thinks about embarking on a similar type of effort and would really like to learn from Bogota how they did this and what were the challenges they encountered and and so that if you learn from someone who has done it before you less likely to make the same mistakes yeah so these two the supply and the demand for a certain experience they need to be matched somehow yeah when they're brought together then they're matched and we a knowledge brokering in a sense has taken place yeah so when we know who is going to learn from who about what and who is ready to provide this experience and who's who who is going to be the learner or or can be a group learning as well or to learning then the next step is now then we go downstream in the life cycle the next step is that we need to think through how will this be designed so that needs to result yeah so it is going to be a study tour or a field visit or is this a twinning arrangement or what are the kinds of pedagogical instruments if you want that we're going to need to actually make the learning happen that's the design part yeah at the same time this is an activity that will take place not a tremendously expensive activity probably but still it needs financing who is going to pay for it yeah is the lower paying for it is there multilateral paying for it is there a trust fund paying for it is it embedded in an operation somewhere etc yeah and then it leads to implementation in fact this in the end involves a lot of technology when we use communities of practice or it involves travel people traveling from one place to another targeting the right people making sure the learning actually takes place on site etc and that leads to development results so this is just one way of breaking down this whole dynamic of knowledge exchange into some pieces bits and pieces that can inform us on the types of things that we need to do in order to to play a useful connector role in the bank and so if we just break this down a little more than you can see that on each of these buckets they're actually useful things that can be done yeah on the brokering side this is supporting countries to know what they want to learn nobody want to share make their institutional capacity issues in countries more and more we're seeing that countries are requesting the World Bank to help them develop their institutional capacity for South knowledge exchange etc yeah on the design side you see that there is a need to really capture how soft soft knowledge exchange can be designed so that leads to results yeah on the results I'd obviously there is a very important need to document the results of south-south now exchange on the implementation side there is a need to support countries to have the capacity to implement those exchanges on the financing side we need to develop financing instruments right so what I'm going to do now in the next three slides very quickly and you can look more in detail at this later on because this presentation will be available to you we also have some links where I think this might be more useful for you to explore by yourself I'm going to show a few of the things that we've been developing recently yeah I would really welcome your feedback on those things and then I will highlight a few things where we think we need to invest some more time in the future before I close one example is and I wanted to bring a copy but we do have a a link of this is a tool kit that we just completed very recently which we've called the art of knowledge exchange and you can see it comes out of the design bucket yeah it is a a toolkit that we've invested quite some time in so to three people have been working on this for quite a while and we've done quite a bit of consultation across the bank but also outside which is a result focused planning guide for the development practitioners yeah it focuses on the how to of knowledge knowledge exchange and it's and it's aimed at people like you and me and others in country who are actually going to design a knowledge exchange what we've done is a few things that I think are quite critical yeah first of all we've embedded a results framework in this we have embedded a series of questions into this guide that take you through a thought process or first of all identifying where the knowledge exchange is the right thing for you but secondly helping you to link it to your overall development goal yeah and it goes up from the development go down to more what is your capacity development goal what is the change process you want to engage in and what are the kind of capacity outcomes you want to achieve it about raising awareness it is it about building coalitions etc yeah and then down from there it helps you select between what we have chosen to be seven knowledge exchange instruments which could be twinning Arrangements community of practice policy dialogue etc and then some what works and doesn't work for each of them so that's that guide and there is i believe sorry there's a link available for you where you can download this guide yeah another thing is this is under the financing bucket we have we have developed a multi-donor trust fund yeah this multi-donor trust fund is for me not the solution to the financing of south-south and i will come come back to that in a moment but it is a very interesting facility to help grease the wheels if you want now this is a facility it's multi-donor and five of those donors very interestingly are middle-income countries yeah so and four of them are a traditional donors this is a facility that is really has has raised a lot of interest with middle-income countries and the fact that five of them are putting money into this facility shows what we've come to call here the desire to share yeah these countries are typically countries in Mexico China India Russia Colombia with a strong desire to reach out to other countries for developing their own development cooperation programs China obviously and India already have some mature programs but Colombia Mexico good examples of of countries that are developing a development cooperation program and really in a context of that want to become providers of cooperation as well providers of knowledge right what we do with these facilities we provide grants to up $250,000 two countries who request through their World Bank channels and then a certain amount of money to learn something directly from another country the World Bank is not involved in providing knowledge we are just involved as connecting just in time this is one other example I want to give you on the result site we have developed this source of knowledge exchange port which I think has quite some potential and I would like to invite you to visit that portal and then give us feedback it's it features result stories from south of north exchanges that we have that we have been involved in I think we're about 40 up there and there are many more to come we have a team of writers here who really try to point towards the development outcomes that the knowledge exchanges have achieved and what has worked and what has not worked yeah we are a partner in the global development learning network and you have the website there as well this is more an implementation mechanism we have about 120 organizations in developing countries who are very conversant with the use of technology for knowledge exchange for video conferencing webinars these kinds of things so that we can use as local partners to make knowledge exchanges happen on the ground yeah and so those are just a few examples of the kinds of things that we are doing and together we're seeing when we place this on the on the life cycle that all these tools together would would give some meat and substance to a global connector role for the World Bank there are few more things that are on the horizon that I think are quite important highlight one thing we've been struggling with and again I would like to invite your suggestions on this is the role bank is a very fragmented organization yeah so we are working in thematic silos we have vice presidencies that work on certain things and not on other things and and the connections between those vice presidencies are not always as smooth as it could be we work in regional silos if someone works on a country that person is not really working on some other country in another region so there is really a need for us to think through how we can have a smooth flow of noise for the World Bank to be a useful global connector we need to find a systematic way of brokering nodes and we have been thinking hard about this and and I don't think we are we've already found the answer so but we know that over time and sooner rather than later we need to think through what is the global brokering knowledge brokering solution that the World Bank Group can offer to the rest of the development community not to compete with the rest of development community but just in order to get our own house in order and be be able to be a useful knowledge broker so that's one thing we are right now chewing on and any suggestions will be really more than helpful now the other big thing where which I think it's probably the most game-changing thing we can be working on and we are now we've started to work quite intensely on this this year is how can we incorporate such softness exchange into world bank lending if you look at the trust fund the south shore facility that's 10 million dollars that we have so far its peanuts yeah the real game is when as in the in as part of World Bank financial support to countries which goes into billions of dollars per year yeah we can discuss but this is money that is done in the end country executed it's money that's owned by the government but the design is done together between the government and the World Bank very often there is a capacity development component in there we have not spent a lot of time and effort over the past years in really thinking through what is the best way to develop this capacity development component of these projects if we were to have a more thought through conversation with the government on how we can use south-south approaches in the context of capacity development components of world bank loans we would just be creating an enormous amount of money available for south-south knowledge exchange yeah so this is really and we're doing a pilot initiative on this this year and we'll be working with Stan operational themes in the bank who are going to incorporate south south north exchange into the design of their lending program and maybe over a year so I can come back and and and report some results on that yeah the other thing and I mentioned it quickly before already is that we are seeing more and more countries and there is now I think already four or five countries have come to the World Bank they've asked that they've said look there is a there's a we want to engage more systematically and starts of knowledge exchange but how do we do it what kind of institutions do we need how do we know how do we make an overview of what we want to share how do we package much we want to share how can we get in touch with other countries want to learn what kind of institutions do we need in short and so this is clearly another an area where I have to start thinking about what we want to do so this is just to give you a sense of the kinds of things we're working on that would complete some other gaps on the life cycle if you want so going forward I just wanted to say that in and this is my last slide and then we'll hand it over to you we have talked in this presentation today very much about what the World Bank is doing but I just don't want to be there a misunderstanding on this this is a country that agenda and we have really are conceiving this as an agenda that belongs to the countries yeah it's the countries for learning from each other we are reflecting on what a useful role for a multilateral like the world bank can be in support of the countries yeah and it's very we need to recognize very much that this is also a global agenda there are many many many partners we are working with and it's the regional and this is just a this is just a few examples and I just don't want to point out any ones in particular and there many more we just wanted to give you with this picture a sense of the multitude of global partners that are involved in this let me just quickly highlight two first of all I think it's important to recognize that this has become an important part of the development agenda of the g20 and in fact we contributed this year on a report that talks about scaling of knowledge sharing and I believe that that report is also available and it really provides recommendations for countries on how to scale up the practice of knowledge sharing between countries directly and we then also contributed to developing a quick follow-up report which specifically focuses on institutional capacity at the country level so those two reports are available and then the other part that I wanted to highlight is a testing for south-south cooperation which really is a country led coalition of countries and organizations and be a part of it just a member who're who have been doing a lot of analytical work on this and i believe that neal schultz is on the chat here as well and so he's been one of the drivers behind this testing for south-south cooperation and is a lot of very interesting things that have been going on in that context including global prac the best practice paper etc and together with the task team we're working towards having a plenary session at the high level formulate effectiveness in Busan Korea at the end of this month and also a thematic session and much much more is going to come out of that and there's a lot of attraction for those sessions and so maybe when we come back from Busan and I hope that many of you might even be in Busan II we can meet each other day we can report back on what what kind of the next steps will be
