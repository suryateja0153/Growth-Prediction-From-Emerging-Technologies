 so welcome everybody I'm Kevin Watkins I'm director here at ODI we have row wonderful lineups I'd like to welcome all of you we The the order of proceeding is that an 11-minute sir the the Commissioner is going to deliver a keynote speech from the lectern will then have three sets of comments from our speakers who I'll introduce after the after speech did just by way of introduction did the issue that the Commissioner will be addressing today is clearly one that goes right to the heart of the aspirations of the international community reflected in the sustainable development goals for those of you who haven't memorized all of these sustainable development goals and associated targets goal sixteen refers to the ambition of creating a peaceful and secure world by 2030 and a building the accountable and responsive institutions needed to underpin that world and that like motherhood and apple pie that's clearly something that we we all want to see getting from where we are to that destination is clearly not a straightforward journey but that is the challenge I which will be at the heart of the presentation that we're going to hear today I think it's self-evident that the European Union has a critical role to play in advancing the international security and development agenda both by virtue of its diplomatic weight in foreign policy initiatives in the peaceful resolution of conflict in reconstruction rebuilding societies affected by conflict as a development actor that is has the potential in the financial resources to make a difference with respect to the sustainable development goals and of course in the arena of foreign policy in diplomacy more broadly the challenges however are immense their immense on Europe's own doorstep if you look at the Ukraine crisis which is a really has become one of these frozen conflicts where there's been very little movement and the European Union hasn't necessarily distinguished itself as a major actor in in brokering and advancing peace in the Ukraine if you look at the Middle East region and the Syria crisis the crisis in Yemen the these are ongoing in part because we haven't had the diplomatic impetus the political leadership to broker the the type of settlement that needs to happen if you look beyond these immediate conflicts now i should add of course that the Syria conflict to thrown up a refugee crisis which now threatens to unravel the European project in a sense so Europe's failure to adopt a clearer and stronger position in relation to that crisis has wider ramifications if you look at the Sustainable Development Goal agenda whether we talk about the ambition of eliminating one dollar ninety poverty by 2030 ending avoidable child deaths getting every child into secondary school the countries that are farthest off track or each of those goals are fragile and conflict-affected countries so the challenges are absolutely immense it does strike me that the responses to these challenges have to involve collective action I think it's clear that countries acting alone are not going to be able to bring sdg 16 within reach in any particular part of the world or in relation to the sustainable development goals it often strikes me that one of the invidious aspects of being a commissioner is it's a little bit like the UN that it's very easy to clock to you to look around the world at every crisis and every failure and to point the finger at the United Nations you know the United Nations could have brokered a settlement the United Nations could have done better in framing the SDGs the UN could have done better in rebuilding societies affected by conflict but but actually with multilateral institutions you get what the Member States want and what they allow to happen and I think one of the challenges for commissioners is to work in an environment where you don't necessarily have a unified voice behind you in the form of you know a clear commitment to collective action on the part of a political leaders in the Member States so against that backdrop Commissioner we very much look forward to hearing your comments the floor is yours for 15 minutes thank you ladies and gentlemen distinguished participants dear development community friends I would like to thank the Overseas Development Institute for inviting me today here our topic is of immense and immediate relevance for politicians for officials and for ordinary citizens equally promoting peace and security is an area where the european union with its all Member States should be a global leader where the added value of collective action seems obvious and much needed in today's world however too often the european union of has difficulty to arrive at a strong collective effort and impact why is that and how can the european union become more effective in this area let me share some of my thoughts from the you development cooperation perspective for development actors security and peace building is not a new arena but it has definitely acquired new relevance and urgency it is no accident that diseases strongly highlighted in the new 2030 agenda for sustainable development without any doubt addressing fragility and conflict is and has been central to development effectiveness today traditional concepts of developing policy and the systems are being challenged hugely under pressure from unprecedented crisis and burst or violence and different forms of threats both inside and outside the European Union we face complex security challenges that undermine development and weaken States including terrorism trafficking in drugs arms and human beings money laundering cybercrime and threats to critical infrastructures we face increasing demands to address the root causes of irregular migration and instability and to step up our efforts on security related issues where are we at significant parts of the EU s external assistance are already targeted towards security and development challenges around thirty percent of our overall development assistance is spent on governance peace and security EU engagement in fragile states has increased over the years both in scale and scope today it presents more than fifty percent of EU development funding peace and security related initiatives have regularly been taken within various regional strategies the future framing of relations with our partner countries under the cotonou agreement will inevitably include a discussion on how to strengthen the EU s response to the security challenges particularly in Africa but engaging in the complex linkages between peace security development is a challenging terrain and there is no golden bullet to become more effective we need to be both more comprehensive and holistic pulling together all our resources but also more targeted using better our instruments and tools firstly we need to work better together and in a more strategically in 2013 we defined an EU approach to external conflicts and crises to guide collective actions across European Union institutions and member states we will report on the results in the coming month analyze the gaps and define further targets in this area we are also currently engaged in broader consultations on the new EU global strategy which will update and replace the current EU security strategy this is an immense opportunity to rethink and reshape how the European Union works together with its member states and other partners at a global level and to give development cooperation a proper place in the overall multilateral setup secondly we need to refine our tools and make them fit for purpose we do have good examples like the instrument contributing to stability and peace it enables the European Union to address some of the most pressing security concerns such as terrorism piracy and biological and nuclear threats we have many success stories over how our instrument for democracy and human rights helped strengthening the human rights peace justice and the rule of law frameworks and in supporting human rights defenders all over the world we have also established trust funds for Syria for the Central African Republic and most recently the EU emergency trust fund for Africa to be able to act more effectively in specific crisis situations at the same time we are fully aware that further efforts are needed at EU level to ensure more coherent and effective instruments and action a good case in point is our current work on the capacity building tools for security and development to enable our partners to prevent and manage crises by themselves this includes improving cooperation between civilian and military actors within the European Union but also engaging more with the security sectors of our partners as you can imagine this is quite a challenge and demands carefully careful reflection as so as to find legally and politically sound solutions from a development perspective we need to keep our eyes on the key price the long-term development of partner countries and expansion of opportunities for people especially girls and women to live a decent life and have their basic needs met and link to this to build upon strong viable democratic institutions that serve their citizens where do we go from here the recently adopted agenda 2030 he is recognized well that there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace and security without sustainable development global goal 16 building just peaceful and inclusive societies is now fully embedded in the sustainable development agenda and rightly so this is an important step forward and our new chance an invitation to strongly focus on conflict and violence prevention piece and resilience building and impetus to win and better manage peace rather than crisis and to build a new narrative around the development cooperation and its role in the security agenda to be able to do that we will also need to understand and address the root causes better by improving our evidence base and analysis but also we will need to use untapped potentials better like by including more women in negotiations and peacebuilding efforts and in decision-making processes better defined and measure outcomes and most importantly create more synergies in the password of EU structures instruments pillars and internal and external actions peace and security agenda will be increasingly at the heart of the European Union's external relations and the role that the european union wants and needs to play on the on the global stage today's word requires leaders and allies not only to fight against violent conflicts and insecurity but to wage peace and the rule of law for the European Union and its member states including the UK one known remark from serving stone Churchill can still sound so pertinent there is at least one thing worse than fighting with allies and that is to fight without them so we all better get to it in unity of efforts at the European Union level and in a collective action with partner countries with European United Nations and other international partners and of course civil society organizations which must continue to play a major role thank you very much Commissioner thank you for providing us with such a comprehensive overview in such a short but well directed keynote address I'd like to pass over now to to introduce Beverly and who is the director of conflict and human security in ended and as a 16 years experience working in different in different parts of the world and Beverly the floor is yours thank you very much giving em um you'll be disappointing to hear that I very much agree with most of what the Commissioner was said doesn't make for that help you debate but I'm sure Anthony will come in as the disagreement I'm very pleased to be here to be able to respond to the commissioners points thank you very much for the invitation and I very much agree with him that insecurity and instability are two of the main barriers to reducing poverty this has long been the case but never more so than in the recent past we have made progress on economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries in the last 15 years but this has been during a time of relative peace and security the last five years have seen an increase in global conflict and violence including violent extremism and this is clearly set to continue in the next 15 years so we expect to continue making development progress but the very poorest people will be the hardest to reach by 2030 we estimate that sixty-two percent of the world's poor that's a billion people it's really hard to imagine a billion people isn't it will live in fragile states compared to forty three percent today there are over 50 1 million people living as refugees from violent conflict which is the highest figure since World War two so the challenge of helping those in the greatest need is growing this is a global problem which requires a collective response within the UK government if it's made a strong case that building stability overseas is in the UK's national interest that's a clear theme in the UK strategic defence and security review we call it the SDS which the Prime Minister recently launched in November as the prime minister said then our aid budget is the act not only of a moral nation but of one that cares about its own security broken or conflict states tend to produce huge problems for issues as at home as well Ebola is one such example where the UK took a leading role tackling a difficult issue head-on and helping to prevent a regional problem from turning into a global crisis that's true of diff its work on peace and security in the SDS are difficult to spend at least fifty percent of its budget and fragile states and regions in every year of this Parliament this reflects a shift we've been making since 2010 we are focusing on the toughest areas to stop problems developing and to ensure that no one is left behind on national interests are served by a joined up approach focused on supporting peace and security in fragile states the same is certainly true in an EU context over fifty percent of development in fragile states is delivered through multilateral institutions like the EU and it's not just in the e u--'s interests for this to translate into a strong collective effort so in the interests of all aid donors and recipients we believe the EU has an important role to play in promoting peace and addressing the drivers of instability in the world we agree with the Commissioner that an effective response requires close coordination with member states bilateral work and complementary with other international and regional bodies like the UN and the AU that you use wish for a stronger collective effort could be aided by a more compelling narrative of where the EU adds value in conflict prevention crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction we believe this could be informed by strategic assessment of recently you initiatives as well as a structured approach of documenting the results an impact we would encourage the EU to expand its evidence base it was great to hear the commission to talk about this approach to development interventions related to that we welcome the EU's setting up of a research and evidence facility to support its trust fund on tackling migration in Africa by building the evidence base for its programming and sharing this knowledge with others EU will take greater steps to better collective action separately we would hope to see better coordination between the council's activities in the UK we've improved our joint efforts through a cross-departmental conflict stability and security fund which is enabled government departments including divid to better link strategic decision-making action on the ground and provide a framework for cross departmental action in fragile states a whole of EU effort could be achieved along similar lines making the best of its developmental diplomatic defence and law enforcement capabilities of Lisbon here the upcoming EU global strategy could provide a useful way of shaping and guiding this work the Commission are also rightly mentioned the global goals especially global goal 16 which highlights the interdependence between peace and development the commissioners right it's time to win the peace a peace building approach should be central to the EU strategy to achieve this goal in fragile and conflict-affected states I also agree with the Commissioner that just as peace building should be central to the EU so women should be central to peace building again we have a vested interest in this being the case evidence shows that women's participation in peace processes and decision-making results in agreements that are reached more quickly and are more lasting our secretary stated if it has put support for girls and women at the heart of the UK's international development work our new age strategy states that throughout all its development spending the government will continue to prioritize the needs of girls and women there may be various practical examples of this in 2016 because you know the UK is hosting the supporting Syria conference next month women and girls need to play an important part in this conference both in discussing humanitarian assistance and the future stabilization and reconstruction of Syria we also intend to take a strong position on promoting gender equality and tackling sexual violence at the first world humanitarian summit coming in May there are various opportunities in 2016 to support p security we hope to maximize our contribution to these and we will work with the EU to help them do likewise thank you thank you thank you very every I know you you have to leave us shortly so I and you can't save the question answer session so what what I would like to maybe just ask you a couple of questions that I'm sure somebody in the audience would have asked if you were staying right the first one relates to the tight side I think there's a broad agreement in relation to the STG that more needs to be down for fragile and conflict-affected States and there's a very strong commitment that you mentioned from the UK to to increase aid disbursement for these states that is often easier said than done because you these aren't states with budget systems that are designed to absorb rapidly increased flows so I so the first place is what do you see is the different delivery modalities in order to achieve the correct that's been set and the the the second question I wondered why he was really on the humanitarian system which obvi has a key role to play in this area and it seems to be that it suffers from twin deficit which is an overall financial resource mobilization problem which we see every year in relation to Syria crisis and it is great that the meeting next week will address that but it's also what some people would see is you know as an insufficiently inclusive system that many of the actors who could make the greatest difference might be local actors regional actors who tend to get a small part of the pie through the system so those two questions they you know the mechanisms are delivering more aid too fragile states and how do we build a more inclusive humanitarian system thank you very much um thanks on the first question how do we how do we spend our money in fragile states it's something that we have been doing gradually as you know I'll our commitment in 2010 was around thirty percent and we've now committed to scaling up to 15 to be honest it's the language is also around regions as well because it's pretty clear towards that some of the she's affected all the countries next door to those with fragile states particularly with them with the forced displacement of people so um we we have got a number of modalities and if it as you know we've moved away a lot from the direct money to government's the direct support under this under this government that we have at the moment in the UK but there are a number of modalities that we have in in the number of these countries we have a big divot office so we manage money ourselves we manage our own projects and programs in some of these countries where we don't have an office we're looking at the moment on what those options should be and where we have a presence on the ground and where we spend through others differ explains a lot of its money through others more than fifty percent of our budget is spread through multilateral organizations so we'll look for the best mix we can on some of these and it was interesting to me moving into this job being quite new is a lot around the evidence we've got and how sometimes that's quite patchy so building in really strong monitoring and evaluation on these programs is really important to us so that we can get evidence of what goes wrong and where we can aware we can best spend so we've got we've got a number of options we spend to NGOs we spend with the multilaterals or we do it ourselves and we run our own programs and we run programs to others we are doing less of that giving money directly to governments and obviously in fragile states that isn't possible anyway what we are always keen to do as ever as as we all are in development is help governments strengthen their own institutions and that's something we're really keen to do but doing that and fragile states is obviously really tough but something that you know we're trying to do in places like Somalia helped help the government strengthen itself in its systems right and I'm the humanitarian system yes we have a World Summit in May we are working really hard to achieve great things in that we hope everyone who works in the system is helping us to do that the more voices we can hear the better I am flying to Geneva this evening because tomorrow all the donors and all the humanitarian agencies are meeting and it will be high on the agenda financing is a big part of that agenda and getting better financing and more predictable financing for crises is a really important part of what we're lobbying for at the world humanitarian summit we need more predictable financing going around with a begging bowl every something bad happens in the world is not an acceptable way of financing in a modern world so we are pushing hard in the international system to make the financing better and we hope to achieve great things in the summit in May we need as many voices supporting that as well now and I just push you slightly on that if you had to define to concrete tangible great things but you would want to come out with some it won't they be particularly on financing we want more predictable financing we're looking at what the tractive crisis might be there's a number of issues we're looking at on that financing one of them we've got a paper on cash in using more cash where possible that's another one of our big papers we're putting into the summit so there's a number of options we're looking up yet okay ready by my Beverly thank you and don't just to let any journalists among you know that when Beverly walks out in whatever it is 15 minutes it's not walking out in protest of anything you feel from the European Commission so um exactly what other people might walk out then but Sir so let me pass now to aunt Lee Smith who's the CEO of the Westminster foundation for democracy thank you very much Kevin and thanks for the invitation to join you and Thank You commissioner for I thought you were not going to use the word but you did use the word democracy once I think in your in your remarks at least democratic so I have some peg on which to pin my my comments and it won't be surprising given the organization that I work for that I want to focus on democracy both in terms of values but also in terms of the way in which we as development actors work in in practice I want to agree with you I think Commissioner that it's important to address democracy as part of addressing root causes of conflict and instability and insecurity I'm not sure you said exactly that but I think that's what I took from your remarks and from papers from the Commission and agree that the global strategy is a good place to think about how to do this there are lots of instruments that the U has to work in this field but a clear and coherent analysis of how effective those are would be helpful and I also would agree with you and with Kevin what you said at the beginning that girls 16 is important i would say that goal 16 doesn't solve everything i think it's interesting that in the same way Commissioner you use the word democracy once it was I thought revealing that the resolution in the General Assembly that adopted the SDGs only used the word democracy wants and that's a contrast to the millennium declaration the millennium declaration 15 16 years ago now said a fair bit about democracy it's called for democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people that's language that's more or less from the Universal Declaration on human rights it made a commitment all of the countries in 2000 committed to implement the principles and practices of democracy and respect for human rights so that was quite a strong commitment whereas in the resolution on the sustainable development goals there was a bit of language about a vision which countries had that at some point there would be Democratic evidence so for me I think the first thing to say is that it remains important for us in Europe to focus on and not not forget the importance of democracy and democratic governance and democratic values we are our organization as a values-driven organization we believe in democratic values I think the second point I would make is that there is a contribution a distinctive contribution that Europe can make in these areas we have to be frank had a lot of practice at managing the challenges of internal conflicts within our own countries within our continent we've had practice at addressing authoritarianism the abuse of power by the executive and that that experience has led to a position now which while a long way from perfect is pretty much as good as it gets in terms of forms of governance which are reflecting the will of the people and preventing the abuse of power so I think that we we have a variety of experiences which are which are useful and which we can can share with others and I think that the issue for us is how best to go about about doing that and again I think Europe can can make a distinctive contribution I think that we have a tendency and approach a culture which is not to shout about those issues as loudly as some shout about them to recognize that there are many ways of addressing the problems of effective governance and to be willing to share those experiences and to allow others to reach their own conclusions about the right models for them I liked the text which I was reading just before the meeting started from the think think tanks document about the global strategy which recognized that political change is essentially domestically driven so the way in which external actors can try and address governance issues has to understand and recognize that and I think Europe can do a pretty good job in recognizing that addressing governance challenge is a very long term process which requires patience and we need to reflect that I think in the global strategy and in the instruments that that we use second area of specific contribution that I think we can make is that Europe can and should I think more than it does at the moment address politics directly in general I so work with Beverly and DFID and I think it's probably fair to say that you know we we dealt with the executive on the whole we didn't spend a lot of time dealing with Parliament's and political parties and the the mantra that you hear in the democracy strengthening community is that development people aren't interested in accountability through Parliament's and parties that's obviously an exaggeration but there's an element of truth in it and I think that while some organizations like DFID I think are pretty far ahead in understanding the political context they work in actually addressing the problems of the political system directly is something that we could do more of and I think across Europe we could we could do do more of that and then finally I think that we need to get the balance right between the sort of political engagement that we have with countries whose systems are poor that don't respect human rights as as much as they they could that do not have strong democratic governance so the balance right between the way in which we address those the leaders in those countries and the work that we do to build a capacity of the organizations that can change that we have as an as an implementer of programs a lot of work in many countries which are very poor Human Rights records and democratic practices but find partners who are willing to work with us on sometimes relatively small things which can be catalysts for a bigger change in the future and at least lay the ground for change so those are the comments i want to make thank you thank you look let me just them maybe I should get cup of area so you to elaborate on that one or two the points you made it you know that the I guess is there's a broad view across government which is reflecting the golden thread narrative so you know this is one of the areas that is a precursor to development if you get it wrong on democracy and institutions other things will fail I guess the question is is aid an effective instrument what realistically what difference does eight make to the promotion of democracy human rights or strong institutions are other concrete examples or practices that you would point to where where I can make that difference depends Kevin I think if you're talking about does having a big aid program in the country in itself help deliver democracy not necessarily and I've been on a panel with somebody from ODI in the past who was very challenging about the evidence on a link between development and democracy and I don't think anybody I said we're a values-driven organization we believe in the ability of democratic systems to protect human rights and promote that but don't see delivery of development in itself as addressing Democrat democracy on the other hand there is no doubt that there are parts of the political system we work with Parliament's and parties but of course working on rule of law issues on the media supporting civil society all part of the picture there's no doubt that resources can help help those in those systems that are trying to reform the practices what's interesting for me in our organization is that the resources are not large they're essentially about people connecting with people what what our partners like is to engage with peers so engaging with fellow parliamentarians or fellow party activists is crucial for them either in countries with European countries for example with more evolved democracies or in their region I think regional working is very important I think for the the for your app it is notable I think that you need to have engagement of national systems as well as the EU the national systems provide some of those pants thank you and so I'd like now to pass over to Simon Maxwell Simon is part of the ODI family former director is currently research associate he was also one of the lead authors actually the report that you held up from the European think tanks group so Simon over to you I was getting there are many advantages to not being director of ODI some disadvantages but I get more sleep one of the great advantages is of not being director is it gives me the opportunity to say in public how valuable OD eyes research on these topics are and there is a goldmine here which Commissioner you are able to mine on the politics of fragile states on humanitarian relief on issues like state building contracts in the aid world and one of the things that work does is to explode some of the myths about over simple definitions of democracy as an instrument for delivering change it is an intrinsic good Anthony you're quite right but we need to have a complex understanding of what drives change in fragile states and ODI has made a big contribution to that Kevin so thank you and i also want to celebrate the work of the european think tanks group of which ODI is a key member along with our colleagues in netherlands in germany and in france and this report that Anthony mentioned has a really good chapter in it which I had nothing to do with but is worth reading on the business of working in fragile states and we're just also working on the new global strategy and we've just done a piece which says the SDGs must be central to the new global strategy um I think the interesting question though is not so much today to talk about the theory but to talk about what all this means for the UK and Europe as partners we're about to face a referendum in the UK so what I want to do in the next four minutes left is to talk about what all this means for the referendum um does listening to this speech and to the responses make you more or less likely to vote to stay in Europe and what action should we take in the UK and what action should Brussels take to see whether there is more of a partnership and I suppose my starting point is the same as yours which is to say that collective action is the only possible solution to the problems we face does anybody think that we're going to solve the refugee crisis in Europe without really strong coordination between all the member states are we really going to abandon Schengen have barbed wire at every border across Europe and just multiplied tenfold a crisis that we already have so the collective answer action has to be the right answer to the problems but if you read the papers in the UK as i'm sure you do Commissioner EU in crisis is absolutely the dominant narrative and we're not delivering the foundation we need for collective action and sometimes it applies equally in the work we do in development on fragile states well I'm slightly more optimistic about that and there is definitely some evidence of successful EU collective action not always in this field but in Paris the EU and the countries of the ACP the africa caribbean pacific group 79 is it a high ambition coalition in paris which began to deliver change a north-south alliance cutting across the g77 which country boundary a huge success for the acp and for europe and i think we have similar examples that we can celebrate in this field and they play very strongly to British interests we in the UK Beverly I guess don't want to be mounting police missions in Mali the Central African Republic you know the Sahel generally nazare because those are not areas where we have strong aid programs but we have an interest and it's actually good news for us that the UK is supporting those we describe the EU in this piece we did as the best supporting actor we don't do the front line a military intervention perhaps thank goodness but we do do really important work backing up peacemaking with police and civil military is under the cfsp the common foreign and security policy and through the various instruments that you talked about when we achieve state building contracts we did an evaluation of those at ODI highly positive actually about putting donor money together into state building contracts so we need collective action it's not always as successful as we want it to be but there are some really good building blocks there what then does the UK do and what does the EU do to build a momentum around the collective action that we have on this issue of peace and security well Beverly I think you gave us some interesting pointers when you talked about the overarching narrative of the UK but also of the EU you talked about the importance of the SDG framework and so on I think the EU is going to get there with the mogherini lead security strategy and why doesn't UK come out very strongly and say we really want an SD g lead security strategy and we'll put the resources into it the EU has created instruments including the trust funds that you talked about why doesn't the UK say these trust funds are really a valuable way of bringing extra money into the system here's a couple of billion pounds over the next five years let's actually break out of the straightjacket of the multi-annual financial framework that the EU is landed with until 2020 and put additional money which will serve British interests but also serve GU interests let's acknowledge the reach and the size of what the EU can do and put some money into it and include better coordination now that's not enough because we know that successful collective action needs the right incentives it needs a high degree of trust and it needs the right institutions I think there are some things that you could be doing as well asking for help in these places working more intensively to put together the community of practice which links for example the think tanks the research institutes and policymakers around these issues finding out where collective action is opposed and looking at how the incentives can be changed to make it more feasible I think you need to demonstrate as an institution to the UK that you can be cost effective efficient effective deliver value for money in those institutions that means strong independent evaluation of the kind that we have in the UK with the Independent Commission on aid impact and it means really strong parliamentary accountability as we have with our international development select committee and as we are beginning to see in some areas in the European Parliament trust doesn't just happen it has to be built collective action doesn't just happen the incentives have to be right I think the building blocks are there but I think both of you need to behave slightly more assertively in building now to cross Europe and if you can do that just to cite Benjamin Franklin you cited Winston Churchill Benjamin Franklin said you know either we all hang together or we hang separately and we don't want to hang separately we do want to hang together thank you thank you I think when you said both of you you pointed to me but you meant over okay so thank you what I'd like to do now is to throw it Oh throw the discussion open for questions commission i will give you an opportunity at the end to come back on some of the points that have been raised i would ask that people keep the questions brief so that we can get as many as possible in i'm going to start at the back over here
