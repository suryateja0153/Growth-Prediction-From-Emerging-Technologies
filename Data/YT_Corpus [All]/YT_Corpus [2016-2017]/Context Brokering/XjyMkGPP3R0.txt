 hello and welcome to today's episode of the Mozilla curriculum workshop on this episode will be talking about physical computing and if that phrase is new to you then you are in the right place I can't wait to learn alongside with you as we talk and work with our stellar invited guests right before we start I want to share a few details logistics that should help the workshop go smoothly for everyone out there audience Lynn first if there are people in your social media feeds wondering why the show has not started yet please kindly ask them to refresh the landing page this should start the live stream for a second this is a participatory webcast and you the audience are a huge part of our energy and success so please ask questions and suggest ideas in the Etherpad the large editable document in the second half of the peach you can also participate in side conversations on the chat there and we will do our best to address the questions that you bring up as well as you're about halfway through the show we are gonna shift from talking to prototype trying to come up with some teaching and learning materials about physical computing to web and we totally acreage you stay with us into joining that party typing on the Easter pat and any documents that were one of our invited guests Jimmy Barnes to design architect at the scholars lab at the University of Virginia regrettably could not join us at the last minute tonight but we will plan to have him back on a follow-up episode about the Internet of Things later this summer you like what you learn about physical computing tonight you're gonna love that episode as well conversation will continue and speaking of continuing the conversation I'm gonna have things off to my co-host of here at all or interruption thanks as had mentioned I'm your guy from Mozilla's well and I'm really excited to be here tonight to discuss the Internet of Things WR joining and are no buses like me who are very new to the Internet of Things world are just eager to jump in and learn more and see how it can apply to us in the right spot and we we are collected a group of very exciting professionals from various aspects of Internet of Things world who are going to share with us their perspective on Internet of Things and how it relates to their work and what we might be able to build together so like Chad mention this is a very collaborative approach to creating curriculum and talking through Internet of Things so please jump in and share with us asked questions for our speakers and in the document indeed a pad on social will try to be where you are at security answers with you throughout the next hour so without any further do I want to start by introducing our speakers so I'm actually gonna start first with Natalie Natalie can you give me an introduction tell me a little bit about yourself what do you do and for the people like me what is physical computing to you sure so high I'm not only free right now I teach high school make each has a computing and programming and electronics 29 through 12th graders and guts I guess my journey there started with doing educational technology research in general and really really interested in the intersection of technology with physical tangible beautiful things and I think those are compatible at all and they're just interesting materials work with so and ended up going to share that morning so now I'm pitching and I guess physical computing to me is a little bit like that description of digital and physical together then projects that involve some tangible often have electronic so that you can get it something of a digital world into the physical and said maybe it's something that someone can interact with actually sense that person and it sometimes it's hard and sometimes it's your hubby projects just a whole bunch of things you can do with that but then I guess we're not getting an area of things yet hoping that description to start with so thank you and welcome natalie Andre I would love to intro you next and tell us a little bit about yourself what you do and what is physical computing to you paid their faults good evening or afternoon or morning depend on you are I'm located in the beautiful state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where I have the pleasure to work with clubs as a regional coordinator and jack-of-all-trades doing stuff related web literacy let's go computing and all sorts of creativity experimentation with technology for me physical computing is is when you finally have software that can kick things that you can basically it's like Lego blocks with logic so I can't really define it quickly but for me it's the most amazing thing I had with technology in a very long time I'm having extreme extreme fun playing with Cisco computing and if I had to try on my destination I would say that these call computing is about making dumps dumps physical everyday objects smart and I will leave the definition of smarts to someone else I think that's a cute in Georgia introduce to you play in the next part of this goes computing details a little bit about yourself where you're from what you do and what is go computing is to you welcome to create your own or elaborate more on what you think is as smart into objects into smart thanks so much for having me here I'm really excited to participate my name is G and I'm a grad student at the MIT Media Lab in the responsive environments group I'm also creative director of GB Tronix which produces these stickers and the goal of my research and jimmy is to create tools that enable people to create technologies and learn technologies using arts and crafts a little bit like what natalie was describing earlier and i guess i think im really excited about is not only how do we learn about technologies how to use them to express ourselves and turn what's in our imaginations into real and so building upon the current definitions for me I guess one way to look at Smart is maybe things that seem to come to life or have a mind of their own so one thing that's been very exciting to me when I add computation or electronics or code to the physical things around me is that I can make them sensed my presence can make them tell when I'm touching or blowing or even just looking at them and then they can respond automatically in a way that non computational objects often do not and i think thats really magical it it really allows us to create things but do seem really smart but in the sense that maybe there's a life in those materials that wasn't there before thank you so much see those are actually three really great explanations to start us off and i really appreciate all that inside because they think he just boiled down to somewhere like a nobody like me that I mentioned actually you know really can explain not maybe to someone else thank you and now that we've got you rolling into question the man often over to Chad who's gonna continue the questionnaire of this part of the call yeah absolutely I will also say that my name is chat chat since I work as a curriculum developer Mozilla Foundation got that much reduction I apologize also remind people now is a great time if you haven't named yourself yet pat on the upper right hand corner about pat there's a little spot with a color swatch and either probably your name what you typed after or the word innate and if you just go ahead and identify yourself there that'll help us know who's saying what makes jet was kind of address your specific concerns one question that I would love to ask our guest tonight they have to say is this what do you think educators should know about physical computing what might be on the way why does it matter what is the why should we bring this into our learning spaces and how might get hit with some of the formal and informal teaching and learning that you see going on now inside and outside of schools practiced my teacher wait time winter I think one thing that's super important right now is that we're all we've got these devices that were using the getting more and more portable and have this cell phones and have access to screen all the time and for me physical computing is this opportunity to have ways of interacting with the logic and the intelligence and the connectivity of technology without necessarily being always glued to a screen that sort of a single person brightly lit distracting if the technology could be in other things you could have more natural interactions with them and once that you have more control of been versus used two screens bed a lot of us are struggling to figure out how to balance using screens all the time and really kind of world around us and i also think that a lot of the technology we use everyday I think that we can actually modifier cells into physical computing an opportunity to empower anyone to understand how technology works to make it for yourself to not a company to decide exactly how it's gonna work i mean i think thats really big if anyone wants to add to that was a great answer the following but gee I'm doing what do you think so maybe building on on that what's been really exciting for me about physical computing as opposed to Computing in general is exactly that off-screen component where you know you look around at the objects around you and your used to them being kind of static and there's a really magical moment when you see something light up that you don't expect to use you sound coming from a place or a material that you don't expect and that magical interaction is what so powerful about technology to begin with it is that it has closed where technology that sufficiently advanced is being indiscreet indistinguishable from magic I think that still holds true because there are many places but don't have these technologies and then it's up to us to decide where to put these and it's up to us to create means new technologies not just the company is not just the engineers and the other thing is I've been doing research on this sense of wonder wonder is what wins the prize causes curiosity and I think putting these technologies in new places is more opportunities for wonder and that leads to perhaps more curiosity which will get more people like myself one of these people to suddenly become interested in computation when I wasn't before it wonders of fantastic motivator in this case I'd rate would you vote you add to the conversation first I'd like to say that I'm printing both definition isn't raining down behind me and I love this idea about the magic and wonder about it because I remember reading a programming book that changed my life and they said in the book on the very first like the preface of the book where computer programs were like spells that cause of behavior and change the world and the thing is that this computing is like spells that case you can actually carry four friends on the living room so its motion forward with this idea of like being a wiser than creating things in ninety making things if you're busy check like Disney Fantasia was all about making stuff and decided that we can have this whole sense of wonder and giving life to Dumbo projects this very powerful and I think that brings engagement to teaching scenarios and educational scenarios so that you can actually teach basically any subject through the lens of physical computation and experiments on but something that really I think they can really empowers non traditional teaching methods and that's basically what I want to use that kind that stuff for everything because I just want to be immersed things so I'm basically stealing the previous kind of the wonder in the tangible magic again these are great motivators I think in space Amir what do you think we should follow I just feel like I've been taken back to that you know little kid inside washington's knee and Fantasia says everything about that seemed so young and spirited and and magical it was the repeated where it I think like a few times and so it it's really nice to see the overlapping beings but really bring it kind of feels like we're bringing out that you think it'd inner self amongst us nice so the next question really wanna fall but that is what needs opportunities and challenges do you see right now in providing learning state resources about physical computing essentially especially as a gateway to Internet of Things so I know that that's a little bit of a worry a weird question but I really want to see how we can address those what are we seeing the opportunities the need and where the challenges that were really seeing around this field as it slowly evolving and its gonna call me continue to evolve I'm gonna ride the silence the awkward silence so I need to say something different context here because we are emerging or submerging country depending on who you ask which means that access devices use it and discovered up scenarios is hard the devices are extremely explosive here so our largest challenged these go computation is that we cannot leverage all the models of amazing little boards available everywhere also most of the teaching resources are not available in all languages which prevents many people from accessing those are the challenges but the opportunities that Brazil is basically the force smartphone system in the world liking your number like this kind of big microphones horrible and if we could find a way to like reporter posed no devices experimental stuff that's already in the country that it might be more visible so what they see here in terms of challenge is that it's tricky to get devices and it's treated to get localized resources but what I see in opportunities and gateways is that to check corruption schemes are used to it that there is no people in the whole world that's more creative than that we are very creative and if we put all that creativity into repurposing old hardware and creating our own boards and create our own resources we can have teaching resources for fiscal computation that can be replicated in other emerging countries then that's where I'd like to go so writing on that answer I do agree even coming from the perspective of someone who creates tools it it can be very challenging to get them get them to certain parts of the world even if the tools exist and so one thing I'm really interested in is i mean actually taking a step back I think it's magical that we can have this conversation right now in all these different places all these different time zones and and share this information very seriously that somehow used that the that to leverage but rather leverage the fact that we did exchange information so freely to to somehow maybe news that two and four use local physical resources maybe that's what you're saying so share the idea that spirit and the philosophy and then trust in people's creativity and with their local resources to create tools that are relevant to them rather than trying to create the same resources that are going to be used everywhere which is perhaps hard to do maybe that's why were you actually another another and I don't know how this would work but maybe if we can't make the specific tools if we can make the tools to make the tools like if we can't have the exact same boards can we at least all have milling machines to mill board and then and then go from there is is the one level up slightly easier to just share as a question yeah I think I think tooling is especially important physical computing and understanding the variety of materials you can use to create armatures and scaffolding and circuitry really wow I just wanted to vent really courteous to jump in physical computing can be like a really big topic if there is an example we can share something we could go straight for you just let us know if you'd be willing to share line 32 on the Etherpad aha moment something you may discover click to work in you have that sense of wonder and magic we've been talking about her agency we'd love to hear from you like over there was no imagery and again you can Skype those in line 33 of the Etherpad and as those kind of pop in maybe now is a good time to start transitioning shifting to prototype so during this part of the show we're gonna join our guests and trying to prototype quickly create a resource for teaching and learning on the web about physical computing and it might be at school it might be design documents might be a tool that makes the tool right we're gonna try to you think through a few ideas maybe pick one recent consensus on something we could all happen together the pieces and we are going to try to do our thing close to keep up the conversation as we work and you can find that we're right on the pad will be prototyped being around line 49 or so after we do something together at 1:43 will also link out to any other tools or sites or resources that were using that are online and you can just join in thinking you can join in the questioning you can be active in the pad in the chapter and if these documents as well as audience members so we looked at some ideas that interested our guests ahead of time with a pre-show survey and I thought I might just invite guests to give like a brief description of what they had in mind we have is that our online we're not all in that same workshop working together so we'll try to figure out something we can make some forward progress on together over the web site throughout the webcast so bad service she would you tell us a little bit about you were a synchronous video platform for sharing projects yeah so I guess one thing that I found in my own research is that you get so much more when you have an actual person in front of you talking and and I've used when I create video tutorials I use this when I learn from other people's video tutorials and things like that and I don't feel not so much happens we can all get together and have a conversation like what's happening right now but it's really hard to get everyone to sit down at the same time as you I'm sure you know trying to herd cats so I wonder if there's some way to have a little bit of both are you have the richness of a conversation but you don't have to coordinate having everyone present at the same time I don't know the video is what if that is the most important part of this conversation or something else but I wonder if you can just having video as a medium for conversation could would be interesting and you can the other cool thing about me is you have audio you have image you have all these other mediums at your disposal when you when you use this form of communication and it reminded me of kind of like Instructables meet stack overflow with like a super friendly community kind of feels very very interesting idea now to lead you want to talk about the internet of hugs which is a fantastic time share I want to say that I love GV idea I think the asynchronous part of that is so interesting because you're coordinating people is hard but it could just be like here's a snippet of my progress and then people are coming back to it may be leaving videos I think it's just very interesting so I think that one but the internet about this is something I've been interested in for a long time it's bitterly these ideas this idea of using physical computing and the Internet to be able to interact with someone or communicate with somebody at the distance so some kind of physical object like a little flag and you can lift up a little flag and then on the other end of the world your friend with little will see their little flags and so anything that's a connection to keep people connected to the distance that customizes to their particular interest in saudi and I have done some work like specific objects like this but I'm fascinated by the toolkit to make that kind of connection really really easy I think that invent all kinds of things around if you just had one little bit of communication that can go activate a physical objects morals a toolkit i think is very important in a good skills spread opportunity for the internet of hugs right because then it gets into the hands of people who might need support and identifying the resources they need the steps they would need to follow now the only kind of energy in a classroom like replace that old postcard paradigm we're not that close actually have this connection the physical connection under a thinking about half of them will correct yeah basically the whole ideals we do have lots of devices mainly off the kids that we have that we are currently using for Internet of Things such as all the little bored we're playing we're like Rus Baer pies are the Wii knows that sells phones and I boorda week but they do have lots of smart phones that are pretty capable I would like to see if I could maybe like great experiment that would go like from the fallen into the device and maybe the other way around something that we could start inserting more of our current devices the experiments that's basically what I was envisioning I do have some I do have a really really really nice your teeth bleaching kit here that has like rage into my computer and I can do things like when you receive what we do this and that physically and that would allow me to you basically connect the phone into other devices over wi-fi network connection or some service integration that I think brings think I'm trying to build here is that if you deliver like kids like a box so person and they have this amazing pieces that they can connect them play together like old amazing stuff is in the box the stuff I have at my home is not amazing so if we can start making that little box interface with the amazing stuff that we already have a round then people might be more encouraged to try things out when I was a kid I would basically be disassembled every electrical device at my home to see how it works I never figure out how it worked and I always broke everything but it was a powerful notion that could actually disassembled and makes things that they would like to see that kind of stuff happening more so all those are pretty disposable these days and powerful and I would like to play with them along with our other kits that's really that's really interesting especially about providing access to physical computing and IOC experiences Internet of Things experiences in places where other kinds of mobile devices or computers laptops desktops are widespread are you gonna come into contact with them on a daily basis weekly or monthly basis this really interesting and thinking about areas of overlap would have been interesting to think about how we could make kind of a kid in a support mechanism for Internet hugs kind of connection that maybe add apps are recycles or reuses if not phones or technical devices things with my final rounds homes classrooms things like that but what are people thinking what's a good direction to go I think one thing I'm really curious about Andre you mentioned having a particular tool kit and all this interesting stuff on your desk and I think it might be kind of cool to pull our knowledge of what boards are out there now what would you need to make it possible for plug-and-play and so on and if we started like collaborative document we started putting like oh so you have a following the little blue to light blue being thing there's also this new with the company's color changes in particle lightning and there they have made this device that connects directly to cellular networks you can reuse that network that just kind of always on always connected but then your feelings are you connect to the internet as you said so maybe having things to the cheap way to do this and I'm sure like Oh no little bits and pieces of it we can put that together to start with specific but that's just a starting point was you know making what would make any of these ideas possible design document for a possible care that may be listed a couple different options awards but also materials you get used to it pieces there is a document made in the line 59 of the Etherpad we can kind of spent on this idea share resources and then house we're kind of assembling the list materials but also baby practices are resources people could look at audience members it would be great to have you on that document asking questions or or adding comments to the side like I've never heard of this board but maybe after hardly know why what makes one better than the other where where can I find these things where do you get like really practical questions about how you might source begin to play with some of these things those would be fantastic clarifying questions for us to have them that documents it really helpful as designers of teaching and learning materials that we want to share and have been used to remain useful to people so I think that would be the asked if we jump into that GTI and can do our best to think aloud about what we couldn't is required cereals and why if our audience and keep pushing us with you know why that one what does that do to really interesting interactions sound good alright so let's do that got an audience with it and then as I'm out here and I will try to continue to ask a few questions from the child and had as well that haven't been addressed alright I think that that document mike Beebe you only so while you open it may be in the in the hang out here we can actually start chatting about what would we need to make this possible what materials and you know even further thinking like how could we make it economical in the sense of what Andre was bringing to the table as well want to start up again before we start jumping document all of these ideals listing resources mostly because I treat mobile devices I have two boards like Pokemon I need to catch them all and I'm eager to discover new stuff I just had to dock appear to be the only for me so if we're going to start chatting I can start doing my infomercial of the devices I have here which there are lots of devices that because she we face hearing real a difficult situation where basically to teach some aspects office like physical computing when you're dealing with development there are lots of barriers here so first first barrier people have no idea how to program second barrier they don't know english is the language that most programming language they come from second some people are actually illiterate then came freedom rights even in Portuguese which makes it kind of difficult situations so how can we ease them into physical computing so is there like any kid where people can just assemble stuff without a computer without programming one kid like that really enjoy is the once from little bits they allow meets you just blog stuff with magnets and I can have some quick working twice that people can be amazed if I can actually build this thing and then we can start moving down slowly slowly inch more complex situation so basically here I have the little bit jets your comments like was 18 bits and I love them all and this is the one that we can do like workshops and explorations withhold any programming that's like my recommendation 40 if you have no idea what this computer is all about this press kit will get you and I'm sure that other kids that I love you it's just a simple things without programming or coding and I would love to learn more from you that more experienced that kind of things that I want to learn more about circuits tutors on on that invitation let me explain what I started stickers and a sample but I could write here if you go to TV Tronix dot com that's where you can find tickets diggers and the idea is that these are little stickers that are actually circuit boards so they're flexible circuit boards with electronics on them like LED lights or sensors or there's a programmable microcontroller and on the back of the boards is conductive adhesive so when you stick it down to something like conductive ink or conductive taper oil whatever you actually create a connection so you're building circuits but you're using stickers and tape and kind of craft techniques and craft materials and the idea that you would do it on for example paper so it feels like you're doing arts and crafts because you are but you're also build the electronic functional electronic pieces that's the idea there and one thing that I really i think is important is that once you create the circuit you can draw and personalize it and I think no matter what kind of technology you're creating it's important that you can make your own cause that's when you start to care about in you care about learning and making it work that's one idea there that's what their get-togethers are you can check them out yeah they're fantastic reviews them remember National Writing Project I think the document is ready to go so gently nudges over there everyone for your patience I'm going to screen share that documents the people tend to follow the action and then I'm gonna close a question from the chat so even though it's very difficult as you're working as a gesture audience member on the document itself adding comments you have an idea if you have a response to one of these questions these kind of jump back out share with us and then dies back alright I'm gonna go on screen share and I'll who's a question just a second now 30 off gtalk can read this no kids doubled support the internet off hugs back at 10 sorry there was another page via Google Docs is slow here sorry we're headed to that line numbers on your Google luck there is in that bronco Firefox that members night ok well someone that they also have an add-on that allows me to split the window so that I have two pages on the same screen hangouts on one side into Google Docs on the other side on the same deal also and also slow has anyone here know used kids from Sams lab yet I don't think so what is Sam's Club you guys here they create this amazing it it's like they don't let those little bits you can have this little modules each module has about three and a wireless connection I think it's good to so this is like this proximity sensor and then you have like mortars itself serves I create their service whatever and what you do is that to have like I'm not on your computer that allows you to connect those things on a campus on the apt and then they connect them wirelessly so you can have like up there on one corner of the room on the other hand tilting one will activate the other it's amazing I don't know if we're talking about those kids and the little bit kids as well because I see live music kind of two great effects reported citing novice traders in circuit designers and so there are a couple of questions in the pattern of trying to combine them and see what you think the first questions about what may be a good place it's kind of like what we're trading right now where's a good place for someone to start bringing computing projects into the classroom like what are some best practices are best projects to begin with that any grade level and then moving out of that could you describe maybe some pathways people take from beginner and you're reading it to advance in working with Cisco computer so where can people start in a in a classroom happen they bring it into their teaching and learning their day-to-day work with youth learners and then from there whether in that classroom those individuals go out into the world from beginner to intermediate I haven't answered that skips over the first question which Lisa Weightman said well but I have my last couple years teaching based around how do you go from beginner to intermediate treatments because I was surprised when I first started teaching that the types of resources I saw out there didn't work for all of my students and a lot of them were here is an example build this example and then tinker with it and see what happens when you change them and there were so many resources to do other things that were based on that model and it works super well for some kids and for others they were just lost because they felt like they didn't understand the concepts it working and they were really frustrated because they weren't getting structure scaffolding or any sort of conceptual grounding what they were doing and so I found that if I could build things up in logical steps it kinda helped everyone and then there came a place where the kids who like just starting to really weigh the advantages of being restructured sometimes when they wanted to and then the kids who did not feel comfortable with this message is generated change anything and see what happens eventually got more confidence and where they were more willing to experiment but I think you do wants at some point some kind of conceptual understanding what you're doing because sort of messing around in the dark will get you so far but eventually to be able to predict what you could do in the future that's a big help to also still trying to learn how to introduce more complex thoughts but for the beginning portion of the question I found that even just showing how to connect one led to one battery and getting it to light up that first time and getting it to work is very exciting for a lot of people and especially if you can put that first light moment in the context of then a project that they create for themselves or for their friend like turn this light into something of flowers a card whatever just that initial very quick success yet a lot of people excited and even surprised by like oh my gosh they got it to work and so I found that to be a really good way to get started just human simple single late and just very simple materials like wire copper tubing battery and then maybe I don't know maybe you guys have more that's almost where if you limit the number of materials very early on it actually encourages more exploration without being overwhelming and confusing so that's one thing as she was saying that I actually would slash mine was do you does that hurt anyone he remember games arcade like this very popular video about undress you shaking your head for you than for others as well here but then came the arcade was this revolutionary story of this young boy who built his entire arcade I think it was like cardboard and paper and he had people in the community come and visit of play with it and it was it was such a close maybe an aha moment myself and I think millions of other people who watch the video but it was like such limited resources that he was actually able to create this experience for himself and others so I'm kind of thinking about that is how can we actually limit the amount of resources and create that sort of experience in this toolkit and I'll share that video a lot it also that I found starting small discreet with clearly defined kind of outcomes and steps to build confidence but that you doing so creating some space for the risk-takers and explorers and I grew up in our class helps to my you might jump one or two steps ahead but was something of his new as wiring occurring at the same time at least at the middle school level you'll get too far ahead to come back and help us catch up to where r partisan issue the day's lesson to the next one now those are pretty neat tempo and cadence that lets you really interesting individually developed projects with multiple components later on was also fun we did what 11 project that really stood out something that was engaging for many students and which some use an artery and others who feels confident coding use little bits was to create little cardboard armatures forever because the protest spots and so they were small little box with messages they wanted school administration here and we set them up and operate on a table and make a little slideshow probably could have and should have granted onto a video production to share this kind of hyperlocal and and very middle school specifics but things like that that kind of creative expression I think it's fantastic yeah like tries trying to unmute myself so complimenting on that I don't know if that's my particular experience but I've noticed that if the devices or the things you have at their disposal of the learners like the look too complex organ look too expensive or two new people tend to be afraid so I do like working from scrap materials so people feel encouraged to destroy everything when I was a university we had like today its product called alt lab but that time was robotics with scrap material so basically all the computers and other devices that the university was trying away ended up on her lap and we were encouraged to build stuff that's out there are powerful because we knew that those devices were destined it to the dustbin sorry free broke down on the on the workload that that was not bad at all you were working with like 10 years old twenty years old computers and I think that may allow for some destructive creativity all learners side where they are not afraid to experiment I think that if they see this crispy kit they might be afraid but if we just have lots and lots of scrap material for them to their creation they might be more encouraged the trial actually I really like your point about being afraid and maybe even intentionally breaking things because this is whatever questions riva is in my experience I found that some of the best learning moments are when you're like really frustrated and it's not working and it usually doesn't work then you know a lot of people might come into an electronics project and expect everything to go smoothly but it really does I'm curious like when it does get frustrating and it's not working and you know it's a good thing but maybe not whoever you're working with like how do you support that cuz that comes up a lot does a lake about some they close to some writing done exactly that topic but building up over time like having having a middle school class 4a year for example never feels like enough time but over the course of that year kind of consistently encouraging since take risk to break savings to be ok with having things not work the first time and then there's a whole group of people going through the same thing can help you find what the 605 was a troubleshoot over time for many students that becomes more and more comfortable than I do think it's a sustained kind of culture you build a community built that helps with that and there are still learners who just remain on that but as the group gets better and better him than helping one another i think is kind of a lease facility after you have more time to help you still struggle with that mindset I really agree with that idea of building up to it and I think some coming into the classroom will have more of a background in its ok domestically and its ok to break it than others and for equity you kind of have to recognize that not everyone is coming from the same place there but I think that for me it's been interesting and noticed that some students I feel need a project that they can feel successful at at the beginning and feel like he was saying earlier some things like starting simple simple materials something that's gonna give you this moment of satisfaction that makes you anticipating more job satisfaction or next project you do and then you can easily take on more and more complex projects you know what it feels like when it works sometimes thats not immediate do for that year it's a combination of two things first call from my mind such where they're not only as a teacher facilitator but we're also like a host so I do have some stand-up routines memorized for those cases and if everything so I'll go with here where tried to break the moment there so that every once all of us laughing you start unwrapping it there is up extremely hard this horrible game called look horrible it's horrible in the sense that it's really really difficult it's an amazing awesome game called dwarves fortress where you stimulate the whole to our fortress and it's really difficult and the game Moto he's losing his fun you don't get me started on that one yeah check knows so they bringing that situation where frustration having your electronics project not work sparked off the front it's part of the puzzle memorize some jokes get prepared for the every single project but you're building if you're building for some instruction that your heart beforehand you know which one are your stress on the most awesome most obvious points where the project will fail so if you can create a funny situation or to order those points and memorize a little stand-up routine for when they happen because they will happen amazing to your learners things will be light and Sunday will be with the whole idea that breaking things is fun and you're breaking things were about to break through past the hour we have for tonight's webcast I just wanted to do everyone back to that it should be a really nice audience members if you have questions about particular technologies what makes it good where you get it what are some example projects please do comment those in the doctor on the report itself and this both both will stay alive and we'll try to answer those questions as best we can for you I did suggested a bottom maybe some things might still be neither things that could continue out of tonight's work will be creating facilitation I'd say this word or a handbook for some sample assemblies codes projects that might get people started in the internet and so that's certainly a direction that this will go in after this webcast I hope it does we will capture the Etherpad will capture the Google Doc will capture the chat and we will put those things into a gift of recalls in this episode which is just an open place where you can find the information and use it and a link to their recoveries outlines sixty one or two nights so that'll be more populated with more content America United States around a final thoughts before we have to say about tonight yes definitely I think that was a really robust discussion I just want to say thank you to all of our speakers who joined us tonight for really bringing in your different perspectives on physical computing and IOT and you know sharing how someone like myself who's less familiar with this area can really jump in and maybe use small ideas within my educational settings and learn how to make it through breaking out which I actually love to do so I love hearing that practice than other places too let's do a final round maybe one minute per person just thoughts about what we talked about areas you might want to explore and so do your personal next steps we don't also and I think it was probably educators who are really wanting to try something in there but they don't have people to talk to so it might be kind of cool to do some kind of mentorship or some kind of way that there's someone which are distributed a little bit so that it's not one person getting all the requests but maybe we can volunteer and say hey i'm happy to answer some questions or whatever that is and it's been great to be here thank you for having the key where that seems to always come up in our colleges mentorship really value and importance of connecting people and that cross sharing on a global level she wanna continue with your final thoughts yeah it's been super super interesting I'm learning all the time and from this conversation to that's a really cool trick yeah I agree I think it's amazing that why don't we do this more often and I agreed mentorship or communication or or sharing and and knowing that there are a lot of people out there that's just excited as you are about all of this I don't know I yeah I'm excited I i feel i wish there was more of this I want to know how to kill ya so thanks for having me here looking for you and all of our listeners I don't think this is the last of our physical computing and IOT curriculum workshop calls in fact adding this is the beginning of a long series on dirrty would you like to take us over and tell us your final thought we should discard last for like another five hours because I'm learning so much it has been awesome thanks all for having me here and I really really one for us to engage in the future wish mentorship if I don't know like discourse topics in our forum this whole idea of bringing people together is to also I have no words followed you all thanks your project after this call to watch games arcade cause I think he will be inspired by it and I didn't realize there was actually a follow-up video games arcade so if you are like me and did not know that if you like to watch it I did throw to use the last one but I actually forgot the Chad I would love to hear your final thoughts as well and really just to bring us home in the last minute yeah I'm just gonna offer final word of things for our guests with a
