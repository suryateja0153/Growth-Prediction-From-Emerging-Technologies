 this is the first webinar series today i will be covering how cloud is changing the business landscape and how as a new platform its enabling rapid innovation and disrupting existing business models my name is Christopher McCarthy Moore's I'm a cloud strategist within an IT I've been in the IT industry for 20 years and the past six years I focused exclusively on cloud computing along the way we'll have two poles I would really appreciate it if you take the time to participate in those poles and in order to have this webinar run as smoothly as possible I'll hold the questions until the end but please feel free to use the question mechanism and type your questions I will cover them at the end we have set time aside for a QA also if there is anything that you want to have a longer discussion on or go in depth with on the last slide my contact details are there please feel free to reach out send me an email give me a call I'm always happy to have a chat right so let's get into this cloud computing thing what's what's really going on many people are calling this the third platform along with mobility social big data and cloud that's really what we call the megatrends that power the third platform and when we talk about the third platform think about it this way the first platform was the main frame or the varieties of variety and computing the second platform was distributed client-server computing x86 or the popularization of IT this is as big a shift as when we went from mainframe computing to distribute it x86 client-server computing and so we call it the third platform and you could really argue that the platform powering these megatrends is cloud and and mobile social Big Data purely or just run on top of that platform so the core basis for a lot of these new trends we're seeing is really using the cloud as an enabler IDC estimates that through 2020 ninety percent of IT industry growth will be driven by the third platform and this year some seventy percent of CIOs will have a cloud first strategy I certainly know that a lot of the customers I speak to have a cloud or a cloud first strategy and I'll get back to later in this webinar as well what a cloud strategy could look like at least what it should contain alright so let's go a bit deeper on on cloud computing some of you will probably recognize this as gardeners hype cycle in order to make sure we're all on the same page I'll walk you through it hype cycle is a tool used to track the emergence and the maturity of new technologies in this context we will use it to have a broad look at cloud computing I won't dive into subcategories like infrastructure platform or software as a service but I'll simply take a broad look at the category of cloud computing so think about it this way if you start at the left hand side of the chart initially there's a technology trigger cloud computing as a concept is floated and quickly people start to look at the possibilities the promise of a new technology is widely hyped and Harold Harold goes as the fix too many issues even though it's not in scope vendors and providers try to lure in early adopters with exaggerated promises of benefits early adopters then fall into the disillusionment realizing that the technology is not yet mature and that the benefits they wanted are not currently realizable slowly but surely however the technology matures and people realize how to use it and what benefits they can expect this is when we climb up the slope of enlightenment finally the technology matures and we start to predictably realize benefits we reach the plateau of productivity in my estimates the plateau of productivity was reached in early 2015 maybe even as far back as late 2014 so there is no doubt that today cloud technology as a broad category is mature technology we also have a pretty good view now of what the benefits are and looking at benefits we've also learned that large scale cost savings may not always be part of that although certainly they can be realized in certain scenarios those of you who have milia would Garner's hype cycle and are currently looking at this slide will also realize that I've added something extra here we're looking at what we in a nightie call the double dip something that's been a bit unique for cloud computing even though the technology is mature and we know what benefits to realize and how to realize them we run into more problems problems that spring from complexity so let's have a look at what's going on here it turns out that even though cloud computing as a broad platform is mature at this stage there are a lot of considerations that are vastly different from running traditional systems having a multi cloud vendor strategy is vastly different from having a multi software vendor strategy and in the end almost all of us will have a multi cloud vendor strategy so if you run a single solution from a single vendor you may be able to reach the plateau of productivity and realize your benefits but as you start adding solutions and providers you run into complexity that complexities there are different approaches to security identity how do you manage SLA s across cloud vendors how do you deal with compliance legislation what would the safe harbor act recently and how does that affect me whereas my data stored who owns it and what is master data data management as a discipline in the cloud world it's a complex we've and in nit we've chosen to focus on three core disciplines to deal with our complexity security security and identity of key areas when adopting cloud you need to make sure that your data is safe and control access to it that goes hand in hand with compliance there are grim examples out there of key personnel in companies that have been terminated whether after Active Directory accounts have been disabled or deleted but they still had access to core cloud-based solutions and data that could harm their previous employer integration cloud applications never stand alone an integration to existing systems on premises and even between cloud providers is key last week I read an article by Forbes and they estimate that the integration efforts needed in the cloud era easily amount to a bigger project as a new ERP rollout and orchestration the more supplies the business has for different applications and systems the more complex and fragments that the architecture becomes having a multi cloud vendor strategy calls for overview and orchestration I realized that these focus areas will not solve everything in the cloud era but it's certainly a good start and with that I think we should dive into our first holes so which areas do you focus on when making use of cloud computing services course there are three areas we focus on mainly in an IT security integration orchestration if you have other areas you focus on please feel free to choose other but you can also use the question form and let me know what your key focus areas are that would be very helpful you you you all right that's right in line with what we're seeing in the industry Security's certainly a key concern when adopting cloud computing for the past two years in according to many research agencies it's actually been the primary blocker in adopting cloud computing security concerns on the other hand we're seeing a new tendency now as well where smaller companies are choosing to migrate to the cloud because the big cloud vendors can often achieve a higher security rating than they can themselves but thank you very much for all your answers so talking about security in an effort to reduce IT costs and accelerate business agility through more cloud computing seventy percent of CIOs will expose their enterprise to additional risk think about that for a moment chasing agility seventy percent of CIOs will not knowingly expose the rents prices to additional risk so why is that what is that agility they're chasing and and why would they bypass existing processes and thereby maybe exposing their enterprise to additional risk why they so eager to use the cloud for additional agility well it's it's really because we're looking at a business problem in a lot and IT problem and when we talk about disruption rate of innovation what's happening in the digital marketer marketplace there's really a lot going on here there was a Danish bank that recently did a study with mackynzie and they found that up to forty percent of their existing revenue would erode over the next ten years to what they call digital rebels and a lot of these digital rebels are really access that aren't even in the marketplace yet and when you talk about the many faces of digital disruption I've seen numerous slides that all use uber and Airbnb as the examples these really are the poster Charles for for digital disruption or new business models if you think about uber the world's largest taxi company that is centrally through an app and a smart business model essentially I've been able to build up a global taxi service now that going even further and threatening parcel delivery as well Airbnb and online accommodation provider again was my business model helping people connect to to other people that need accommodation renting out private homes one of the impressive things about Airbnb is they run some 10,000 servers in the cloud with a very small team of just 50 people that's really a forefront example of what some of that innovation and disruption that can be powered by the cloud some other good examples that one plus for those of you who don't know who won pluses it's a handset provider they build mobile phones this is a company that have come out of a number of new Chinese vendors and they're using their manufacturing advantages to take a new handset global from the outset so traditionally in this industry you're looking at geographic geographically limited launches but they took their product global from day one it's a business that's often dominated by carriers they sell direct to the end users they use purely social channels for marketing and they build a hype engine out of a limited supply mentality you had to pre-order and you had to sign up for a free order and also they listen very closely to their target audience and build products that they want they don't assume they know themselves so it's more of a co-creation model with consumers Tesla huge disrupt on the automotive industry going up to high-end disruption but also new approaches to product development if you think about the way a car is traditionally built it's designed expect then it's manufactured once is manufactured it's a finished product every car that rolls off the production floor test place and experiment they continually update their cars not just through software but also physically now they're doing a new fleet learning project where they challenge mapping and autonomous cars initiatives through using smart technologies and the cloud so some good examples of what's really going on and what's putting other companies on the pressure and this is why we see those CIOs chasing that agility in the cloud so why can tradition established players not just do the same if you're a large incumbent company why can't you use the same rate of innovation why can't you disrupt the business they face what I like to call the incumbents dilemma large incumbent companies are facing an onslaught from the digital world the rate of innovation is very high across a number of industries at the same time the barrier to entry has never been lower especially if you want to start the global digital business and globalization is only growing smaller players very agile because we're moving to an optics based economy cash holdings become less important when starting a new project on the other hand large incumbents have a number of factors that hinder them in facing these challenges they have many processes built up over a number of years itíll for instance is not a good fit in this world the culture may not foster innovation and speed they might have an existing technology install base that they have a hard time breaking with and that's always the fear cannibalization so how do you solve that if you're not a startup many companies choose to create dedicated innovation hubs within the businesses this is what from an IT perspective Gardner calls by more like T on Mackenzie calls to speed IT and that could be an approach so if we apply this to IT or even cloud adoption think about it this way you have two modes of operating your IT mode one is the traditional way you run IT today it's sequential process control focuses on safety repeatability and accuracy next to that then you set up the second mode maybe with a second-team to operate it and the second set of hardware setup operational guides you add that alongside the focus is on exploratory services and traditional processes must not get in the way speed and agility is everything the reason for adding a second mode rather than tweaking the existing IT mode is that they rarely meet it becomes too much of a compromise for both models you can't have it both ways so why is this mode important what's going on well I talked about the large incumbents dilemma one of the things that really hurt if you not have this quick startup like mode is the time to market of an advantage essentially your window of differentiation the time to market advantage is the window you have within an industry to improve upon an existing service to bring a new one to market in order to stay competitive in some industries this has gone from 18 months down to just three months three months to continually improve improve upon an existing service or bring a new one to market this puts tremendous pressure on other systems that support these these services a cloud is great in that respect because of the instant access to capacity but it won't help if existing processes and overlay supplies and slow down that capacity and that's why a lot of companies look at this bimodal approach to handle both things look after existing IT but also enable the innovation labs to get quick access to what they need and start up some fail fast projects one thing I'm a caution though in this mode of operation is that it may be useful for some to building a model for bringing a service from 02 back to mode one but as we move forward this way of operating IT services might become the new normal especially as we gradually phase out legacy systems right now this very agile mode along with the mix of services delivered by cloud is very small but over time it will be the other way around on my first slide I talked about the third platform where the first platform was mainframe think about this as the same journey we had when we went from mainframe to distribute a client-server computing at first people didn't believe that distributed client-server models were fit for enterprise applications today we know differently the same goes for cloud computing and keep in mind that the journey does not stop with infrastructure as a service this is a merely a stopgap mode for legacy applications custom development should take place on platform as a service and ready apps will be consumed through software as a service an IT functions will need to get ahead of this I talked about digital rebels and disruption going on the business and that pressure is hitting it's hitting the business and then maybe hitting the CIO but in many cases I T or the business will bypass IT and we see more and more examples of shadow IT popping up this cloud services become increasingly symbol to contract and consume and the bimodal approach may want maybe one way of getting ahead of this and with that let's move on to the second bowl what do you think is the biggest innovation blocker in a cloud-first economy and as with the first question if you have other here please feel free to use the questionnaire form and type in your answer there you again thank you very much for your answers I see most of you answered processes and for those of you are not already looking into it I highly recommend looking into modern service management I said ice or may not be a fit in this world there's a lot of people trying to put together new frameworks that may be a bit of a better fit in in the cloud world and although I'm a firm believe in setting up dedicated innovation hubs to support the movement in the market having the right approach is also useful and a cloud strategy is so useful starting point for that you can think about it across three main vectors readiness drivers and mapping that maturity readiness is usually assessed across people process and technology but in the cloud context it's very useful to also add your vendor landscape are your vendors cloud-ready and compliances of course important because you may be ready from a people process technology perspective but lives legislation in your industry may not allow you to use public cloud services and what are your drivers as i said earlier cost may not always be the main driver agility is by far the most common one geographic spread public cloud is great from that moving from a capex to an optics economy and seasonal peaks and applications can be solved by cloud and finally there's some great tools out there to map all of this gartner has a new maturity model and personally i really like the one from the open data center lines they have a cloud maturity model as well that I encourage you to have a look at and as you dive into cloud computing and and before I let you go today a few closing comments first of all please have a pragmatic and sensible approach to cloud I've been in this space for a while and I still fall in the trap of thinking everyone has the same baseline understanding of what cloud is and please maintain sight of the business goals much of this as we talked about this business driven and may feel uncomfortable from an IT perspective cloud brings with it such great promise as a platform for future innovation just have to make sure that we are not the innovation inhibitors and before we move on to the Q&A a little bit of advertising this webinar is the first in a series next we'll be covering security and identity in the cloud after that integration orchestration and finally we have a life sciences specific webcast in April where we'll also cover GXP and the cloud I hope you'll join us and as I said initially if you want to go deeper on any topic or have additional questions that we've not had time to cover here today please feel free to reach out I'm always happy to have a chat and with that let's go to the Q&A please use the questionnaire form and I'll cover any questions you come up with thank you you so we have a question here can I give some more details on modern service management well it's being worked on as a framework by a number of people across different organizations some of the founding members came out of the operations group that operates office 365 for Microsoft they have a LinkedIn group there's also a great mini white paper called eight steps to modern service management that i'll be happy to distribute it i didn't write it up a part of it but i recommend reading it through but essentially it's just a a more agile approach to to process if you will that more matches the need for for rapid speed and turn around alright let's see this is great thank you Richard and please feel free to reach out if you want to have a deeper discussion on that topic and with that I'll let you go thank you very much for your time today I hope to hear from from any of you have a great day or great afternoon wherever you may be thank you
