 each year Microsoft Research hosts hundreds of influential speakers from around the world including leading scientists renowned experts in technology book authors and leading academics and makes videos of these lectures freely available you okay thank you very much another parallel research talk I'd like to introduce my colleague Natasha millage frailing who is part of the computer mediated living group there she leads the integrated Sims group and she will tell us about her research project thank you very much thank you very much : now as what skully didn't tell you that I have a secret agenda here the objective of my talk really is to try to shock you now if I don't succeed in shocking you then I am actually very happy because then you all not know about all this that I'm going to tell you it's really about the way that we design systems and the way the people experience systems and what they think systems are doing and you have been probably aware of the privacy breaches and surprises that people get when they realize that they're being part of an experiment or they're part of sniffing around and profiling and so on but I don't think that that really message hits home until you see the empirical data or what is actually going on and so for today I just picked one example which represents a very widely used application which is a browser and just to understand a little bit what is it that people see and what is it what actually happens behind and what's the did gap between the two and really from the computer science point of view raises a big question about the transparency of design of computing systems and the value exchange that we support when we are designing these systems so to talk today is not going to introduce any dramatically new interesting algorithms they're going to be about empirical evidence for transformation that's happened on the web and to make us think about how we should convey to the user interfaces to the people what actually is going on so here I'm showing you this is typical experience that you go to a web site in this case is a New York Times website and we call this normally a first party web site because this is the side that you intended to go to so you can imagine you as a user sort of have you have a in your mind an image of what you website is and who you are dealing with a generalization and what is the value you can get from them now what happens is also on that website there are the bits and pieces that you may not be aware of and those are the other entities that are being involved they are all feeling the same page so they are feeling the same kind of real estate on the web with bits and pieces and those other ones that are involved and people don't know about because they didn't intend to engage with those sites we call them third parties so the simple kind of definition first party is very intended to do you think you're doing and then third party are other partners or other companies involved that I participate in the experience okay and now I will now go straight to a demo let's just show you what actually happens when you down on the web page I will switch to a demo of an extension of Firefox where the objective really is to show you what sort of things through say cookies may happen on your computer so I'm going to go to a New York Times the same company and so just as you go to New York Times as soon as the page is loaded you can see all these little bits coming off the screen all the top of the screen just fell down so these are all cookies that I right now downloaded on my computer now among these cookies there are some greens when there are some red ones most of them on retinas red ones now I explained in a minute but each bar represents a domain so the green bar here actually represents the cookies that were downloaded on a computer right now from New York Times and if you go to New York Times you can go and talk to them and they'll say yes I do need all these cookies because the site needs to work and if you click on this you will actually see this is the list of all the cookies they need it for site to work and you can say okay this is fine you need it to work and I'm alright with this but I don't really know what are these other domains go doing that okay so then you can start clicking on the other one so the next one here is double click so double click has only three cookies downloaded on my computer right now but what's interesting is the list of domains that are below that it says here in particular says one of hundred three other domains have the same cookies so what you're seeing here now is the list of domains that somehow he got involved while I was browsing while I browse on online okay so so that means that the same three cookies the double click put when I accessed new of times by put on all these other sites and then you ask yourself what are the cookies and what are they doing the simple thing and when I think about cookies is it's like a badge okay if somebody puts the badge on me so every time I go to a different site I have a badge and the cars look at me I said okay well I recognize this bed this is double click badge and this person was on U of x and then next time it was on easyJet and next time goes on I don't PC world so but that badge stays with me and whoever can pro for that badge can go and track me ok so there's basically what's happening you're on your computer for the same reason that you would need to communicate with websites in order to download the content the the websites are now probing into your computer and they're basically checking for these badges ok and based on that information they do what we call real-time tracking and so we are now talking about milliseconds we are now talking about milliseconds of collecting information and then provided that information for bidding ok so I will now show you another little prototype that we built from visualizing networks it's called know that cell so what we have done we gave this tool to a number of people so now eight individuals and they said give us your logs after a week ok and then we are going to see who has been involved in tracking you ok so I don't show you a visualization of the tracking network for one person for seven days and they'll just show you how it basically we do we analyze it ok so here it is this is a network that was created based on links between a website and the party the third party that the website referred to so the links here are from the green dots you see them here the green dots are all the website that the person visited and then the links towards the red nodes are the links that happen once you load the page and then in HTML there is this there's a link referral basically where you can refer to another party when the page is loaded and I will show you how example how it works so suppose you went to for calm he is for calm and that very moment when you are engaged with force these all the other parties get involved okay now some of these are red some of their purple and I explain them in what it is but say this folks is pointing to double click then you click on double click and then you can see which other websites have been connected with double click okay so a little bit about the structure of the network so pointer from A to B means that a node a refer to not be so in this case most of the green sites are pointing to the the trackers and then the trackers some of the trackers would point to other trackers and that is for example a double-click note so then number of these links going in from greens websites and then and then the point to the red ones because they're basically a broker so as soon as a signal comes from the website they pass information to the bidders and then the bidding happens in exchange and then of course the flow goes back and you you deploy the advertisements okay somebody like a purple note is slightly different okay in for this note you only have in links those are the links from the websites going straight to the say in this case is Google Analytics and there are no necessarily links going from Google Analytics outwards that means that the way that website is not necessarily broker but is just a collector of information so in this case this sort of a different third parties we know there are different roles it just in in this case it happens that the tracking across websites and tracking within the site are done by two entities and they both belong to the same company that both belong to Google now there are instances where you have you have facebook.com/ and for a facebook net and they have similar a similar relationship so one is tracking within the site another one is tracking across sites and so the whole analysis here is done basically simply based on the network analysis of course in order to verify that what I'm saying is correct you need to go outside and then look at the business models and look in the whole ecosystem but the fundamental question here for us is this is all invisible and yet it is done in plain sight that's why I call this table it's in plain sight it's right in front of you I showed you the web page they're all there it just you can't you can't really you don't understand what it means okay and the value proposition now is well we're delivering you information we are not telling you we are basically doing that in from back to delivering information because we are tracking you and in this particular case the reason why the trackers are there is because of the business models the trackers are not there randomly they actually have contracts they have contractual agreements with the green dots with the websites so each of these websites actually signed a contract with double-click in Google Analytics and others and these contracts are based on some value proposition it may be that say Google Analytics may come and say we will tell you exactly what's happening your website you'll be able to improve your website you'll get better traction with your customers and double-click may come in and say we have fantastic marketing campaigns we can show your advertisers across the whole web you're not restricted just on your website ok and so essentially the the first part is the the website themselves may or may not understand the mechanism but the value proposition to them is exploit the internet eyes explore the people who are visiting and you will be have a better exposure in all this the saddest part is that consumers you and I are outside this network we are sitting right outside right here we are trotting over these green dots and you're being tracked yeah so in this value exchange we don't have a say that's one thing the second thing is when when we are when somebody's claiming the benefit of this network nobody asked us in fact the advertisers would claim to make their own claims they'll say well this is because our customers wants better advertisements and I want to know who of you ever asked any of this website to put advertisements there so in a way they're claiming they're giving us a benefit for something that we never asked ok I just find that argument very very interesting ok so I don't now switch to back to the presentation just to show you some of the type of analysis that you as a computer scientist would probably will do just to understand a little bit of the nature of this network and also to understand what is the exposure or us individuals consumers when we are using very simple services like search or Twitter just to understand a little bit more what is the statistics behind ok so let me just go back any questions at this stage people were aware of this or I shocked a bit as well yeah this is my objective I was really hoping that I won't shock them back but as I said it just hits home and you see the numbers and that's what our job is believe me there is nobody under the Sun nobody in the world that can actually tackle this but you nobody nobody understands it we created computers computer technologies we put it there and you know how it goes it can be used in various ways whatever you invent it will be used and it depends on which hands gets into and we computer scientists we understand this when you understand this technology it is really in our hands - I would say fix it but understand why this has happened and then understand if you don't like it if you do not like it or if citizens don't like it what is it that we can do the the the the answer is probably not just you know to try to kind of cut off the internet you are not going nobody can do this the question is if you understood why it happened then we can try to introduce perhaps other technologies or other practices that would empower more citizen in this case so it isn't one reason that I'm expect to browse the Internet and for example read the New York Times for free I don't want to pay for it and then the price I pay is basically the advertisements and the tracking exactly so if that's the case the the question is only whether that value proposition was presented and whether it was accepted as such yeah so so everybody's happy to get things for free and if they think that are getting it for free they may accept it so the way it works is that you end up say on the New York Times and then there is an HTML or the web page there's a referral and as soon as the page is loaded referral is going to say double-click or Google Analytics and yields manager and so on and they then place the cookie as a basically cookie comes with the advertisements basically whatever they put on the page then actually gets loaded and installed in your cookie cache so you think you have a one to one relationship at a markup are 10 sites being all pointed to your except that everything from doing it's right yeah you can't yeah so I cannot show it just discussed a little bit of what browser is allowing people to do you can start blocking the download of cookies from particular domains so you can the browser has the ability to say stop this you can't put this on my computer so you are not sending the PC is not sending anything PC just allows people to sniff yeah yeah maybe I should comment a little bit on the design of a yeah a comment a little bit on the design of the interface there was an attempt to help people understand exactly what you're saying and understand what are the mechanism that by which they can act so just a little bit of a structure to talk what I just mentioned to you is I showed you empirical study of the network and the particular interface in which it was a Firefox extension and the idea between the behind the design of this prototype was to see what will be the people's reaction when you provide information to them in real time so in sin if you think about the design of the application that I just showed you the cookies dropping off the top of the page kind of shocking the number of ways you can try to inform people about things and we went all the way to the kind of real time when we were deployed and actually the study it was very interesting because at the beginning first couple of days you don't even notice things you could kind of if you're not really paying attention you won't even see this little drops because people are not going to the websites like New York Times that which is going to Facebook and on the Facebook you may have two of them and so they didn't pay attention so after when you interview them they they some of them said yeah yeah we we noticed some of these things dropping down but we're not sure what it's just part of the website and you know we never even thought about clicking on them and they obviously didn't read the instructions that we gave them but that was all realistic so this is all fine okay this is exactly what people will do they won't read and they won't do anything so in the introduced with them the real thing it could observe what happens from initial discussion what do you think about advertisements what do you think about fail in a free content and so on until we showed them the graph and the graph was oh is that how it's done and the second question is and what can I do and that was the sad part you know we didn't really at the time we didn't have anything to tell them what to do except get into private mode browsing in in private in fact you pay a price because in private means that you are not going to store anything locally on your computer so you don't have your history anymore so that immediately cuts on the benefits of other features and then in private would probably block most of the cookies so that was all kind of secondary effect but really we didn't have any sources for them so that was the discussion of the first and then the rest of the talk I will talk about two other studies that we have done one was about exposure to trackers when you're doing search and then just a little bit of awareness what happens when you say share URL so on Twitter because it's all basically the same thing before I go on with search let me just show you the attempts from the browser design point of view to help people deal with cookies so this is typically what you get you get a menu if you know where it is anomalies under the kind of sum of security previously previously tagged now and in Microsoft browser you have the slider basically the if you just think through a little bit more more the idea is you have the idea that your privacy is on a smaller kind of scale so you can say I want more privacy or less privacy I want medium or you know high privacy so so this is very interesting as you know I said if you're thinking about the design and you're conversing with people what would that medium previously mean to them and then the simple thing you get on Firefox now I'm not gonna critique Firefox I think it's not appropriate so I just stick with IE and then just look a little bit what happened to me when I was after I found out about cookies in more detail I said okay I'm going to bump up my privacy all the way to the top so now I've got block all the cookies that's what kind of understand and and then I was curious what the advanced one was I'm going to do for me because this is kind of a standard one so I went into the Advanced tab to see what can do there and that's where I got confused because the advanced was showing except except on the first party cookies and third party cookies you can see kind of accept accept and I just thought I just thought I changed that yeah so the only way I can now interact with this one is by actually saying override automatic cookie tracking and now I don't know really what is automatic was not automatic I just put the thing on to the top I see that I'm accepting cookies what do I do next yeah so so anyway so so basically I realized that the only way I can now interrupt with this one is by overriding something which I don't know what time over a variety okay alright so just a little bit more but what would the user do when thinking but these different mechanisms and not understanding what they're doing and then the worst thing was I went back then to check what what the wording was about this and then just if you read the wording it says block 30 party cookies that do not have a compact privacy and you know now I'm a complete loss because I have not heard about any you know complete privacy policy I have not heard of any policy because nobody had informed me about them yeah any so so you see what the barriers now for understanding probably this was designed for administrators who understand this and can set this up or for people that's fine so if it is not done for the end-users let's make it clear but then what are we going to do for the end-users all right I'm not saying that you know doing things for the end-users would be any easier in fact the whole agenda behind understanding this value proposition and and informing people and then finally getting in the debate in public debate whether this sort of thing should be addressed by technology or by policy and so on well it is a long process but we were thinking just from the user design point of view what is it that we would need to do in order to move from educating people to acting and I'm just offering you here something that you may find useful in your studies so there is a framework that has been put in place by console and others on communication human information processing it's an approach to warning and effectiveness it's a c-shape framework where suppose you want to warn somebody by the fire or warn somebody by disaster and you want them to act otherwise you get hurt yeah so so how do you design systems and then you realize that there is a very very complex process that has to happen you are designing it vacation channel from you so individual so you're using a number of different channels and so so typically what you've got is there's a source of information there is a channel and then you have to deal with the mindset of the receiver and so first you have to get their attention so that's why we went with the real-time you know information showing then then people have to understand what's happening so this is the comprehension part and even with their comprehend what's going on you have to understand that that's falling onto their existing mindset so they have certain attitudes and beliefs so even if they understand what's going on still there is no guarantee that they're any good body is going to act so it will depend on what the artist and ELISA and then even if they realize that it's really contrary to all their beliefs and values they need to be motivated to act so if they how how long this is only after all this after you achieved all this you may be able to observe some behavior so this is not the warning to you if on your PhD you have to promise your thesis what you're going to do and what you're going to measure as a success of your prototype or whatever keep this in mind because often you know you kind of say I'm gonna have a nice prototype I'm going to deploy it and I'm going to what measure user behavior please don't because to get to do user behavior change see how long the processes you may need to in fact design multiple prototypes for each of these stages to move people from one on the other and it's not an easy easy job to do okay so let's now look at quickly cookies and search if you want we can also discuss any of this before I move on okay so the reason why we decide to look at search because everybody is using search and what is the idea you do a search and you start clicking on the results question is how many clicks do you need to do in order to get trapped and who will be trapping you who will start tracking you how many trackers are going to be on your back after certain number of clicks and so in order to kind of do this evaluation we went to kdd a cup 2000 five they had a nice set of queries of course we meet in repurposed the queries that were at that time prepared for a competition and competition was that about classification of queries so it was really fortunate for us because about hundreds of queries were actually involved in the track and they were classified in the different categories some of the categories over there so this is a one of the conferences that people in computer science publishes knowledge discovery conference it's called kdd and they have competitions where they would repair datasets and then I'll release them for it could be a scientist to compete for on the algorithm smooth way to do it the classification well or optimization of search well or things like that sex money so this is an old one in almost what ten years ago but it was designed for the classification of queries at a time where people wanted to guess intent of the users who were searching online so it was good for us why because the one simple question you ask yourself well maybe if I'm searching for products I'll get hit hard by the trackers then if I go and look for my say text code online or health services and so on so this is kind of a hypothesis that was we thought might be worth just looking at so we picked because the classification was done manually and whenever we had people and they don't agree so we went only for queries where the classification was confirmed by at least two judges and he picked 662 queries and these are the categories the same way which we covered so then we ran these queries in four different markets because we only spoke English among the researchers so we just pick the english-speaking markets India South Africa United Kingdom United States and we picked two search engines Bing and and Google so just to see whether it makes any difference and then we plotted a graph so this is a network that includes websites and trackers and so imagine for each of 600 queries you get top 10 results for each result you go and get the trackers and you know websites of course and then you put them in one network and then you ask yourself okay I want to know really what is the connected component in this graph because that's what matters you want to know how tightly they're on it and so if you start moving from one website to another who can catch you because it's all the information is propagating through the network yeah so we ask for the connected component and this will be got back this is a connected component of the graph that we got from a Google search engine in the Indian market ok and we said well this is just a mess ok so we have quite a couple of clustering algorithms just to tease it up a little bit to see whether there is any substructure and this is what we got so you can now see that if you really try to piece up parts of it that some of the web sites are converting converting more to some of the trackers so there are some sub clusters in there if you go to the US market you get very similar picture ok so you can oh you almost get the feeling that it doesn't really matter if as long as you live on planet Earth this is where you are this is what you're dealing with internationally this is a this is really complete global you know surveillance on the web but in order to get a bit more insights I just here put a table and I wanted to focus just on the bottom part the table shows you characteristic of the network for the four markets for two search engines and on the bottom I'm just highlighting how big the connected component is and so you can see that if you just look at the connected component for each of these kind of snapshots of the network the number of nodes involved is over 90 percent between 90 to 93 percent but if you look at the edges almost 100% you have 99% of the edges included into this connected component which means whichever nodes are not included here they don't matter they are not connected really okay so so anyway the next question is okay it's really hard to study you saw how even visualization of that is really hard so you can only indirectly kind of probe to understand what the structure of the network is so we decided to just run for for you know for fun just to see whether by any chance these networks behave some or like some of the known networks and and and actually they do they do behave very much like a small world and networks which means that they're extremely well optimized for propagation of information so if you do simulations of the small world networks we using particular the most circuits around the model you can see that they very much behave like like the network at the probability point to of rewiring the network it's right here so so they're very much aligned to what the properties would be of the small world network and then if you take a dominant node like a double-click node then obviously gets destabilized so it's very interesting because these there's obviously very important role that this some of these big well-connected trackers are playing the in this network but if you're thinking about whether this is a phenomenon that has happened just because there are these big players who came to the market first I just want to show you what's happening now in the Chinese market because you can argue this is the market that kind of evolved a bit later so we we collected queries from the Baidu search engine we didn't have much time at the time when we're doing experiments so we had only about 100 queries and I want to show you how their network Evo is devolved now outside you see the website and insides are trackers in the Chinese market as you know it's not that openness as the rest of the world you can still find face books and you know double clicks and google analytics but there are players that are characteristics for that market okay by doing in particular and the QQ com so let me just show you their role it is very very similar to the binding that I already showed you between double-click and Google Analytics it's very similar role so the model is being reproduced it's obviously very lucrative model and it's of interest to whatever party is in this case governing the the development of the market in China okay but now going back to the main question and it was us about us users so what is our faith okay so your experience is you go online you do your your search and you go down the first top 10 results now this is showing you the probability that you are going to be attract by one of the trackers on the bottom is the on the x-axis is the number of clicks and on y-axis the probability so you can tell that you know right after you know just five clicks you're probably in the hands of Google Analytics then similarly double-click but if you follow this line after 20 20 clicks there's ninety percent of chance that all these top ten will track you after thirty percent you are done okay here's almost 100 percent okay so so what's the same thing is it doesn't matter you do it using Google or use a bank and I'm pretty sure you use any other search engines the same because it's not the property of the search engine it's not it's a property of the web and that's what the scary thing is and it is really what we need to understand that there is a content network and on top of it there is a tracking network okay and the content network is bugged okay that's basically what it is is bad because for every every everywhere you go there is a part of the of the tracker natural that's get activated and so you know now you can think what what we might be able to do with this but that's what the Internet has if you were wondering now back to the topics it doesn't really matter which topics you're searching on there's a little bit of a less tracking happening on information about you know about the law and politics and so on or information science so maybe these websites are not that keen for free content so maybe they don't engage with trackers that often but yeah all right so this was bad about search any questions about this please yes please commercial trackers when we have government tracking that works on the network layer that we cannot control yes so so it's very interesting we don't really know if this is speculation the question real question is why is that why why in this commercial world where we typically have governments coming into place and saying there's a consumer protection there are the things there are no voices of that sort they're very weak there are people who are trying but it's not moving fast enough and I believe that the design of technology is not helping so because it's invisible it's a plain sight but yet it's not visible yeah this whole information exchange and you know pointing people to URLs for information for the front of you know best intent actually poses a question for our own practices so you're very excited about the BBC news or an article in York Times and what do you do you go on on Twitter and and you know forward that information to your friends okay so the question is what have you done okay so yeah so it doesn't have to be you know it doesn't have to be Twitter I mean it is also worry for the corporate world in emails you're basically sending things in the email to your friends yeah when I look at my emails most of the time they have the little bit of text and three or four texts you know URLs in it so what am i doing so so in a way it becomes a question about our own practice normally normally if you know that there's a danger right you would say you can go there but please turn off your cookies yeah so so it in a way if you protect yourself you may want to protect others and say look there's a warning but because you don't know so you don't know yourself and you're acting completely from your best intent you have and there's also also no mechanism for you to warn anybody so that's basically was disturbing here that that that the design of the technology has not allowed us to understand make informed decision and then act properly isn't even that sometimes when you go to websites and you have disabled some cookies then you get these kind of general messages pop up do you want to enable them again just a whole lot to whether there are any classification encouraging this behavior this is a thing that the government's have when went along with the industry and said okay we are going to inform citizens and then there would be these pop-ups saying these websites uses cookies now it's a laughable thing you I mean just happened to me regularly so there is not even sometimes there's not even button okay it's just you can all you can do is close it means you absorb the information and they can do whatever they want they haven't they make no distinction between first party in third party cookies so in a way they play on that card of misinformation either the government's or not who are making decision EU or whoever than UK were not given information or if they're given information they decided not to have knowledge fully and they're not presenting it using cookies and explains what it is what do you think is it Ruby is a common practice in the future for all websites or maybe it will be required even so it is going into that direction there is a pressure point on on hand them informing the customers the only question is when what is the right design of informing them I showed you one when you have these things dropping off the page and interrupting what you're doing and this is another instance where they inform you at the time where you already made a decision so this is the problem they when you are interfering with the process when the user has already made decision to engage and is expecting the value to be realized and then you cut it off that you redirect their attention and at that point they may not even have a choice so they accept the terms just because they have the short-term goal they need to complete so the back the maybe requirement that the websites need to inform and then we need to decide we asked designers and implementers of technology how would that be implemented because it's a part of the computer application design it may need to be something that's a more of a statement that has to be considered before you start engaging with Internet so it may be at the beginning of your session say okay just keep in mind that there are trackers out there do you want me to keep informed or are you fine so it can be a different process but when people engage then you're competing with their short-term goal and then everything all the bets are off as you know people cannot really assess the risk long-term risk when they engage in a short-term game it's like an automatic registration really somewhere so I'm going to go briefly through this I'm not sure how much time is 17 okay so I just got the four five minutes just to go over this so you just understand a little bit the ecosystem the first is about Twitter just reinforce a little bit what they said we went and looked at the part of the Twitter network based on topics and did to users so imagine that you are following certain topics or you were following particularly users we managed to get a data set they had about five million tweets from the topics and about eight million from the users and out of those we just were curious to see how many of them had URLs in them so it's not a large percentage however is enough and so as you will see we also studied a little bit for the top user data set we we started a little bit who which are the URLs which domains are being tweeted about and as you you're guessing most of them things going to come from YouTube we didn't confuse here you have a shortening URLs so I'm just putting in all in kind of raw format but also what's interesting to look at the third part is associated with these websites so if YouTube you're using then it's about twelve if you're using some of the others like you know facebook.com about twenty four trackers but the shopping one is the tumbler one but they don't get alarmed this is because tumbler is a site which allows individuals to set up their little you know pages and websites and so this individuals then each of them invites their own trackers I mean inadvertently okay because they may be introducing some content and therefore collectively if you look at the tumbler then you have this huge number of trackers but it also tells you that you're not talking about one or two or main companies they're thousands of them section yeah so so what's happening so first we done an a social network analysis and I say on the topics we picked a topic politics and when you use the social network analysis we use node Excel it's a it's a plugin for Excel that helps us also do this clustering and layout so in this graph people the nodes are people so the red nodes here are all people is just the red nodes that the people who tweet a lot so the node size describes number of followers and that node color is how many retweets there's this kind of myths that you if you have lots of followers that you're very influential perhaps yes but if you don't tweet much then then you're not very influential so you know it so so in a way it's very good to also look people who are retweeting and in this case they are propagating information and URLs so the big component that I showed you the connected component among people discussing politics we again pulled it out a little bit and as you can see these are the people only people who share tweets video URLs so not all so all of them are contaminating each other so any little clusters you see so people are passing to each other URLs and you can see the kind of there is some constructure there and then the question is you know what sort of trackers are we talking about and there did you know the same suspects that you already had from the other execs except here I'm showing you what happens when you are sharing your eyes in social media yeah so if you're looking at your SEO third-parties how many of you are as well actually associate with them a 65% actually we're associated Google Analytics in this case and 56% to Facebook and then also the third-party domains how many users are actually exposed so 66% of users who are exposed exposed to these chapters okay Google Analytics 58 of double-click 57 to google.com and so on okay so we just wanted to get some idea what happened to us when when we share URL set assumption is of course that you actually want to see the URL or you want to see it before you you include it in your tweet so yeah all right so let me just go quickly this is the last bit this is now understanding the ecosystem of the trackers themselves okay so these knows now are all trackers we just want to understand a little bit the types of them the little nose are negligible here these are websites based on these 20 websites I just looked who are the trackers associated 20 websites ok the reason we looked at his 20 websites because in a previous study when we did international search they were present everywhere the web sites were present in top 10 results and the trackers were there so the three categories of trackers the we already familiar with the tracker trackers the people who are bidding and you know have exchanged for advertising that's theirs red ones but also there are companies that are affiliated with this bidding process they don't track anybody they just deliver ads so these are the green ones okay so you have red guys who are really the brokering the whole process and then the green ones delivering ads whatever and then there are the blue ones okay and the blue ones are really tricky because from the design point of view there is a kind of dual value proposition those are the websites did you actually see you go them actively you have subscription to them you have engagement with them okay they have dual roles so when you have see a little F little T little L on the web web web pages everywhere the F for you know Facebook icon and Twitter icon and so on and you see them everywhere why is that well they are tracking devices so whenever you land on the website which has F and T Twitter is informed immediately now it's okay you know they inform immediately but if you are logged in to them they don't know who you are okay so so so what actually what we are doing now we are moving from anonymous tracking based on some kind of fingerprinting or with laptop which is also bad yet and although other things so actually knowing who you are so whatever you do is not anonymous anymore as you will see here these are the similar just show you how it works so in this case is a how and it's connected with something a blue one green one and red one the same thing with double-click connected with with all of them the blue blue one and green one and a red one okay so it's very interesting to see how the connection among the trackers work but if you are in advertising what would you do you would look at the picture like this and say oh well here is a demand and supply what is it to worry about I have demand I have people who want to advertise I have websites that the supply for places for advertising okay so demand people you may be BMW BMW has its own website but BMW wants to advertise everywhere so BMW isn't on the demand side now and says I want to advertise who can't advertise my stuff and then of course the exchange there yes involved and say I've got the customer I just tracked this customer I know where they've been maybe a good chance to go there so what we have seen from our analysis we have seen what's happening on the supply side we have seen websites where the the advertising actually gets implemented that's where the supply is so we've seen how the websites informed the exchange we've seen how exchange and brokers with the green sites to get the advertising in and the consumer gets the value right back to advertisements okay so what I'm basically saying you can do computer science as we've done empirical study and so on there is a whole economic model behind and it's enabled through our technology and the consumer is there and knows nothing thank you our designs okay I'll stop here Thank You Natasha I think that has given us a lot of food for thought and I'm sure there'd be some questions as well to follow up so it's very interesting the advertising business itself is very interesting the holy grail of any company is not to have tracking mechanism the holy grail of New York Times or L'Oreal or easyJet is actually to have a direct relationship with the customer now what has happen is the intermediaries the reason why we have intermediaries who are now sniffing enabling tracking across websites is because none of these individual companies can do their tracking none of them can actually get to the masses of people easily so so if you have a mechanism by which we can enable more intimate relationship between the vendors and the consumers directly then this intermediary thing is gone so we can think of some other creative ways by which the a the the vendors can actually engage with customers and their many more coming up you just look at now the practices are changing people are skyping people are you know linking on Facebook and so on we just need to think about other are there any technological innovation that we can put in place to replace this sort of advertising because if they are pressed it will be very interesting to see what the effectiveness is yeah so they're all playing effectiveness in there only in their own ecosystem but not us we didn't be outside it and they have very very fuzzy metrics about how successful they are you know whatever plans and something that we click on something but we actually converge with our purchase and so on so so anyway they have fuzzy metrics and they're happy in that role because the money is changing hands and that's all fine so one answer is let's look at the technology be creative let's think all you need to worry about the time next time we citizens want to be part of it okay so that's a desi the draw the second thing is we do we do have some chance to negotiate the governments because we have such as the citizens of the countries where at least in some cultures the the privacy is valued so we may be able to push some of that so whatever we come up with how do you know that the middleman wouldn't get involved anyway I mean it's just the nature of technology and they have a direct stake and making money just like everyone else they always will you're right it always will just look at the stock market if the whole world and you can't stop it the question only is whether we enable in the next round will help people be empowered more because at the moment at the moment we have no say this is I always phrase this is very drastic but it is the case when do you remember in the history of humanity people didn't have any right and even have any choice okay only remember ones with slavery no rights no choice it's horrible the question is it's not a legislation problem I mean cannot we okay it's not something that we must simply decided it is not it should not be allowed to to get all our history and use it for commercial use and to delayed ourself in some manner it's not something that the government and our people must decide it's I mean can we act like computer scientists and say okay our new technologies will be will be protecting other people from using but it should be something that we agree all agree on so the question is really whether what is the role of computer science in this right I mean the computer science of creating innovation innovative technologies it could be used in one way or another way we cannot when the browser redesign people didn't think that this is going to happen so fresh known is how we computer scientists engage with the rest of the society me I'm pretty sure the universities you have ethical committees and so on whenever you wanted to run this study there will be somebody on your back asking you whether your peg injection this and that we really the community that is creating technologies and believe me people on the street cannot write programs and if we do not design systems that then understand what programs are doing in some way we have an ultimate power this is really and because we put this we put these technologies and and masses are using them and and so the question is only that we have certain responsibilities when we when we do this because we don't live in vacuum computer science is not in vacuum there are economical factors are around that go jump on it how do we engage with the broader society to have this conversation before this sort of things happen I don't know I do not know what the forms would be but if you raise the questions this is almost trivial what I'm showing you today by the way is nothing this is tip of the iceberg the next next thing when maybe next time I talk to you I'll show you what happens with with java scripts that they embed in the pages it's just a and and it's not just about your browser cache is going to be your proxy so god help you then because it's outside your computer yeah anyway so so I agree with this we need to think about the mechanism to engage with a society and think about this one's food is there anything else aside from the fact that you know I agree that it looks a bit scary still I am feeling okay I'm not too bothered about it but I can imagine that there is another way that tracking is used that is a lot more so so the reason why we consumers don't have much power is after this because we can't prove that there is harm he saw somebody so okay so what now you know what I like you know this type of boots are not the other way so you cannot really argue that it's harm but in fact we are talking about privacy where there is no ground risk or challenge perhaps however I can tell you if my daughter goes and this do some searching online and it just happened that I am using the computer you can see that some ads are coming up I will ask the question and she would not like it and it's not about her being harm on the street is about you know not being able to go out with friends or anything so you get grounded for you know no reason oh good reason and so the privacy is very interesting because not like security however there are companies that will be worried about this there are they scenarios that they'll be big worried about it especially if you're not just looking at advertising when you're looking these attacks through JavaScript it's enterprises they are subject to the business espionage because you don't have to be Google and double-click why anybody you can be anybody and exploit the vulnerability of the system at the moment so are my batteries actually that again citizens will be taken care of for wrong reasons if you wish not because of the human rights or their rights for privacy as a value but because the companies are going to be harmed because there'll be information leaking through the same mechanism that we individuals are being exposed I mean reduce demands will reduce bottom right yeah so it's just a question is how do you manage the blocking the ads yeah yeah I mean if everyone does that the chain will collapse right exactly so this is exactly your right so those edges that are coming into the network will be cut off but we need a unified action right otherwise the thing is that you see the they already prevent the companies are already thinking ahead so what's happening is now you have the whole operating system you have so you have the whole browser being designed and in the hands of the main companies of the in fact they participate in the economic system so you know you have to the anticipating reaction so they are already repositioning themselves so it's going to be an ongoing thing just like with security it will never stop and it was said before they'll be always the middleman and younger question is how can we count basic without the question can we count
