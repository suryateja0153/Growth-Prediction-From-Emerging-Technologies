 this meeting is now being recorded good morning once again I am Chloe shields and the senior associate for partnerships here with the global likes for clean cookstoves and we thank you for joining this webinar designed for both new partners to the alliance we're now over 1300 organizations strong as well as existing or long-standing partners this particular series will not only feature a specific tool resource or engagement activities such as the investment platform that will be speaking about today but will also provide a brief introduction to the Alliance and how we work describe some of the benefits of partnerships and highlight upcoming opportunities for our partners so after this short introduction I will hand it over to my colleague GV Valdes who will give a more detailed presentation and demonstration of the investment platform tool so for those new to the Alliance our aim is to create a thriving global market for clean cookstoves and fuels and this is really in response to the persistent problem of which are all aware as organizations working in this space that still impacts 3 billion people cooking their meals over solid fuels and on rudimentary stove around the world as we know this results in numerous impacts on human health over 4 million deaths annually the environment and climate impacts local economies and livelihoods and women and girls in particular so in response the Alliance we've launched in 2010 by a number of sounding partners with a mission to address this multifaceted challenge and save lives improved livelihoods empower women and protect the environment in at the time then we set the goal by which to measure our progress and that was a hundred million households adopting clean or efficient cook stoves and fuels by the year twenty twenty and you can see from this graph on the on the screen here that we've reached the point of our our goal by 2015 and are already ahead of our projections with 28 million households having adopted cleaner efficient cookers and field since 2010 for more information on this we definitely encourage you to check out our recently reports are recently released five years of impact report where you can learn more about the results reported by our various partners that demonstrate these Spurs and continued projections to get us to our goal by 2020 so it was through a consultative process with sex sector experts shortly after i launched where we determined that a market-based approach was really the best way to reach this 100 million target and this was also building upon the lessons learned by many of our partners probably some of you on the phone today who have already been working in this space for many decades this approach is based around three core strategies strengthening the supply enhancing demand and enabling market and this approach really drives all of the work that we do here at the alliance whether it's supporting innovative new technologies through our pilot Innovation Fund on the supply side or the numerous different opportunities we have to build the capacity of enterprises at various stages or some of the demand generation activities that were involved in promoting consumer awareness or consumer financing options for our marketing abling work that cuts across many different sectors for example supporting international standards to demonstrate the technology benefits of these various cook stoves and fuels so the investment platform feature today is just one example of how the Alliance's working to both strength and supply and enable market as this tool is a hub for really our enterprise development pathway building offered it is it has a matchmaking capability to connect enterprises directly with investors and serves as a place for targeted news updates and resources for this sub-sector of alliance partners now that we've introduced our core strategy how does the Alliance work well we are led by a secretariat based in Washington DC who coordinates our global activities we have market managers leading teams in our eight focus countries and that's really where we go deep with targeted support for clean cooking and serve our locally based partners in those countries or regions but beyond the secretariat we really depend on our partners to support in advance clean cooking efforts around the world so you'll see from just a few examples here that we work with multiple different types of organizations across the public private and nonprofit sector this list is by no means exhaustive and we encourage you to find and connect with are many more partners through our online directory the link is provided on this slide but to you know matchmake on your own time to gain new partners to understand what different organizations are doing and to create those connections there what does it mean to be an alliance partner and how can you take advantage of some of these opportunities well the short answer is that becoming a partner is the best way to stay informed of Alliance activities globally and in various countries but more specific than that it also means various resources and capacity development opportunities whether that a one of our numerous funding opportunities or participation in a workshop on event such as our upcoming biennial for or a webinar like this partners get a first look at Alliance tooltips reports or other resources and are subscribed to our month newsletter Turner's also receive a number of networking and partnership brokering support from the Alliance whether that's through our online tools such as the front-end directory that I mentioned or oftentimes we find ourselves introducing partners to others working in similar complementary spaces to donors to media and a number of other visibility enhancing opportunities are out there for our partners whether that partner spotlight within our newsletter which has a circulation of 8,000 some individuals working in the sector or promotion on our social media channels like Facebook or Twitter so lastly I just wanted to highlight a few new resources and upcoming opportunities for our partners the first is the clean cooking forum which is fast approaching November 10 through 13 in Accra Ghana we will have over 450 partners represented in person at this forum which happens every two years if you're not able to make it there's still a lot you can do to follow along online I've included the link to the forum website clean cooking 2015 org and be sure to check that website each day during that week of of November 10 and that will have photos video highlights and blog posts you can also follow along on Twitter that will have the most up-to-date information and I'm sure many of our partners will also be contributing their thoughts and insights on some of those platforms as well also if you are seeing more in the climate or for environment space and are participating in the upcoming cop21 climate change conference in Paris we want to let you know that the Alliance will have a presence at that event to ensure that clean cookstoves and fuels aren't conversations around mitigating greenhouse gas and black carbon emissions so for those already planning to attend were involved in a number of official and unofficial side of them that will bring up issue and you can look out for more detail on those and opportunities to participate in our october newsletter which should actually be going out later today and it will also be available on our web later today or feel free to shoot myself an email and i can connect you with some colleagues working on the cop21 meeting I already mentioned briefly are five years of impact report which we released in September around our fifth anniversary and this is really an opportunity to read about the sector's growth in these five years since the advent of the Alliance understand the progress that's been made and our continued goals and projections it features some stories of impact where our partners are highlighted and their growth in this in this past five years and some things we know now that we didn't then from research findings from studies commissioned early on in the alliance as well as some some quotes and other information from individuals and organizations across the sector so check that out if you haven't already and lastly I just wanted to mention that we will soon have a our newest sort of partner tool a market research guide which has been created in partnership with wash plots to help organizations whether it's a clean cooking Enterprise a manufactured computer or an NGO to design and manage your own market research and understand more about consumers and users that your technologies or fuels might and let's apply to so that tool will be give you dat the form and will be available online and shared with our partners shortly afterwards so featured resource is the investment platform as you know and I'm going to hand it over to my colleague Stevie Valdez at this point stevie is the Alliance's manager of impact investing and market development where she works to increase awareness of clean cooking enterprises within the investor community and drive investment in the sector but she also works on our market development side advising in the areas of slaw and medium enterprise development and consumer finance so I will now hand it over to Stevie just bear with us for a second we're going to use the screen share functionality so that you can take a look at this investment platform resource directly you everyone de valdes at first I want to thank you for taking the time to join us in this meeting today to learn about the investment platform as my colleague Chloe shields mentioned I work in the areas of enterprise development investment of the Alliance where I'm driving additional investment into the sector through various funding opportunities interaction with investors and I do manage the investment platform at the global lines for clean cookstoves so as they begin to give a bit of background on why we're using the form and what is for and I just wanted to give you a bit of an understanding in the comparison about some of the different resources that are out the Global Alliance for clean cook stoves are online and when we look at the investment platform I wanted to compare it with what you already might be familiar with if you're registered partner and receive this email is the partner profile the partner profile advocate Alliance for clean cookstoves is a place for you to put in your information and you can be a champion at the global alliance as any representing any type of organization public-private academics which includes academics government enterprising partners large corporations everyone who is a champion of clean and efficient cooking can create a partner profile with basic information including a contact person and it basically just goes over information you would want people to know such as what is your technology what sectors do you operate in we at the Alliance while this partner directory quite helpful it includes again all public private and actors and champions of clean cookstoves and fuels what the investment platform for clean cooking does is it allows the arises enterprising partners those who receive earned revenue through the sale of cooking products allows them to connect with each other investors donors and tours so for just a quick moment I'm going to stop sharing and I'm going to go over to the base I'm going to go over to that to the presentation there with you for quite some quick moment so I'm going to go to the presentation and just talk about why we've created this platform and what you can expect out of it so the clean clicking investment platform allows you to go much deeper into your business model school your profile allow you to attach additional documents see these and really the reason why you would put this information up onto a profile is that you are connecting with potential partners potential impactors potential donors as potential mentors and the clean cooking platform has actually an algorithm it would match enterprising partners with investors based on investment criteria that investor was put into the platform and a lot partners to be matched with donors they based on that as well they would create an investor profile but also mentors so if you are an enterprising partner of the Global Alliance for clean cookstoves and involved in through the sale of stoves or fuels or similar cooking implements you could theoretically say that you needed information or support in a certain area such as marketing and put that as part of your profile so it's really a connection tool and and again the the advantages for some of our partners like investors include finding the investment opportunities within the clean cooking sector that fit investment criteria again there's an algorithm to match enterprises investors and and this is more or less what we hope to achieve with this fat fun this problem is not new to the Global Alliance for clean cookstoves we've actually been using this platform for over a year now so you might be familiar with it and you might actually already have a platform or already have a profile on the platform but before I talk about and go through the demonstration of the platform itself I wanted to talk about what what it is and what it isn't so it's definitely place to connect you can see enterprise news and things that were up to on the enterprising side of the Global Alliance for clean cookstoves but it's not an investor directory they're not going to join the platform and get a list of all the investors involved in the factor all the donors I go back to the screen share for example you can see that there are you can see who's registered in the group if you're logged in and we'll do this in a minute you'll see that certain of these members base are showing as new members in the group are actually investing numbers so you might be able to see this is registered as an investor but you're not going to actually see all of the information about investors it's also not a public place to display confidential information about your business so we're not logged in right now if you are looking at the partner director you can see basic information about this partner Nova gas which is the pilot Innovation Fund grant team but if you go to this investment platform and you search Nova gasps you're only going to get very basic information some very basic business summaries and who is associated with that company otherwise it is I will talk a little bit more about confidentiality and what information is shared but it's not a public place where we're displaying all of your information or a place where we're sort of collecting it at the alliance in the back end and using information that way what it is is um the other thing I wanted to talk about with this platform is this is a white-label platform provided by good acts so if you see um you go down to the homepage you can see that this is a registered vedeks net it x is the creator of the algorithms and sort of this white label platform and note that if you are starting to interact with this platform and you're having some challenges you both interact with me on the investment side of the Global Alliance for clean cook stoves and with fedex the last thing I wanted to go before we go into a more deep in depth demonstration is just why the Alliance went through the trouble of going beyond the partner profile to a specific platform for enterprises and investors to interact and this is for a few reasons and firstly life has been working to create relationships with investors and donors and the sector trying to scale up on market based enterprises for about three years now few years after our inception is really when that programming began and what we have noticed is in those conversations is that the first question investors ask is what's your pipeline show us some really good companies in this sector or I'm looking for in businesses in Haiti can you show me any clean cooking companies there and instead of them going to the alliance or aligns the staff is sort of a bottleneck this a lot to find those companies on their own so if i wanted to search katie which is where the gas is located i would actually have a list of 13 enterprises whether or not they're champions or mentors for 13 in the sector who are based in haiti and i can know that there's actually a wealth of cooking enterprises across the globe and that demonstrates investment potential and we get to send the same question from donors and we'd like to be able to have again a place where they can do this themselves but we also want to keep expectations on here we see this as a place where we could really send people if they have a specific question of course we'd really hope that investors and donors are registered on the platform and they're looking at things regularly but we don't expect that to be the case we really expect it to be a reference and then a continued place interaction after that also note that no direct terms transactions happen on this platform so you might connect with an investor on the platform based on whether or not your enterprises information including this finance needed and where you're located matches with an investor donors information the actual transaction will not take place online you will connect to each other online you can connect and share additional information about your business online but the actual transaction which happens offline so we're not necessarily selling securities or whatnot for this platform okay going back to the site what you'll see on the page is some basic information including news and events um if there's something very specific to our enterprising partners you'll see this on the side you'll see who's recently joined this group new businesses where profiles have been created and of course if you're not for some reason reliance partner already you can be directed towards becoming an alliance partner after this webinar if you still have questions you can go to a frequently asked questions page here including our contact information if there's for some reason any challenge with the platform you can contact us at investment stop clean cookstoves org our investment at clean cookstoves network and we will do our best to resolve your problems ourselves if not we will refer you to bed X who is the host of the portal the other thing that's really exciting about this platform is you have the opportunity to join other portals and again a terminally terminology issue here the alliance called this the investment platform but x refers to each individual platform as a portal which is not the belt the difference there there are country level portals so I could go to Kenya enjoy this Kenya portal or i should say within clean cookstoves but the exciting thing here and to this next is if so you create a platform or if you create for your profile here you can actually use that profile which is the kenya portal so you don't have to create additional information so as bit x as an entity's continues to grow and bring on more countries a more specific types of entrepreneur such as women entrepreneur groups you can use your same company in your same company profile to join other entities so i'm going to go over very quickly creating a log in a business and a couple of dashboards and then i'll open it up for questions so you can choose login or start here's I'd have an account but I'm going to do a new account I'm going to click here to register when you register i'm going to write not the cleaning page today okay so once you actually register and login you will receive a confirmation email to make it to make sure it is solid and then you would actually go in and activate your link and register now for the sake of expediency I'm going to avoid that process for now and use a different login to demonstrate what you would actually see on your profile I'm going to choose this social network option so you can see how this works as well and going to add a different account the sense of a Google augen so you would sign into Google or Facebook or there's a hotmail option and that's even avoid multiple logins so as you can see as Stevie I already has a profile setup I've already been connecting with people and I helped some messages it was great about this platform is you don't have to give away your email address to connect with individuals you can connect directly one but I'm going to go to my entrepreneur dashboard here because once you're logged in you can create a business profile so this is my business profile here I can decide that I want to delete this because this business is no longer active or i can edit my profile so i'm going to edit my profile and i just want to give you all the subs for the type of information that you can put here so i can name my company put it a little go describe my business and i can actually add an audio and video pitch for my entities i would like to i can talk about my role and the company i can add additional members to my team and this is the information we want to ensure that you have available this is about your company what to type of financing you prefer um you could say for example not sure but if you know that you need a 100,000 US dollars or so you can actually put that information here now the reason why you would put information in these financial details which again are confidential and to lead until you actually connect with somebody on the platform is that this is the information that is used in the algorithm for investors when they're looking for companies that match their profile so on the enterprise side you would enter information about how much financing it may be whether it's loan or equity or debt um basic information about sales revenues and operational costs and again this is the final information that an investor would use to make the deal but it's actually or a donor in this case is what is actually the information that they could use and say as an investor I'm not actually interested in a a company with a hundred thousand US dollars in revenue with a million dollars in revenue class and this information would be put into the algorithm and investor metra profile for the enterprise on the company to be matched if you are looking for mentorship right now I'm saying right something does not look for mentors you can actually go to mentoring details and say yes I am looking for mentorship and there are areas that I can choose where I need support but if they business funding valuation and I can put that information describe the challenges that particularly my company is facing so valuation in Haiti is difficult um and it looks like my colleague on Alex on the enterprise development site is a matching mentor so I can all of the mentors that could theoretically match with the expertise that I need and I'm going to take on Ahmet here and request mentoring from him so I can send a request to receive mentorship because he's the type of meant where I'm looking for because you can help me with my business line and with valuation you can save my profile here so my cook stove company is now seeking out mentorship in addition to maybe a funding opportunity the other thing i want to show you quickly is that as entrepreneur entrepreneur dashboard I can see interested investors unfortunately since I have zero adopting those dollars for example for this company there's nobody that matches my criteria and an investor has not reached out to me but it's also a fictional business I'm not too disappointed um but you can also do this help so if you're ever wondering and going back to maybe this webinar to listen to an online conversation about this is an investment platform you can get some basic information hear more about your entrepreneur profile you as an individual can create a program that can see who I am and this is important to when investor is looking at an enterprise they're looking at who the entrepreneur is behind it we're going to go back here to this help function now the difference between a company profile in the business profile because this is quite often the most common question we get is the company profile is very basic information maybe are not ready to build out all of the information about your enterprise you can click here and just put in your company name and website but you can actually have multiple businesses on your profile for example if you have multiple subsidiaries we have a spark lundgren t in nigeria that has two or three different subsidiary organizations you can still have one big company profile as you as an entrepreneur but you can have business profiles that are underneath sent from multiple businesses and you can see here and I'm have multiple businesses and this is the last thing i want to show you before opening it up to questions is that it you can grow your network within your industry and that's the exciting thing about having the specific queen 15 top if you are interested in reaching out to potential partners in Hades you can go to company contacts here I have no particular context but if again if I search in the search functionality while i'm logged in as Stevie I search to Nova gas I can see that John France lawyer there is the entrepreneur behind this organization in a can connect with him because I'm interested in partnering in Haiti my contact to request has been sent ahead and we can connect to this spot one without having to try to find people through the partner directory but also if there's something there sometimes where there's not necessarily overlap between the two entities so I'm going to pause sharing screen I'll go back to the wellness and see if we have some questions thanks baby so it sounds like we have about 20 minutes for questions please type those into the chat window in the bottom left hand of the screen and we'll read them aloud and answer them as time allows so our first question is there a regular funding cycle to apply to or is it open all year round for the various funding application sure I can take that um so Alliance funding cycles are our funds first particularly for enterprises and that's the one I can answer the best are open usually four degrees there at a time they open once a year for application period and then they close you might be asking this question in relation to the investment platform because in previous rounds of the start fund and the pilot Innovation Fund all the applications have taken place through this investment platform and the Alliance does not provide direct funding directly through the platform but it uses the information there you can submit it to your enterprises spark or pilot Innovation Fund application that actually might change into this but committee restate the answer the funding cycles open once per year usually not open for discrete periods of time there are no ongoing funding cycles available directly through the Global Alliance for clean cookstoves and you can see tabs on when those funding opportunities open by checking our main website at the very top of clean cookstoves board we have a link to funding opportunities and just stay attuned to our newsletter we always give quite a bit of advance notice before one of those cycles comes up um I'll maybe wait for one minute or two to see if there are any additional questions before we close out the call but remind you all that you can my contact information is here this is CG Valdes but if you have anything particular issues with using the platform you can email investment at clean cookstoves org and we can definitely try to answer those questions there's also a frequently asked questions page on the investment portal or platforms and hopefully that that information can answer your basic questions we really do advise you to go back and look if you have applied to a spark fund in the past or a pilot innovations founder of women's empowerment fund you actually likely already have an account we would like you to keep that information as up-to-date as possible if your is out of date and a donor abscess I'm looking for a company in Haiti and they go to that search function it might not show all the traction you've created with your enterprise in the past six months so do take a look you and keep that information up to date it helps us better demonstrate just how far the sector has come in the past few years are there any other questions about being a partner for the Global Alliance for clean cookstove our the investment platform before we sold out the call you we get a new question um asking are we automatically members of the platform by being partner another great question so i'm automatically members of the platform if you become partners we haven't quite got to the functionality where these two entities such as the partner platform and the investment platform are connecting with one another so you do need to go to investment dachshund cookstoves org and go to that login or start here button at the top right hand corner to create a profile again if you've applied for funding opportunity I would recommend searching for your profile or trying to login and then recovering your password information you forgot not too many questions this morning but we will stay on the line for another five minutes so feel free to jump off if you are all set or if you want to hang around and other questions come up we'll be here to answer them thank you thank you for joining you
