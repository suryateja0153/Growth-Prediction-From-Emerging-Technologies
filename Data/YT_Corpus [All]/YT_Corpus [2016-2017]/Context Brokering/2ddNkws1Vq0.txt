 here at csis and it's really a privilege we're having a chevron forum on australia's security international development opportunities and its status as an important ally to the united states and we're really fortunate to have my friend andrew scheer who's a former national security visor of australia with us he's a visiting fellow here at csis I want to wish the many Australians in the audience a late australian national day given that we've got such a large Australian contingent here I figured I'd I do that I suspect we have a large representation I think from the embassy here as well but I think the the reason I wanted to have Andrew was he's someone who's been in the think tank World as well as having been in senior position in government in a in Australia is to think about international development in the cot as a form of applied to foreign policy the way we think about applied mathematics and I think that we often when we think about Oda or foreign assistance or those that care about international development oftentimes don't think about the larger national security or foreign policy implications but certainly the folks who have the job the national security jobs or the senior foreign policy jobs certainly do when they think about international development and so I thought it would be an opportunity for us to have this conversation Australia's a very generous donor and is somebody who you know as a country that has been a longtime ally the United States and a valued partner I don't think I have to tell them anybody in this room that that's the case but it's you know we are very fortunate that Andrew has been been with us for several months is going to be with us at least through june so we're really happy about that so i think without much further ado I'm going to ask Andrew to share some thoughts I've got several questions then we'll open up to the audience but Andrew thanks for doing this and tell us a little bit about when you were National Security Advisor how you thought about how did you and how did the prime minister think about foreign assistance Australia's foreign assistance and how do they think about in the context of of where Australia is located on Australia's interests as well as its role as a as an ally to both the United States but also to too many others in around the world thanks Stan and it's great to be here and I just like to to sega day to a lot of friends and former colleagues from the embassy who are here it's great to see you all it's a really important topic i think and i guess in my former all the way I used to think about development assistance and aid is is really I guess in two ways I mean one way and perhaps the more obvious ways that that aid see is that is an expression of our countries and our societies inherent altruism and determination to do the right thing by other people especially people who are less less fortunate so that's always been a very powerful powerful driver of aid then the second way I guess and Dan alluded to this is that a tour development assistance is very much part of what you might call the international policy toolkit the the set of instruments that government has available to it to to implement its its long-term strategy and a lot of my dealings with with aid in the Australian context have been through that lens going right back to a lot of you will recall the bougainville intervention where Australia got involved in sort of peace brokering and rehabilitation after a very long and painful conflict there and of course is Timur Solomon Islands the Ramsey intervention and then Afghanistan and Iraq we've been doing a lot of this and I think what that's done is is brought aid and our aid delivery mechanisms much more into the into the sort of core national security space and it's required us to think much more about partnerships how we work whole of government how we work with UN agencies with NGOs and other donors much more closely I'm thinking about Australia spends about four billion dollars a year on its own its assistance there's an emphasis on the asia-pacific region you all have a particular interest in a number of islands in the Pacific in particular papua new guinea i think comes to mind could you talk a little about some of your some of the thinking behind how you how australia thinks about specifically the asia-pacific and think it's about assistance and what are some of the dynamics there sure I guess we we tend to regard ourselves as having a special relationship with with many of those smaller Pacific island nations and a particular responsibility to look after them papua new guinea of course is in a unique situation because it's a former australian colony and i think most Australians would would recognize that that gives us a an even bigger stake and a very particular interest in the welfare of that country so the South Pacific is obviously very close to us and I think that sort of our true istic impulse is very strong there's a lot of good feeling among the Australian community for the South Pacific but it's it's interesting I mean Aid has a lot of stakeholders and i think one stakeholder you know we can talk about aid agencies NGOs the wider development community other donors recipient governments etc one stakeholder that often doesn't get much of a look in is the taxpayer who actually under rights all this this activity and the Lowy Institute poll I think it was last year used to be at the Law Institute I did work so forgive me a little plug for my former employee of course I the polling at the Lowy Institute is interesting on this subject I think more than half about fifty three percent of Australians actually supported the recent reductions in the Australian aid program so what I think that means for us is that government has to work much harder to actually explain the reasons for for aid and there's a positive story we have to be able to demonstrate that those taxpayer dollars are making a real tangible difference to the to the lives of people on the ground and I think sometimes our aid programs kind of lose sight of that a little and the other part of it is going back to the national interest side of the equation in a country like Papua New Guinea which now has a population I think of about seven and a half million people really rapid population growth very high rates of HIV and other infectious diseases a lot of crime and a lot of potential to be a sort of transmitter of these things into Australia given that it's only a few hundred kilometers away from our coast the public has to be brought along and informed about the consequences of instability in some of these countries and the massive cost of an intervention I mean the we've spent literally billions of dollars intervening in those those specific countries that I mentioned earlier PNG is a much bigger much more complex much more challenging task and the cost of intervening if something goes catastrophically wrong there is very significant I think these are the sorts of arguments we need to make to taxpayers I think about in the u.s. context if you think about a context like Haiti or context even in to some extent of some other Caribbean islands where if there was a collapse and we've had a couple instances here in the United States and where were the situation in Haiti was so untenable you know tens of thousands of people got on boats or in rock yuba the Cuban government has cynically used releasing people as a way of removing dissidents but also sort of reducing the pressure on their on their regime so I know it's it's it's not just a challenge unique to Australia you also i look at the sorts of support that you give to PNG something financing over 600,000 school children in schools two thousand kilometers of PNG's most economically important roads a total of nine thousand kilometers 2010 you you all have a big stake in PNG and have been very generous I think we have been generous and as I said then I think that's appropriate given our own particular responsibilities but I think it also makes sense from our sort of hardheaded clear-eyed long-term national security perspective that we do what we can to to to assist Papua New Guinea the dilemma of course is always just getting the balance right I mean too much assistance can veer into that whole sort of dependence spiral not enough assistance can can lead to some of the sorts of problems i mentioned earlier so there's a sweet spot and i think you know one of the tricks for government is is finding that sweet spot and obviously doing that very much in in partnership with the with the recipient government can you can you talk about the the there was a merger with of ausaid and the foreign ministry how was that what was the thinking about that at the time and well these things are always any large bureaucratic reorganizations always a bit traumatic and disruptive especially for the people most closely involved i think there's a spectrum of ways of organizing development assistance and relating it to foreign policy in other parts of the government I think people sometimes lose sight of some of the context here Australia's aid agency has only been an independent entity from our Foreign Affairs Department for less than I think western half of its total life for a period a few years in the 1970s and then again for a few years after after 2010 so in some ways what's happened is a reversion to the the previous status quo but it is disruptive and it does it does cause a lot of concern i know i think there were two key drivers really for what the government did with respect to to the aid agency the first one is is really an efficiency argument under the previous government they'd been a very rapid ramping up of development assistance but they'd also been quite a sudden substantial expansion in in Oz a particularly the sort of senior management layers of Oz aid and there was a sense that efficiency savings were needed i think the the sort of out the the processing costs associated with delivering australian aid had risen to about seven and a half percent whereas the oecd average is i think a bit less than five percent I'm sure there are people who can correct me if I have that wrong so there's a sense that we needed to find some more efficiencies in the program and then the other point was really around alignment with with foreign policy broader foreign policy objectives I had emerged around the same yeah it's a similar approach I guess that the Canadians have taken in terms of the results I think I think you know I've got a lot of friends who who who were in Ozzie before the merger and I think it was very challenging cultural change is a difficult thing and and you know I think in some respects also got the sort of the rougher end of the deal and I know that you know there's been some some issues with morale and so on my sense and again colleagues can tell me if I'm wrong is that we've worked our way through some of that sort of difficult patch terms of the results still very early days but for example the 2013-2014 aid budget was was implemented in full almost to the dollar bang on what was estimated in the budget at the same time is doing this massive reorganization so I think that's a real testament to to the officials involved both in for marat sade and d fed officials and bringing that together when the canadians did this as you mentioned and they had a major under so clearly it didn't didn't go as well as it did in the australian case so you know there's different ways to slice and dice these things and they'll always be debate about what's the best model I think most reasonable reasonable observers would say that so far this seems to be working reasonably well although there's still some distance to go I've been involved both here and in other hats I've worn where there have been sort of endless discussions in Washington about the permutations of the org chart what I call the org chart debate and so it's a it can you you could spend an inordinate amount of time gaming out org chart permutations if I can call that so I I know that it's I'm sure it was i'm sure i know it was disrupted when i visited canberra a couple years ago it was clear that it had been there was a lot on folks who are foreign former AusAID staffers plates when they when I saw them 18 months ago or two years ago so I know it was challenging but I know that this is this is common throughout the OECD whether it's whether it's Canada or the u.s. that there's various sort of changes in how how whereas where does assistance sit in sort of the foreign policy and national security organizational chart could you talk a little bit about two about the you and your government came we were you were part of a government that came in there have been a ramp up bit of assistance there was let's say a ramp down of assistance could you talk a little bit about some of the thinking about why what was behind that I'm sure most of the people in the eighth business don't like reductions in assistance but but it may have been part of a larger conversation I suspect it was sure no you're right i mean the aid cut so i think it's fair to say one of the more controversial things that that that the coalition government did after it came to power in 2013 I guess very happy to sort of debate this in the Q&A a little but perhaps some context they'd been a very very substantial ramping up of the aid budget under the previous government at least in part motivated by not unreasonably by our Security Council candidacy there were doubts within the coalition and I think perhaps more broadly in the community just going back to that sort of lower polling about the sustainability of the eight increase about the targeting of the aid increase and and efficiency issues and so so that was a big part of the context the next part of the context that and I think this really this is just sort of one of the realities our societies live in is that we we had a very bad fiscal situation when we came into government and you did a deteriorating one the the previous five budgets had been the biggest budget deficits in in Australian history the revenue base was eroding very rapidly because of the end of the mining boom our social welfare spend was increasing at a rate well above inflation and so was our health funding and together those consumer vast proportion of that the budget that basically not discretionary so that was the sort of the fiscal backdrop and then I mean the reality is the government's just have to make tough choices so the Coalition had made a commitment during the election campaign to reinvest in defense to meet a target of two percent of GDP for defense spending after significant disinvestment in defense over the previous decade defense frankly had become a kind of ATM that was readily available and is easy to raid without offending too many major domestic communities and and the coalition made no secret of its determination to to reinvest their we also very quickly realized that the threat of terrorism was was growing rapidly again and we invested I think about 1.6 billion in extra counterterrorism resources so that's just a choice i mean the cameron government which is also you know a center-right government when they came to office in the UK they cut defense and they boosted aid spending you know that was their choice maybe they just live in a slightly cruzi a neighborhood than we do but I I think and I'm I'm part of the decision making and I'm not objective obviously but I think most observers would say that our decisions on defense and counterterrorism when you look at things like the Jakarta terrorist attack just a couple of weeks ago growing maritime uncertainty and contestation in Asia and so forth they look like pretty good decisions and the reality is that that something had to give so those were the those were the choices that were made that wasn't the totality of what was done though there was as you mentioned down a sort of decision to narrow the focus of our aid so ninety percent now I think goes to to our region there was a decision to focus much more on economic growth and poverty reduction going back to my point about convincing taxpayers that dollars are making tangible difference to the lives of leading people on the ground performance benchmarking brought in and a determination to to not let programs that are failing just kind of roll on through you know bureaucratic inertia or the fact that they're there already budgeted or whatever and then finally just a sort of and this is a constant issue for I think for development agencies but you know they're kind of what I call though you know the person in the pub test you know how is this going to look if it turns up on the front page of a tabloid in Sydney me and with all we all know those store horrible stories about you know and they're usually taken out of context or whatever but you know consultant X is getting half a million dollars to live in a hotel in country why it's getting a little personal Andrew I'm sorry my nervousness that could affect my business model so I think and again I'm happy to talk more about this you know a very difficult situation aid has a it's just a reality a it has a domestic context and a domestic political context as well as an international context you know I think it's interesting I think about the Cameron government that one of the other things that the first head of differed that's the same set of hard questions about okay how can I tell people back home in a it's not a writing that's in Canada that's but that in sort of the yeah in some sort of a a congressional district equivalent in in the UK that this money is being well spent is not being wasted I can show some sort of a return on it other sorts of questions that political leaders have to be able to answer to I think in this in the u.s. context I think the there is some there is support for for assistance but it requires some nurturing that and it's required putting together coalition's I think some people would say there's a common in the Republican side would be a mix of religious religiously motivated voters national security interests and then that's called economic international trade interests or the coalition and the center right in this country that that are interested in development or a part of sort of the coalition supporting it the the I do think it's sort of an interesting question about how you how do you convince how did either Prime Minister Abbott or how how did you or other senior leaders make the case for assistance or did you get pushback either in Parliament or when you or your boss where we're out talking to to the voters that it puts you in the jobs did this issue come up in foreign assistance ever come up you don't think it's really interesting that altruistic impulse that you described then in an American context is clearly there and my experience was the time you saw at most sharply was whenever there was some sort of humanitarian disaster where frankly it was all it always amazed me and you know you know in a good way gratifyingly how much how much sort of passion and public support there is to help people in those in those terrible circumstances and I guess that's kind of the world we live in with social media and you know everyone's a journalist and you see these you see the real world impact of these disasters much more closely and people do rally and usually ironically in those situations as governments we get criticized for not doing enough yeah so I think I think it's there and it's very real I think you know in terms of of convincing people you know it's the sorts of things we were talking about it it is being very very rigorous it's again I I think you know one of the issues sometimes we have is that we try to do too much and spread out and spread our aid too thinly I mean there are so many different stakeholders and again this is the this is part of the sort of the vibrant diverse you know social media driven world we live in where you know a relatively small interest can can gather a whole lot of support using social media and one consequence I think of that over time is that our assistance gets you know we try to be all things to all people and and we're also a bit prone to you know flitting from one issue to another or one activity to another words they're fads in international development whereas this stuff this stuff takes and we know this from from you know our own region we not from Iraq and Afghanistan and that's pretty Aaron and even frankly you know the rehabilitation of Germany and Japan over it was after the war this stuff takes decades and decades and decades of sort of consistent application and I think sometimes we'd be better off sticking picking something and sticking to editing you know like we're going to we're going to do education absolutely brilliantly in the South Pacific or whatever and we're going to let other donors do health for infrastructure I mean I'm not I'm not saying it should just be education but for example I think there's something to be said for making bigger longer term investments and locking them in rather than flooding from flooding running from pillar to post rater this yeah and look there's always going to be programs it's probably people rolling their eyes because governments are the worst of this you know Prime Minister go somewhere and we roll out another eight not even deliverable yeah for the speech but i but i think come and while i always needs to be responsive i think we do need to take a longer term that's interesting I just let me just press on that a little bit when I was at a ID that though I think many people who were at a ID or at the World Bank or the folks who are from ausaid would say let's we they would agree that you need five or seven or ten years to demonstrate any kind of progress but a lot of the pressure or allow the exigencies are let's call them foreign policy or national security or political exigencies where we're going to a g7 meeting or a g20 meeting or we've got this crisis and yes we know you've got this so I think balancing sort of these having the it could be that if it's a two-way street between the AusAID folks and the foreign ministry folks they did there'd be some understanding that it requires seven or ten years to actually see see the results of some of this stuff that's right and again I don't carry a particular brief for the merger but just going back to that thought you know when I was a young desk officer in indy fat you know you had you your colleagues around you and then all zaid were in another building on the other side of the lake and they were all over there doing their thing the the reality and defend now is that if you're on the PNG desk you know that the person who is doing sort of policy development and you know as we're running the traditional Foreign Affairs desk responsible for Papua New Guinea is sitting next to the person who's designing the the next five years or whatever it is or ten years of the development program who's sitting next to the person who is actually directing the implementation of today's program so and again I'm not sort of just trying to boost what's been dumping it it does seem to me that that that's gotta help in terms of those people working much more closely together day-to-day the the the aid people understanding what the longer term policy agenda is and being able to align their day-to-day work behind that agenda we get two more questions for and then I opened it up I was in Indonesia last week and obviously Australia i think it's the largest don't aid donor to indonesia which is a very interesting country you have economic interest area of diplomatic interest there you have security interests there could you talk I used Indonesia as a as a vector for the larger discussion about countering violent extremism and thinking about how do you think about how does how does the development assistance come into play in the conversation and countering violent extremism yeah this is a huge huge challenge and I'm afraid it's difficult not to be sort of quite pessimistic about the challenge that the terrorism and violent extremism is going to pose in Southeast Asia and the next five to ten years so yeah it's a really big problem Indonesia I think in many ways is is a powerful sort of antidote I mean this is a vast country it's had a difficult it had a difficult sort of birth very rough independence process and a difficult transition to democracy obviously and what I think remarkable is actually how how it's come through that how quickly democracy is taken root there and consolidated it's a very diverse country it's it's got lots of stresses and strains it's got a lot of poverty you know it's got a lot of tough things going on and there is fertile ground there for extremism but by the same token it's still remarkably tolerant it's it's dealt very firmly with terrorism it's arrested I think certainly last time I checked Indonesia no country in the world had arrested and detained more terrorists than Indonesia so it's really been very much at the forefront and its own as the world's largest Islamic population its own example of tolerance and diversity I think it's a really powerful thing so to my mind supporting Indonesia's success is is the key to countering violent extremism I mean yes you need to have these programs that try to try to target it but I have to say I'm a little bit of a skeptic about some of that I think I think this phenomenon is much more about dealing with ISIL in the Middle East emphatically and demonstrating that it's not going to build this this Caliphate and reducing the attractive power and then domestically in a place like Indonesia it's about it's about doing whatever can be done to to sustain economic growth and education and build infrastructure and all those things that go for a successful society because that ultimately is the best way to marginalize this phenomenon although you'll never you'll never quite get rid of it because you know Australia which is you know by most accounts a very prosperous and very successful country with with a proud history of multiculturalism has has its own very very serious problem around extremism with like four hundred high priority terrorism investigations underway as we speak so this is a massive problem and you know we're all going to have to work on it very hard for four decades to come well the the last question I have for you is I think about Australia's economic success is often tied to mining industry other sectors agriculture energy how do those sectors play in development cooperation if at all are how should they be more closely linked in terms of what Australia is sharing with the rest of the world yeah I think this is a real opportunity you know again we tend to think a little bit of development assistance in sort of narrow lanes and silos and is something that development agencies do or NGOs do and sometimes together whereas I think I think we do need to think a lot more about how we use our know-how and often just as often more often it's going to be in the private sector than in government I mean the days when government was the sole repository of development knowledge a long past so if you look at Australia we wear world-leading in dry country you know arid agricultural techniques that's obviously something that we can we can bring to the table water management Australia has world-leading expertise in putting together public private infrastructure partnerships a place like Indonesia is crying out for the knowledge to do that other countries just spending two and a half hours in traffic I would agree with you so so so these are these are aspects of running a you know a modern sophisticated economy that that we have real expertise in and if government can come sort of partner a bit more creatively with with some of these private sector deliveries then I think I think we can make a real difference and then there's this I don't pretend to understand this stuff on a really a tech guy but I was talking to someone about this the ability with with modern satellite constellations and big data to do the most extraordinary analysis of everything from you know how much fertilizer a farmer in an African country should be putting down in a particular month through to you know traffic flows where the weather interconnections that at the very micro level in an economy aren't joining up you know if we put a bridge over this over this river we can increase trade by thirty percent so so there's very smart stuff out there that can be brought into this with some some innovative thought about partnering thank you well you've all been very patient I suspect there are a lot of thoughtful people in this audience that have views so I'm going to while we group some questions together I see this gentleman here yes I'm gonna get my friend it's going to give you the microphone if you just say your name and would you yeah I'm Charlie Reese from Rand welcome to Washington Andrew a question stimulated by the very thoughtful conversation which is monitoring and evaluation this is for a special challenge I had a period of time when I was in charge of us assistance in Iraq and there was one project that I didn't think was working very well but I didn't know the details so I put some money into doing a special M&E evaluation of the project and then the way things are in Iraq I left after my 14 months at war and the next year the project value was in and the project evaluation found basically no problems and I talked to my successor and I said but there were problems we knew everyone know that there were problems why didn't they find problems well there is a coterie of essentially companies that do project implementation and each company has actual incentives not to be too hard on the others because a donor in this case what would it would upset the entire industry shall we say and I wondered whether Australia and now with the collaboration between the US aid and and the fat has found a better way to manage that particular conundrum because it really turns to the question of political support for projects it's a good question it's a really good question charlie I might have to defer to some of my colleagues in the room here I think in part this is what the performance benchmarking that that the government's trying to bring in is meant to address and it's pretty early days with that so unless someone can can update us I'm not sure that that would claim to be a total answer to the to the issue that you've identified just off the top of my head you know that sounds like a case for some almost sort of Kwazii independent you know inspector general now you're always sort of Blanche about creating new new bureaucracy to sort of monitor the bureaucrats you already have but you're right i mean this world is so interconnected that that that sort of you scratch my back I'll scratch your behavior is is undoubtedly an issue and I mean I touched on it before the whole issue of consultants and you know I are you asking the guide to the guy to do the evaluation who you know sits next to the guy who designed the program well probably sometimes and and I'm not sure that they're there are too many answers peer review might be one where you know it you could you could ask people from a like-minded countries aid organization to to kind of step outside for a month and come in and and just take a fresh look now it won't take you totally out of that because again everyone ultimately sort of those everyone else but but at least that's a kind of a couple of distances a bit of distance removed and maybe that might maybe there's something in that I think it's a very good question and I mean to do good and measurement evaluation the rule of thumb this is the much as five percent of whatever the cost is I mean so some of the stuff you want the if you want the Cadillac M&E it's it's pretty expensive and so people will say old there's that issue and I do think there I don't know if it's maybe I don't know if the latest number is and a lot of these folks are my friends and but I think it's something like 20 of the largest implementers in the United States do something like eighty percent of the of the work so there is a it's a it's more than a community it's it's an industry I do think there are i doing I think there's some implicit the implicit conflicts of interest in some of the I can't think of too many evaluations that are too harsh on on anybody and I think the other the other challenge though in addition to them being expensive and sort of this implicit everybody gets a trophy kind of a thing that I can you know a little kitty kitty soccer games or something is who reads this stuff to is the other thing I mean I think the folks that actually do program implementation and they're all written in technocratic gobbledygook and so there that you know I unless you're having trouble sleeping at night I don't know how you know I think there's a there's that concerns i there's a whole series of accountability challenges with this sector I think you've put your finger on so i think it's that's it's more work for me at a think tank that's great so thanks for raising that because i needed a job security so this is great thanks for raising that okay exactly exactly that's there's a little bit of a okay this gentleman there and then this gentleman here these two so I'm bill Costello and I look after development issues at the Embassy across the road and I was an oz ADA for 27 years and now I'm a defect officer on the evaluation question the the previous government established and this one carried on an office of development effectiveness which is a it's still in house but its autonomous in house and they've put across the top of that development effectiveness Advisory Committee actually headed by Jim Adams who used to be the vice president down here at the World Bank so there is a processor but what's happened is capacity is limited so you don't do every project evaluation because there's hundreds of those right and you you kind of end up going way upstream and doing very sort of high-level evaluations of you know what have we done on law and justice over the last ten years or something like that so it's that much more macro evaluation which is more autonomous I would honestly say we have a pretty contestable culture in Australia and I don't think we have a lot of the problem that was described by it by Charlie and there are some people who are outside the consulting industry whose niche is providing that that evaluation so I think you have to foster a separate evaluation community that's not beholden to the big consulting firms and that couldn't be from think tanks but they're also consultants out there doing that results for development as a group like that that's outside exactly but we're actually a very self-critical culture and then I find we actually beat ourselves up a lot so there's not a lot of gossip glossing over the other thing I would say about evaluation is the really hard question is what a success look like right in Iraq especially just holding something together might have been a great achievement I've done a lot of work in Papua New Guinea that's I ran the PNG aid program for a while and holding things together as an excellent outcome but hard to explain to the taxpayer coming back the comments earlier about how you explain it to the taxpayer yeah I suppose one thing I should have mentioned it was actually asking the recipients you know if this is effective if it is this changing your life in meaningful ways because again I you know I think we do sometimes leave the taxpayer out as i said before but we're also sometimes i think a little inclined to leave out the people on the ground just on bills point and welcome bill thanks we've been waiting for your arrival so we're so pleased you're here that i think in the last five or seven years i think there has been two bills point sort of the or I think there's been a i would call measurement evaluation renaissance is probably too strong a term but there's been a series of academics in development economist at yale and harvard Dean Karlan and and some other folks who have done a lot they've also set up organizations like results for development this is a lot in the last five or six years but and i do think it's to do them to do a full-on measure evaluation study is they say it's five percent it's sort of the order of magnitude and it's so that's a lot of money if you get add them up but I so I think it's it continues to be challenging I do think in the u.s. context in particular and I wouldn't be so you know it's very encouraging the sorts of things that that bill is just describing are the sorts of things that you know we ought to be looking at here as well so I do think there it it will always be a challenge expanding i also think in terms of what success looks like if I think of Haiti in the u.s. context there's a clear as a political constituency for Haiti there's significant number of Haitian Americans often in Florida that have a particular interest in Haiti but if you said okay if we look the cold hard interest of the United States on Haiti it would be in addition to sort of being aware that there's a significant political constituencies here you'd say okay well do we want this to be a failed state that drug lords can use to or terrorists can use as a base you know do we want that no and then do we want a hundred thousand people getting coming in on boats that we can't absorb no so to your point about holding it together as a success like not having something bad happen as the metric of success I think is a good point and then it's sort of hard and it's not very nice to explain well look we had a success here in Haiti because we've we've kind of kept it to get empty Dumpty from falling apart again and isn't that a good thing and it's it's not very satisfying if you say well we don't we want to see the additional progress and say well we're trying to get progress but for right now this is the best as we can get and I think at P&G I suspect don't want to put words in any of my friends from Australia's mouths here but I suspect that that it would that what I just said probably perhaps resonates in the PNG kind solutely and if if we've learnt nothing else from the last couple of decades of interventions we've learnt that these things spectacularly difficult spectacularly expensive every one of them is unique that you can't take a kind of cookie cutter approach to to any two of them and and that you know with a little bit of humility we're not actually very good at understanding some of these societies despite all of our resources all of our experience that's true it's this gentleman here and then good thank you Tommy Gardner CTO Jacobs mission solution I focus on data analytics and cybers thanks for your comments on need for more data analytics so see see you after the events are open our door right exactly you mentioned the trade-offs that are natural between aid and and security and defense and I think every government deals with the guns versus butter trades in some way shape or form so I asked if you could comment on the Australian Defence policies may be in regards to the new submarine program or new cyber security efforts so the Australian Government I think in the next in the next month or so looking good former defense colleagues should be handing down a long awaited defence white paper which is kind of a qtr equivalent i'm pretty sure that that that white paper will include a sort of comprehensive funding base for reinvestment in defence consistent with the government's electoral commitments in that area I think you'll see a much stronger focus on maritime capability a larger submarine force slightly larger surface force more focus on is are things like UAVs and networking and yes definitely more focus on on cyber and it also space I think there's a realization that the individual bits of kit the platforms are important but increasingly we've come to understand especially from the sort of operating tempo of the last decade or two that it's really how these platforms or sort of networked together that drives the real effectiveness and where we can get real advantage and and maintain or or extend ideally our capability edge so I think I think you'll see a lot of that in there in the white paper reinvestment in IT systems high-end computing and as I said cyber and space absolutely my friend up here thank you very much Paula Feeney from Karg know the enduring both the George W Bush administration and certainly during Obama's administration there's been a lot of talk about partnerships all sorts of partnerships you've talked about PPP's for example but from your point of view and where you've sat and where you're sitting and what you've read can you give us any examples of what you would see is an effective partnership between australia and the united states in the foreign assistance game that could be something very specific as a project that you may have seen or your colleagues have talked about or something more grand in multi multi country and nature sure it's an excellent question I might I might defer to colleagues on the on actual single projects I mean I can give you what a sort of higher level example so Australia Japan and the United States have a trilateral strategic dialogue and have had that for just over a decade and the coordination of our respective development assistant efforts in places like the South Pacific and Southeast Asia is regularly on the agenda for that meeting you know it's not quite what you're talking about but it's you know Southeast Asia has a deficiency in this area we should do more you know in a sort of macro sense to target that and we should coordinate what we're doing so that we're not doubling up and missing things so I mean I think I think there is movement in that direction there's a there's a working group they used to be certainly a working group on South Pacific development assistance issues that brought together us-australian and Japanese aid officials and I think this is the future because all of us have have these these fiscal difficulties and it just makes so much more sense to coordinate like that the other point though I guess I'd throw in here I think aid flows to the developing world or something like 150 billion dollars at most empty know that right whereas remittances are three or four times that have been private capital is probably I don't know multiples end times that multiples so how do we actually make sure that these things are working together rather than you know cutting across each other seems to me almost a big I mean yes we should totally you know work much more closely on that on the ground with traditional partners but what about all these new partners and what about countries that until fairly recently we were giving 82 that are now give to on ourselves like China it's very relevant in our region China's aid program i think is now roughly the same size as Australia's it's all right if I could put it delicately its strategic interests are not always convergent with ours it's now an active player in a region that until feel it fairly recently was you know more or less an Australian sort of sphere so how do we how do we engage a donor like that that's really hard really challenging work but i think really important so sorry that's a little bit of its ignorant answer but but there is some coordination at the higher level and i think it's starting to sort of drill down into coordination on the ground andrew this prompts it's a really good thanks Paula for that I just promised one question for me about could you just talk for one minute about the aiib and what were you were you part of those that decision making to join the aiib where you around for that us and I was so how did how did Australia decide to join the Asia infrastructure investment bank which is being led by China as you know japan and the united states have a mmm how do I describe it a different view than the many of our friends and allies in Europe and Australia and in Canada this is a really interesting case study if you like of what's going on in the wider region the media would have you believe that Australia said no because the Americans didn't want us to join and then said yes because the Chinese really really wanted us to join it wasn't like that at all essentially what we did was and this got a lot of high-level attention at the top of the government what we did was if you like a first-principles analysis you know what I write Australia's fundamental driving interest in this case do we want to see more infrastructure investment in Asia yes do we want to bring China into global and regional institutions and have a player constructive role yes do we want China to to broadly adhere to the sorts of rules and principles and standards that we think should apply to to finance and development assistance yes we had a look at what China was proposing there were some elements that we were comfortable with there were a reasonably significant number of other things that we were at all happy with around how much control the board would have over investment decisions by the bank and so when we were initially asked we said no but subjects are being satisfied on these things then we're prepared to to join we were very upfront and transparent with the US administration about our approach and we were very transparent with Japan which also shared a number of those concerns and we were completely upfront with the China and said you know this is what it would take to have a store in the bank we appointed a high-level envoy in what to do some negotiations with China and with other other countries and what happened was essentially that the China met the overwhelming majority of those those things we'd identified they are incorporated in new arrangements around the board and therefore we told the US and told Japan and then told China that we join it and I think it's actually quite a good example of how Australia you know if you like doesn't take orders from anyone is capable of being quite strategic quite hard-headed about its its interests and I think it was actually quite effective diplomacy well I think this is going to be a topic of great interest here and when I next go to chem bear I'm gonna want to meet the the person who's who's working on this because I do think it's there's a I think there's perhaps some degree it we I don't not necessarily sure that everyone in the United States of Japan wants a IV to succeed and but at the same time I do think all the points you make are the ones that if you were if you were at for joining the AIB and Canada did it I think South Korea did it and most of the European allies did it yes that's what what that's what we would be the arguments for it and and I mean I think it's I think it's a really good test i mean if if China's serious about playing a greater role and a constructive role that doesn't you know intimidate other countries in the region here's a great opportunity and you know I think if it moves in that direction Australia should continue to encourage the u.s. and Japan to join fair enough fair enough okay other ok let's get this gentleman last question tell us who you are and who you're bleeding I'm Andrew tanga some from atlas call here in the US and I'm also representing the foundation for young Australians in Australia and Australia my organization kind of runs a number of a new coat of exchange programs and I am working with atlas call here who run an exchange program bringing young leaders from other countries to the u.s. to serve in nonprofits here as interested by your comment to Andrew about kind of we don't always understand the cultural context of the places in which we work and just want to kind of get a comment on how are the value of a kind of exchange programs and the importance of developing the personal relationships with people from other countries cultures in terms of maximizing our impact of international development thanks Andrew it's a great question and well done on the work you're doing because it's really important you know if you go back to the origins of Australia's developed resistance it's actually the Colombo Plan which was all about that basically bringing smart young people from all around our region to Australia giving them the best possible education and I mean this a lot of Australians know this story but but many of those people went on to become very senior business leaders and political leaders and community leaders in those societies and forged incredibly important connections for Australia all through the region the the coalition government when it came to office brought in the new Colombo Plan which is if you like is the mirror image of that which is basically and I you know as part of the government but I genuinely think this is a great idea and could have very similar impact over time this is sending thousands of young Australians into the Regents I going like a reverse colombo plan if you like to do internships to get a university to work in philanthropic organizations all around Southeast Asia and North Asia and to build that understanding and those connections that are just so so critical it's great and you know again you just hope that this is one of those things that is allowed to continue for you know decades and build on itself it's already growing really strongly the up takes phenomenal I can't remember the latest numbers but but really really successful and I think I think you're exactly right Android that if you like that sort of personal diplomacy is is just critical and you know I continue on a number of occasions in the middle of a crisis or something it's about finding a way to to connect with with another another place and other government when everything else is kind of blocked up because you're along a heads or whatever and it's being able to find someone to call and and get a message through its it's critical just if you ask former aides staff who have retired this is the most successful a ID programs where the scholarship programs where they sent tens of thousands of folks from developing countries to study in the United States to get masters degrees or PhDs in agriculture and urban planning engineering they want to be or health health related topics of health ministers or agricultural ministers or foreign ministers or prime ministers that stuff is paid dividends for decades Wii it's hard to maintain because it's expensive on a perc on the measurement evaluation question it's on a per beneficiary basis you'd say well it's 10,000 or 15,000 dollars like that is the pushback you get or some folks say I just want to stay in Australia I want to stay in the United States that's the other problem but if you can figure out a way to make it work and get folks to return to their home countries it has all sorts of benefits and dividends and having that sort of connectivity so I'm really appreciate you raising that that question thank you all for coming as you can I think is you can see this has been a very interesting conversation I want to thank again my friends at chevron for hosting this and and thank you Andrew for agreeing to do this please join me in thanking Andrew Scheer thanks you
