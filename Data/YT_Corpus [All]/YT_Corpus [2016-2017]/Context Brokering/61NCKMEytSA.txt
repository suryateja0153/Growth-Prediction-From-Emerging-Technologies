 speaker today dr. mimi ito so when my son was in third grade so about seven or eight he went off on a hike with his dad to a canyon near our house in the canyons of around La and they found a pond that was full of tadpoles so of course they emptied their thermos they scooped up the tadpoles brought them home and I was not super thrilled to see this thermos full of squiggly creatures but my husband assured me he was going to go right away to the aquarium shop and figure out what they needed to raise these tadpoles into frogs so they take off and then they come back quite a while later and my son is just beaming it turns out they bought this huge aquarium with three kinds of sand and rocks and a special light and everything these little critters could possibly want to grow up into frogs but it turns out that my son is not I mean he's happy about all the stuff he's thrilled about the cool stuff but he's actually really excited about somebody he met at the aquarium shop the aquarium shop guy and it turns out the aquarium shop guy he walked that same Canyon when he was a little boy he found tadpoles and then he investigated himself how to raise these tadpoles into frogs and so this experience that he shared with my son was actually one of the foundations for what ignited in him a lifelong passion for learning about aquatic creatures that eventually led to his chosen profession so for up a year after his encounter encounter with the aquarium shop guy when my son was asked that ubiquitous question what do you want to be when you grow up he would say I don't know it's hard question I could design robots you know maybe I'll make video games or I know I could be an aquarium shop guy so today I'll be talking about learning I'll be talking about technology but at the heart of the matter is really this question of how can we help young learners find their aquarium shop guys those educators those passionate individuals and enthusiasts who are going to infect young people with their enthusiasm their passions share their knowledge and expertise and set them on a pathway to become lifelong learners for the rest of their lives so fast forward a few years now my son is a sophomore in high school and he towers over me and nowadays when he has an interest there's something that he's curious about of course the first place he goes is online to find information to find his aquarium shop guys to pursue an area of interest or specialization and so the question that we really have in front of us today is how do we best support young learners like my son who are growing up in an environment of absolute abundance in access to information and social connectivity and this is happening where our institutions of Education god bless them were founded in a much different era of information scarcity where access to experts knowledge and so on was a very different proposition versus the world that our young learners are growing up in where you know there's actually an over abundance of access to knowledge and social connection so we're living through this very interesting moment which at worst is a culture clash and at best is a tremendous opportunity and so I want to talk today a little bit about how we can get past the culture clash and turn the environment where the kids are growing up in today in an opportunity but I want to start with something just a little bit different to get you know everybody warmed up and talking to each other a little bit so I hope you'll humor me and take part in what I think is a fun way to get started into the minds of kids these days which is a Digital youth quiz that will do as a group so the first question I have is how many of you have a device that's connected to the internet that you can access a web page from right now Oh almost everybody okay awesome so I think there's kind of natural groupings if you could form so when I say go and not till I say go if you could just stand up form into groups of three or four and I think there were enough people so everybody just there has to be one person who's going to post online and then look at me once you formed your groups so stand up form of three or four and then look at me okay go okay look at me if you've got your groups and you've introduced yourselves okay I'm seeing a lot of faces we good okay look at me if you've got your groups awesome so now that you have your groups what I'm going to do is we're going to have three questions about young people and technology today so your job in your group is as a group you come up with one answer which is your best guess and try not to google the surveys please because it's much more fun if you just talk about yourselves and see where you are so I'll give you about a minute to come up with a group answer and then you're going to post it to the site which is just a group chat board today's meet com Portland spark 15 so but i'm going to give you the first question then you'll have a minute so the first question is what percentage of americans aged 16 to 29 read a book in 2012 okay so if you have an answer as a group start posting it to today's meet what does take a look yeah switch over okay we're seeing some answers come in thirty percent I guess they wish it was more 27 let's see some more guesses up there our people doing okay is everybody finding the site okay it's today's meet com Portland spark 15 / Portland spark 15 okay they're coming in the answers are coming in okay is everybody let's get a few more 40 20 50 50 so far the highest is 50 anyone cope going higher than 50 or lower than I think 15 might have been the lowest 50s kind of at the high range oh we got a 68 we got an 83 okay I have a feeling somebody might know this research okay you ready to see the the the answer everybody ready okay so maybe we can switch over 83 so who though what say okay I see the 83 team okay so I usually like to start with this just as a reminder that even though kids are super digital these days it doesn't mean that they aren't reading and that they aren't reading long-form things like books so and this is comes from some pew research library research on young readers and it's a good reminder that what we think of as traditional literacies aren't necessarily going away and this is corroborated by other work for example Andrea and Karen munceford have done work on writing of college students and they've found that the volume of writing has increased dramatically over the past 20 years since the turn to digital and contrary to popular expectations the error rates in writing in comparison those two time periods haven't actually changed that the nature of the errors have changed with the error rates the quality of writing has been pretty consistent and that young people act college students actually really do know the difference between a text message and a college essay okay so ready for the next question okay so this is 2009 numbers and this is per day how many hours did us kids aged 8 to 18 spend with media one minute okay next question five hours six hours okay let's see some other some other guesses up there a day in a day okay 5526 seems popular anybody Oh a two hours four hours Oh 14 okay that's the most we've seen okay 10 4 6 okay okay you ready to see the answer oh not yet okay 5.5 we ready okay so seven and a half hahaha I think there were some groups that were pretty close now for those of you who guessed more they are actually able to pack 11 hours of media within that seven and a half hours due to multitasking so there might have been several right answers here and actually between the time that Darren asked me to submit the slides for this event and today a new study was released by common sense media and this number is currently nine hours so between 2009 2014 assuming that's about when they fielded the study you know these numbers have been going up and this is the part that really has been changing because so much of young people's communication so it's not just information it's not just entertainment but their actual social communication is being mediated through digital and media this is why we're seeing this very steady increase in the overall volume of media engagement and we have to understand that you know if you want to meet kids where they are today this this is where they are okay last question what percentage of gamers are female today okay this one is usually pretty fast so okay let's see where we are on the percentages here seventy-two oh wait 30 40 haha 2840 okay 33 there's a range here okay let's go ahead and post people are usually pretty quick with this one so oh look somebody figured out the joystick icon that's nice haha I like that okay everybody post their answers we're seeing a range from ten percent over 50 some people are guessing that more girls than more women than men okay you ready okay 45 okay I think there's some groups that we're pretty close so yeah the you know I think the important thing to realize with gaming is it's not just for teenage boys anymore than four on reserve diversified the demographics have diversified you know among teens virtually every kid as a gamer it's at about ninety eight percent now in 2008 the gaming industry surpassed the movie industry in revenue gaming is the dominant entertainment medium of our time full stop so thank you everybody for participating in the Digital youth quiz everybody's a winner and yes so I think it's an important reminder that you know these kind of more interactive and participatory forms of media engagements not just more media but the types and genres and the level of engagement in media has changed dramatically now that gaming really is the dominant mode that kids interact so I think the question we were faced with today is given these kids who are always connected who is expect engagement participation interactivity what happens when they walk into the classroom so not only are they facebooking and texting during class but you know they're taking to this whole ecology of peer to peer connection to meet a variety of learning needs and sometimes they do things that we approve of like doing note taking on an either powder wiki or you know setting up a Facebook group around a class but they're also doing things like screening the hard graders through ratemyprofessors.com going to one of the many sa download sites free and paid or you know my latest favorite our services that will take your online class for you so the problem is now that the communication at the student layer is so fast and seamless we as educators can't really be in the job of playing whack Amole to limit the communication it's really challenging us to think of how to engage with this new ecology as a positive force rather than something that we need to police and the problem these problems happen really when learning is not tied to meaningful problem solving an inquiry when it's about filling in the blank so writing an essay that's been written a hundreds and hundreds of times before and when if when learning is really becoming for the student you know filling in the blanks the line on the resume the grade and so on we all know that as good educators and in a way a lot of these new you know communication platforms and so on are challenging us to really return to the fundamentals of what we know is good pedagogy and the kind of learning that we want to support so this is the challenge we're facing now we know that young people enter school pretty happy engaged eager to learn and over time the longer we have them in schools their enthusiasm for learning declines over time so this is what Gallup has called the school cliff and by the time they get to us in college about half of them are disengaged and Richard Arab and Yosef Orosco have recently done a fairly large-scale study of learning among college students and have followed them into early adulthood and they've found some pretty damning evidence for those of us working in higher education they did assessments of student learning that we're really centered on writing and problem solving critical thinking higher order kinds of learning and capacity and they found that about half of students showed no games in their first two years of college so that should really be telling us something so we're really in a context where we're kind of living through this culture clash be tween the modes and institutions of learning that were perfected in earlier age and the expectations and practices of internet kids who are growing up in a much different kind of networked ecosystem and it's important to remember that this gap or this culture clash looks differently for kids located in different points of the socio-economic spectrum and I know we'll have speakers later today that will be addressing some of these concerns and you know what most of us are aware of the fact of the equity gap in formal education right we know the differences between the access and resources that kids have in schools and even though we're seeing rising rates of college attendance and completion across the socio-economic spectrum more privileged kids are you know getting there more so the gap is widening but what a lot of people don't realize is that the gap is actually widening faster and out of school enrichment and this is these are numbers that are showing the changes that in family investments and out of school learning activities where you'll see that the porous the bottom line is the poorest quintile of families you know since the 70s it's kind of stayed at about a thousand dollars per family and you'll see that the wealthiest families have tripled their investments from about 3,000 to almost nine thousand dollars per family during that same time period and what this is really showing is that highly educated and wealthier families are really investing in that kind of out of school learning that is about letting their kids specialized pursue passionate interests having the opportunity to connect with peers mentors aquarium shop guys in their area of interest and go deep and have those experiences of you know being able to pursue something that's a genuine interest in passion but also being able to connect with adults caring adults in that area of interest and do something that is about finding their place in the world in making a genuine contribution whether that's through athletics through artistic performances through publications that experience of really being able to put something out there in the broader world having that firm handshake being able to look an adult in the eye and feel like you really have a place here something to contribute and that you belong these kinds of authentic experiences you know the it's not that the poor families don't believe that they want this for their children but increasingly it's become a burden on families to produce these kinds of offer these kinds of experiences in their out of school settings so in theory technology should help right because we can deliver more cheaper more broadly MOOCs are just one example of how open online technologies are creating really new possibilities right for young learners to be able to access highly specialized kinds of learning opportunities content have access to experts in a way that was really unimaginable for earlier generations now the problem though is that we know from the history of technology time and time again that when you drop a new technology into an already unequal social world that technology gives the more privileged people super powers right so in theory the internet is free and accessible to everybody in reality it's giving even more advantage to the kids who come from tech savvy highly educated families and you see this really clearly in for example looking at MOOCs where the vast majority of people who engage with MOOCs are people who already have degrees in higher education so that's where it's just so critical the work that all of you are doing here because it's really our educational institutions have an even more powerful role to play in providing access support mentorship brokering to guide young people to this much wider palette of opportunities that we have today okay actually I'm gonna go back so I want to kind of take a bit of the temperature of all of you here in this room just how you're feeling about kids these days and how your organizations are grappling with these changes so if you could show me with your thumbs let's start with you that your organization your school or university or wherever you're working how optimistic or pessimistic do you feel about how your organization is adapting to these changes where a thumbs up is like we're killing it we're innovating we're taking advantage of all these new opportunities thumbs down is it's a really tough slog you know we feel like we're in the pain point of this culture clash where sideways is somewhere in the middle so show me with your thumbs where you think you are okay a lot of thumbs ups and a lot of sideways i don't think i see many thumbs down that's probably because you're here which is good this is a nice crowd so now i want to hear what you think about kids these days so how pessimistic or optimistic do you feel about kids these days and whether these new technologies are making them smarter better faster and it's a great thing thumbs down is they're distracted socially isolated you know really shallow thinkers and sideways is somewhere in between okay interesting yeah so I think I see more thumbs up for the kids than the organization's although it might be a pretty even split but I like to quote bill Gibson who said the future is already here it's just unevenly distributed so I feel like you know it's different kids are inhabiting a different reality but it's great to see that this is a group who is clearly trying to make a difference and making some progress so I want to make it a little bit more concrete by talking about a young learner so what I do is my team and I hang out with teens on the internet and figure out how they're learning and affiliating online and we did a range of case studies of youth affinity groups ranging from gamers to fans to fashionistas and how they were using the internet and their peer relations online to fuel their learning and Abigail comes from a study that we did of towns of the boy band One Direction how many of you know one direction okay admitted you know I know more of you know NAT Wondrich oh so they're an incredibly activated fandom as you may know digital fandom but we were specifically looking at young mostly girls who were writing fanfiction around 1d and abigail was a great example she was 14 when we talked to her and she started as a fan of harry potter and then moved on to be a directioner and she found her people on this platform called wattpad which is an online publishing platform where which has become quickly the dominant platform for fanfiction writers and so she you know first started as a reader and then she was really nervous about it first that started publishing her own work on wattpad after a while you know after her mom got her a smartphone she would write her stories on her smartphone and publish them and then she started getting positive feedback and eventually had quite a following and so if you look at her learning pathway she started with a passionate interest around Harry Potter in one direction and then what was really game-changing for her was she was able to connect to a community who shared not only this interest but who was also supporting her learning and skill development and writing through this online platform and then what was very interesting about Abigail it's kind of an exceptional story in this sense is that she had a teacher at school who she confided in that she was actually a fan fiction writer most kids won't do this when we interview kids they're like oh my god I would never tell my parents or teachers I write one deep and thick but she did she shared with a teacher and then her teacher brokered some opportunities in school she suggested she write for the school newspaper and other things and eventually Abigail went on to you know take the leap into applying to a specialized high school that would foster her interest in creative writing and it's definitely something she wouldn't have done if she hadn't had this opportunity to really develop her skills and confidence within a supportive peer group that she found online so how many of you know a young person who goes online to connect to a passionate affinity group whether it's making movies or phantom or gaming okay so most of you now keep your hand up if that young person has connected that interest to an opportunity in school or career or civic engagement okay yeah that's much fewer so you know that's actually what we found in our research too so abigail is an example of what we call a connected learner she's somebody who was able to take an interest and connect it to find a supportive pure learning community that supported that interest but was also able to connect it to an opportunity right and what we found was that most kids have a peer group most kids have an interest a fair number of kids are geeking out on an interest in an online affinity group that allows for specialization and the kind of learning that would necessarily be possible within a local context but very few of them are able to then connect that to a school opportunity or a job opportunity or a civic engagement that happens but as much rarer even when we are intentionally sampling and looking for kids who are doing this so the reality for most kids is that they're actually struggling to connect the learning that they're doing in school to their interests much less to the wider world right and the question I think that's really in front of us as educators is how do we build these connections and at one level it's pretty simple right we need to have people who are experts who want to share what they know and we have to let kids find them find their aquarium shop guys this doesn't require technology but in theory the internet should be able to help with this right so the ideal I think is that all of us in our very learning institutions at least part of our job should be about helping to support kids in building these connections and brokering to opportunities in the wider world so I have a question for all of you I think we've all had an experience of connecting to somebody who are having a person in our lives who has pushed us to try something new who has pushed us to go deeper into something that we're engaged in already these are the aquarium shop guys in our lives right it could be a teacher in your childhood it could be a friend a fellow hobbyist somebody who shares recipes with you it encourages you to try something new or it could be a community of interest like Abigail had with her fanfiction community so I want to ask you all to just take 30 seconds because I'm running over already and just turn to your neighbor and you know share if there is a learning hero in your lives it doesn't have to be like a gigantic learning hero could be a little learning hero so take 30 minutes and if you at 30 seconds and then posted today's meet with hashtag learning hero or even tweet it out if you want to share okay I don't want to kick you on stage and we will have a couple of questions okay yeah I want to leave time for questions what is your learning here or who is yours so think about okay okay so if anybody wants to share their learning heroes feel free to post I usually map to hashtag just post on the today's meet or if anybody wants to just share in real time too I think it might be hard to hear in this group though nobody wants to share on today's me does anybody want to share to the group you have hahahaha Darryl would be fine to be named as an learning hero anybody know learning heroes okay thank you wow so you're still in touch with some of the people from then to anybody else yeah that's all so yeah these are great examples a lot of times oh here's more yeah we have their these very potent memories from our childhood but then you know it's it can happen at any time in your life and a lot of family members and the diversity of who people name is learning heroes is actually incredibly interesting if we can go back to the slides yes so just feel free to keep sharing on the today's meat so it turns out that the research backs this up and I'll just point to one study and there are many others that was done by in collaboration between Purdue and gallop where they interviewed 30,000 college graduates several years after they finished college to try to understand what in people's experiences in higher education left led to a thriving in life and this wasn't just economic outcomes but really about community connectedness well-being health a lot of factors and they found that it didn't actually matter if it was an elite university or a less selective school if it was small or big or whether it was specialized or general liberal arts orientation the two things two things mattered one was what you might think of as project-based learning like did they engage in a meaningful activity that could be in class or extracurricular but longer than one term that mattered and the second thing was the aquarium shop guy effect so did they find a professor who inspired them or they connected with and that doubled their the impact in terms of life outcomes so the aquarium shop guide matter is that it's been you know really something that has come out in our qualitative work around connected learning as well okay so the question is what can we do as educators as technology makers as people in schools colleges and universities what should that look like in an era of abundant connect conductivity and we've been you know this is a work in progress but as a community we've been looking to the connected learning approach to say look it's not about each organization taking on this whole ecology but how can we work together better in brokering opportunities between our organizations whether it's a museum a library a school and aquarium shop guy whatever resources we have and it's really really great to see regional events like this that I think are really part of the answer in thinking about a region as a network ecology of organization serving students because from a student's point of view it's not like everything's going to be in one place it's about connecting the dots and we find that the best connected learning experiences are really about integrating the social and peer support with interest but also to the opportunity piece and that's often the most critical missing piece of the equation and that at the center of connected learning experiences we generally find that there are certain properties which we talk about as design principles one is the shared purpose principle that you're doing something meaningful together it can be a sports competition it can be making something it can be a civic engagement but there's a meaningful relevant pursuit that the learning is support and support of secondly a lot of these activities have some creative or production orientation to them and finally is the openly network principle and this is the part that's about connecting to the wider world that it's not just a self-contained activity but there's some way in which it's engaged or visible or accessible to a wider network so I'll give two examples just in closing which are some of the efforts that my colleagues and I have been working on to try to put some of these ideas into practice one is the you media learning labs the first one was launched several years ago as a teen space within the main downtown library in Chicago and its really a drop in youth media center that is staffed with mentors and areas of youth interest in the digital arts and has a whole lot of resources ranging from books two laptops to a sound studio and it models the principles of connected learning because it's focused on kids making things with digital media and they are organ attacked if it is you know it can be kind of informal hanging out e but they also support the what they call signature projects and performances like spoke weekly spoken word performances competitions something like a record label or video game podcast things that kids are doing together that is genuine and meaningful to them and then finally they make even though there are physical space they make the effort to have their student their kids work visible to the wider community whether that's through doing performances in a regional spoken word competition or publishing the game review podcast or putting their fashion work on a tumblr site that kids are getting feedback and recognition from the wider world and then finally this is a new venture I launched earlier this year called connected camps which is an effort to deliver learning experiences through the game of Minecraft and minecraft of course supports production center it's not the only thing that supports that we really focus the making the coding the design aspects of Minecraft we've staffed our camp within our courses with high school and college counselors who are themselves minds you know passionate about Minecraft and for them to the opportunity to give back to younger kids into a learning community through a game that they love and have invested so much time in that like reorients their whole interest world into a space of opportunity and possibility and then the counselors design you know coding challenges survival challenges building challenges and so on that motivate the kids to really up their game and then finally minecraft of course is one of the best examples of a game that lives and thrives in an openly network ecosystem where our kids are sharing on live streams and tumblers and watching YouTube videos and so on so there's not a whole lot of work we have to do on top of the already existing minecraft ecosystem so I know all of you are doing tons of things to you know grapple with these different dimensions of Internet add a new technology and I think the exciting thing about the times we're living in is all of us have a role to play whether we're a formal educator and administrator technology maker a parent or even just somebody who knows something and might want to share it online it's super easy and in fact it's incumbent on everybody to be part of the solution to education there's really no excuse because everybody can do something and in that spirit I know you have a full day and other opportunities to talk more about and I'm looking forward to learning more but there's one thing that I would love it if you could do today before you leave this site so you all talked about learning heroes a few minutes ago and I'm assuming that most of you had somebody so the question I have is does this learning here or know about the role they played in your life so and they might know already but even if they know they wouldn't mind hearing again so send them an email tweet out pick up the phone and just let them know that they made a difference in your life that's one thing you can do today and this is just one example of many of the very small things that we can all do to support an openly network ecosystem where kids are going to be finding their aquarium shop guys so we have a lot more information about connected learning the research we have a openly network community of faculty engaging through connected courses around these ideas so I look forward to hearing from all of you and I think we have a few minutes for question yes yes we do does anybody have any questions yes I I've been I've been looking at Twitter my first question for you and keep thinking about it is what does learning look like an environment of abundant creativity about it creativity yeah well it's interesting because I think the piece like in a lot of ways like the creative and making side of learning is you know there's not it's not new but I think what's really different about today's EKOS system is the ability that kids have to share and circulate their work and get feedback on their work in ways that wasn't possible anymore previously so you know I talked to a lot of people who have ended up in sort of creative or Scientific careers and most of them have this these early experiences of kind of messing around and tinkering and making stuff but a lot of them were doing in a fairly solitary mode for their childhood and it's really different now like kids like Abigail you know they're they just can get that community and peer support and feedback in a way that was really not possible before so that feels very different to me yeah well I struggle every day yeah I mean I think that you know the thing that is hard for parents today is that we don't necessarily have familiarity with the specific interest that a lot of our kids are engaged in whether it's gaming or fandom or so on so like when my daughter got into fandom and suddenly I'm like Wyatt you have two thousand Twitter if I was like what's up with that you know it's like you have to kind of learn and pay attention and be comfortable with being a little bit clueless but asking a lot of questions and you know I I think it really pushes us as parents to be learners and to do reverse mentorship while still like really being involved at asking the the same fundamental questions that parents have always asked our kids about our kids which is you know are they you know are these productive relationships you know is it is there the right balance of things in their lives and especially I don't know parents of gamer boys struggle all the time I think because we don't necessarily know all the genres of gaming like who are those other strangers on the other side of teamspeak and you know I've you know I make sure my son's computers and a public space I'm always hovering over him and irritating him and asking a lot of questions but you know at the end of the day you know I feel like he actually appreciates my curiosity and you know it is quite open to my suggesting things and learning with him about the stuff so I think the co-learning stands especially if in the teen years is really really important all right anything else any last questions last chance there you go yeah yeah no I think that you know when often and this we see with when kids talk about educators to who have had a meaningful impact on their trajectories is that you know they they have so much depth in these areas of specialty that they're interested in and they they can just spend so much more time and intensity so like it's really fun to just listen to them sort of nerd out on something that they're into right now and you know I think it's especially challenging like when I talk about one direction I get more eye rolls on that than anybody else but just to say look it's actually really interesting and I really want to hear and know about what's interesting and why this is a fascinating community and then it is fascinating so like I learn a lot but then there's sort of this part where it's like oh well they don't necessarily know how to connect their interest to things that matter for their opportunity in their future lives and for adult facing worlds and like when we talk to say fanfiction writers or like gamers who play a game like Starcraft that has so much sort of literacy and stem and academic content you know like I coach these kids and how to talk about their interests in a way that they can advocate for their interests in the adult world and that's where the mentorship the adult perspective is so important it's like it is sort of a cultural anthropologist kind of thing where you know after a while like we talked to these One Direction fans they're like I don't read or write and I'm like what do you mean you don't read or write like you're you just wrote a thousand pages of fanfiction like I don't write that's like what you do in school and then after a while of conversing and being respectful of their practice they start seeing their stuff as possibly relevant for school and the same thing with starcraft gamers like the kids who get really good at for ad about advocating for their interests they'll say oh we advocated for a starcraft after school club in our high school we told the teachers that it's all about critical thinking and problem solving and mathematical reasoning and then they gave us like a room and you know money for our clubs so like when kids kind of develop that confidence of having an adult like listen respectfully to their interests and you know help them build those connections it's the thing about connected learning is it seems like it's kind of at the margins of what we do as educators but for the kids it's at the absolute center of their being so if they can make one connection from their interests to the adult world it can be life changing so that's the difference between the connected learning and interest driven model from other kinds of subjects that we deal with because the other subjects are at the center of our worlds the interests are at the center of their worlds and that's when building those connections becomes incredibly transformative okay one slipped in right at the end is there a day coming when teaching becomes entrepreneurial oh maybe that days already here I mean I find it very interesting because you know I've been tracking a lot of these new companies that have been popping up on the internet whether that school of everything or Skillshare or the Mookie stuff and I think there is this trend right now for this much more demand driven kind of you know decomposed sort of learning opportunities so if you're like somebody who can do nail art you can run a class on Skillshare if you want to you know do your homebrew class and so there is the sense that these hobbyists and these experts in any domain can suddenly just do these pop-up teaching opportunities in ways that weren't possible anymore now I do think you know that doesn't mean that our existing educational institutions are going away but I do think that it creates a different sort of unbundling of our business models to think of it and business speak in that we used to count on packages of sort of expertise instruction and assessment they all come in a package that we think of as a course and that's changing where the credentialing the actual content expertise and the instructional setting is becoming unbundled and different companies are kind of taking on different pieces of the ecosystem so I do think our educational organizations and all of I'm sure all of you are grappling with this you know we're trying to figure out how to function its effectively within this pretty fundamental change can you please give her hand think
