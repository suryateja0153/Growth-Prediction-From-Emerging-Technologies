 okay hi everybody I'm David Grossman and I oversee TV and entertainment content partnerships for Twitter amplify there's no presentation for the next 30 minutes you're just going to watch people walking that's it tell me how you enjoy that no I'm kidding so what I would like to do today is is take you through kind of the evolution of video on Twitter which is relatively new it's about two and a half three years old and kind of tell you where we are and hopefully share some insights and learnings that are helpful as I take you on the on the journey that we've taken over the past couple years and give you a little bit of a of a peek at what we think we're headed so twitter has always been a real-time conversational public platform but real time was this a couple years ago it was Carson storch talking about some great stunts he did on the bike and he might have thrown in a hashtag so people could join in the conversation and people could reply and favor it but that's what real time was and obviously there was something missing and what was missing was the ability to give that first person media forward compelling view of what Carson was seeing and what Carson was talking about so to Nephi eight years later this is what you'll see on Twitter we have good sound do we have I think we have good sound on the sounds like coming off the laptop anyway to adjust that or no get everyone here from my mic you can hear it okay all right so what we have to worry about it so so we made this journey from his Carson storage talking about I did this crazy trick and people like yell sure you did buddy if you say so it's just you just wrote 140 characters about it to here's this amazing first and video of what he did when he did it tweeted out in real time so that's the the journey we've been on is how do we get from from A to B over the past couple of years as we've innovated we've kept a couple of things in mind our unique strengths what about our platform makes us special what do we build on first we're mobile so we're about ninety percent of our video views are on mobile that was an important thing to take into account we're live things are happening in real time people are not generally coming to Twitter to see what happened yesterday they want to see what's happening now they want to enter a real time conversation and its social we want to give people the ability to share a video to now like not favorite to now like a tweet to reply to quote tweet so those are the innovations we built on and I'm gonna show you a little time line I'm going to buzz through this piece because we get into each bit of this and more depth and should go without saying please stop me at any time with questions thoughts comments Corrections two and a half years ago video on twitter was vine it's still a very important part of what we do but we were limited to a handful of folks relative handful that could upload six-second videos onto twitter it may 2013 amplify launches pairing premium content with advertisers that are serving our users in the in the process then we said all right well it's great that we can we can connect champs sports with the NBA but was still sending a link to youtube that's that's fine it works but it's it's a lot of clicks it's not media forward you're not necessarily finding the stuff you like not necessarily compelling user experience so we launched our need a video player which led to one click playback full screen and landscape on mobile and most recently autoplay snappy TV this has been a march towards ease of use for everybody involved in publishing and consumption of video on Twitter so with snappy TV that was an eye mostly towards the the content owners how do they clip compelling videos gifts images and get it out to Twitter and by the way other social platforms really really quickly and easily promote a video we gave brands the ability through our native player to tell the story on Twitter that they want to tell mobile video we allowed everybody to now be a creator and to publish an upload video again into this native player niche partnering we have these great video capabilities now now we can we take up a group of creators and make the process of aligning them with brands and other content companies much simpler and more efficient periscope everybody went for being a creator without with with the mobile video camera to now being everybody being potentially a broadcaster as we've seen compellingly in big events and small around the world over the past year or so and amplify open so amplify if you look on the on the bottom left amplify is now no damn polite custom we have a new version of a michael amplify open and i'll explain the difference there whoo that's aiming to serve in a moment so vine we'll start with vine so again as i mentioned vine started about two and a half years ago and it was a lot of this this is great by the way if you have a hedgehog playing a piano you can't go wrong with that everybody loves that no but then brands started taking a look at what was happening and brands like EULA Packard started doing some really cool stuff with vines and we were matching the brands with creators to do fine things like that that are really compelling and fun but are also by the way demonstrating a functionality they like this so much HP that they commissioned the series of vines and turns it into a TV ad that's kind of the evolution of vine so in may 2013 Twitter amplify comes around and its simplest form amplify is basically taking content that airs on TV now at a live event at a sporting event that tweet gets promoted by a brand from the publisher handle in real time to who the advertiser wants to reach so in this case you have the US Open and a tweet promoted by Heineken and I'll show you some some examples of this in a minute and the different applications of amplify important thing to know is that we have about 200 publishers now including networks leagues MCNS and live event companies in about 20 countries and speed of amplify so you know people are out there on on Twitter talking about a game about a show in real time they were doing that way before video and we know it's going to happen anyway the love they hate the emotions the predictions it's all going to be there but now what's happening with this video experience is we've given the publishers the tools to go put this great media forward experience their users have come to expect it brands go align with it and the speed of use outside this time to social and the speed of those clips getting out there and getting forwarded by brands is nearly immediate with amplify so here you have quick Chris Palmer tweeting Kawhi Leonard and the spin cycle that was smooth he just saw it on TV 1102 it's an amplified tweed the co whitestorm erupts on tnt so that was about a two minute lag it can happen much quicker than that now and what you see is you see the play one thing you see like giving like Alonzo Harris we can up on it like damn that was clear and so amplify started out as as really a thing for live sports brands are investing millions and millions of dollars in these rights in the broadcast component of it and be in the live venue component of it and then we said you know what it's it all makes sense for sports it might make sense for the Academy Awards or the VMA s because you know 20 people will get into a war room and exchange 30 emails for something like that they're not necessarily going to do it for one episode of Ellen for a week on The Today Show for a weekly clip of an episodic series because it's still too hard and everything we've done along the way has been sort of like snappy like the native video player has been again ease of use ease of finding the video in a media forward way ease of getting the clip out there and we sort of seen amplify explode different executions around ten poles and lots of own brands and advertising in but also a lot of everyday stuff so I'll show you a couple of examples I don't want to play out the full examples in the interest of time but i'll give you a sample mcdonalds people branded cousin freedom around Univision tremula nuestro so think about what McDonald's is doing here i worked at univision so i have the insight into it but it's pretty much the same across the board in terms of the basics mcdonalds is a major investor in the on-air broadcast they're also doing activations on-site doing integrations maybe some kinds of consumer tie-in now they have the ability through amplify to take that that sponsorship into social and mobile through our platform reach you they want to reach when they want to reach them we broker the deal we brokered the and we advise on the content and the targeting of course and when it is an award show it's not always a highlight on air like you just so feminine oster oh this is billboard music awards and this is sponsored by acuvue so j and j brand and sometimes it could be ancillary footage behind-the-scenes footage or focus on different aspects the fashion aspect of an award show for example last year's be be amazed red carpet was full of memorable moments from blunt bangs too bright eyes so let's take a look back at how your favorite celebs to find beauty in 2014 see there was pre-roll but that was on target for the brand in terms of the content that was but there we extended then to to ongoing series and here's out weekly eight blooper outtakes sponsored by Clorox they call it bleed real moments basically moments that you want to make disappear that happen on The Bachelorette the following Bachelorette bleach abul moment has been rated n for nailed it I can't believe I'm at this brand new hotel right at the end I can't believe I'm at this brand new hotel I can't believe I'm at this birth so it's funny division that's something that was right on point for Clorox it was additive for consumer because they're watching the show you know there's some scripting and you know this is that going on you know it's a little bit of force trauma but you're getting the kind of see how like the how the sauce is made and the sausage I think it's the sausage is the expression you gettin see how the sausage is made there but in a really out of way if you're sitting there and fascinated by the Bachelorette in real-time up lip sync battle on on Spike this is a show that launched about eight months ago this show hasn't had an episode without an amplified component Smirnoff was in from the start and then Dr Pepper came in and so there has not been an episode of the show since its inception that has not been amplified that's pretty simple that's a real just simple quick highlight each week amplify is not always video by the way it'll be gifts they'll be images they'll be vines that can be audio cards and when it is video it may not always be pre-roll it might be a branded integration that's happening for a brand or it could be both in an example like this presidential guard number two he died protecting our great nation from its deadliest aquatic fo and for that we are eternally indebted Presidential Guard number two will be missed by his family his country and the remainder of his overpriced wireless contracts total wireless has no contract so you don't pay for more than you need sharknado 3 oh hell no continues next so that's kind of where we come in we and where the integrated marketing teams and the social teams at the partners come in this is not going to work for the democratic debate this works perfectly in the context of sharknado in this brand we've also seen this is again very simple execution but in this case zyrtec had an extensive sponsorship across all of the Thursday night Shonda Rhimes shows on him on ABC really highly social properties we actually have a whole team at Twitter that works with the show runs and the producers to make the shows more engaging and get more of a look outside the monetization and brands so we've worked really closely with shonda rhimes the shows are really social big deals on Twitter and in this case you had sir tech saying can i sponsor a night can I just sponsor the best of tgit and they ran a promotion around this this was a grey's anatomy tweet but there were also scandals scandal and how to get leads burger season like this no one can predict what happens next grey's anatomy season finale next Thursday on ABC eventually amplify is not just video so this is a gift this is actually the first branded gift that ever ran within an amplified campaign and this is interesting because it's it's kind of like what's it what's happening now with periscope on Twitter we we developed a product we acquire a company and we say all right well we're going to have a nice we're going to get the user experience right then we're going to create a right ad unit around it and we're going to start monetizing it and what inevitably happens is a brand a Content owner some creative genius on a social team will go out there and say this is how I think we're going to do it and and we've seen some amazing things develop so we don't have a product we don't have an actual product right now we're working on it to to brand a gift within an amplified campaign MTV when it did this themselves around the mtv movie awards in partnership with revlon within an amplified campaign so that's that's at any just a pause for a second any questions anything I've showed so far or anything on amplify cool so let's go to native video again this was really all about making the user experience better and putting great video and images gifts to vines front and center so the videos I've been showing you how being I be clicking on never stop but we're in autoplay world now so what you see the user experience for for amplify now is you'll see a brief thumbnail of the content and in amplify the video is coming from the partner handle so scandal NFL whatever it might be so you'll see the you'll see that you see the teeth of the handle you'll see a thumbnail of the content so you'll have a signal that's coming it gets one hundred percent interview it begins auto-playing the pre-roll unmute the charge point for the brand is either three seconds on mute or click whichever comes first we limit the pre-roll when there is free roll and amplify 26 seconds right now we may test skippable down the road and then it goes right into the content this is all other things that we do now with our native player this is opportunities like video docking no personal just as very focused why some video down going to our screen wont goal and keep scrolling point call to action in the video to to watch a stream to watch a broadcast to view more videos but i would say that order plate has been the biggest thing there we're seeing cost previews come down with seeing engagement rates and view rates go up and it's been a real real boon from an amplified perspective also so snappy TV i mentioned how many people in the room are familiar with snappy the capability so snappy really it this is an example of really serving the publisher as well and really minimizing time to social we know that the ability the amount of all things equal the amount of engagement retweeting and so forth we're going to see around a tweet is maximized when that week goes out in the first couple of minutes when it goes out 5 10 15 even 20 minutes later we're going to see a significant drop-off in the engagement there and way less relevance for twitter user so snappy TV is ingesting a stream like this in the interface like this and allowing for immediate tweets like this in this case it was a motogp amplified tweet but often it's not amplified we have a lot of content partners that are just using us as the backbone of everything they do be at amplifier and I if I might just be a small part of it all promoted videos so we took our native tools we took the media forward experience and we started letting brands tell the stories that they want to tell it's not for every brand some brands may may stick with images they may stick with text they need to do polling they may do largely amplify but there are a lot of brands and they're getting better at it because they have to in this world every day of telling their own great stories in this case it's Budweiser but we've seen with a ton of brands again autoplay similar charge point for advertisers a lifetime is not long enough to show you what you mean to me that doesn't normally happen I know I'd stop but that kept going and it's a great story a lot of you may have seen that but when when it works it puts a lot of onus on the brand but we're giving them we're giving them the the distribution we're giving them the the the great user experience we're putting a lot of onus on them to tell them stories but when it works it's amazing in this case the Budweiser video 2.5 million submitted that million video views in the first week six to one earn two paid ratio which is tremendous and a huge lift in positive sentiment and mentions around Budweiser after the campaign versus before on Twitter and we're seeing it across all different categories of course b2b q sr across out bev retail automotive and others and this really this was from like the first few weeks this this slide it's been utilized really a lot really happy with where it's with where it's headed so I talked about promoted video I talked about amplifying some other things we want to just quickly pause and do a side-by-side because it confuses everybody even still me and our team on a bad day if you look on the left that's amplify it's a tweet from the US open handle promoted by Heineken to heineken wants to reach with official content if you look on the right heineken obviously a big sponsor of the US Open beyond just beyond amplified beyond just television and other digital properties so Heineken also wants to go out there and have content for their own handles to drive engagement to hopefully boost followers and to further their association with this important investment for them so they'll tell their own stories from their own angles day how would you feel about sitting up in that chair and quieting all of these people so what I love that this example is you see how Heineken is accomplishing two very different things but in that in a way that's just great for the user if you're like tennis and you engage in the match you want to see the replay but also if you're if you're a fan if you have been to the US Open or a tournament like that you love the crowd and the spectacle and the shopping and the technology and everything that goes around it so it's really fun and that's the story that view is open it may not tell or may not be what Heineken chooses promote from the US Open handle and have a limited amount of content and money to do that but then they go and they tell their own stories at the same time and and complement that so periscope periscope is pretty new this is actually what happened visiting New Yorkers in the crowd this is what happened on day one this is a essentially go terrible a tragedy but on day one there was a fire on the lower east side of manhattan and like the day before it was like 50 of us at the Twitter offices streaming that we just each ate a sandwich and the and the CEO of Twitter was like watching us eat our sandwiches because we were all just dogfooding it and then the next day we start seeing the power of it and we've seen the power of it unfortunately seen it recently and some real horrible ways compelling but horrible but it's been interesting to see what happens with brands and how pop culture on a much lighter note have picked up on the power of periscope and the big opportunity and challenge for us on this front is to see how brands and broadcasters continued integrated so one thing we know we have to do is get periscope into a more media forward instantaneous experience on Twitter but there's also another experience with brands we don't have a periscope add product now a lot of brands have done factory tours cars coming off a lot I'm red carpet premieres and things like that so they've done their branding and they've used periscope but amplified we're like a we got to come up with a periscope product at some point for amplify and then you had brands verizon and Taco Bell around the VMA saying well we'll do an image tweet will will tell users that we're going to go live on periscope from the red carpet in three days at seven pm eastern and then afterwards we'll clip some of it up and we'll do recaps of the different q and a's that happen so we're starting to see those things develop organically on their own more and more you'll see with a bit of an assist from us I think a fun little clip on how it has seeped into pop culture from day one wanna dance great play some music you so the amplifi open beta so amplify custom was just amplify just like Coke Classic was just coke I don't like to use the example because New Coke sucked this beta is going gangbusters fortunately but what we wanted to do was we wanted to give brands oh wait let me get a four for our purposes and for user purposes we want to get more great video on the platform so anything we could do to and sent that to get great video on a platform in a in a compelling way for users is great for Twitter great for our users of course the but what we wanted to do with amplify open was also allow brands to align with more video in a pre-roll format in a targeted way but also but free them up from that need to have that one-on-one association with the publisher to do that manual brokering so sometimes that's still essential so let's say you have a brand like Taco Bell Taco Bell makes a big investment in the VMAs on MTV Taco Bell will always want to say could be verizon could be sprint could be Samsung but the brand will that brand that's made that big investment the VMAs will always want to say hey I want to have my segment from the red carpet or red carpet footage generally be what what we feature or a beauty brand might say we're not so much in the music angle we want to cover more the fashion angle so you'll have things like that where and and those brands will say we want to really play up on this aspect of our sponsorship and we want any tweets and we want to Matt this time and we want them from this handle and that that's amplified custom that says it's always existed and it's gotten better and easier and for the reasons I've hopefully shown you guys but let's say your taco bell is very well we love the VMAs that's a great sponsorship for us we also just want to be part of the music and pop culture and teen conversation that's happening on Twitter but reach people watching videos on those topics and that fit that target during the month of August okay so you have the VMAs amplify custom if you so choose but then you have the ability to go say I just want to tap into I want to target roll against the organic viewers various handles whatever publishers have elected to publish at that moment and the way it works is publishers are shayla visual personal here's an actual campaign from nutribullet so you'll see pre-roll reaching across various handles these are the organic followers of FS one of Nat Geo BuzzFeed and now this so I think just to catch CeCe that again 6 second pre-roll for nutribullet followed by videos and what these publishers have done and this launched about a month ago is these publishers were publishing these tweets organically they've clicked the button that said elect to monetize this video they self to find the video based on on tier 1 I AV categories so I'm forgetting the exact names like business and marketing politics arts and entertainment and publishers may have blacklisted some brands they may said well even though you're you're selling blind Twitter we have such a big partnership with target we don't want even the chance of a walmart video to run against it and have any backlash so they may blacklist walmart or if they have target they may blacklist everybody in the retail category aside from target and then they're letting that video get monetized and we're sharing revenue back to them so the two versions of amplify that I mentioned on top is the new beta that I'm talking about now an advertiser so its content category is an audience is to target boom boom boom the ads are served against publishers organic videos and that again frees you up from the publisher 101 relationship let you have it always on strategy targeting who you want to reach targeting people watching videos that are relevant oh that you believe will be relevant from a brand's perspective the bottom path amplifiers it's always existed now amplify custom you have a sponsorship deal with the publisher it's more one-to-one custom hand held in bespoke and that content is tweeted and that's a Promoted Tweet so we're in Nevada you're reaching the organic viewers of a video and you're picking the targeting and and the buckets and the cancer categories in this case its traditional amplify you could target whoever you want as the brand and promote that video to whoever you want so these are the brands I the publisher sorry that signed up for this beta which went live on October eighth and we're in the process of ramping up to hopefully 100 brands before it goes wider so we're really really excited about this we see it living nicely alongside traditional amplify getting more video on the platform for users more revenue obviously to Twitter more videos on Twitter and serving the needs of publishers and allowing them to monetize and distribute their content in a broader way so to bring it all together our innovations and hopefully we've done a good job of this and I think it's still a work in progress we've tried to innovate based on our strengths we know we are you think we know what we're not but we've tried to really focus on being the best mobile live and social platform we can be as we made these video enhancements and it you know it's it's just to like kind of a in conclusion little factoid couple of factoids here we see attention shifting to Twitter during live moments so we know as I mentioned at the beginning conversation shifts people are talking about events are happening so just to kind of reinforce that on the way out around events like the Oscars you'll see digital traffic may increase in most cases not all but the blue bars are Twitter so we see a disproportionate surge in attention to Twitter during these key moments and some of the numbers are pretty significant last season's empire season last season's finale of empire we had 500,000 authors publishing 2.4 million tweets and 112 million impressions and the think this was the 2014 VMA extra sorry these are the 2015 VMAs I apologize 2.2 million authors 20 1.4 million tweets and nearly 700 million impressions and that's it I'm going back to the people walking thank you and any questions thoughts sure not end of life but I do think you'll see like some of the functionality migrated over to our to Twitter's native player or it makes sense I can't speak to exactly how and when a because it's not my area of expertise be I don't think we supposed to be anyway but definitely not end of life just uh what we can make it easier and simpler and and make the the publishing experience easier and scale it will do it good question though anybody else Michael there was oh thank you very kindly he's one of your selects influencers by category you identified that you can do things you know by the tier 1 IAB you know categories like business or whatever there was a lot of you know fluff about klout Incred and various you know measure your social influence stuff is that one of the selects you can get influential people within your category on ample well right now so we're still kind of scaling up right so we have the biggest the biggest challenge we have is you have about 140 publishers in the beta like I said about 80 are publishing and then I publishing every day and then you have about 25 Brent so it's still in the process of making a market right now the ways you can target the 23 buckets and then you can layer on additional Twitter targeting but that's any other to any Twitter targeting we have already so interest keywords at handle targeting geo device language and so forth does that help absolutely it helps and could you also lay out for us how you how Twitter works with an entity like the US Open or the vmas and how do those deals structure you guys going to market together to brands yeah it's a great question so it's a it tends to be a co sale with thee so we have we have a about 200 partners like I mentioned the standard co sales agreement we have is essentially the same it basically says that it's a lightweight agreement what content producers its aside from the actual language like Japanese in Japan language english in the u.s. language not not legal language it's basically the same agreement it basically just lays out if we're going to do business together these are the things we have to figure out in each case in each case we have to figure out who's going to lead the sale via comm with the vmas do you want to leave the sale you probably do can we bring you inbound leads great one one thing though that we've done so when I first got to Twitter there are about eight thousand things I didn't know and still are but one thing I did know coming from the TV world was that every content owner does deals differently and needs to win differently some are sold out of their their digital video inventory or display inventory some are sold out of television ads some need to package late night with prime time or or whatever or they want to get a foot in the door digitally where they may not have it so when amplify started is a long-winded answer but when they amplify started it was very much a 50-50 model let's say make it out an example up show x you bought 250,000 promoted tweets on Twitter the brand had to spend in the network had to ask for 250 thousand dollars in either a fee or matching media from the partner that had the benefit of simplicity of like everybody understanding what the ass was it had no other benefits it didn't recognize that everybody needed to win differently and that we could win in a lot of different ways so I what I did was say I don't care how much money the content partners make I care that they make money I don't care how much it is if they can make 20 times more than us great if they want to give it away if they want to give away the key to amplify and let a brand just pay us because that's fitting some other need on their end it's fixing a relationship or its or it's getting them in the door in a piece of business or whatever it might be or getting a meeting even something intangible or helping with a CPM conversation we don't care so we've freed the constraints between brands and agencies and content owners on the on one hand to go do a negotiation that works for them we still charge Promoted Tweets no more or less all things equal than any other rota sweet and yes generally co sale but if I had to generalize even more i would say ninety percent of the time the content partners want to lead a sale because they're bundling it into something bigger that'll probably change a little bit because a lot i think the growth a lot of the growth for us going forward I still see growth with the sports leagues that might still see growth with TV networks even if we didn't change the essential model but i do think if we want to get into the business of amplified working at a big scale for pay-tv for ott for movie studios then we're going to need a a little bit of a different model there we'll need to control the sale it would probably send have to be some kind of more plug-and-play rev-share type of model but that's that's the essentials anything else cool i think i'm the lead into beer so have fun thank you
