 the copper rationales for adding value is another one of the Johnson schools and Whittington elements of the p3 syllabus as you can see it is explicitly referred to on the syllabus it has been asked twice in December always where it was poorly answered this is the concentration of this particular presentation is dealing with that question then almost in retaliation it was asked in December 10 in question 1 and so this time if students weren't prepared for the topic it wasn't just the case that they could avoid it as they did in December always and performance in that question as you will see on the next slide what was quite poor lastly as you can see this topic is part of a technical article that was written in response to the poor performance in December way and prior to the next time it was asked in December tame so essentially there was very little excuse for it to be poorly answered in December 10 was so that's the context for this particular topic and therefore it's one of those topics that really is a need-to-know and not nice to know on this slide you can see an extract from the examiner's report from December 2010 which was the last time that this topic was asked as you can see he was not terribly impressed by the performance you'll notice from the first set of comments that he is particularly perturbed about the possibility that students were question spotting and you can see that he has made an explicit reference to the study guide so that's a really strong indication that he feels that this is unacceptable by students to perform in this way and therefore he really has a duty or a responsibility to revisit this topic the second comment that you can see at the bottom of this slide reiterates that and if you see the last sentence disappears to have been due to a lack of knowledge in this area of the syllabus this then requires the examiner to go and revisit that topic much the same way that an auditor is required to revisit an area where there might have been runs on a previous order so even if the examiner doesn't want to ask this particular topic he effectively has no choice he has to revisit it and that something we need to be very conscious of having hopefully convinced you of the importance of this topic now would be a good opportunity to try and understand it so the corporation are adding value examined the notion that a corporate parent may actually add or in some case destroy a value of a child company to use that expression within its portfolio now mostly this examines the concept of a larger organization acquiring a smaller organization but it also can to a lesser extent address the issue of mergers whereby the new merged entity might be made up of two companies but those companies will not have been equal in size and so one of the companies and would have been much larger the other is smaller therefore the new entity is made up of let's say 70% of the old company and 30% of the other so the management from the larger company might be still to use the expression calling the shots and in doing that they're not actually adding value as was intended in the new larger entity they're causing more problems and then they're adding positive things so the three different concepts or approaches and that Johnson's calls in Burlington discuss are the portfolio manager the synergy management of parental developer and I suppose one of the simplest things to start with here is that you must ensure that you're adopting the right type of strategy so for example if the company that you're acquiring is a perfectly well functioning company and they're engaging in a type of commercial activity that you don't really understand properly whether you're far better just to be a portfolio manager there's no point in trying to get involved or get stuck into a business for really you can't contribute much so you're not really going to add value by getting to use that cliche expression therefore you're better to stand back however there could be some criticism of adopting that approach because maybe to take the second example you would be far better off to take a synergy manager approach and the suggestion here is that there are some quick wins again apologies for the cliche so it's actually a lost opportunity on behalf behalf of the company making the acquisition not to get a little bit involved in what's going on down at the childhood company level and perhaps take two of these companies say you go and purchase your i.t together and get a better discount so as you can see here on the diagram they're saying there should be a little bit of you know lapper cooperation between the different companies in the portfolio at the see if they can gain economies of scale or art issues like that and then the last moment is possibly one where the company doing the acquisition would want to be very clear that they're not accidentally and getting themselves involved in this type of relationship so a parental developer is possibly one of the most ambitious one that could end up with the highest amount of reward but it's also the one that would have the most potential problems because we're the parental developer you are not going to be able as a corporate parent to sit back like a portfolio manager and just review reports and give the child company has already broad and financial targets that they must strive towards it's also not a case of doing the simple kind of quick wins that a synergy manager and would be required to do do you know the origin of two plus two equals five the parental developer is going to have to really get stuck in and I'm really helped to change the operations and the resources and capabilities and competencies etc etc of that particular business so in any of these particular scenarios the parent company can add value but they can also destroy value and one of the most fundamental ways that they will do that is by perhaps adopting the wrong approach so the portfolio manager you know who should be really getting involved in some very very easy and profitable synergies doesn't that value because they adopt the wrong approach or the person who believes that they're entering in synergy manager acquisition only to discover that the company that they've acquired is in severe distress really needs an awful lot of help so it actually needs a parental developer acquisition but they're not equipped to do that for some reason their analysis failed to identify that what was required here was a company to come in and make an acquisition from a parental developer point of view are not a simplice energy manager and by failing to recognize that they fail to identify in advance that they're not capable of adopting that type of a of a relationship so that's the idea to conclude it's basically about the fact that a parent company and when engaging in an acquisition or when may be engaging in a merger but there will be one of the entities in the numerous that company is kind of more powerful can through its approach and through its kind of it's almost ideological attitude toward acquired company add or destroy value and that that's the critical thing you know we must ensure that the choice that the company making the acquisition and is doing it is correct and effectively that's what you're going to see in both of these questions whereby the company making the acquisition perhaps hasn't fully analyzed at the nature of the acquisition and on that basis then they end up getting in themselves into awful bad trouble this slide sets out the actions that will be required by a company making an acquisition or as I previously explained a merger of a particular type in order from to add value now what you can see here is that it is theoretically possible for a portfolio manager to add value for a synergy manager to add value or a parental developer to add value so you might be tempted to say well it doesn't matter really you know you're going to add value anyway but were you're not because you might not have the skills so for example if you make an acquisition based on the assumption that you're going to be able to adopt a very hands-off portfolio manager role only to find out that the company that you've made the acquisition out will go for the other is actually a parental developer relationship but suddenly now you're going to find that rather than just setting disappearing expectations providing investment so again you know that's the simplest way you can add value at the company's a little bit of financially distressed or having difficulty securing financing and you can come in and provide that or in the monitoring performance you suddenly then find out that once you began pardon the cliche once you've looked under the bonnet at the engine that this company needs enormous help with developing its teaching intended mission its external image and it needs specialist expertise in certain areas it needs to make dramatic improvements to its business and performance and it needs it its strategy to be developed properly and the existing assumptions within the business to be challenged and discovering that the company that make the acquisition might then come to realization is they don't have the skill set to do this they don't have the experience to do this and the reason they found themselves in this terrible situation is not necessarily through arrogance although that can be the case and you know that they thought it could be a parental developer very often it's because they fail to recognize that an actual fact this acquisition what was going to be a parental developer acquisition so again as we see with both of the past paper questions an actual fact of that kind of addressed this issue is the importance of the company making the acquisition to realize what they're getting themselves involved in and then hopefully being honest with themselves about what would be required and so the other way that it could manifest itself and potentially that's a backfire is that they do correctly identify that it's not a portfolio manager a Haitian ship that it is in fact this energy not not a synergy manager one either pardon me it is a parental developer acquisition but that they haven't perhaps been honest or are humble about their own skills and they have over estimators are overvalued their own ability to do the tasks that are required and laid out here in the table of a parental developer so that's really the way that the p3 syllabus wants to address it with this type of of topic and very briefly try and contextualize it on the rest of the presentation we'll go through this as you go through the the MMI question from December 2008 you will discover that what basically happened was and the MMI company and successfully executed an acquisition they did that clearly with the intention of being a portfolio manager and they stumbled completely by accident on synergies now this for some reason led them at come to the conclusion that they were not only synergy managers and again to emphasize the narrative shows you that the synergy manager dynamic was completely accidental and their their initial rationale for the acquisition was purely a portfolio manager and they stumbled by absolute fluke on some synergies and it this led to kind of a little bit of arrogance and overconfidence and unfortunately it was amplified because they then even when a stage further so with having intended to be a portfolio manager they stumbled on a synergy so convinced them says there were synergy managers and then somehow decided that that meant that they were also able to be a parental developer and and what you're going to see is that the next acquisition they made ended up being a complete disaster and the reason for that is that you know they weren't parental developer if they had no experience or expertise in that regard they weren't even synergy managers because the synergies that they had managed to exploit but if their first acquisition were completely by fluke and then it's leading to an absolutely almost apocalyptic scenario were in question to see of the December always question sorry question to be there considering in buying another highly distressed company and really what they're doing is they're massively overestimating at their own ability so the way that the question can manifest itself in relation to this topic is as for those two are indeed and other way it could be asked is as per this slide is having correctly identified the nature of your relationship as a company making an acquisition what then would be expected of you so the question could be phrased differently as in you know what we're actually telling you and that this acquisition is being viewed as a synergy manager acquisition how much are now being required to do is advise the company on but there and tasks and responsibilities will be in that context and again what your job then would be to say well they're going to be required to develop the company's mission and make sure they have carried about their image develop certain strategic abilities achieving synergies and etc so that's the the way that the the question we think can manifest itself we've seen to pass paper questions of a similar style and then the the other possibly could be asked is having told you and what type of relationship or the work will be happening is resolved the acquisition how then should the company proceed and advise them that might be the verb advise them on impart tasks will be required post acquisition as well all questions in p3 your first task is to apply my suggested exam technique to reacquaint yourself with the exam technique you'll find it on pages three to six of the course notes so going through the step starting at step one the first thing to consider is the marking scheme as with most questions you'll find that this is assisted when you look also at step three so as you can see from the circled items on this particular slide we identify that there's actually two verbs separated by an and so therefore we know the question is in two parts in terms of the marking scheme there next thing to figure out is how many of the 15 are going for the explanation on how many for the assessment you should take an opportunity to visit the ACCA website at some stage and look at the examiners interview from Steve Skidmore there's an mp3 of the interview and also a transcript and he does explain in that interview that unlike other examiner's he does not differentiate in terms of cognition between two verbs so when he separates a verb a question with the word and he's applying equal marks to both therefore you might be asking yourself the question well how do you divide 15 evenly and you can't do that and what you should do is take a look at the marking scheme on page 208 of my course notes and you'll see the way he is constructed there it's very very fair however my suggestion to you for consistency is that you should always try and have the mark so in this case it's impossible so the closest you can go is 87 you should spend 8 marks on the part of the question that you feel your strongest on and 7 marks on the part of the question that usually they are slightly less strong in terms of step 2 of the exam technique the question here does provide us with some of the vital words that we have to include in our answer to make sure that the examiner cannot criticize us for not applying our answers to the narrative I've already mentioned step 3 for step 4 the real thing there is just to practice and make sure that when you are writing your answer you try and use words and expressions that are as businesslike as possible in terms of step 5 if it doesn't apply in this answer because there are no professional marks and available in this particular question and also step 6 which is vital as you should also also apply the suggested timing metric and make sure you try and stick to that in the exam steps 1 & 3 of the exam technique play particular importance in relation to this slide the purpose of this slide is to demonstrate to you what your physical answer really should look like on the exam script we already ascertain that there were two requirements to the question and on the previous slide but because we're also dealing with two companies there are two parents within each company so the first part for you is to conduct an assessment of the rationale for the acquisition by MMI of the two companies and then you should perform an assessment of the subsequent performance of the two companies post-acquisition it might be a useful thing for you now even at this stage to just pause the presentation to read the narrative and can you see if you can identify even at a very high level at this stage maybe the reasons or the rationale the acquisition by M Mir for pleasure and then Boland and then an assessment of the subsequent performance so that might be used for exercise to do at this stage before you even go on to the next part of the presentation paragraph 1 of the narrative sets out some of the reasons why mm I have embarked on this particular strategy of acquisitions one use for exam technique issue which I have highlighted in this slide is the use of transitions you'll be aware from my lecturers that I have spent a lot of time emphasizing the use of transitions both in questions and indeed in your answers so again with two perfect examples of them here the however comma and the furthermore comma and so these transitions our way of highlighting to the reader in this case you is the student and that there is an important piece of information coming after these transitions and it's not the same as the previous information you can adopt a similar approach when you are answering your questions in the exam and highlight into the examiner and the corrector that you're giving different pieces of information at the piece of red text underlined is maybe where you could name drop the expression that I used pastel it's not in the examiner sample solution and but what you could say here is that the reason that MMI are embarking on this particular strategy is because of macro environmental factors outside of their control and they've been forced to do this and so that's something that you could mention and you could also perhaps mention some other issues including maybe the the product life cycle and it may be applicable more to the next paragraph but you could basically say that the product that currently MMI are involved in which is you know a quarrying and opencast minding and that's at a decline phase that it's gone past maturity as under the client phase and that's the reason why it if they have been forced to take this particular strategic action again they're not in the examiner sample solution either the product life cycle or pest that is mentioned they could be useful and you know answers for theory papers the one thing you have to keep remembering is they're very very subjective but once you populate your answer with points of information with the required amount of debt you should score the marks appropriately moving on to the second paragraph here we can see another consistent element of the exam technique that I've been emphasizing the whole way through the course mainly that of transitions so we can see here that consequently and this again is telling us look that you need to focus in on the element that is coming after this because it produced to emphasize an important piece of information of the narrative the other areas that you can see that I've circled here for example diversification now as we've mentioned in class and in relation to the technical article of mergers acquisitions and managing SPU's you will see that there is some concern about the whole area of diversification particularly unrelated diversification so again without trying to confuse issues here what would in p3 there will be sometimes a very necessary overlap between models as we know one of the four and soft growth strategies that you can select as a diversification and again going back to that technical article you will see there is some very deep concern about unreligious diversification and again it would be may be obvious here or you at least have a suspicion that a quarrying company who then subsequently makes an acquisition of a leisure park so again I suppose maybe that's a very UK expression so you maybe think of a theme park that they would have in the USA like Disney World etc or Thor Park that would have in the UK rollercoasters amusements these types of things there doesn't appear to be you know much of a commonality between a quarrying company and allows your part company so this is something from the very beginning that maybe should you know some kind of a a note of caution for you as you go forward through the rest of the question you the first part of paragraph three is rich with information that we can use in our answer particularly with regard to the rationale behind the acquisition of first ledger by MMI the first thing however I want to draw your attention to is the circled text initially criticized this is another exam technique tip to watch out for and relates their language that is used so when negative language is used in the case you have to be aware that you know that is an important issue that are raising because very often p3 your task is to help a company where things are not going very well for them moving on to the piece of text highlighters and which relates to the questioning by certain analysts as to ye MMI were acquiring a company that was involved in and leisure and that's just reinforcing the point from the previous slide this is an unrelated diversification again what's the rationale for an unrelated diversification well we can use the colloquial term of not putting all your eggs in one basket and we try and avoid colloquialisms in the exam but it's an unrelated diversification which is supposed to give you a more balanced portfolio the second thing as well as there is a little hint here although we get it more obviously conveyed to us later on that first measure are already a profitable leisure group so when we take the average portfolio matrix into account and it's not that I'm first ledger is some sort of a basket case company that's crying out and for a complete to help us and so there isn't a huge amount of parenting opportunities here you know those are not not a lot going wrong with first leisure that needs to be addressed and that's something that you can mention in your answer the second thing that's highlighted is is is the aspect of the first several managers being led to run the company by themselves now this is a direct reference a very obvious reference to the rationale for adding value whereby the comprar parent can take three views they can be a hands-off portfolio manager they can be a synergy manager or a parental developer and this is a clear indication that initially when MMI acquired first ledger they were very much a portfolio manager and were hands-off less the managers at first ledger get on running the company we didn't see at the bottom of this particular slide that there was a transition and the transition wasn't based on the inspired idea and again that's another example technique issue to follow out for when they use very rich and and you know verbose language like that it's for a reason it's to make it stand out and and this is basically whereby they've moved from being a hands-off portfolio manager to a synergy manager and so MMI identified that there was resources that they were currently using which were underutilized and they could now use these in another one of their businesses in the in their in their portfolio and add value so they've moved from hands-off portfolio manager to a hands-on synergy manager and you could make reference to the you know the concept of the Johnson scores of an engine economies of scope here or Johnson scores and won't even talk about allocating resources to different parts of the business at different times so we now have in all quarries which have run out of minerals being used as ledger packs and sometimes that's referred to as economies of scope because now MMI have essentially two products they have quarries which and deliver minerals which they can sell and advanced or quarries which are near exhaustion are closed which can be turned at the leisure path so they now have from the one resource their scope is increased and they now have two products the first part of this slide could include again some name dropping of pastel and the key words here which would draw your attention to pastel as dimension of government so anytime you see government that can equal the P of pastel probably if more relevance really here though is the text highlighted in red and the development of new parks has helped the first leisure to expand considerably so you know that's what I have referred to in class as a type one piece of information and the examiner is telling you that in black and white and you don't need to do anything with that information except give it back to them under the correct heading so this would not be you know the ration for the expansion already acquisition and this is as you know the results this is one has happened post acquisition acquisition that first ledger has managed to expand and the second piece of text is highlighted after table one is again a second chance in case you missed it the first time which we address in the previous slide that MMI are adopting a very much initially a portfolio manager and view it says here that they were the first ledger has continued to be run by the managers whenever my acquired the company and MMI plays very little role in the day-to-day running of the company so you know we're getting a sense again that you know what they provided some synergy and then they went away so there are enough and you know a parental developer hurler they're constantly on site constantly you know mentoring and am assisting and helping MMI they've gone in provided the resource which has been underutilized and MMI given at the first ledger created this energy and they've gone away so showing here that you know they are involved in managing synergy but they're not having to get down to a parental and developer level the other thing which I circle in this slide which is very important and many of you might think this is clearing the obvious but again this has been the subject of some highly negative comment and the examiner's report is the C Table one and the examiner has been very critical of people not using the quantitative data thus he has taken the time and effort to put into the narrative and this is kind of like a big hint you know I don't know how obvious he's going to get with this is you know I think the next thing he's going to draw an arrow and from the text over to the financial data because students still seem to be ignoring this and again the figures are going to be looking for here is the foreclosure figures and and you know the expansion and you would actually have to try and measure that and again that's going to go into the second part of your answer about first leisure about how they got on post acquisition and which is you know a very very good point on you would gain easy marks for include your answer at first glance paragraph four actually looks like a little bit of a red herring and more concentrating on on question 2a and we would be asking ourselves what has the fact that MMI acquired and to querying companies and a further five minds got to do with there am acquisition a first leisure and Boland while there is a very valid point here and albeit it's very subtly made in this paragraph what the examiner is trying to see you and that you may or may not identify here the challenge for the student is mmm I have been successful in acquiring an unrelated company first leisure however first leisure although they were unrelated they were performing well in this case mmm I have acquired a relation II who were underperforming and this case they took a very much a parental developer role went into these two hundred performing companies and turned him around but what now mmm I have done is they have convinced themselves that because they bought an unrelated company who was performing and then a related company who was performing that they can do and what they try to do with both land which was a non related underperforming company now it sounds almost like a bit of a tongue twister but basically what they've done is they've Dave you don't really you could say cross multiplied an equation to suit themselves so just to highlight again first measure was unrelated but there wasn't any problems these two mining companies were related but there are at was problems so just because you buy a related company that's underperforming and you've already bought an unrelated company that was performing doesn't mean you are in a position to buy unrelated underperforming company and expect to turn it around you haven't built up that experience yet so the statement here with a CEO that mmm I have now a corporate management capability and which they can you know impose on other organizations it's a little bit premature and as we see with the Boland example it didn't work out because Boland was a different scenario it wasn't first Leger unrelated with no problems it's not these two mines which were related and problems that Amy might had a vast amount of experience that they could fix both land was and unrelated and a company with problems and mm I had no track record of of solving that kind of a situation there are some great examples of type one information in this particular part of paragraph five this is the type of information where the examiner gives it to you in black and white and all you have to do is give it back and put it underneath the correct heading so for starters we're moving on to the second section of our answer we're now dealing with Portland we've left and for Fletcher behind us and in the first part here you can see in the highlighted red text they're just emphasizing again that this is an unrelated diversification and however you know a great thing for you here and re important you would spot this you know he even uses the word rationale so like you know the first part of the question is explained the rationale he's told you here so you just have to give that back under the appropriate heading so in this case whereas first measure was an effort at diversification and the initial rationale behind it was a portfolio manager where they were using the cash from their quarries to get into another business that would be around when the quarries would run out of their resource this was very much aimed at synergy and you know and this was supposed to dovetail and with the the purchase of first leisure so they bought first measure would cash from their quarries so they wouldn't have to rely on quarries in the future but they're buying both land specifically to help foreclosure so there is a different motivation here the rationale is different the purchase of em first glazier was not the help the mines now it ended up that the mines and helped for pleasure particularly the inactive mines but that was the initial rationale the rationale from the very beginning and the whole reason why MMI purchased and Bowland was so that they could help and force leisure so just to reiterate that again the rationale behind purchasing first leisure was not the help MMI his mining business although the mining business sometime after the initial purchase was able to help first leisure in this case the purchase of Bowland was mainly driven because of how they could help first leisure and maybe her first ledger could help them so it explains here the first measure had a problem in terms of obtaining and maintaining both for its ledger products and that both land would would help them out in this regard and straight away we can see you know the rationale behind it was car savings and it also was allowing both clan to expand its production so really you know on the basis of the first part of this paragraph five we have three or possibly four points of information which we can develop above the rationale behind the acquisition of both land now what we're going to go on to now shortly is what happened post acquisition and this wasn't as happy a story as the experience would first leisure paragraph five gives us a glimpse into how the acquisition of bowland by MMI has fared out as you can see they've taken quite a hands-on role where they've actually replaced the boat land management with their own management personnel but we can now see perhaps they've fallen to the ultimate trap of the copper pairs is rather than adding value they've actually destroyed value again from an exam technique point of view you can see the use of a transition here this time it's it's qualifying what happened however Bolton was reporting poor results so you know they've made things worse rather than better you can also see some reference here not that it would be necessary but it is useful to perhaps the marketing mix and so there are no longer making and products that the majority of the customers of boat land are interested in you know on maybe they're concentrating on a very small niche which is products that first leisure want as you can see that there's an issue here and and you know you can also see that as a result of the decision they've taken just read the quote first lesser were for casual use of holidaymakers often ill treated them and certainly at no long-term investment I'm in their ownership so again really what has happened here is mmm I have got this badly wrong and rather than having value as a as the corporate parent they've actually managed to do is destroy a little bit of value that was there so a different corporate parent who was more skillful and more appropriate perhaps could have made the acquisition of Oakland and they would have been successful because they would have been equipped to do so it's quite clear to Panama are not equipped to do so you the last part of paragraph five really is you know rich with type one information which we can include in our answer and you'll probably have noticed as we're coming to the you know the end of the the narrative that really answering the question in terms of Buckland was probably an awful lot easier than first leisure you know the examiner told us and black and white why both land was purchased and he's telling us in black and white what happened after they were purchased and so the first leisure acquisition and the rationale and the post acquisition performance there might have been more challenging but really in relation to both client it was very clearly stated and as I said to you before in class you can expect that kind of an approach both within questions and within a section some parts will be expected the students would score very well other parts will be more challenging so again just look at the three words highlighted in the first part of the slide here complained to delegate unreliable so you know what would language like that it should be quite obvious what we are going to assess and the post acquisition performance of both land and again you could make you know further reference I mentioned in the previous slide obviously did use the word customer here and you could use the marketing mix and because they're obviously not giving the customer what they want and then it has the but further problems just look at the language again these delays were compounded and so it's telling us that you know post acquisition this this was not good for for everybody it was poor for both land and it was poor for for pleasure the last part in this slide is is where we have a definite reference to the cultural web if you wanted to use it in your answer it's not in the examiner's sample solution so it's not a requirement but it is something potentially that you could use and just fairly explicit reference made to it for basically as a result of the acquisition rather than synergies which never developed and we've actually damaged both land because over half of the and you know the boat builders are almost half of the boat builders have left the company and so we've totally failed in this example in adding any kind of value to either organization or any synergies and in fact we've damaged both land and first leisure still aren't getting their problem solved paragraph six very much focuses on the requirement of question to be a rather than question to way and that's the whole area of weather and MMI and should proceed with the acquisition of Infotech however there is one element here which perhaps you can use backwards if I can use that expression into 2a and that's the fact that after it's experience a boat land the CEO of MMI is cautious so that's suggesting you know that what happened with both land was not positive and as a corporate parent and it would appear that their experience in this regard has not always been successful and again it goes back to the theme I mentioned earlier you know they made an acquisition force pleasure because they basically had had more cash than they knew a lot but to do with they stumbled on synergies got a little bit maybe cocky and arrogant and then went and made an acquisition of both land and as it turned out here now maybe they've only realized that are not the fantastic offer parent that they thought they were so in that context and there would be maybe very cautious about going to the next stage which is actually into our or what we would hope is an obvious parental developer a situation because Infotech quite clearly as a company in distress but the hint here in relation going back to 2a is you know never mind considering going down the road of being a parental developer you know in order letting yourself in for that's quite obvious but you haven't even demonstrated that you're good I've been a synergy manager because you thought that's the relationship you were getting into with Vohland and it turned out that it wasn't or that you weren't that equipped to do that there are four sections to the quantitative data in this case study your first temptation when concentrating to an answering question to way would be to concentrate on the data relating to both London first laser only however there is some useful information in relation to the data about the MMI business itself the querying business which would help explain the rationale for the pursuit of the acquisition of the other two companies the very first thing however to remember when analyzing financial data is if you mustn jump straight in you should scan the data first and see what information maybe is worth investigating that you can use in your answer and then that's when you start calculating percentage increases and ratios and that kind of processed information so when we look at this we see one very obvious thing and this was mentioned in narrative and the figures that subsequently prove this which is that the querying and mining business is operating in the declining market we can see from o to 208 the entire market has decreased from 6300 to 6 or 1/5 so management suspicions order concerns were proved right and that they were operating in a declining market Ahmad Lee you could use the name drop here is the product lifecycle we mentioned this previously so this particular product say the mineral in terms of the quarrying and mining business has gone past maturity and it's now in the decline phase and the second information that is relevant here is what I refer to previously in class as tied to information so you haven't been given the information on the silver platter you've been given two parts of the information which you must process and that then will give you something value but that you've including your answer I know I've done all the calculations on the table below but you maybe will just have to concentrate on some of them you may not have the time to perform all the calculations so what model can you apply and how is this relevant well another thing you have to watch out for in case stories is if they provide you with information that is applicable to a model the chances are they want you to use that model so particularly in this case we were purposely given information on the size of the entire market and then the size of the market share that the particular company had while they are the X and y axis for the Boston box and what we can see here is that the market share that mm I have of Clary and mining as a market is increasing so taking your x-axis and the Boston box there over on the left hand side the only problem is what size is that market is it growing or is it shrinking now even though it's only small and - 1.5% 2.5 1.5% it is a market - shrinking so taking the y-axis on the Boston box it's down at the bottom end so if you plot that if you are on the left axis on the left hand side and if you're at the bottom of the y-axis you're a cash cow and it also was mentioned the case and it very obvious you know I'm in your face way and what it specified the cash it said the cash from the quarrying business was used to purchase first ledger so this is giving you a further clue that the quarrying and mining business was viewed as a cash cow a cash cow is eventually going to become a dog so what you have to do with a cash cow is when things are going well use that cash and to support your question marks and your stars and this is another vital thing that you should have included in your answer in this question the quantitative information provided about first leisure provides the basis for a number of points in your answer and these points would be relating to the post acquisition part of your answer so basically your analysis of what happened to first ledger after it was acquired by MMI again as previously mentioned the most important thing perhaps is to do a quick scan and from a quick scan you can see that there was good increase in results of more tu-204 fantastic increases in results from Oh for 206 and then reasonably good maybe excellent results in the o-62 or a period but not as good as the previous one so why did that happen and how can you apply that to your answer and is there any theory you can use well the answer to all that is yes clearly the reason why this happened and it was stated in the narrative is although mmm I acquired first ledger in o - they considerably changed their attitude with regard to M - first ledger in O four so in the O to to a four period there were very much hands off portfolio manager and then from the O for 206 period when they decided that they could use their disused and mine's to help first ledger get additional ledger parks they changed their attitude and became a hands-on synergy manager so this would be under the theoretical heading of the three rationales for adding value and that would explain the dramatic improvement so there's at least two points of information and you could even develop those into three or four points of information in terms of your assessment of the performance of first ledger post acquisition by MMI and the second piece of information and our basis for multiple pieces of information that's available on this slide is in relation to the size of the market and the market share that first ledger currently holds as mentioned in the previous slide this is type 2 information so this is not handed to you on a silver platter like the differences we've just discussed about the revenue the gross profit in the net profit you have to work this out and again because you have the two bases of the X and y axis in the Boston box you have to use the Boston box in your answer so the two axes you're talking about is the market share the first ledger has of the market and if that market is growing or not and as we can see in this example and the market share the first ledger has is growing so taking the x axis they maybe would have started over on the right hand side where they had a low share of the market they've now quite a substantial share of the market like it's a fifth of the market and so that's going to place them on the left hand side of the x axis in relation to the y axis we have to consider is this market actually growing our static or shrinking we can clearly see that the size of this market is actually growing and by 2008 it has increased at 12 percent so on that base is taking the y axis it's not at the bottom end of the y axis it's at the top end so therefore if you are plotting a company that is on the left-hand side of the x axis and the top side of the y axis that clearly is a star and that is something that you would have to include in your answer again multiple points of information it's post-acquisition your assessment of it and you are now classifying first ledger as a star business or a star product within the mmm corporation the quantitative data with regard to Portland also provides the basis for a number of points of information that you can include in your answer again this would be in respect of the answer about the post acquisition performance of boat land so the first thing to determine its when the dock that acquisition happen again the narrative tells it was 2006 and if you look at the figures and there was a dramatic difference in the o6 208 and performance of the company the period from o to 204 and up 206 and certainly wasn't fantastic but it was an awful lot better than what happened after both land was acquired by MMI so you'd have to include that in your answer about your assessment of both land post acquisition by the MMI you could also bring the theory here about maybe why this happened and the reason it happened is that mm I had incorrectly identified that they now had this fantastic strategic capability which was now a corporate assets I've been able to turn around a company now we've gone through this before where and just because it worked with first Ledger which was an unrelated diversification but was a profitable company and just because it worked with the quarrying businesses which were related but they did need a performance to be addressed by helping management it's not the same scenario here this was unrelated and a company that maybe was struggling in any regard so you would have to mention that you could also mention in your answer here about the reason behind us initially was to give synergies between boat land and first leisure and but they weren't going in just as a synergy manager they were going in as a parental developer to try and address the problems of the underperforming management team the second model you can apply is in relation to the egg and the type 2 information it wasn't given to us on a silver platter we had to figure out the size of the market that both lenders competing in and their market share again this is clearly the X and y axis and the Boston box and if we plot that information we see that the market share that both land has on the x axis is very small so they're way over on the on the right hand side in terms of the size of that market is it growing or shrinking and it's growing but by a tiny amount or in the last period it's not changing at all so it's going to be in the bottom level of the y axis so if you product they're on the bottom of the why the y-axis if they're way over on the right-hand side of the x-axis they're a dog and that's another basis for multiple points of information in your answer this slide provides a quick summary of the potential issues that you can turn into points of information for your answer for the first ledger part of the question and wanting to emphasize here very strongly is there are far more potential issues which you could develop into points of information here that will be required to get maximum marks in the exam there's 11 issues here and two of those issues denoted by the asterisks could provide multiple points of information and so you must remember that the second thing to stress is as I mentioned before I thought the first ledger part of the question was more difficult and even within that part of the question the rationale for the acquisition by MMI is more difficult in the assessment of the subsequent performance and so the information for the assessment of performance I think was more readily available you need to watch out for this in the exam and maybe this was the intention of the examiner whereby he placed not only the most difficult part of the the question first the most difficult part within that question first and a lot of students may become bogged down and trying to answer the part about the rationale for the acquisition by MMI our fourth measure there for consuming time that they could have been spending under subsequent parts of the question which in my opinion were easier so quickly going through them it was clearly obvious that a major motivational factor behind acquiring first leisure was the declining market and that MMI was operating in and they were having to diversify for reasons about said if there are control and I was an unrelated diversification which is very often a good and prudent thing to do in business so there were there reasons you could also say the reasons were that they were concerned about the direction that the business was going in the future and the subsequent figures prove that at the initial plan was to adopt a hands-off approach remember they were buying first ledger which was already a profitable business and if they had left them alone there was every good indication that they would continue to be profitable so you would name draft the portfolio management role that they initially took under the three rationales for adding value and the last thing you can do here is you can even mention the Boston box here in the rationale part of your answer because they were using the cash from their cash cow and to put into another business and that's what you're supposed to so that was another reason more clearly available was the assessment of the subsequent performance and so the business is already profitable and and they were adopting a kind of a portfolio management role but then there was this inspired idea it is for both language that was used in a narrative which is done for a reason to make the thing stand out for you the student to recognize and and we now had a situation where a post acquisition mmm I moved from a hands-off portfolio management role to a synergy management role and the subsequent improvement in performance on the basis of that so that would be part of your assessment that initially for pleasure perform may be the way it would have had if MMI didn't require it and then suddenly and it dramatically improved so there were unexpected synergies again you could name drop the Johnson scores of engines allocation of resources here and then very very vitally you must have mentioned the Boston box it gave you those two pieces of information after the acquisition you had a situation where the business was now not only growing its market share the market in which it was operating was also growing lastly would be the average portfolio matrix this is probably a difficult one to spot whereby initially when the acquisition took place we've explained in the rationale why it happened and it wasn't because they saw massive parenting opportunities that first Ledger was a basket case company it wasn't because it wasn't profitable and I wasn't immediately obvious that there was anything that mmm I could offer the first leisure and in fact they were they were going for an unrelated a company for that very reason to turn to not put all their eggs into one basket or such then things changed suddenly first ledger had a parenting opportunity needed land and MMI were able to prevent provide that land so they became a Heartland business if you apply the average portfolio matrix so there is a quick summary of the potential issues that you could develop at the points of information for your answer here's a summary of the potential points of information that you could include in your answer for boat land and my opinion this was an easier parent to the question there was far more obvious information provided about the rationale for the acquisition and information as to how you could assess the subsequent performance the first thing is the synergy and without doubt the motivation behind this acquisition was synergy I was hoping that by acquiring Bolender could create synergies between both land and first leisure there was a belief in mmm eyes part that they had the competencies to enable these synergies because of their positive experience with first leisure and with the other mining companies they bought they suddenly felt that they now have this corporate management capability to enable synergies but as I explained earlier on the presentation that that was a flawed belief and there was also the basic opportunity to correct an underperforming company and a lot of companies would engage in this they would they would ascertain from an outside perspective that that company is underperforming because of poor management and if they conserve the management they can solve the company and another reason was obviously supply problems which was explicitly stated in the case that firstly jewelry experiencing and then the cost savings no I said name-drop backward integration there and you might say at this stage in the course we have uncovered backward integration we haven't and I will be summarizing and the concepts and models that I mentioned in slide 4 this is quite a good example of a question which is that one of the challenges in p3 is that questions in Section a can span multiple chapters where as questions in Section B and may be very locally contained to a particular topic so as you saw in slide 4 you could answer this question using a number of topics from chapters one the whole way to chapter 10 it's not something to get disheartened about there's far more information provided here and then you would need to get maximum marks and if there were some particular concepts our theoretical models that you didn't mention that are on slide four you could still score four marks for this question so looking them the assessment of the subsequent performance you know there was absolutely no diplomatic language used to disguise or softened the fact that this was a disaster this acquisition did not prove to be successful you had a no narrative data and you had it in the in the quantitative data you also had quite clearly and you know the information in the narrative about the rationale I'd like to use the word rationale in the narrative and said this is why Bolton was purchased by MMI there's multiple points of information from the quantity of data and it did more harm than good and all it's a bit colloquial and put may be an exercise for you to say could you articulate that more professionally they didn't have the corporate management capability they thought they had to enable the synergies here and so they really kind of over assess their ability you could definitely get at least two points of information on the Boston box and when you were plot the company and this is boat land operating in a market that's not growing and with a very small segment they're definitely classified as a dog in terms of the Astra's portfolio matrix and both lund ended up being a value trap undoubtedly there was a huge opportunity for parenting because the management were poor so you know that management needed to be replaced so there was an opportunity there for parenting the only problem is mmm I didn't have the critical success factor to offer that parenting that they thought they had it subsequently proved that they didn't have that critical success factor and that's why really you would classify both land and that regard as a value trap the last one is the cultural web again I know it's a topic we haven't covered at this stage of the course but when we do cover it we will refer back to MMA and you could see that is even another further point of information you could have included in your answer so when you add all these up here considering that there are multiple points of information that can be made from from three of the issues you know there is an abundance of points of information we're using this answer and in my opinion this was easier than the first part you will probably have noticed the whole way through the presentation that I have made reference to a number of the different academic models that we've done in the course so far now the primary ones that refer to this question directly are the three highlighted in red the rationale for adding value the BCG matrix and then also the average portfolio display now strictly speaking with this question the Oh a question you actually didn't have to use any of these models whatsoever never mind the three in red are in particular two rationales for adding value but the fact that rationale for adding value or the word rationale was using the question was a was a strong hint into 2010 question however you had to use the three rationales for adding value it was explicitly stated and maybe in a moment of kindness the examiner actually decided to include the three of them in the question so we actually gave you portfolio manager synergy manager and parental developer and you wouldn't want to assume that that would be something that will always happen what questions in this area so I hope you found this presentation useful it's more than just about the three rationales for adding value however that is an important topic but it's also to show you about some of the the choice questions if we can just focus in on that particular part of the syllabus is very often the only way that you can review a choice or advise a choice or analyze a choice or criticize a choice or assess a choice is by doing and some analysis and you know the reason or the rationale behind the acquisitions that are covered into a we can understand those from the narrative and then what we would do is go through perhaps some of the models that are outlined here and make a determination if we think that that choice has been successful or not based in the subsequent performance and so we know that you know some of the drivers behind the choice work or pastel and product lifecycle issues we would feel that some of the reason why we would criticize the choice based and the subsequent performance is because let's say the marketing mix boland wasn't producing both for the majority of its customers or we might talk about strategic capability mmm I didn't actually have the capability had to do at what they thought they were going to do so this is the idea behind a particular question like this again I think when you break it down into the four different requirements and they were of a slightly different standard but I think a reasonably well prepared student you know should be scoring quite well and on a question like this one again just to reiterate again please don't let this list frighten you it's just something to show you that if your reason to be on top of your theory you might have seen some of these or hints towards these as you were going through the narrative you didn't need to and the core ones are the three highlighted in red and even within that the most and one is obviously rationales for adding value
