 thanks um hi everybody I feel like we've already been introduced you already know about my nightmarish startup commute Oh at this point normally I would introduce myself but avi has already done a little bit so now you know that I'm a product design manager at Facebook and prior to being at Facebook I designed products and led some teams at apple and an assortment of startups and agencies and right now I lead the core growth design team we are as avi said responsible for connecting the next billion users to Facebook and we actually just hit a really enormous milestone really recently we had the first day we're over a billion people used Facebook within a single day which is kind of insane like that number it doesn't make any sense right so what is a billion people well I'm told that if we stacked them up not that they would let you do this but if we stack them up they would reach to the moon and back seven times all right the people at the top would have some breathing issues I think um anyway but even with this staggering number and you've already seen this graphic today in Maria's presentation but i love it to our journey at facebook is only one percent finished and i love this because i think it represents my personal journey to my journey as a design leader is also only one percent finished I love what I do as a design leader and as a designer because I'm constantly learning I'm constantly improving I'm constantly hitting such situations that challenge me I'm constantly up and trying to learn from those mistakes so today I would love to share a little bit of what I've learned with you um but before I do that um I would love to get you working because you've had the opportunity to sit still all day it's time to make you pay for the conference that you're attending so everybody stand up for just a moment and I'm gonna stand up because sometimes we do our best thinking on our feet especially in those dangerous hours right after lunch right okay so now that you're standing I would like you to think about the last time you felt you were able to do your best work I hope it was really recently but maybe it wasn't what was the project who were the people you were working with what made it possible to give you that feeling when you've got it in your mind and its really clear have a seat again when you're ready um so when I first started leading design teams between you and me and the rest of the internet since I think this video will be posted I had no idea what I was actually doing no idea so okay that's not one hundred percent true I knew how to solve tough product problems because I had led lots of product processes but I didn't actually know how to lead a team because leaving a team is not the same as leading a design project so here's the thing i knew that i wanted my team to be able to do their best work i knew that i wanted them to have that feeling that you were just remembering but I didn't know how to make it happen but at the end of the day I'm a designer right and I've spent years jumping into subjects that I know nothing about and learning as much as I can like media editing electronic books medical care to figure out those core ideas exactly what Jamie was just talking about what is critical here how do we create a meaningful and useful experience for people and design is how it works right and a team is something that needs to work so we can do this we're designers we can figure it out um so just how should my design team work what happens when we use design thinking to learn how to lead our teams um so in between flailing around as a leader I did some classic design research which is I spent a lot of time observing that what the strong leaders that I knew did I also talked to a lot of the designers that I really respect and I spent a lot of time recollecting my own experiences as a designer working for great leaders and in the course of it I realized that those leaders were doing a lot of different activities but all of those activities were actually just in the service of one thing and now you're probably thinking today the day I'm going to learn that one weird trick that helps me lead my design team but of course as with everything it's not quite that simple nonetheless the thing that I saw was this design leaders create the conditions that make great design possible so we spent some time this morning already talking about this so you guys are already familiar with the subject but what I wanted to share with you today is some tactical things that I've learned so we'll get into a little more detail so these design leaders they strive to get every member of their team whatever it takes to be able to do their best work and to me this is absolutely the difference between leading a design team and just leading a design project but what's cool about this so even if you're a design team of one these laws apply to you so what the hell are conditions right the first thing I should say that the conditions under which you work are the conditions under which you work that means they're incredibly situational they have a lot to do with the team the project the company that you're working on they have to do with what days you are in your career so they're totally dependent on circumstance and instead of listing out all the possible conditions that I could tell you about i'm just going to list a few examples and give you a framework for thinking about conditions so first some conditions come from outside of your team and the two that will get you every time are having clear goals that everyone in your organization understands and agrees on and can repeat when asked spontaneously if you don't have that you've got a lot of problems and the second the people that you work with the product managers the engineers your Salesforce when they are engaged with design they need to know how to work with design they need to know what to expect they need to know when to bring design into the process if they don't know how to do that you're going to have unhappy designers you're gonna have bad design results okay so those are conditions that have been outside of your team but there are also conditions that are inside of your team like having just enough process here too much and you can't move quickly too little and your design quality will suffer so you have to walk the line the second is trust in candor we've already covered some ideas of trust having your team be able to share their honest opinions with each other so that we get to good design quickly again these are not all the conditions that are inside your team these are just ones that I've found to be particularly important to the teams that I've worked on and then lastly when you're working with a team you have a bunch of different designers and different phases of the career you have a bunch of different personalities you have a bunch of different situations and each of those designers brings their own stuff to the table so for each of those designers you want to make sure that they know what their strengths are that you know what their strengths are do you know what your own strengths are and by the way anybody what are you good at where do you feel like you're really effective if you don't know where your strengths are maybe you should spend some time thinking about it and the same should happen for your team okay and you want to make sure that everything that you do your team is able to engage with their strengths the second piece is they need to be motivated to do that because even if they're good at it if they don't want to do it what's the point all right raise your hand if this is making any kind of sense to you anybody awesome or a few that aren't up well sorry i'll be over soon and then you can go snack uh-huh so stand up again because we're going back to thinking remember that time when you were able to do your best work do you remember the conditions that you were working in the external conditions the things that we're coming outside of your team the internal conditions maybe your team had really great process maybe you had a critique structure that worked really effectively maybe you just had a really great thought partner or maybe you were just at that point in your career where you can do no wrong can you pick one mission that was working really well and be able to articulate it really crystally clear in your head yes no not some heads please all right so I'm gonna hold you to that because you're going to turn to the person next to you and you're going to tell them was it an external condition an internal condition an individual condition for you and what was the condition and I'm gonna give you one minute which is not quite enough time but if you manage to express it succinctly enough to your new friend they get the chance to ask you one question I'll call time and then you'll switch okay are you ready and go ten seconds left okay switch hahaha you got another minute you're right alright alright folks how was that you can take a seat when you're ready um so with the condition that your friend told you about was this something that you've experienced before in another project yeah so we're mostly here we we've heard some things that are familiar what about did your friend tell you about some new condition that you had never thought of anybody nobody okay great um so I have to tell you that a biggest part the biggest part of the process that I've gone through to learn to be a leader has been engaging in conversations like this with my peers and my friends and people that I respect so um one minute is not enough time two minutes is not enough time but you should have these conversations on a continual basis with your colleagues and with the people you work with and with the people outside of your organization's you're exposed to totally different conditions alright so there's intro Steve Jobs style there's one other thing that I found to be absolutely critical and it is this great design leaders are supportive not directive and the thing about this is if you're always telling your designers exactly what they should be doing then you are going to be spending all of your time from there on out telling them exactly what they should be doing that's not to say you don't help them through problems right if you help them learn and grow they'll make good decisions even when you're not around and that's what you want and one of the reasons why i like my gig at facebook right now and it is a gig every job as a gig right and one of the reasons why i really like my gig at facebook is that this is something that facebook has really embraced there are no art directors at facebook we don't have a distinction between UX and visual nobody is making wireframes and then handing them off to a visual designer instead we expect our designers to own the whole process from identifying the product needs from the start pitching them to the team if necessary working side by side with the engineers and the product managers throughout the process to the delivery the delivery of actual pixels and for us this leads to better products it leads to designers who grow faster faster stronger harder more right they're not robots but you know what I mean designers who are able to take on increasingly complex projects and they're able to push through success in increasingly difficult conditions which is good because design just keeps getting harder right so but this raises a bit of a question which is if you're supportive but not directive how can you change the conditions in which you're working if you can't tell people what to do how do you initiate change so I have a really lightweight formula that's got about three parts and I'm going to show that with you today actually I'm not going to share it with you I'm just gonna tell you there's a formula you're gonna have to guess and Jake no takers okay so the first part is people because conditions are fundamentally made up of people write their goals their knowledge their abilities what they've done in the past excuse me what they've done in the past and actually also what they're afraid of is a big part so in order to change or create a new condition you need to identify the people who are both influencing the condition and the people who are affected by it the second piece is understanding and you need to understand what's going on and it's always more complex than you think it in it that then you think it is initially there's this fantastic book called creativity Inc by Ed Catmull from Pixar if you haven't read this you should and one of the things that I like the most about this book is that ed says of leadership so much is hidden when you were a leadership when you are a leader so much happens that you don't know that you don't see so that means that you have to start by asking questions in every situation you have to you have to approach every problem with a mindset of Curia and you cannot assume that you know everything ever the third piece here in my little formula is you but it's not just any you you can't just show up in your pajamas based on the people that you've identified and the understanding that you've learned by asking good questions you need to pick the you that needs to show up so that might mean you the coach so you're not on the field but you know what it takes to play and you are able to empower people to become better at their jobs you might be a diplomat brokering consensus and delivering understanding between people you might need to help others see past the short term into the future and this is the strategist so this is a lot of what Jamie was talking about and sometimes you're the connector acting is the glue that holds the product together connecting people and processes even if it's not strictly your job but somebody's got to do it right sometimes you're a defender and this is a really common position for designers we're used to defending our designs we're used to defending ideas but sometimes you're defending people sometimes you're defending schedules sometimes you're defending vacation time and finally you might end up being a therapist which is quite frankly just helping other people get over their own happens more often than you might think okay so like any good framework this formula is pretty easy to understand and it takes some practice to actually apply it so I wanted to share an actual example from my team and this is pretty recent so a product manager and a designer walk into a bar um actually they don't walk into a bar we don't do business in a bar we try to drink outside of work sometimes sometimes we drink in the office anyway um a designer and a product manager walk into a project um and I mentioned to you at Facebook that we have these great principles about designers being involved in the process from the very beginning we're part of the concept in what part of the pitching this is fabulous in principle when it actually happens it's amazing and produces great results but when we're trying to move quickly it's easy to forget how we should work so i have a designer that starts on a lightweight project a little bit after our new p.m. starts on that project and right away the PM starts asking the designer to make some screens um no problem the designers really eager about the project it's interesting she's excited she starts making the screens and then tell me if you've heard this one before the PM changes the requirements in a really big way multiple times usually right before a meeting anybody have to yeah yeah sorry guys um okay so much of this is happening without my knowledge because I helped kick off the project but in a really lightweight fashion and then I actually went on vacation so all the interactions between the p.m. and the designer are happening when I'm not there and that's pretty common so I learned about this when the designer is showing me the work and the screens don't hold together things don't quite make sense and I'm like I need to figure out what is happening here so by the way this story could have just as easily happen at a start-up and you can replace p.m. with a CEO you could replace it with your lead engineer you could replace it with your head of marketing you could replace it with a sales person anyone that we're getting requirements from who's asking us to do things so this is applicable in a lot of different context it's not just this one time at Facebook with this 1pm in this one designer anyway these are not these people are not the enemy they're just people trying to get things done quickly right they want to get their jobs done okay so the people in this context would seem pretty obvious it's the designer and the PM but it's actually more complex than that and I'll get back to that in a second um right off the bat it seems evident that the PM doesn't actually know how to engage with the designer so that's that external condition that educated stakeholder so it's a classic one but I can't assume that that's the only problem here because there's so much that happens when I'm not around so I have to understand the situation more and I started by asking the designer a couple of questions so can you read it to me what the goals of this project are and why is he asking for the changes she wasn't sure about the answers to either of these questions which is a pretty not that's not a good process right so I me immediately went to the PM and asked him the same questions he knew the goals of the project and of course he also know the reasons behind the changes but he was trying to move as fast as possible and when he had started asking her for these screens he thought that was all he needed I just need a couple of screens what's the big deal it's just a couple minutes and sketch or Photoshop and no big deal right but so now I have two conditions I have the PM that's not engaging properly with design and I have a designer who doesn't know no the goals that they need to accomplish on the project and and the course of my conversation with the PM I also learned something else which is the requirements kept changing because there was a small group of other people that the PM was showing the screens to without the designer present another p.m. and a lawyer and so every time the PM showed those screens to the p.m. and the other p.m. and the lawyer a change would come through and it would seem to the designer that it was coming totally out of left field so the people situation is more complicated than it initially scenes and i only found that out because i asked questions alright so at this point I'm pretty sure I know how I need to how I need to improve both of these conditions the lack of clarity on goals and the lack of process I need to get all of these people in a room together talking right you know the way we should have done it at the beginning so I could accomplish that in a couple different ways I could probably do it by yelling at the p.m. in the designer what the hell are you doing don't you know how to do your job you're supposed to engage with the designer we've talked about this process before and designer why didn't you demand goals from the PM what the hell are you thinking um and that would accomplish it for this project but what I actually want what I actually want is for these people to make good decisions when I'm not in the room in the future and I want them to realize that it's actually in their interest to make those good decisions not just because it makes Melissa mad so instead I need to play a different role um what role would you guys play here yeah any any others may be a little bit of diplomacy um but basically I ended up being a connector by getting people in the room together so at the next time the PM's the next time the PM met with the designer I invited the other p.m. and the lawyer and I showed up and kicked off the process just by asking so um could you guys remind me what our goals are ten minutes later we had a slightly contentious discussion but everybody agreed on the goals the next pace afterwards I post gamed with the PM to ask him what would he have changed about this process and he realized that if the designer had the total picture she would have been able to help him from the beginning and would have been able to be fully engaged in the problem solving process and they wouldn't have gone through all those loops this after that I also put pre-post gamed with the designer and all I did was ask her what she'd do differently and she immediately said I would have asked the p.m. for the goals she's never gonna forget that again is she um so basically by acting as a diplomat by acting as a connector and by coaching people to understand the way that they should actually act as opposed to demanding it of them and yelling at them I now have a p.m. and a designer who are going to act better in the future and are going to make better decisions when I'm not in the world ok so I'm almost out of time so I just wanted to give you a quick recap of what I just said which is number one as a design leader your job is to create the conditions that make good design possible number to be supportive not directive and number three with people understanding and you I firmly believe you can solve pretty much any problem and that's what I have for you today folks Thanks this is really fun
