 hi everyone and welcome to module 5 where we're gonna focus on fields of practice looking at what the different fields of practice look like and then we're also going to focus on the social justice issue of heterosexism so for our overview today we're first going to talk about the fields of social art practice we're then going to move into focusing on our social justice topic where we're gonna explore the language that relates to gender and sexual orientation we're gonna look at some of the research and then we're also gonna discuss homophobia in cisgender privilege and then lastly we're gonna move into sort of our meet and greet where you're going to get to know some social workers in the wilmington community so i thought it would be helpful to perhaps may clarify some of the information that you guys have been reading in the text up until this point so when we think about social work practice and we think about how to describe it there's a number of ways in which we can do that and then there's a number of ways in which you see that done so I wanted to sort of break this down so we can talk about social practice in terms of the populations with whom we work the issues that we address as social workers so the services that we provide the settings and locations in which we provide those services and then also the roles that we take on as social workers so in terms of populations social workers as you've come to know by now work with folks across the lifespan so we work with infants we work with children we work with teens we work with adults and older adults but we also work with folks beyond the individual level in terms of we work with couples who work with families or with communities we also work with folks that take on particular roles like caregivers folks who are servicemen and women so there's a variety of populations with whom we work and that's one way that we can describe social work practice another angle from which we can look at social practice is by looking at the issues that social workers address and in all of these slides these are certainly not a complete list certainly there's a lot of overlap in terms of these lists but just to point out some of those issues social workers help folks to deal with our addiction we look at aging issues bereavement loss death child abuse and neglect folks in in terms of medical social worker who might be working with people who are dealing with chronic pain community development or dealing with folks who may be of experienced crime sexual assault or abuse or some kind of trauma we look at the conditions of poverty mental health physical health intimate partner violence we look at LGBTQ issues we look at homelessness health disparities and then particular health conditions like HIV and AIDS another vantage point from which we can think about social practices in terms of the services we provide so social workers can work an addiction treatment they can assist with adoption and foster care services certainly advocacy is a big part of what we do we provide case management services consulting services crisis intervention services disaster relief employment assistance and again some of these things span different working with different populations of course and working in different settings but also providing family service family preservation services gerrant illogical services we work with veterans there are social workers committed to doing research and evaluation of practice there's services for folks living in rural communities public welfare policy development parent education certainly mental health and other kind of health care services as well as services that deal with housing so again not a complete list but this is just another way we can begin to think about social work practice so we can also think about social practice in terms of in what settings just social workers work in my hope is that this is helpful to you in terms of understanding the scope of social work where you might encounter social workers in your personal life or in your professional life if you choose to you know move forward with social work as a career and to help you understand where you might work were you to become a social worker so as you can see there's a long list here of the kinds of settings social workers work in schools health facilities of variety different kinds community health settings nonprofit for-profit agencies we work in the government agency which can include public welfare services criminal justice services working for the VA voc rehabilitation working in political offices so there's a real span of settings of which social workers work so lastly we didn't cover this earlier but in terms of thinking about the roles that social workers play I wanted to again just touch on this and remind you all that social workers again practice from the micro to the Mesirow to the macro so we work with people individually but we also work with them as couples and families in groups and we work with larger communities and in doing so we play a wide variety of roles so any where from the enabler to facilitating to planning brokering helping people negotiate difficult systems connecting them with resources we function as advocates we're often mediating or serving as activists in some way teaching training doing outreach research or scholarships so just wanting to remind you about the wide variety of roles that social workers play as well so to sort of capture a lot of that altogether there are what we call sort of common fields of practice now these look different depending on what texture looking at that kind of thing but I wanted to touch on some of these specifically to help you sort of toward the end of our class make sure that you have a good summary view of what social work looks like so the fields of practice include medical and health care Social Work school Social Work clinical social work Social Work administration and management now of course someone can function an administrative capacity in some of these other fields so they're not really mutually exclusive necessarily there's also International Social Work working with children and families forensic Social Work and then employment and occupational Social Work so again not a complete list but just a good starting place for you to have the big picture so in looking at medical Social Work there is a number there's a list here of sort of the ways in which social workers function and in this field of practice so certainly these social orders help connect patients and families with services help them navigate very difficult systems they help other pulp professionals understand the needs of patients and those families they also coordinate home care and equipment following discharge they also do a lot of discharge planning so let's say you're in the hospital and you then have to move to a different facility or you need home health services social workers will help set those up social workers also in these settings make a lot of referrals they provide referral services the port of counseling coordination care and follow-up services they may provide crisis intervention they certainly work in interdisciplinary teams and a big part of what they do also is demystifying the healthcare terminology personnel and procedures as you know the healthcare system is a really complicated one and so having support in that sort of context is really helpful for folks so school social workers work to support students and families to overcome social behavioral emotional and economic issues that can get in the way of learning and education so they also work with students and families to assess these problems make appropriate referrals you'll notice across all these fields of practice some of the things that social workers do are very similar in terms of those roles again going back to our earlier slides connecting folks with resources you'll see a lot so following up on those services coordinating with teachers and administrators and often providing crisis intervention services that relate to potentially issues like teen suicide drug and alcohol related issues and school violence so clinical social work focuses on providing mental health services and that includes the processes of assessment diagnosis and treatment now clinical social work can only be done if one has a master's degree with training in clinical social work so with an undergraduate degree you're not eligible to provide these kinds of clinical services so again clinical social workers who that's what the acronym LCSW stands for licensed clinical social worker provide services to individuals couples families and groups they also utilize a variety of psychotherapeutic theories and tools to guide their practice they provide referrals to the appropriate agencies in case management services they help folks to adjust to unique and major life changes transition so these kinds of things could include the death of a loved one the experience of having a disability divorce or the loss of employment and then they also interface with healthcare insurers to authorize mental health services international Social Work is another field of practice in which practitioners help aid refugees in ensuring a smooth transition into a new environment they may facilitate international adoptions work in disaster relief in times of crisis they also may help develop and staff international service delivery programs and of course there's also the advocacy piece of international issues to improve the quality of life and addressing and justices across the globe Children and Family Services is another field of social art practice in which practitioners help children and families to provide better solutions to their problems or the issues that they may be facing these social workers may also be responsible for removing children from abusive situations to place them in carrying a more appropriate homes they may be helping families find employment housing as well as working with the adoption system providing assessment support and counseling resource coordination and advocacy evaluating potential foster homes and then monitoring those placements and lastly supporting families and individuals who may be victimized in terms of intimate partner violence the forensic Social Work field of practice focuses on the criminal justice system and social workers who work in this area provide risk assessments expert testimony mental health care substance abuse treatment and other timely best practices to both victims and offenders so these social workers utilize best practices in child maltreatment and domestic violence assessment and treatment they provide assessment and treatment of juvenile offenders again mental health drug abuse medicaid an alternative treatment for adult offenders they get involved in trauma survivor assistance victim offender mediation and batterers intervention programs so it's important to recognize that social workers work with both people who have been affected as perpetrators and those have who've been affected as survivors social workers in this area also have expertise and instil in restorative justice they work around issues of punishment versus rehabilitation deterrence and determining whether individual offenders are capable of change and they function really as change agents legislative advocates policymakers and program administrators both for victims and offenders lastly I wanted to touch on employment or occupational social work in which social workers help workers with problems that affect their job performance and satisfaction so often these folks are employed by the actual agencies for which the individuals work the clients work so they assist corporations to reorganize their structure and methods to improve efficiency creativity productivity or morale they may work for a union and be involved in job counseling or organizing be an employee assistance counselor deal with substance abuse domestic violence single parenting or vocational rehabilitation issues or they can work with foundations or utility companies or Bank trust departments so just as we discussed last time we focused on racism and this is certainly applicable to all the isms we want to remember some key ideas in this discussion the first is that we have to start where we are so we all have different backgrounds and different experiences I mean we come to that discussion from those different places and we want to remember that we're all doing the best that we can with the knowledge skills and resources we have this is a really foundational belief that we have in social work when we think about where our clients are we believe that all people are doing the best that they can with the knowledge skills and resources that they have now that doesn't mean that if people gain different knowledge gained different skills gain additional resources that they can't be in a different place so the same goes for us in addition we can't change what we don't acknowledge so we have to really give an honest look to ourselves and to the world around us in order to change it and we also want to pay attention to this idea that heterosexism is not simply a problem of personal prejudice and individual acts of discriminations it's systemic it's a web of interlocking reinforcing institutions so social political economic cultural legal educational military etc so much like our discussion of racism and really the other isms these are socially constructed so there are systems in place that really marginalize groups of folks and so we want to pay attention not only to our own behavior but think about the larger structures which is really key to social work because we want to change those larger structures in addition to individual behaviors lastly we want to remember that the intention of raising our own consciousness and that of others is not to incite guilt or shame or blame we want to raise consciousness to bring about action and social justice so keep those things in mind as you're considering the ideas today and thinking about yourself and our larger society and the structures in play so now we're going to shift our focus to our social justice issue in which we're gonna go over some foundational language now in addition to what we're going to be talking about here I've also provided you all with a handout that would provide the definitions for all of these terms here and some additional terms that would be helpful to you so what we're going to be talking about now or we're gonna make distinctions between biological sex gender sexual orientation and then some other concepts that really foundationally have to do with social justice issues so first we're going to make the distinction between sex gender and sexual orientation now sex refers to biological sex which is a medical term used to refer to chromosomal hormonal anatomical characteristics that are used to classify us as individuals as either male female or intersex so to clarify someone who is characterized as intersex is someone who has a combination of those chromosomes and hormones etc for from what we would expect to see from both the male and the female so formally this was known as someone being a hermaphrodite or hermaphroditic but this is actually known as being pretty derogatory now so we want to stay away from using those words so historically speaking if a baby was found to be intersex this was treated as an as an emergency and something that the doctors needed to quote fix right away but since this time there's been increasing advocacy and awareness brought to this issue such that this is no longer seen as a medical emergency and infants are being allowed to remain intersex past infancy now we're gonna move to gender so sex was the biological anatomical differences now gender identity is the internal perception of one's gender and how a person labels themselves based on how much they feel as though they align or don't align with their understanding of whatever gender is is to be so gender is often confused with biological sex or sex assigned with birth so those things are often confused so common identity labels include being a man a woman gender queer trans and there are some others as well so that's someone's gender identity so now let's move to gender expression so gender expression refers to the ways in which people externally communicate their gender identity to others through behavior clothing haircut voice and other forms of presentation so gender expression also works the other way as people assigned gender to others based on their appearance mannerisms and other gendered characteristics so we sort of assumed gender based on some external gender expression so folks who are transgender may seek to match their physical expression that external gender expression with their gender identity so that is you know the identity they feel internally rather than their birth assigned sex so let's say someone is born with male parts but internally feels like a female they may in turn choose to express their gender consistently with that female gender identity so we want to be clear here that gender expression should not be viewed as an indication of sexual orientation so sex gender and sexual orientation are very distinct concepts so to continue thinking about gender again the internal understanding of who one is there's this concept of gender role so this is the set of roles activities and expectations and behaviors that are assigned to females and males by society so our gender role is completely socially constructed so it's nothing inherent to us so our culture recognizes to gender roles that being masculine so having qualities attributed to male and feminine having qualities attributed to females so you may take a moment and think about okay so what are the expected roles and activities and expectations as well as behaviors of both males and females in our society these are their gender roles so people who step outside of their socially assigned gender roles are sometimes referred to as transgender so while our culture only assigns there to be sort of these two gender roles other countries aren't the same way and may other countries may have three or more gender roles so this again gets back to the idea that our gender role is socially constructed so now we're going to discuss the concept of transgender so this is an umbrella term covering a whole range of identities that transgress socially from defined gender norms so a person who lives as a member of a gender other than what they're expected to be anatomically so because sexuality labels so for example gay straight and bi are generally based on the relationship between the person's gender and their genders that they are attracted to trans sexuality can be defined in a couple of ways so some people may choose to self-identify as straight gay bi or lesbian or pansexual or others using their gender identity as a basis or they might describe their sexuality using other focused terms so the concept of gender normative or cisgender refers to folks whose assignment at birth corresponds to their transgender identity and expression so if you were born with female anatomy and you feel as though your gender identity is in fact what we assign as female then you would be cisgender so or gender normative so if you don't fit in that category you would fit in this category of transgender so essentially we all fit in these two categories so there's also the concept of genderqueer which is an adjective there's also a catch-all term for gender identities other than man and woman thus outside the gender binary that we have so people who identify as a gender queer may think of themselves as being one of the following so they may think of themselves as both being man and woman neither man or woman moving between gender so gender fluid a third gender or other gender that includes those who do not put a name on their gender and then there's having an overlap or blurred lines between gender identity and sexual and romantic orientation so I think the thing to recognize here I mean this may be familiar to you based on your own experiences or you just might happen to know about this or it might be new information to you that there's a wide range of gender identities and there's really a continuum here for us to keep in mind
