 I welcome you to the third lecture on how to transfer our technology through strategic alliance and today my focus will be more on opportunities and risks in the strategic alliance now to put the opportunities in a simplest way as mary did in his in her paper strategic alliance legal and ethical challenges that globalization and technological advances have contributed to the rise of strategic alliance it is alleged that the traditional or particle integrated companies cannot deliver the level of quality low cost innovation and a first response times that competition demand so to put it other way around that in the globalization era or when the technology advancement is in its peak the title strategic alliance is a better form of business opportunity in compared to if you wanted to grow in an organic manner within the organization now possibly we are our of the fact that the life of the technology is became much lesser than which it used to be in last decades take example of mobile cell phone you will find the life of technology is around three months by the time you will find new or better improve person is in the market similarly there is a other technologies also beat a car beta you know bike beta a IT based technology beta entertain based technology you will find they are rapidly changing and they are bringing more and more efficient technology into the market so if you wanted to be a competitive against your competitor in the market then you need to adopt the new technology and you should have a capacity to absorb that particular new technology within your organization and to be you know order to be to be candid on the particular issue many of the time the company who are in developing the product into a particular market do not have a age to develop that Ardi within their organization so one has to rely on the technology which is available in other part of the market or in the other part of the globe and they have to get that particular technology so that they can bring the product which is market standard so strategic alliance gives the dynamism collaboration and mutual learning dynamism in the sense that you can keep space with the technological changes which mike market look for collaboration in the sense you collaborate with the partners where your partner also get opportunity to learn about the market where you are producing that particular technology or they even able to learn that technology demand into that particular market so accordingly they can customize their product if they are good in 2 r.d or even they can bring a better technology or Commission the new research for developing a new technology orbital technology even you know the strategic alliances evolve the way by which it can gives you a dynamic managerial as well as the legal framework now when I am talking about dynamic material it means that those people who are managing the affair of the company or the organization which is coming out of these strategic alliance or any relationship which is coming out of this particular strategic alliance they should be in a better position to know that how to place themselves into the emerging market or the changing market conditions at the same time when I am talking about the legal framework you have to have a very dynamic legal relationship between between you and your partner or between the parties who are you know participating in to these strategic alliance so both of you can get the advantage out of this strategic alliance itself now when I am talking about flexible framework or flexible legal framework I wanted to mean that whenever you have entered into an agreement you possibly not aware of the fact that what are the issues might come before you rather you have kept your condition open or the framework legal framework open so that if there is an excision sees in the futures or if there is a changing business environment in future you can accommodate that particular changing business environment within your agreement itself so what I am trying to drawing your attention that you should have a flexible system of managerial orientation of the organization which is coming out of this particular essay or if it is a simply a contract then both that organization should have a flexible managerial structure which can promote the a strategic alliance at the same time you should also promote the flexible legal framework so that it can give you a better understanding over this you know continuation of the strategic alliance now let me take you through the criteria which might provide you a sustainable and successful alliances in when you are going ahead into the future the first thing is that there should be a communication channel at all levels that means if you are creating a creating a new structure or new business organization out of this strategic alliance or you are managing this but business by both the partner in both the cases there should be a level of or channel of communication in all the stage it might be even the channel of communication in the lower management rank even in the working level at the sometime you should be into the higher managerial level where the decision-making happens in these particular case now you should also develop the joint capabilities of producing that particular product or handling the market or even the competition which you are might face in the market or at the same time if there is any risks which you are finding in in doing this particular business relating to the matter of the rig's I am going to discuss little later but let me tell you this developing the joint capability is one of the very important aspect for sustenance of the strategic alliance there is a some kind of study who is say that you know within three years almost fifty five percent of the strategic alliance collapses because of not able to developing these particular joint capabilities similarly you need to have kind of a system available through which you could exchange your property information if you remember my previous lecture I was talking with you relating to non-disclosure agreement because sometimes while you are in strategic alliance or when you are acting together into a particular market you do disclose some of the very sensitive information which is only known to a particular organization only because if it is spill over to the public domain then in that case you might have a difficulty to face your completed or even the market too so exchanging of proprietary information should be there but at the same time there should be adequate precaution to be taken by both the party into this strategic alliance now you need to share the goal and objectives and you need to continuously change it monitor it readable up to it and reassert it because the goal with which you have started this particular strategic alliance need to be changed due to the change into the market condition due to change in a regulated environment due to the change above in the customer preference so much so far similarly you know you need to be flexible about your objectives which you wanted to pursue during these particular strategic alliance two because you might have a objective initially to do to producer to bringing a particular product into particular market but over the years it might require to customize that particular product and you also need to indulge yourself or to start R&D for bringing a better product into that particular market yourself so you need to have a flexible objective you you cannot continue simply with developing the product if if needed eyes you have to have developed the facility to do the rd into this particular product now the third third thing which helps this particular strategic alliances is is the mutual cost reduction strategies you know through this particular strategic alliance many of the time you try to find out the best process through which you can bring down the cost of the production it might be through the engineering innovation it might be by defining the new process of labor management it might be the process by which you wanted to access the market or it might be the supply chain which wanted to use for distribution of your product so much so forth you basically try to find out a suitable knowledge or suitable understanding from each other so that you can mutually get benefit in this particular process now as I told you that strategic alliance give you a lot of opportunity to grow at the same time you also you need to ever the risks which you might face during this particular strategic alliance and what I did I gave you a four-pointer about this particular risks which you might find in usual course of your business the first might be in the week intellectual property protection and most of the country you will find though there is an intellectual property law are there but the execution of the intellectual property a property protection is quite low now if you look in India you will find those multinational who do the business in India or those people who are basically technology base or knowledge base business they always allege that Indian intellectual property enforcement is pretty low and it is quite risky to do the business in India because India do not give any protection against the reverse engineering India did not give any protection relating to rampant infringement of somebodys knowledge India do not give adequate protection in in in infringement of the copyright so much so for even you know some people say that if it is up industrial design if the India to not give a proper protection for this particular purpose so many of the time the week intellectual property regime might be a big challenge for strategic alliance because the the liability of protection protecting this particular intellectual property which you are receiving from your partner nization lies with you only so you need to have your strategy in place internal as well as you have to take the adequate precaution for for enforcement of your right if there is an infringement happen in outside of your organization to now the second can be the uncertain political environment and this is a quite a big challenge in the in in the country like India where there is the multi-party democracies are there because once a political masters changes in the election they are objective and the perspective of the development or prospective of a prospective prospect of economic growth might change so in those circumstances one need to be very careful that how they are going to carry forward the business you might if you look around you will find there is a mini project which was initiated by the previous government are not really progressed much into the present government and this is also true not only in the federal level or the central level but this is also true in K in in state government level or even in the local government level so the political uncertain environment might be a huge bottleneck or might be a huge problem for you in execution of the project which you wanted to initiate through these strategic alliance now some of the market are are affected by the rampant corruption and you know people do allege the same thing for India also and this is also true not only India in many of the market be to develop market developing market or under Tavella market and you know in those particular market the government missionaries or maybe the local government or the people who are facilitated to that particular business they do expect that there should be kind of a kickback for doing the business into that particular market and your organization might be a ethical organization and you don't encourage this particular process so in those particular market to survive itself is a very very challenging task or difficult tasks like you know somebody told me that it is surprising that how the Tartar do the business in India because India has a you know a bad reputation of the corruptions and and they said that you know if the ethical organization elect otters are doing the business in Indian market is really very surprising surprising for the outsider who are not part of this particular thing similarly there might be a complex and complex legal and regulated regime and which might create a huge bottleneck for doing the business into a particular market yesterday I have talked with you relating to is of doing the business in India and India basically a feature very low into that particular list itself so sometimes you know there is over-regulation into a particular market sometimes you will find because of the particular over-regulation brokering influence comes and it create a stumbling block for development of this particular business and you need to you need to manage this particular difficulty into into this particular including this particular strategic alliance well now let me put it before you these two stages of the risk assessment one can be called before you are entering into a market and second one is after you entering the market in both the cases it is advisable that you closely monitor this particular lyrics and you should have a strategy in place to combat this particular risks like if you are entering a mean before you are entering into the market you might have ricks relating to the legal and regulatory issues which i have talked with you it might be relating to the business community it might be relating to the business security and even some of the time Geographic lyrics I believe I have talked with you relating to legal and regulatory issues let me talk about the business community you know some point of time you will find the business community through their trade association create a barrier for a new entrant into the market and these particular barrier is quite acceptable to this particular market because maybe the fair regulated into that market are not very strong or there is some kind of practice which is prevalent into the market and that create a barrier or strong barrier for a new entrant into this particular market and in those particular circumstances you should have a strategy in place how you are going to do this particular thing or sometimes you will find this business community do exercise a lot of concentration into the market through their own association or or trade probings similarly you will find there might be a geographical Rick's geographic areas due to geopolitical issues it might be because of the fascial environment of that particular place where you wanted to do the business so much so forth and there you should be ever about that what are the risks which you might face before before you really start your strategic alliance and if you if you are ever of this particular area you have to have a plan in place how to come back with these products similarly after you enter into the market you need to you need to you need to continuously monitor these risk assessment or perform this particular risk assessment so that you have a early warning of our particular risks which you might going to face and if you have this particular early warning then that case you should take appropriate measure how to compare the petrol rigs into that particular market itself this take me to the risk management and I i will suggest you that you should have a risk management into the core of your strategy strategic decision making now when I am talking about the core of strategic decision making I am talking about all around or risk management system it might be the you know business risks which you require to manage it might be the econometrics it might be political leaks it might be the legal and regulatory weeks it might be the intellectual property interest your property protection reeks of that particular market so much so forth so whatever this particular Rick's is you should have a kind of a risk management in place and you should know who is going to bear what kind of risks that means are you going to be are all kind of breaks or your partner is going to share some of the rigs or how you are going to hays a particular risks which you are going to face into this particular business or if you require to have some kind of underwriting protection for this particular lyrics and if you do take this particular Android production underwriting protection who is going to who is going to bear the finance for this particular underwriting protection or how you are going to transfer the risk to the other people who might be associated into this particular business so what I am trying to draw your attention that you should have a mechanism in place to manage this entire risk which you might find at the time of strategic alliance thank you for your patience hearing
