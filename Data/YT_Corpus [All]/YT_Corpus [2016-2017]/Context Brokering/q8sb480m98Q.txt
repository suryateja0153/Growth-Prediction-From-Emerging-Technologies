 good evening and welcome to this special event dinner event be hosted together with the USIBC and let me also extend a very warm welcome to his excellency ambassador warme who well we keep on calling upon his indulgence and he always obliges us by being here but this program is special because you know it was I do not think that out his help you would have been able to put together what you were seeing before you mmm very warm welcome of course to Captain swinter Williams who in India as you all seen enjoys a status of a rockstar I told my niece that Sunita was Captain Smith is going to be her and she made me promise that I must send a selfie with her immediately on whatsapp so I'm going to proceed to that later in evening dr. Stefano pillai who has been the driving force behind india's remarkable achievements in the space in different sectors as a world's two largest democracies you know India and the u.s. have now graduated to seeing themselves as indispensable partners in ensuring global peace stability and prosperity now things have moved a lot ever since the 123 agreement was forged in a 2008 and this relationship which is every day growing more and more multifaceted I would say is as we are reaching out to each other collaborating together in various different ways finding new ways of engagement and the breadth and depth of this relationship today is evident in the new mood in both DC and in New Delhi in the mutual ease and comfort which we are now observing in the interactions between the two sides it's a newfound is in comfort even when we do not agree and many things which we do not agree on as inevitable but this is now goes far beyond i will save mere strategic requirements or economic needs and even the vibrant you know diasporic connect of which the Ambassador himself and Captain Smith are Williams are living embodiments now this annual dialogue commemorating calc nachala is built around the central theme of space policy but this evening in particular we assemble to discuss the critical the business of space and that is why you're so happy to have use ibc any visitor here as partners for this evening now india's involvement as la visita has already pointed out in outer space has been growing by leaps and bounds between twenty thirteen and fourteen india community of three percent of all the orbital launches the same as japan it also accounted for three percent of all spacecraft the spacecraft manufactured in the world now phenomenal as these achievements are it is necessary i think to place them in perspective so some comparisons are inevitable and i'm going to make them in 2015 and economically stressed russia still managed to pull off 28 launches followed by us in china at 20 and 19 india by comparison launched five satellites in 2015 up from four in the previous year well india is if you look at it in a global perspective relatively small in the number of satellites it operates it is pertinent here that of the 1305 satellites and operation the u.s. operates close to half 549 china 142 russia 131 and india's operation satellite stand around 25 now while india has been using satellite technology for several purposes it is still in the process of building capabilities in respect of specialized year for intelligence gathering missile detection mechanism and technological development and of course outer space aren t the annual revenues of the global space industry across manufacturing operating and launch services stood last year at about roughly over 200 million India still remains a bit player it is getting there but it still remains a bit player in this big market over the last 10 years a satellite service sector alone has more than doubled globally so these are all areas where India with its indigenous space capabilities i think is today uniquely poised to take advantage of the global demand in the expansion that is taking place in this field and in building these capabilities we must congratulate successive governments of India who have given the necessary support to estero as an organization an organization that time and again has demonstrated his mettle has demonstrated these capabilities and to truly appreciate the achievements of his row all the comparisons i was making must also be put in perspective NASA's Space budget when over last year 2015 of almost dollars 18 billion is expected to grow to 19 this year the European Space Agency has a budget of over five and a half billion is true on the other hand even after budgetary increase of two times in the past year still manages and strips through with a budget of roughly 1.2 billion that's why it stands now within these constraints when these concrete constraints no doubt the achievements of estero have indeed been phenomenal it has today created the requisite pool of human resource and technological capability which can now exponentially grow in your space program competing with the global peers so while there is an urgent need to expand astros budgetary support we must also realize that in view of the social and political imperatives facing a government such as a government of india there are definite limits constraints constraints to the extent india space ambitions will be realized on the basis of support from the consolidated fund of india we need to move beyond that today the Indian government is actively encouraging the integration of space technology and services for the realization of various initiatives or anyways authorities mention about them a great digital India initiative which no seeks to make the capabilities already developed in the field of prop mapping metrology resource planning land use make them available where they are most needed right down to the bottom of the pyramid and that is where satellite technology comes in that is where information technology come in the marriage of the two there is a huge market for India even domestically to expand the space program therefore limitations imposed by fund constraints can no longer be allowed to restrict these ambitions it is here that there is a need for proactive policies that encourage private sector investments in space exploration and satellite development three companies from India have successfully build satellites another Indian company has successfully produced based draft components India now needs to also encourage private sector capabilities in propulsion manufacturing and various other areas now private sector involvement we feel can facilitate deeper cooperation among satellite and space technology companies and agencies they can help in facilitating technology transfers and bring new economically viable strategies and opportunities to the indian space program in this chief course would also have to come forward and invest in R&D capabilities and collaborate with universities in a big way so that is that is the universe we are next looking to step into the east roulade indian space program has in many ways help to realize to reach the potential of the private sector and is already working towards creating a larger role for private institutions recent developments in involving companies to build units of the PS will be launched system are indicators of the growing penetration of the private sector in this fear this all this now needs to be upscale exponentially to the next level in this context again it is instructive to look at our partners the US which holds more than forty percent market share in this industry the success has largely come from a dynamic innovative private sector and that is the kind of dynamism we need to unleash in India as well the US has been actively encouraging tremendous growth to space technology companies like SpaceX one web planet labs no whole host of them are today poised to reshape the entire future of the space industry even as a whole host of no subsidiary answered units also get carried along in the tailwinds India should now capitalize on stone capabilities by giving you space actors mentioned if you throw a space at your team endures or to operate in various others to give them a policy framework in which more like them can flourish and make their success India success therefore I am again very grateful to the u.s. IVC and extremely grateful to Allah saw Varma for being here today joining us in conceiving and supporting this theme and this evenings discussion that has actually surprises were gathering such a diverse group of stakeholders so I'll let the experts delve deeper later into in the evening into the niceties of the programs we are talking about but for the moment are like to invite his excellency ambassador Varma audra share thoughts with us thank you so much it's great to be here at my weekly USIBC and ORF event i should say done a lot of events with both of you and I'm grateful for the leadership that you've shown input in putting this together I want to just tell you how we even got here to this evening last summer we were looking at all the different things that we do together with India and when the president was here last january january of 2015 we came out of that visit with some 80 different initiatives we came out of the Prime Minister's visit to Washington with several different new initiatives what people probably didn't appreciate is that a big chunk of what we do together is in the science and technology space but it's specifically in our space cooperation and I don't think enough people actually knew how much we were partnering and what the future actually held for our two countries in space and I heard the Prime Minister talk about I heard the president talk about it so we actually sat our team at the Embassy SAT together and we said we need to highlight this cooperation because I really think this is going to be one of the big pathways of our cooperation in the future you know some people like to say watch this space watch this space because it has a lot happening and we have so much in common we have a lot of great experts so we really are team George Sibley Murray Hagelin Jay ghoulish Robert Kemp so many other people put together a whole month to recognize what we are doing on space so this month we've had dialogues we've had visitors from Washington we've had special events educational sessions op-eds we have a series of events leading through tomorrow to recognize this us-india space cooperation and I'm so glad that are up and USIBC could be part of it and truth be told this is a personal passion for me as well when I was in sixth grade I wrote a letter to NASA and I wrote to the NASA Administrator never thinking that I'd actually hear back from the NASA Administrator but I wrote a letter said I want to be an astronaut what do I need to do I actually got back a two-page letter which I still have to this day signed by the NASA Administrator laying out first that I needed to be a good student and do my homework but then secondly leading me through the different ways people become astronauts there are payload specialists there are pilots there are people who come from the military there are people come from universities and so I set myself on that path to become an astronaut and I had my Air Force career in front of me I had engineering scholarship in front of me and then there was that talent problem in engineering and science that kind of got in the way of me becoming an astronaut so the ambassador thing is not a bad back up hopefully this will this will work out okay but but really when I think about all the different people I've met in this job over the last year and a half whether it's government officials foreign leaders bollywood stars but the fact that I got to meet an American and Indian hero in Captain sunita williams that was a big thrill and honor for me so thank you so I want to talk a little bit tonight about what our countries have done together and where I hope we can go in the future from our earliest days mankind has been racing to unlock the mysteries of the universe through science astronomy physics and yes all through also through space flight this quest has been about far more than satisfying human curiosity or a need to explore new domains the journey has also been about the limitless laboratory that space provides a gravity-free classroom that can help us improve the human condition better predicting monsoons enhancing global communications and connectedness and conducting advanced research on the pressing problems of the day are just a few of the benefits on earth from our continued work in space I'm also proud that the United States and India have a long and successful history of space cooperation beginning back in 1963 when India first launched a US manufactured sounding rocket sometimes called a research rocket from zumba to study the atmosphere above Earth's magnetic equator over the next 12 years the United States and other nations helped India build and launch more than 350 sounding rockets from zumba that same launch site in southern India has become a major site for meteorology and Atmospheric Research which provides valuable information about how the systems of our earth interact information that is increasingly important in the face of climate change i'm also really proud of the role that americans of indian and south asian descent have played in our great space program i had the honor last fall of traveling to houston texas where i met with a number of indian americans who had immigrated to united dates to support the important work of the Johnson Space Center and the related scientific research there I already mentioned captain Williams and we welcome all of our friends from NASA who are here tonight from is ro from the US government thank you all for what you do and we remember and honor the courage of Kalpana Chawla and all those who have given the ultimate sacrifice in this quest in the 1970s is Rowan asah conducted this satellite instructional television experiment or cite cite used NASA's first direct broadcasting satellite to beam television programs to more than 2,400 villages across India site set up TVs for community viewing to show programs on health agriculture development and children's programs the program impacted the lives of millions of rural people and provides just one example of how us-india space cooperation can bring tangible benefits to our people the site program led indian space scientists to design and develop their own state-of-the-art multi-purpose communication satellite in the 1980s the indian national satellite or inset the first four in fat satellites were built by US industry and three of them were put into orbit by US launch vehicles in fat ushered in a revolution in india's television and radio broadcasting and connected people many for the first time with telecommunications the system is also used for search and rescue missions in the Indian Ocean another example of how space technology helps protect our people inset is now the largest domestic communication system in the asia-pacific region with nine operational satellites in orbit this early relationship has developed into a robust partnership exemplified by scientific exchanges and joint projects chandrayaan-1 India's first mission to the moon was launched successfully in october two thousand eight the faith craft carried several scientific instruments built by international partners including two by NASA the satellite orbited the moon to map the celestial body for chemical and mineralogical characteristics one of the NASA instruments mapped about ninety percent of the surface of the Moon in nine months of operation the mission produced data that led scientists to detect water on the moon for the first time in September 2014 both our nation's had spacecraft arrived in Martian orbit NASA's Mars atmosphere and volatile evolution spacecraft properly known as maven arrived at Mars on September 21st and it's the first spacecraft dedicated to exploring the upper atmosphere of Mars it's rose mars orbiter mission or mom arrived only two days later and made india the first asian nation to go to Mars the mom is still orbiting today and helping scientists study the Martian surface and atmosphere nasha NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory provided navigation and communication support to the mom showcasing yet again how our nation's can work together effectively on complex challenges now following this near simultaneous arrival of our spacecraft to Mars our countries established a Mars working group to investigate further cooperation for Mars exploration the third face-to-face meeting of this working group concluded today in banglore the Mars working group seeks to identify and implement goals that NASA and Israel share for Mars exploration particularly coordinated observations and science analysis between maven and mom and NASA's other mars craft the working group looks to potential future joint missions mars another ongoing project which is particularly exciting because it can provide important information about climate change is the NASA is Rho synthetic aperture radar project or nice are our space agencies are developing this joint satellite and plan to launch it from India's impressive geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle in 2021 the satellite will use advanced radar imaging to provide an unprecedented detailed view of Earth the joint mission will improve scientists understanding of climate change and natural hazards by measuring changes on the Earth's surface such as changes in ice sheets land vegetation and land motion both President Obama and Prime Minister Modi recognized that global climate change is a profound threat to humanity I believe it's critically important that utilize all of our strengths to fight this threat that's why we are so proud that we are using space technology and the nice our project to do so obviously there are significant scientific benefits to that but if you just think about what I just said and what's in store NASA is going to take one of its most sophisticated systems put it on an Indian launch vehicle and put it into space for those of you who have been following this area for many years just think back to a few years ago as to whether such cooperation in such collaboration would have been possible in September 2015 for the first time india launched a u.s. satellite well actually they launched four at one time the satellites belonged to a US company and india launched them from its trusted workhorse the polar satellite launch vehicle which has launched satellites for 20 different countries other US companies have sought launches on India's pslv including a google satellite scheduled for launch in April and likewise many US companies continue to provide is row with satellite technology and components and Raytheon is playing an important all in India's gag on navigation system a satellite navigation is an indispensable technology that we rely on each day the cell phones in our pockets use the technology to help us navigate make phone calls and send international fund transfers I'm excited that our countries are working together to make GPS and the Indian regional navigation satellite system more compatible through the adoption of the same signal for civilian use this creates the potential for us to harness satellite navigation data for more benefits to our society the data could be used to help trains avoid collisions assist fishermen to stay in appropriate areas or provide valuable data to initiatives such as digital India and even smart cities the u.s. and India also have a deep cooperative relationship in weather systems and applications which rely heavily on space technologies our weather agencies maintain a long-standing data sharing agreement and India continues to enhance a weather forecasting model developed by the United States government India also provides data technical assistance and financial support to the monsoon desk at the US National Weather Service last June nASA released international climate model data for the Indian subcontinent to facilitate climate resilience cooperation between us and Indian technical agencies this data will fuel a partnership between the u.s. and India to help each country assess and prepare for changing climate risks at the sub-national level what is more this relationship goes well beyond government to government activity us and indian universities and professional societies also collaborate on a wide range of science research and capacity-building efforts so we talked about the past we talked about what we're doing today what is the future what is the future hold and let me lay out some some lofty possibilities because I believe we can continue to push forward and do even more together some of our most valued technologies have origins in the space industry technologies like the cameras and our cell phones water filtration and medical scans so we have to push forward for more collaboration in space to bring even more benefits in the future so what do we envision we envision a future where the United States and India work with scientists from around the world to explore the far reaches of outer space imagine our astronauts working together in space on a joint mission imagine our scientists coming together to explore this galaxies and galaxies beyond jointly discovering the very origins of the universe I believe these grand dreams may not be so far away after all just days ago Prime Minister Modi announced that India will build a lego facility and together we will explore gravitational waves the most exciting discovery in fundamental physics in this new millennium the International Space Station also provides a potential opportunity for more depth in our space collaboration India could become a partner in the space station opening the door for even closer collaboration in space scientists and students could send experiments to the space station just as other partner nations in the international space station currently due to study topics that range from space and physics to biology and biotechnology in 2014 the then chairman of is row said that India was in discussions about conducting climate-related earth observation experiments on the space station if it became a partner of the ISS Earth observation from space can provide valuable information about global weather patterns extreme weather events and environmental changes helping to keep our cities our people and our country safer but in addition to sending experiments to space in the coming years Indian astronauts and American astronauts could work side-by-side in space to better understand the intricacies of our planet our universe and human interactions with them beyond the outer atmosphere of this planet we continue exploring Mars together our engineers could jointly develop a spacecraft to explore the atmosphere or even the surface of Mars our bright scientists could work together to analyze the data and learn even more about the red planet you know our NASA Administrator likes to remind us that the first person to walk on Mars is alive today somewhere on the earth what was once a dream and part of a Hollywood movie script is fast becoming a reality and I'm confident that our work together could help secure and accelerate this reality and why not go beyond Mars let's go further in our solar system our nation's could together build a spacecraft to reach other planets or bodies in our solar system at the us-india civil space Joint Working Group last September both our nation's expressed interest in working together in heliophysics or the study of the Sun joint projects on these celestial bodies would lead to joint discoveries about our home in space and while the current generation of us-india space collaboration is largely government-led as was mentioned earlier the next wave must include leadership by private industry academia entrepreneurs and the users of space-based data and services I know of more than a few Indian Space entrepreneurs seeking capital to build small satellites provide real-time agricultural data developed weather apps and provide rural connectivity there would be tremendous benefits to India if it harnesses this technology and the 300 billion dollar space economy so commercial space technology reinforces technology development innovation and entrepreneurship more broadly us satellite operators offer broadband internet everywhere in the United States at affordable costs and the social and economic benefits of GPS are profound joining our expertise and needs in these applications and in others including supply chain management machine demean machine-to-machine communications precision farming and optimize transportation could provide a huge boost to the digital India vision so let me let me wrap up and in conclusion just say that greater us-india space cooperation across multiple segments of society could inspire the next phase of indo-american potential it could vividly demonstrate how India and the United States working together can be of service to the world space research and exploration drive innovation and technology development for the benefit of all people from satellite navigation and smart cities to water purification technology and medical imaging space also inspires young minds and sparks passions encouraging students to study science technology engineering and math skill sets that launched high tech careers and stimulate entrepreneurship space as part of the global Commons is a precious frontier that will allow for the continued advancement of mankind it is an area in which international cooperation is not only important it has become a necessity as President Obama said what was once a global competition has long since become a global collaboration so I want to thank you all for the time that you've spent on this i want to thank you for having me here this evening to speak with such an impressive group of thinkers and world changers i'm really passionate about what we all can do together in space i'm inspired by the work that all of you have done and are doing to help realize this potential and i'm grateful to our to visionary leaders President Obama and Prime Minister Modi who have challenged us to reach for this final frontier thank you very much
