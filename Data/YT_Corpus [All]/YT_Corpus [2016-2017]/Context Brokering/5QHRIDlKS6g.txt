 my name is Pat auspice and on behalf like to thank you all for being here it's really because of the expertise and experience of people like you that we could write a book like voices 3 because it is the collective wisdom of the field that we tried to capture so and some of you who are here are actually contributors to the book so thank you again what I'm going to do now is just quickly run over what the evening will consist of first and fish will give a little talk on the findings of voices 3 she'll talk for about 20 minutes and then we will have a panel discussion moderated by Tom doer and our distinguished panelists are Joel Radner Jennifer vaniqa Raphael Bostic Elena Harkness John Burroughs and zap Briggs after that we will have some questions from the audience so for about 10-15 minutes so that's it and very good good evening everyone thank you very much for being here Diana you just got here too thanks so what I'm going to do is talk for about 20 minutes we are assuming that you all haven't had a chance to read this book but it's on your bedside table and you'll be reading it over the course of the next few days and weeks but we thought that we just lay out for you what some of the main themes are that are in the book that can lay the groundwork for the panel discussion and for the discussion with you for the rest of the evening so what this is is this is a third in a series called voices from the field where we try to take a look at various types of community change efforts they used to be called comprehensive community initiatives sometimes called community building initiatives but that there that are placed based and are trying to improve outcomes for kids and families and make conditions in neighborhoods better what we did is we ended up drawing our information from 48 of and there's a list of them in the back of the book and we did a combination of reviewing program documents and evaluations but because we found that we find that so much of the knowledge and wisdom about community change efforts is really in people's heads we did a lot of interviewing and a lot of small group discussions and so this is a combination of that that effort when we looked at these we looked at ones that have been in existence that started in the late 80s and early 90s all the way up through the contemporary time we a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation says that there's probably been about a billion dollars of philanthropic investment in these works and depending on how you count the public sector money it's around 10 billion if you add in Hope 6 it's really starts to get up there just on hope 6 sometimes we refer to hope 6 and sometimes we don't because it it's place-based but it doesn't quite have a community building orientation so we tried to pull some lessons from there but it's not really a focus of this so what I want to talk about first of all is what we can say in general about what they accomplished and then I'm going to spend some time talking about some of the broad lessons that we feel like we can draw from it and just give you a flavor for some of the challenges for the field going forward and I'll figure out how to go forward so what have they done in terms of producing tangible documentable outcomes they can show improved outcomes for individuals in the neighborhoods but I want to say something very important about that it's improved outcomes for the individuals who participated in the programs in the target neighborhoods and this is going to be a theme that will come back to so that for example the Harlem Children's Zone all you all were at the Harlem Children's Zone promise neighborhoods initiative yesterday we can they can show improved test scores for kids in third and eighth grade in their charter school that's very important second a lot of them built housing John barrows how many units of housing have you built in rehab okay 210 outside of our land trust about 800 yeah okay so built housing and particularly those that were based in CDC's can show housing that was built and some of them can show associated outcomes like reductions in crime and increases in property values as a result of that work and then a third thing that you can point to is that many of them develop commercial space and you'll be hearing from Jennifer I'm sure over the course of the evening there's a there's a lot of very interesting stuff that going on in in San Diego that and what they've done in terms of commercial space is really impressive then there was also a set of outcomes that have to do with community building and so there's many sort of quality there's qualitative evidence and lots of powerful anecdotes about how new leadership was developed in the in the context of these initiatives leaders who have been in their neighborhoods for a long time like John leaders who have moved from their neighborhood level work to positions in foundations and technical assistance organizations and research organizations in public policy positions OMB HUD the we even take credit for the mayor of Savannah in this wheel then new social capital meaning new connections among people there are powerful stories about those kinds of connections organizational capacities were increased and then something that we've called community Civic capacity which really means the community's capacity to represent itself to powerful outside forces to the public sector to the private sector through by doing organized community planning by doing bio community organizing by being able to represent and speak for the community to outside power bases then one another one of the objectives of these of these initiatives over the course of the last 20 years has been about policy and systems change and this is this part of it is a little bit sobering because i think if you we don't we expected to see more than we actually saw but i want to tell you what if you ask people who are in the commune any change initiatives what they say that they can document as policy and systems change they will often talk about how they attracted and leverage new funding in the neighborhood and some of them document it very carefully I know that in the McCarthy lisc initiative they're really documenting that very carefully in there in the evaluation that mdrc is doing in terms of system responsiveness I want to make a point about the difference between transactional system responsiveness versus transformational system change that there's there are examples of when the community groups needed the system the public sector system to do something differently and they were able to take access and get a regulation changed getting a rule changed getting people to pay attention that was not transformative of the system but it was they were able to get things done on their behalf and then finally I think one of the themes that several people talk about and that we see thanks to the presence of Zev and Raphael here is that we see sort of a new legitimization of place-based work that we see it in the current policy administration in the current administration we see it in foundation work we see it in state and local government work here's so that's what they have done here's what they didn't do they did not transform neighborhoods and it's important to say this because if you read the documentation that accompanies a lot of this work they talk in in very lofty terms like we are going to transform neighborhoods we are going to turn around this neighborhood we're going to make it a healthy place for kids and families they have not done that yet yet so we don't see for example population level changes in these neighborhoods we see improved outcomes for individuals who participated in the services that were and put into place in those neighborhood but do we see IRA get changes in poverty levels as a result of these initiatives no we don't see that yet were they the target were they the engines for major economic development they did commercial revitalization they did build housing but they were not the engines for economic development in the poorest communities and as I said they did not trigger the kind of system reform that everybody had hoped so in so the bottom line is that the community change efforts of the last 20 years have not transformed poor communities the good news is that they've improved outcomes for individuals and communities and they built capacity the community building dimension of it is noticeable and is something that people report on so what does that mean for the future the future is we can't do poverty reduction work without paying attention to place we can't do it without place-based work we talk a lot about regionalism now it's very important but we still are talking about regionalism as it connects to poor communities and so therefore we have to take the lessons that we've learned from doing this and apply it to the next generation of work because we don't have a choice we have to do this work so now let me talk about some of the lessons that I think are sort of the highlights of what we've learned and that are in the book the first thing I want to say has to do with being clear about what can and can't be done through place-based community change efforts we have to get clarity about the outcomes that we expect and the theory of change that goes along with it and the reason that's an important statement to make is that we now in retrospect realize that too many of them over promised they promised that they could do too much and too short a period of time with too little money and when they don't do it it makes it seem like this is a failure a failed strategy when in fact what we really need is some honest discussion about what can and can't be done through place-based work what kinds of alliances they need to build have realistic assumptions about the outcomes the timeframes the levels of investment and so on and make sure that we're that we're making distinctions between putting several good programs into place in a particular neighborhood versus an initiative that is externally sponsored by it's a a government or by a foundation with us with a start and end time and Anna fixed amount of money versus what is community change which is long-term changes in the community conditions that is just as an example of getting so a need for clarity because we confused of those things all the time in particular we confuse a lot about the role in value of the community building dimensions of the work now the community building dimensions as I said earlier is leadership development social capital development organizational capacity building community civic engagement and community Civic capacity that is defined so differently across this field and so what is one initiative or one organizations deep community engagement is another locations occasional community consultation for some buy-in and that's a big range and it is unresolved so far in this field because we are willing to just use terms like community building and say oh we know what that means and the thing is that it means it we also need to be clear about it because it might mean different things for different kinds of outcomes if you want employment outcomes for example building social connections within the neighborhood may not be the right thing it's about building connections between the worker and the employer who might be outside the neighborhood whereas if you want neighborhood safety as Robert Sampson has told us you do need to have some kind of social connections within the neighborhood or if you want to increase Civic capacity that's more an internal social capital connections kind of work and the reason that the final reason why this is very important is because the beginning of a discussion about working in very poor neighborhoods might start say at a foundation board saying we know that this is a very disinvested neighborhood we know that the capacity is low we know that there is no power in this community and so we understand that we must make the first of all a long term commitment and we must make a commitment to connect it to capacity building and community building and that's going to be the first step and then that goes on for year one and then you're too and then you're three and then by about year for they start to say yeah but what's all this community building doing whereas the outcomes where's the beef and so what ends up happening is these investments in community building get judged prematurely or buy it by or by the wrong thing by whether they've produced hard outcomes now we want them to we do believe the community building and producing card outcomes are connected but we have to be clear about the theory the interim outcomes how long it takes and so on all right the third lesson is because these community systems are so complex and because the causes of the problems are so complex we have offered as solution comprehensiveness and comprehensiveness is the solution to the interaction effects of the complexity and what we've found is that comprehensiveness is very hard to implement it's very hard to implement because sometimes it's overwhelming and you can drown under the weight of a comprehensive strategy if you have to do everything or what is more common as things get diffused a little bit of Education here a little bit of housing there a little bit in neighborhood safety here and then you don't get to the dose and the scale that you need to produce the outcomes for the individuals in the neighborhoods that are the targets for this so we need to figure out how to balance an appreciation for complexity and comprehensiveness with the intentionality that's required to produce the outcomes and that's that's a balancing act that we have to be comfortable with and we have to get better at and what that means and what what we talked about and I'm hoping that maybe is the evening goes on Jennifer will help us think about this do we use the term internal alignment because it's being very clear about what outcomes you're going to you're trying to achieve what management structures you have to have in place what programs are going to put into place what and have accountability structures in that and that is a hard thing to do in a multi-faceted effort at the community level it's even harder to do because the kind of change that we're talking about requires lots of actors there are there are very few institutions that are on their own able to do this work by themselves so what we're talking about is getting multiple stakeholders oops sorry about that I'm going to get better at this by the end of this I'll have this down we're talking about Oh hold on one second a lot of stakeholders who have a lot of roles and what ends up happening is that sort of responsibility and authority and accountability becomes diffused across a whole variety of stakeholders and as Bob O'Neill who is a road in our and in his contribution to our book what happens is that it's so diffused that everybody has veto power nobody has the power to say yes and so the question is how you get alignment that is external meaning alignment across partners in between the community and outside side entities so that you have an open process because you need different people to come in and play or different organizations to come in and be a participants at different moments so it's you need that openness but then you need to have to structure in accountability for actual work as time goes on and the thing is that to make that happen in the places that we've looked at there are people or institutions who do functions that are brokering and aligning that do this work as their everyday job they it's a function that requires capacity that requires funding and people need to be doing this in these kinds of multifaceted initiatives and particularly we're going to take we really need this as we look toward now the changing the changing sort of landscape of the field where we see a lot of federal government initiatives coming in thank goodness but also even at the local and state level we see a whole variety of new actors that weren't around in 1990 doing this work in the 1990s when I started in this field and when Jim Gibson was doing this work at the Rockefeller Foundation they were very many of them were led by the national foundations working in local communities now we see a whole different array of foundations joel's from the Wayne foundation MacArthur is behaving very differently in Chicago we'd see a whole array of new foundations we have community development finance institutions that are doing this work and a whole range of new kinds of nonprofit and for-profit developers so managing these relationships is actually a key part of the work and it needs to be recognized as such and funded and then finally there's this on the one hand i'm asking you to have a clear theory of change and be very clear about what kinds of outcomes on the other hand we know that this is an emergent process it's organic its developmental we have to learn as we go so how do you balance both the need for clarity up front and that clear theory of change with an appreciation for the sort of the developmental nature of the work and the answer to that is to have in place high-quality learning and feedback systems that are owned by the people who are doing the work fortunately we have advances in community level data that make this possible but we but we have to think about structuring in continuous learning opportunities and we talk a lot about creating a culture of learning but there are very few organizations that do this well but some of them are up here and can help you think about that so the last thing I want to talk about and I want to just give you a flavor of this it's in the book about sort of what are the challenges going forward there's a lot of discussion about that this is sort of some of them let me just pick up a couple of them one of them is as I was saying earlier we know that regionalism is important to the future of changing conditions in poor communities but how do we really operationalize that more than just attaching an inner city resident to a suburban job how do we really think about operationalizing and making real community to regional linkages or a second challenge is population mobility march turner might be coming here tonight she and she and and Claudia Colton and Brett Theo toes did a did the report on the 22 rounds of survey that making connections up the ante casey Foundation did in their 10 sites 10 or 11 sites and they surveyed the put the families and went back and resurveyed them three years later and fifty percent of the families had changed addresses in three years now we knew there was population mobility in these neighbor it's but I don't think we knew how much and we've certainly not thought about it in terms of what it means in terms of delivery of services thinking about kids and schools kids and families and so on instability of neighborhoods and then another big issue going forward is that these are community level interventions that are trying to counter the structural inequities that exist in our country and that are getting worse and that hasn't changed and we have to figure out how what communities can and can't do and what needs to happen elsewhere there is a chapter that alice o'connor who's sitting over there wrote in a book 15 years ago i think it was called swimming against the tide all of these great community efforts are swimming against this tide that's moving against moving the back downstream so those are just a flavor of some of the challenges before us going forward so the conclusion is that the community change is more than just about putting in co-locating some programs it's not even about initiatives and there's there's a chapter that I would commend to you in though in the book by mark joseph that talks about the dangers of initiatives why the externally imposed initiative with a fixed start and end time and a limited amount of money is expected to turn around a neighborhood and what we've learned about that that if we're really going to take on community change we have to think about it as Tom Byrne says in our book as democratic institution building or is developing strong well-anchored and legitimate community platforms for technical and financial support and that word platforms we've stolen from the list MacArthur work in Chicago they use that word and it seems to capture a lot of what it is that we need to be doing and in order to do it well we need clarity about goals and our theory of change we need intentionality thinking through alignment both internally within the work itself but also aligning the various partners the continuous learning and adaptation and then finally if you really want to think about the systems reformed systems reform work I think one conclusion from this is that we can't expect that it's going to bubble up from good work on the crown that the people who have access to the policies and the Institute solutions that really have that are making the pot that are making the funding decisions and so on that's where the systems reform has to happen and that it's unrealistic to think that people in communities and community efforts can actually can actually provoke that systems level change that systems level change has to happen at a level where there's the access to it so that's the quick summary of what we have in the book I think what I'm going to do now is turn this over to Tom my colleague Tom who is going to facilitate a discussion among our fabulous panelists so thank you very much in keeping with the title of the book we are going to hear from some experienced voices from the field and we're going to pick just three of the many things that we could choose to talk about at length from Anne's presentation and indeed from the book the first theme that I think we'd like some panelists to comment on and by the way we'd like to present all three of these themes and have discussion among the panel and then we'll open it up for discussion from the floor the first theme is getting real about outcomes what in fact have we learned about the right kinds of outcomes the right expectations we should have for community efforts and over what period of time this idea of scale and dose are very key to thinking about how in fact we can get some closer correspondence between aspiration and real experience around outcomes John Burroughs is the leader of very very long-standing and effective community organization in Boston the Dudley Street Neighborhood initiative and I know John in your work you must have come to a point where you I've gained some sense about what are the right outcomes to work on and how should we think about that you want to start us out job sure I'd love to thank you Tom for the question unfortunately too often the question is about the outcome getting real about the outcome and not enough about getting real about the level of funding capacity and timeframe and you know at some point and I think we need to think about what's what's the what's the kind of floor you know don't waste my time if the grant is only X amount because it's probably not use not not useful given what we're trying to get out of this it'd be an interesting different lens to see it from but giving that you know there is an outcomes conversation and given what had just talked about in terms of the over expectation under delivery that we've seen over the years I think for us over the last 27 years what's been important to us is recognizing that different stakeholders are expecting different things from our community and at some point we decided we'd shift from the national conversation and make sure we were focused on the local conversation and that the local expectations and conversation around outcome was going to create more of a sustainable platform for us that in fact that the power structure who we were trying to create relationships with understood that in fact we could deliver on what we were trying to change that we could get a better return on investment and energy and focus on our work and that some of them some of the national players we have been working with come and go and can do it rather easily where some of the local folks some of the local funders are municipal government and some of the other people were in this with us right and so what we started to look at then at the the local level was the fact that the things that matter to them was in fact that we were partner ready that our beer would call on us and send resources our way because you actually didn't want to make changes in neighborhoods like ours because he thought it was the best investment right that when the when the salvation army came to and said oh we've got an opportunity to build community centers around the country and we might want to look at Boston he didn't hesitate he said call John barrows I ds9 and for us that kind of outcome that says that we can run process effectively and we can be engaged in civil discourse in a way that looks at zoning looks at planning and some other things for us is a real is a real of the other one locally that I think is important for us is we continue to produce leadership out of that neighborhood at this point we've got three straight state reps got a city councillor you know the mayor thinks that we can take his job you know that our sheriff and so so that so the the hero story or the or the or the leadership development stories out of our neighbor are also important outcomes and then I think on a national level because I know I've talked too much already but that the Promise Neighborhoods framing of educational outcomes for children presents a very compelling set of outcomes that we've interpreted our neighborhood as if we can find the most dependent part of our community people who live in our community and we can improve our lives then it stands to we stand to believe that we then have improved the whole system so if the children are the most dependent part of our community and we can draw out that the relationships that they're depending on and then impact those relationships so you would have parents and family concerned adults you would have local businesses local programming local services and if we can say we can do enough around the child to improve their academic outcome that's a pretty for pretty compelling for us system to look at and our neighborhood to say then our then we think that the ecology in our neighborhood around support would be stronger and we think we could we think we could actually sell that at the national level in a way that we haven't been able to with other other ways of looking at our initiative thank you Elena I want to ask you Elena is currently a program officer at the MacArthur Foundation but previously served as the deputy of the partnership for new communities in Chicago which was a funder collaborative time limited to help the Chicago Housing Authority's plan for transformation so you have both the kind of administrative in a program officer point of view and I think you may be in a position to interpret how it is that this platform idea brought to life and made kind of living owned by the neighborhood could actually help with this question of focus and generating real outcomes yeah well I think you know what Mayor Menino called investment ready is what we sort of at the partnership as a very small fun constrained entity that had been charged with a very ambitious set of goals it we saw the same thing we looked you know we had several neighborhoods when he wanted to work and we wanted to make some progress on Neighborhood Development Goals and as an outsider you're looking for organization you're looking for a plan in place you're looking for the buy-in and sort of incredible buying of a lot of stakeholders and we found that platform and that you know something to build on in the quad communities Development Corporation which is one of these CDC's that is a partner in the local initiative support corporations new communities program and they had been working in the quad communities for a couple of years had gone through a comprehensive quality of life planning process had great staff in place and they were demonstrating that they had a track record for getting projects done and so when you're a small foundation or when you're an outsider foundation looking to make impact in a place it was very important to have that credibility and so sort of you knew it when you saw it but I think now that lunch is you know as a funder now stepping into the funder seat in a different way we have to hold ourselves very accountable to demonstrating that you can quantify and measure what that platform is and I think we can bring all of us that kind of discipline in that expectation of discipline to measuring the platform or the what does it mean to be investment ready because I think there are ways of doing it it's there's a response essay it's a lanoka gyuki's response essay and invoices where he points out there is a whole field of management literature and what we've expected of these neighborhood organizations is that they're just doing the process or just doing the process is just happening we want outcomes we want the products but I think it's you know we have to pay attention to how we're producing it and make sure that we're funding effective production mechanisms I think again you do know what when you see it but I think drawing those lessons out about what makes good management and good documentation of process and good communication all of those things you know add up to something I think we need to be measuring it not just not just as an interim outcome but as the product of something right would anybody else in the panel like to weigh in on this question of getting real about outcomes Jennifer I would be glad to I I thought what deadly straight did was really pioneering and I you know I think some of the folks like Dudley and some of the early Casey initiative work or Abyssinia CDC some of those folks that when we're all standing on the learnings right that that those guys had to live through and you didn't mention this John but I think one of the reason I mean I would only hypothesize that one of the reasons that after 27 years you're still really strong and at it also has to do with what i would call who decides what the outcome is matters right and I think typically its government or foundations in the old model that would come in and say you know community we want you to change in these ways without seeing themselves as part of that kind of ecosystem change I think in the Dudley model what was so powerful for those of us who followed in the field was the the community voice and I'm having resident step forward and say here's here's the issues of common concern that we want to put forward and here's how we're going to measure success there's a woman in our neighborhood who said her group her her Mexican grandmother always uses this line don't do about me without me I think there's a really powerful lesson in that thank you that I'm first of all good evening everybody it's a real treat to be here and big thank you and congrats to 2n and all the team for just a wonderful I think of very very timely reporting fence again it's a treat to be here you know I think some of this these themes will run together in a way that you have to do is following sequence is nice too because when we talk about accountability and learning a question of accountability for what and what's actually achievable and how do we ensure an honest conversation about that's enormously important I'll pick up on just one thread of the exchange so far and that is things like leadership development you know as opposed to affordable housing in ism or jobs created or these other cans now they're all important in different ways this folks in this room you know very well I would say that you know it remains from my perspective and this includes things like going to make the case to a congress that is to say the least challenging to work with these days um it includes things like taking the quote-unquote soft outcomes like leadership development or things that may contribute to Pacific capacity and making them tangible enough for people that you can influence decision making and a few people in room have heard me tell this story i'll give a very quick version some years back when I spent time in India as part of a project on capacity in different parts of the world one of the things I will never forget is interviewing the vice president of a very fast-growing Indian Bank essentially about the question why would you guys partner with slum dwellers what's in it for you why do you do it what exactly do you gain from it and to boil it all down these guys have figured out in the language of project finance how working with capable organizations at the grassroots level lowered their execution risk in tangible ways that matter now you don't always get moments like that or a financial calculus that is still everything but I think these kinds of things and continuing at the effort of making it tangible enough right is it almost the important and in the spirit of transition to the next themes it's a good lead into the next theme I'd like to ask the panel to weigh in on and that's the theme of alignment both within the community among the different players in this very complicated situation dynamic as well as complicated and also the alignment between the community and outside forces it's not so easy to figure out how one navigates and and how one learns from good examples of effective alignment so that you can actually improve your own practice which is a kind of jump or almost leap of faith sometimes Raphael would you start us out on this theme of alignment I know you've thought about it within the federal government but you also have at least one maybe several former lives where you thought about it and the ground is a practitioner so sure I want to echo Zeb's thank you for invitation when I thought about the the question of the issue of alignment that what what I kept coming back to is the question of what do you need one of the pieces that you need to have in place if you're going to have these sorts of efforts initiatives programs transformations actually be effective and and there are really a couple of categories you have the hard resource that John talked about you need the capital you need the investment you need to the people on the ground that have technical skills and then there's a whole host of soft things shared vision to an understanding of what a problem is information about what your options are to make a difference of honesty and openness and a self-awareness respect between the partners and a real trust that you know the partners are going to be there two years later four years later fibers I come from an academic environment where you know universities will pop in during the late month deal and they're not around anymore all of those sorts of experiences shape what you can and can't do and the challenge of place based policy is really that in every place the mix of those things and the ability to really succeed in those things is different right and so you have to think about what that context is so when you think about what role should entities play it's a really hard question because depending on the local context different players should be doing different things I think about the federal government so it's been a sobering experience for me to to come to Washington have to think about neighborhoods communities cities and regions in a context where I have like one instrument that's got to work in like six hundred thousand different contexts and and if you think about specifics that we should do to me I feel like one of the common things that we can do is really be a facilitator around information around helping to build peer networks so that that learning collaboration takes place in an effective way and and really try to be an aggregator right in a very specific way then you get to the state and local governments you have you have some vision builders that can happen at both levels I think that this this emphasis on leadership is particularly important and you've got to have leadership at multiple levels you've got to have champions at the local level can be the voice of the community who can be the voice to the community right you've got to have champions at to the governmental level because they're going to be lots of meetings when that local champ is not going to be there and you've got to have sort of a federal awareness that that things are happening things can't happen and I will say the federal government is only so-so on that right so I travel around a lot I get to see a lot of our folks on the ground in field offices and actually get to observe how they engage with their local partners some really good and some I feel like I have better relationships with the local partners right um and that's really hard so so I want it I think all that's important and then the last piece I wanted to say because I'm going on 22 long as well is that the foundational role and the role of sort of nonprofits and others who haven't always played sort of that that other leg to the stool correct well is evolved in ways that are really interesting and important and I think that thinking about and for them to think about how they engage consistently right and and create those partnerships and lemonses is something that I'm interested to watch a land on as we go forward it's a perfect introduction of our next panelist Joe Ratner who is the living third lake who looked at the context of Youngstown Ohio a challenged context to be sure that was undergoing rapid change massive demoralisation if I can say and finds himself now leading a local foundation with modest resources but with already in a kind of present so I think it would be great if you could shed some light on how it is you went about figuring out how you could play a useful role in that mix given the realities of your limited resources and so forth I think we started by trying to create a local alignment and and building bridges and and and believing that everybody was a potential partner so we invested first in the development of leadership and engagement effort called the moaning Valley organizing collaborative which you referenced Tom in your article which in terms of accountability we think has shown great results so you say that you're surprised they have such a great relationship of the city and they are almost a city in exile in that the city has a little capacity they frankly have to do a lot of the city's work but not just do they have a great relationship with the city they have a great relationship with the local Chamber of Commerce I think that's even more surprising who understands that the organizing effort gives us local capacity so instead of being threatened by it they've seized on at the example I'll give you and we're we're getting very clear results in about three years that we've been working on this the organizing collaborative didn't exist we give them very major grant and we expect results so they obviously identified vacant properties in Youngstown not no surprise there as something that they needed to take on and they actually and one of the first tools that we needed was a County Land Bank which there was no state law allowing a County Land Bank except in the Cleveland area so they they worked hard and actually changed the state law so about six months ago the state of Ohio allowed for county landings based very much on Dan kill these model and Flynn but we couldn't do it before now we can do it and then throw a regional alignment they found the money through the fun for economic future some of you know about a Cleveland akron-canton coming together sponsored a contest for government collaboration and the way you got the money was by getting the most votes so again by virtue of having a an engagement effort on the ground we were able to get that funded by that one the most votes in the government collaboration effort because it's a County Land Bank so they've gotten us there's the regional alignment the city of course is very glad to have the the County Land Bank the county the state by passing the the state legislation so we think it's fair to expect results and we are constantly working to have that internal alignment now we're working with the cities and the anchor institutions which I see living cities is represented here we're thrilled to be part of a living cities integration initiative effort as part of a replication of work that's going on in Cleveland so we're very excited about that we see that again as creating alignment on the ground we've been I'll just say this a wrap-up I know you want to keep them moving we're Frost the the national alignment is is is harder and more frustrating and Raphael referred to it that boning valley organizing collaborative has actually gotten a number of meetings with the the Secretary of HUD and Shaun Donovan now there's a couple local residents of Youngstown who thinks it's normal to get a meeting with Shaun Donovan because they've had several don't yeah so that we've been able to get those meetings and have that dialogue and we had Mercedes Marquez and to Youngstown recently and have been talking a lot with with mr. Simms at HUD so have begun to create that relationship but we did really badly with Neighborhood Stabilization money and we feel that neighborhood stabilization was set up for us to fail it was about the coast from our point of view and even to the extent with in Ohio it was set up to benefit the three C's cleveland columbus and cincinnati who are much bigger and have much more power so the city of columbus which has a an abandonment foreclosure problem two or three times the size of youngstown got 30 times as much money as we did because we can't compete with them because oh and the Neighborhood Stabilization round two we didn't get any but we're not better you're busy because so aligning with the federal piece has been really hard because of the local context and again a programs which you talked about one size fits all and you're struggling with that and and we're struggling with that too from the other end and the other thing and I know I've been called blunt recently and and and yes and a provocative but the aligning with the national foundations is even harder and from our point of view and they're fickle and with all due respect everyone in the room they're fickle and they're opaque and they're too political and and so they were very much in flyover territory I mean Cleveland a little less so for them but Youngstown and we're second-tier cities so we really struggle to get their attention much less to get their money so so the line with the national institutions is much more difficult okay someone else like to weigh in on the alignment issue it's ripples through all aspects of this work either the internal or external alignment question I might just add that it's a continual process it's so interesting you can start out as a kind of key partner Keef under and an initiative or a project or right or just try not to use initiative no no that you can use just think about what you mean when you say long as there's no time limit at the end it's okay exactly win supporting comprehensive community development work yeah um and supporting the evaluation of network it's you really have to be intentional about supporting that ongoing dialogue when you're wrestling with complicated issues and questions it's not that you set your theory of change in the beginning and then you update it at the you know right interim report it really has to be a fluid well-documented process and I think you know it doesn't those are easy things it seems like to do but it's actually hard in practice to hold yourselves really accountable to you know creating memos after meetings and making sure that everybody gets those memos and it sounds like a small thing and it just ends up not being a small thing in many instances is because you're getting clarity about language expectations and you know when you're using words like a platform for example well you really have to break that down all right what does that mean two different it's it's continuous adaptation just continuing one of the measures that I always look for when I visit a local group as to whether there's alignment is whether people can describe what others role is uh-huh accurately right and maybe even what they could do in addition to what they're currently doing because gradually alignment is also about knowing the potential and the limits of your partners which is part of working knowledge to get real alignment I just want to say it's gonna be really difficult for me to take initiative outside of God is your neighbor initiative you want after a shorter name for your organization but I want to recognize I think I want to happen with Rafael said about the soft part of this the soft skills trust the sense that we actually understand how to communicate with one another is something that's really difficult we think about investment ready then I continue to struggle with from a neighborly perspective the community perspective and it's just refreshing to see who's in government now who I'm talking to them yeah it's like so 20 years later we've grown some capacity on the ground but who making some of the decisions positive decisions have changed right the conversation with Sam Briggs is very different today because there is a level of trust there's there are nuances to the conversation that I don't have to explain right it's an understand that's different that's why I do think that we are growing a cadre of leadership of policy makers in the country that in fact is community there's investor ready communities but is our country becoming more community ready it's good could the investments in community now have more effectiveness because that I think it's an interesting way to look at right so have were you trying to jump in here I was a two quick notes one building on lanus point my perennial concern is a sometime educators the skill set to and they're all sorts of human resource opportunities of this it gets back to John's point about who you deal with half of HUD roughly is eligible for retirement a number of the folks in that agency signed up when it was the place to be to change the world that was their value proposition they went in 60s and 70s and each of them has a story you know but they will be departing there is a renewal opportunity right and Hut is one right of a thousand different examples of the same sort of story but what do you recruit for how do you develop your people it's both inside of organizations it's a challenge to the Academy as well right soft skills and hard scale is quite different to teach sometimes difficult to name I I think John is right I think I'm seeing the same thing I'm certainly working from my little corner of the world to up the community literacy if you will and it's it's a real challenge you say things like place-based and the almost instinctive reaction or one of them in the federal government is all you're talking about another empowerment zone kind of a thing I mean that the fixation is you're about to pick them another special Club right of 12 places and shower them with love and everyone else will be out in the cold in other words you're going to target you can earmark you're going to something that's one of the insects with the challenge on a bunch of levels but it's my age okay thank you let's move on to the third theme that we'd like some panel discussion on and then we'll open it up to the floor the third theme is worth thinking about is accountability and building in this culture of learning this culture of results that seem so key to getting some real progress here it's easier said than done and getting specific examples of how it works and how it's fine tuned how it's grown I think we have some experience on the panel to help us with Jennifer could you describe how you struggled with that in San Diego and I think I think you guys have hit hit it on this book in the sense of these are the big conundrums right of the next phase of our work I think this alignment issue is more than an ocean when you're working with brown fields and toxic waterways and poor off ramps of interstates and floodplains and trying to align state federal and local and community resources I think is probably the the next big learning for us we certainly started our work on the the theory that people had to own their own change that you really have to have large scale civic action of people stepping out of their homes tackling the issues of common concern in partner in these larger partnerships and to have a really powerful voice in it and i took this quote from the book i was really moved by it that we need new ways of being strategic when we are working in a complex adaptive system we we need new ways of managing the work when we have to interact with so many actors we need new forms of accountability when we are innovator on when we are innovative and try unproven strategies and I think that that very often and i think the outcomes and the accountability parts are linked that when they're really pre prescribed there there is a tendency to kill the flexibility and freedom of people to truly grapple and innovate on the ground and we've seen such extraordinary and reflects situation yeah you're quoted in the book by the way as needing to rethink this kind of framework every three years which is a little different than picking a theory of change and staying with it until you go over the cliff well actually really close to our theory of change we have a very tight theory and a very very solid set of values the comp the complexity is always managing to that value set right and organizing yourself to to implement to those values I think you were hitting on that as a really really important point in terms of how we all learn to partner in a line one of the problems that I'll oversimplify this forever for this discussion but you know you've got a situation at our neighborhood levels really were there they've been nickel they've been the markets haven't worked and there's been a failure of government in those situations to start with right so government doesn't necessarily own the full accountability for coming to the table involving that you have foundations who very largely were outside the situation trying to hold nonprofits accountable for those outcomes but not seeing ourselves as part of that ecosystem of change you've got the resident players who largely feel disempowered and don't believe that changes even possible or that it should be the government that comes in and solves it then you've got tell you tend out there the poor nonprofit in the middle of all of this trying to be accountable who feels responsible and has the weight of the responsibility but in some ways doesn't deeply feel the ownership of it because it's been pre prescribed by somebody upstream so you know we we do think that in this next generation of work that we all grapple with that we need to we need to be in that deeper discussion about roles and how we all own our own stuff right in in that and hold ourselves accountable to not just expecting that change will happen out there but that change will happen with our within our partnerships that will allow that create the innovation to flourish right so learning systems are critical we kid in our organization that if anybody can tell the difference between a failure and learning we like to call them learning because it feels better than the failures but our founder who was gave us a great risk taking set of values loved saying you know that babe ruth struck out 1330 times that allowing things to fail we've seen it time and time again is really where you get the great creativity the great breakthroughs to let people just sit there and look at it and grapple with it has really led to these really extraordinary breakthroughs and it gives people a very strong sense of ownership right and that's I think ultimately how change happens and how deep accountability for the change process occurs right we have had to tie all the players right together we've had to create forums where people have felt safe enough to reflect on what's really happening yes we also had from a management point of view tie the development functions to the community organizing functions to the capacity-building functions into the grant-making functions and any other kind of investment and PRI strategies so that you you can't allow the developer to take off without the community builders you've got two different languages two different sets of pace and dynamics and in and it's created a very rich learning experience you can't just say oh developers the enemy because then you have to look across the table go with the enemy is us right and how do we need to change our own internal policies our own internal way of thinking to be able to be relevant to community so sorry I just want to make a really quick comment to me that is that if there's what one of the Nuggets is that for Dudley Street and Jacobs that I think they're models about is that the strategies are aligned so in all the strategies are aligned so internally internally yes because they're so often that people aren't thinking and I think that there are huge pieces that aren't them and aren't even thinking about aligning room so it is aligning every one of those strategies and keeping them all moving forward together and keeping all those players talking to to each other and creating a venue so that they see that we're in this together and that alignment I mean that's what makes these comprehensive projects more than the sum of us you know yeah a cluster of individual projects it's not additive there's this presumption that it's going to be you know exponentially better there is a synergy right and I think we have to be it's at that moment that we have to really hold all of ourselves accountable to how you measure that right that extra but what but I do think that Jennifer hits on an important thing which is I had written this down earlier the notion of risk and uncertainty and that you know everything you try is not going to work right and what does that mean for accountability and and what are we accountable for and two and we often don't articulate that the possibility of failure is not something awful when I introduced at the beginning and so you have to think about how you're going to manage that and it really gets back to sort of the first area i'm a we're coming full circle but you know what are the outcomes that we want to have people think about right now what about what's the ambition that we have and that we're trying to chase it's a real challenge because right now when the failure happens and it will happen at some point you've got to be able to manage that and make sure everyone when you fall down you get back up again and that that's you've got to be managing to that as well part of the capacity I think of managing that is one thing we're working on is how do we have our own research our own analysis our own evaluation capacity right on the ground as bubbly street as the initiatives communities we think about what capacities unique ability to build you know connection and we chose those performance management we need to be able to say okay the funders are looking at d set of things but we think these things are really rich learnings quick little quickly let's do some data gathering let's do some surveying let's do even though they're not there with us because there's there's a set of rich learnings that have passed us by yeah and anyone as I look back the past two decades I'm like oh if we only had you know really gathered that data at that point and then looked at years later what happened to those families and have them tell that story and so one of the things that I know we're committed to down on the ground you know Jeffrey cameras my heroes right is and he tells stories about people who wanted to talk about his data and he said hold on a second you know that's our story and we're going to tell you about how that stole so it's done in an empowering framework that it's done in a way that we move forward together and it's not you know something that makes us feel bad about ourselves and so it would be interesting if at the front end then we then embedded risk management right in it internally right I said it didn't have to come from policymakers but I have to come because we really want to improve right yeah I mean there's so many really rich themes here i just wanted to jump on a couple of them for a moment number one it is quite something john to work with planners or planning students for example around the world by the way not just Americans on this issue of community knowledge local knowledge what does it mean and not have them retreat into a defensive posture because they fear you're telling them their expertise is worthless their job is simply to become a community scribe sort of sit there and faithfully record and not to have views as opposed to engage in a vibrant sometimes contentious process that can empower people that can challenge them at the same time but that produces learning the other thing I wanted to say for quick SEC is and we have coming full circle always I mean the spirit of measuring games it feels to me like this is a crisper sharper conversation on a number of levels than the conversation we were having ten years ago or further back right it's a field of fields first of all yeah it's always been tricky to sort of define it's been very values driven it's had lots of dilemmas no shortage of them and one of the many reasons i love them to report is that it talks about things like operating strategies specific templates and recipes for getting hard stuff done the other thing that I think we're talking about tonight I mean is where we started terms of the getting real theme and something we're working on within the Obama administration I just wanted to share um accountable for what so what kinds of outcomes you actually trying to produce I'm going to stick on the hard outcomes for just a moment we were talking earlier about the so-called soft that are also hugely important but things like employment especially in this economy right job creation employment rates and the hardest most vital stuff what we're trying for one of the things we're trying for and I'm about to say it much more bluntly then you'll see it any NOFA right that we put out one of our messages really is folks there's no time and no money to spare right countries that sort of a crisis point a turning point please don't try to boil the ocean that's one of the critical messages and it's tricky to convey that's tricky to explain to again Congress and others are much more accustomed to having you sort of paint a picture about a huge need and tremendous merit and justify things that way and to try to flip the conversation to say we actually have built up a body of knowledge about what works in some areas in those areas we want to see a higher road approach and we think it's time to be more demanding in some ways and in other areas frankly we still have a ton of learning to do you know the knowledge is still more nascent the practices are less established right and that's a different it's a different sort of challenge the one other thing I wanted to mention and touched on the dynamism of neighborhoods or the neighborhood turnover neighborhood change dynamic Jim is here from mdrc tonight this is a huge issue in the way for example the jobs plus demonstration was put together and how NDRC and the funder partners and the communities implementing it tried to learn from it and you literally could not understand its impacts unless you tracked people over time including people who moved away you know 17 years ago in the South Bronx that was a community planner of course we were using the language transform neighborhoods that was the ambition the neighborhood turnover was off the charts you could see it playing out and if I had one wish in this domain it's not frankly though I care about that to the kind of formal evaluation in the way you try to design to account for all that change that one wish in the space it would be that people in the field embrace a different mental model and it relates to that whole it relates to the mantra don't try to boil the ocean I mean one of the keys to not doing that not falling in that trap it seems to me is saying you know what they're people who are here who don't plan frankly to be around a long time and I may not be able to change that that may be beyond me I got to think about them in one sort of way there are others who want to be here and they're deeply rooted and I want to make that the very best choice it can be improve their quality of life and I want to by the way see if I can engage them as community assets and be leaders bringing others in and so on and then maybe all kinds of types in between but you would think very different it seems to me about your intervention about how you spend time and so on if you're not saying this is it's completely unknown in the field but I can promise you in the Bronx two years ago it was not something that those on the front lines had at the forefront of their minds they had something that I would characterize as urban village on the brain this is a place that is going to be a wonderful stable place and again to put it may be too bluntly and maybe too harshly it was New York City these were low-rent neighborhoods the neighborhood is serving a function in one of the world's most dynamic most staggering League unequal housing markets and labor markets it got to get real folks you're playing a role in that much bigger machine and you want to think about what that means and about them you know the dynamism of people's lives and the fact that many stream through if you're going to touch them if you're going to reach them if you're going to be able to focus your efforts and actually be able to point to something at the end of the day that you've accomplished no thank you I'd like to open it up now we've uh we're not going to use cards so i will get the mic to people who would like to direct a question please try to make it a question more than a statement and it could be on one of the themes that we've already raised it might be on something else you heard in Ann's presentation or you know it is in the book anybody hi mark told me zawa six degrees of innovation it's a neighborhood driven think tank that works across platforms where nobody makes money because people are much more warm about sharing what they know will work if there's nobody's job on the line here's quick things you talked about President Obama he wants government as a platform for democracy so we're looking at platforms that make that faster and easier for groups of coalition's to identify who should work together rights matchmaking and moving forward looking at maps with real-time assets deficits in other words it's almost like you have a war room pardon me of real-time opportunity right and if you map the people within that you now know the organizations and the track histories who will fit together well and then the Foundation's will know how to work as coalition's themselves and fund that okay do you have a question for somebody who else is working on this because if you don't have systems tools it's going to continue to be really hard to spend human time with so I I agree with that completely and my group has actually taken a leadership role actually though suggest to some of this we are we've convened a bunch of interagency working groups that are really oriented toward building collaborative and comprehensive systems so communities can tell what assets they have on the ground this is this is critical and it actually runs to just about every one of our programs as we're moving forward our sustainable communities we've asked the the area's to tell us and document where they're where they're going to be a hood as a as an agency and we you know the Senate Secretary has instructed me weird to be the first geo enabled agency in the federal government are really to help places see themselves as places with the things that they have on the ground visual so they can start to make the decisions the other thing I did want to say is that I think you're absolutely right in another regard in that one of our biggest challenges is really the diversity of capacity and systems at the local level so it is particularly in localities it is often virtually impossible for them to tell you what's going on let alone for you to find out what's going on and as long as we're in an environment where it's to some extent serendipity whether you can tell what's going on it's hard to imagine this getting to scale in a significant way so we've got to find venues and ways to invest in that almost invisible infrastructure it gets back to what are we measuring one of the outcomes that would be desirable right um yeah so that we can then leverage that and really start to take big leaps in the future it also it also gets to the point of learning right it at this point we we took an inventory in the community we thought one of us to take care 14 different major items everything from you know access to technology in the community to health and firemen right answer oh we can't work on an Israeli so he said to herself Inc systemically about what the drivers are right you work on safety what do you work on education employment there's certain things that drive certain outcomes right so you don't so the community might want you to look at those things and pay attention to them but you've got to have a systems type of conversation you got to know what's going on it talks to you about gas talks about need talks about opportunities where you invest maybe at certain times and without those kind of tools as you're making changes in the middle are there new sets of information of the context changes around you you kind of get lost in your thinking right unless you can hold it have something we're working on a youth violence you systems violence project where we actually somebody has built according to the gangsters in the neighborhood and youth and people who are pulling triggers how you get any gangs and out of gangs right so there is a story it tells you hear the decision I made to get into a gang here's what happened in my life here is when i became a shooter in a gang here's why i didn't become a shooter in the gang here's why I became a shooter outside of an organized gang just all of these major platforms and the interventions I got a min and the interventions that got some of these folks out so we did interviews interviews interviews focus confusion now we've got a system on a computer that pulls a lever and says if police if the police department conducts a sweep here's what we think will happen Yeah right giving all of the chambers of events based on how people make decisions in there is a foundation program that intervention that we now have more jobs here's what we think happens if there is a combination of the two we think this will happen and so this stuff is very tricky so not only we need to know what's happening but we need to think about relationships yes given increases or decreases and getting to consider non programmatic solutions because some of those kids stopped because of connections to grow friends peers employers and not necessarily juvenile offender programs some of which are effective that's the program centric quality of a lot of problem solving limits our sense of options another question out here possibly yes Christine so I've had a question John you mentioned about leadership and the leadership pipeline and wow you know now your elected officials among your alums sort it sounds like right so one of the things and I'm just new at Jacob since June so I don't know chapter and verse just chapter or just right um but we really try and stay away for the history of the organization you've stayed around away from the word leadership we try to stay away from the word governance to let it just happen and I'm interested in is there a point at which you know especially cuz we're going to be Sun setting the foundation and we're going to be turning over something sets and ideas there is governance that will happen things will have to be governed or whatever the word is so I'm just kind of interested in how you in the natural leaders emerged but what about the non-natural leaders its kind interested in that so we we speak heavily about governance we talk about leadership all the time if you assume that needs to be governance at the end should it happen yesterday because governance is not easy very complex beasts to think about local governing and to think about building the capacity for people to work together so they can govern in a collective sense so our governance structure has a racial overlay where we have because of our census numbers of population for African American seats for white seats predominantly Irish and Italian old guard and the only seven percent of our neighborhood for Cape Verdean sees West African immigrants for Latino seats predominantly a dominican and puerto rican because that's how the neighborhood saw leadership and the biggest question for them in knowing that they were involved was that were there was someone from their ethnic group at the table right then we brought in the other stakeholders the local stakeholders and made a decision that we didn't want any kind of government officials at the table so there's it has many ways to think about leadership and governance I would say start now and then leave them a huge endowment so they can make decisions in but the question of leadership where we when we decided that education outcome was going to be important to how we're going to systemically look at our neighborhood and think about the child is the most dependent part of that system and how we improve all the system all the support networks around we said okay well we think we're going to sit on the school committee and we talked to the mayor and I got a point to the school committee that's leadership when you decide that you want to be able to have a voice at a certain table and you decide that you can actually look at the people around you in your neighborhood that's supposed to be a devastating neighborhood poor neighborhood likely to be incarcerated neighborhood and say here are the leaders that we're working with we need to put you in this position me to put you in a position to put you in a position so you can affect the collective plan of this neighborhood and be a serving so that shared vision to that shared set of values to that shared plan for us is how we want to work with our leaders when we decided that we wanted to state to state legislators to time a different conversation about some of these policies we said we're running some folks who's stepping up right yeah just just a comment because we were very intentional i would say about leadership development we have tried to stay away from the word and i think partly because there is the question about who anoints the leaders right and when we first started we were coming off some of the early research of the cci field which you talked about anna lot in the book with lead agencies and you if i would have three people at my table for conversation all three of them would call me afterwards and complain about the other two and they don't trust a you know ready so you start aligning with people who see themselves as the leader of the self-appointed leader or even appointed leaders you you it's very complicated when you're starting out and we felt that it was a better entry to to do very open process everybody's at the table huge teams and and to try to be very careful about not appearing to anoint leadership because of some role that that we were in that we were going to work as neighbors and allow that to naturally emerged that now it's different because we have this kind of meta net of networks with nine cultural groups and nine other kind of networks within the note within the neighborhood community networks and they are now looking at being a primary feeder system for leadership training so there you be accountable to your Somali or Sudanese or Samoan community if you're in that leadership training to take that back and lead and in the discussions more on collaborative leadership right not organizational leadership and so that's that's kind of the next frame that we're really trying to figure out think deeply about for the next phase of this mhm we hope you want to other I like what I heard and I don't know if this is an alternative viewpoint or sort of supports it but I think along with intentionality I think you it's really important to create an incredible system that is constantly fermenting and changing and allowing paths to leadership so I think it is about constantly so for us it's part of its it's a small Grants Program which in which the committee members decide who gets the grants and the committee rotates all the time so constant so that the pathways to leadership don't get blocked or people don't kind of hold on to them and those are the leaders and we're not so constantly creating this opportunity for ferment and new leadership and as we know there's such incredible transients in the in the neighborhoods that that it's important that though that that we don't block things up because that's not how the neighbor is neighborhoods are but again allowing a a let a thousand flowers bloom and constantly creating that field where all those flowers can bloom we have a last question in the room we do have time for smoothing and visiting and actually conversation and following the panel Jim how you see the lessons from this research how do you see the lessons from this exploration applying to choice neighborhoods and promise neighborhoods I guess I'd address that to anyone on the panel familiar with those programs I think they're great a couple thoughts one we've got some specific challenges when it comes to alignment even within the so-called federal family there's a lot of whale in this administration there's a lot of energy being invested by very capable very very good people but you're working in a an area where on one hand again Congress is not neatly organized to facilitate this point number one point number two I think it's a very interesting fiscal and political and economic moment on one hand it's a moment wherein you can say things like let's get real you know we don't have capacity time money to spare it can be insistent as that kind of leveraging the moment for reform on the other hand you know desperate times also make people hunker down and defend territory and focus on holding on to what they've got and we also see that dynamic I'm not trying to characterize it as strictly parochial there's a lot of fear a lot of anxiety and it gets to again some of the tensions between being demanding setting a high bar but trying to work with people in that space and you know being inclusive allocating resources more broadly saying that everybody has something to plug their gaps with and boy are there a lot of gaps to go around so those are some of the things Jim that are tricky and all this as to the substance of the hope if you could sort of abstract away from those governance questions and some of the difficulties of actually resourcing across silos and those other things that we hope to do I'd say it's quite striking actually you can find that when you look at a program meant to revitalize neighborhoods that has a particular focus in history to it such as hope 6 at HUD and you try to create an evolution if not a revolution in that in that program you try to really figure out what you've learned and build on it it's incredibly easy i find to spend time dealing with a lot of the things that are collateral to the core of the intervention so to work on the problems of dislocation and all the things that the intervention does to sort of stir things up and that's important for one set of reasons and there's been a lot of bitter battles over those things as you know in this and many other programs aimed at aimed at the pool and a disadvantaged neighborhoods over the years but it's incredibly easy in that picture actually forget this the simple things at the core what precisely are we trying to achieve or being honest with ourselves about whether it's doable surely we don't want to hardwire certain things into into legislation that would make it very hard to adapt and to learn but when it comes time to actually you know preparing a kind of call for send us your best stuff here's what we can look at what's the guidance we're going to give up its the other funders here we're talking about it tonight and evaluators and others in the room no the problem very well we're 30,000 feet up and to try to aggregate these lessons and think about where you want to prod where you want to insist where you want to leave some room to learn some things because they're going to be surprises that's i would say an ongoing challenge but Raffaello should say what you things too yeah so i guess a couple of things strike me one is so if where we started about around the expectations but what can happen tomorrow what can happen in two years what can happen in five years and this notion of over-promising versus and delivering and making sure that you calibrate those things and as we look to our candidates making sure that we have some conversations early on about you know some of the risks and pitfall that we have in place I think there's some real nuggets to learn from here you know we were at the Promise Neighborhoods thing yesterday and another thing that I that that struck me was the notion of a network and very early on trying to establish these networks so that these learning opportunities arise so that lessons actually transmitted from one organization to another and really the so that we start to get to a place where people don't feel like they have to grope in the dark and can actually work together and and the last thing is probably not the best thing for me to close on but I think there is real value in entering into these things sober and and really understanding what the limitations of these opportunity programs can be while at the same time aspiring to the opportunities when the first things I wrote down when I when I was listening to you and was you know there is this inherent tension between incrementalism and complete up transfer transformative optimism and you need to have some of both really and we need to figure out how we do that in an effective way so that people don't get discouraged so that people don't give up and that we don't leave places actually in worse condition than when we started and we have lots of examples of having done that the wrong way I think that you know the types of projects that that you guys studied in the book give us a host of rich examples of of information that we should know to make sure that doesn't happen as you move forward and and so I I would thank you again for doing this I had no hand in funding it or anything like that but but I do think that it does give us a lot of information that that will as we read it and reread it and reread it even learn new lessons that will help us be more effective in these things and especially talk it through as opposed to just reading it I think implying it to specific context do you want to say anything before we close we still have half an hour of food and visits no I just want to thank everybody very much for coming tonight I really appreciate you all being here we've learned so much from all of you I think that what zas said about how the conversation now is so much crisper than it was ten years ago it's really really is really really on point and it's because of all of the work that all of you have done that it's so fantastic on the ground and how you keep learning and sharing with us as you go on thank you very much thank you thank you thank you
