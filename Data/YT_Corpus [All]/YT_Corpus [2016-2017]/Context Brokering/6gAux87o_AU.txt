 it obviously you know it's it's it is a highlight for me to be here every week I walked across from the commons again like I used to on a Wednesday my Wednesday has become a thursday so I'm absolutely thrilled again to be here absolutely wonderful can I can I say on that point of format I I think it's I think it's the right thing to do but I have a habit of talking too much and so if i do go over the time were you hold me accountable and sake live it's time for Question Time all right because I will be the timekeeper and I will stop you no less than 10 minutes beforehand the class because I won't hurt interaction yeah I do I don't want the format but I do think the format is a is a good suggestion so on that technical note you know I'm preoccupied today ladies and gentlemen because students on this campus students whom I love and care for and deeply cherish have invited me to sit on a panel this evening and the panel is on a phony topic it it relates to students for justice for Palestine and so I just need to say that and you can imagine the sort of trepidation that I have knowing also that there will be plain clothes policemen present and so forth that I have that sense in my stomach not of butterflies of anticipation which I have coming here which are all wonderful and pleasant you know but a different sense of anticipation nonetheless I am on that panel and if I do seem a little distracted it is only because a part of my brain is already wondering how that discussion will go this evening and I guess if you know me you know kind of how I'm going to come at it because all conflicts are problematic righty-ho thank you i had that on my mind i hope you don't mind me sharing that with you thank you I I gave an introduction last week which was a theoretical overview of the nature of transitions we're done with theory we're going to look at at South Africa de facto that what happened in South Africa we are not going to look at films today but I promise you films from next week onwards I need to put the groundwork in place because the films are strange and I don't want to present you with footage which isn't contextualized I think appropriately and that is that as my task is to do that for you so no phones today but from next week and then one other technical point before I do start which I'd forgotten is there was a suggestion that I make these talking points available to you I would be more than happy to do that I can't make copies for all of you but I can make sure that it is electronically circulated and i'm sure those folk who wanted will find it wherever you do find these papers is that okay i'll give you last week's stuff i'll give you today's and I do indeed have six sets of these things for six discrete discussion sessions so I'll share all of that with you climate f you convey that information to Norma electronically she will post it on the alley website I'll do that everyone here knows how to access the alley website so they can get that information okay awesome I shall do that and and as i mentioned i did have a student callate for me all the video footage of the 87 sunday episodes that were broadcast publicly in south africa and i will put that list on as well it's it's a long list it's about 40 pages worth but if any of you want to see certain snippets at your own leisure time they are thematically listed you can see if there's a theme that interests you and you can certainly watch and decide what you want to watch on that basis I'll share that document as well as all of this with you it seems to me to be germane to and pertinent to the discussion and if any of you wanted to watch that on a laptop or something you could do that by clicking on the link so today what I intend to do is give you a sense of the reality of the time and I want to take us back a little bit into the negotiation process itself in order to understand that I thank you for the analogy in order to understand the birth the birthing process that indeed and I think the analogy is a very episode 1 because and I don't need to tell you the nature of giving birth and certainly in many respects a transitional process and giving birth to a truth and reconciliation commission as you can imagine was no smooth was no smooth thing and so I want to put it I want to place that product if you like that transitional justice product in the context of the process that brought it about the negotiation process itself so we're going to dwell a little bit on the nature of South Africa's negotiated transition I want to talk about the extent to which if at all transitional mechanisms including the question of justice and reparations featured in that process and I want to talk a little bit about the dynamics of the negotiation process so that you understand where the TRC came from so instead of talking about dialectically induced hybrid positions I want to talk about political compromises because that in our language is what we're talking about the nature of the negotiation process was indeed essentially characterized ultimately by compromise was a it was a it was he it was indeed a big compromise that we brokered through that process so so what was on the agenda when we were negotiating what were the kinds of things that we negotiated about when we entered into this process of negotiation well we spoke in the first instance about the nature the political nature of the state should it be a unitary state or should it be a federal type state and in fact that word federal was known as the f-word yeah no one wanted to hear that word on the African National Congress aside and I can go into all the reasons for that in summary mainly because it seemed as though the National Party was hiding away form of apartheid under a federal disposition it wanted to entrench minority rights group rights and and was keen to press forward a federal solution for that reason cam known as the f-word it stopped us talking for a while we avoided the f-word we avoided all expletives certainly in the public domain as best we could and and so federalism unit er ism was one of those power-sharing was another a government of national unity the formation of a government of national unity was another agenda item what kind of Constitution should we have was an agenda item and that led to an interim constitution being produced what kind of bull of human rights should we have that was a discussion point the nature of the economy in the context of nationalism versus capitalism if you put it crudely was a was a point of discussion and a point of contention the nature and role of a future dude judiciary was a was an agenda item all sorts of Ombudsman Independent Electoral Commission's transitional executive governance arrangements and so forth the question of course of elections free and fair democratic elections that was high on our agenda at the time and the fact that there was a high level of violence I'll talk about this in more detail in a moment was an agenda item what though was missing is missing from that list what do you think might be missing from that list pardon freedom of speech would have been part of the Bill of Human Rights discussion how would you feel this is a hint if you were a and I don't say victim a survivor how would you feel if you were a survivor you got it thank you and that was a almost a you know it came right out there it literally did there was no discussion of reparations yeah that's not entirely and exactly right and I'm going to describe to you how this little bit about reparations whilst it wasn't on a formal agenda actually got slipped in right at the end and and and I see I've preempted myself by saying i'll share with you that list of films i've got a note here to tell you that there is that list of films but let me then tell you that that that series that series was broadcast on the South African Broadcasting Corporation's channel it was publicly broadcast also globally but that channel led to 87 snippets if you like and covered the first two years of our commission that's all accessible still online it was produced and presented by an Afrikaner max to priya who covered the TRC in this fashion max an amazing man was also the editor-in-chief of South Africa's Afrikaans newspaper the fryer vehicle at the free weekly paper is what it was called and from an Afrikaner perspective even that name is amazing so this was a guy who got it who understood it and africana who wanted to play a role in making sure that the country heard the story of the TRC his series won the foreign correspondents award for outstanding journalism in 1996 so if you do watch some of this footage it is certainly well done and well worth watching right so so the transition to democracy from this oligarchy from this dictatorial white racist minority regime this was characterized if you like by compromise and concession and and certainly it is true to say that the pursuit of justice in the context of a human rights agenda that was always a central theme of the liberation movements of the movements that were struggling for freedom in South Africa during apartheid so this idea that there should be accountability that there should be justice that there should be some form of reckoning was always a central tenet of the struggle for freedom in South Africa it was never something that was invented post facto after 94 it was always something the African National Congress and other liberation movements felt strongly about but these concerns remained largely of our negotiation table what extent in a febrile environment these issues are insensitive and indeed I protest oh you can just imagine to what extent this was a contestable tirade if you have 25 political parties around the table negotiating a peaceful settlement to a conflict what should we look into exactly what should be looked into how should it be looked into to what end these all depended as much on the personal insights and personal experiences of negotiators in that process as on anything else and ladies and gentlemen one man's freedom fighter one person's freedom fighter was another person's terrorist defenders of law and order for some work instruments of inhumanity and repression wireless you have this situation of the plate and in fact on I'm even thinking about tonight's discussion as I say that all sides all sides the African National Congress the in Carter Freedom Party the pan-african Congress the National Party the conservative alliance all of these parties accused each other of culpability in the atrocities that had happened in the past and indeed for current violence happening in the streets whilst we were negotiating no one was to blame except the other yeah that is literally how it went I am perfect I am completely in the clear and you are the ones who are fermenting you caused all the problems and you're fermenting the violence right now that is exactly how it played out it was a kindergarten and you might think of analogies that's why I think of the one tonight because when you think of some of that bellicose and aggressive rhetoric when you think of the name calling when you think of how unhelpful that is and when I had that experience here then I wonder why we didn't learn from that in 94 and think we're in 2016 and know that name-calling doesn't help it doesn't help we all we all accused each other of culpability and at the same time we denied we excused we obfuscated 'add we ran away from our own roles in history and in the present this was a characteristic of this process so I broke down twice before we got it going a third time of course it is true to say that interpretations of responsibility for past violations were challenging how to deal with them understandings of how to deal with those were were challenging at the time notions of morality notions of value notions of principle seem to be so relative and of course relative to one's own position in particular the conflicts of the past were littered with I say victims but survivors of course because they survived those who were lucky enough to survive who would accommodate their interests how would their interests be accommodated in any process indeed ladies and gentlemen was it possible to move forward to even put in place something a constitutional dispensation let's say with a justiciable bill of Human Rights was it possible to do this without some form of reckoning that first took place and of course conversely there were arguments that said that if we put in place some sort of mechanism that digs up the past that holds perpetrators to account we will slide back into that Civil War we were trying to get out of if we put in place a Truth and Reconciliation Commission it will only exacerbate and feel the feeble planet and cause in fact a worse war than the one we were trying to get out of so you had these discussions and debates not at the negotiation table but happening in the political parties and happening in the country whilst we were talking now despite the protestations of a small human rights community and ladies and gentlemen it isn't helpful to actually tar South Africa only as an awful place prior to 94 because they were folk who were rational there were folk who were reasonable there were folk who believed in human rights there was a small group of them they were in the minority which made it all the harder for them of course but even then during the negotiation process the small group of folk who were committed and who always have been committed to human rights protested that this discussion around reparations and reconciliation had essentially been reinforced of the agenda by all the participants all the political participants in the process I know that sounds a bit strange any meaningful examination of what had happened and who was responsible had been really fun stuff the negotiation agenda and whilst you had this ring fencing and suggestion that we wouldn't discuss the stuff in the negotiation process outside in the streets and I promise you next week i will show you some footage also of this because the violence came right into the World Trade Center where we were as I as I as I said the situation was compounded daily by some of the worst levels of violence that South Africa had ever experienced in fact some reports suggest that over 14,000 people were killed in that four year period whilst we negotiated at the table water schizophrenic this is a this is the contradiction that South Africa is and remains whilst we were talking whilst we were brokering a peace settlement we had some of the worst levels of violence ever 14,000 people dead or of course injured and so we see some commentators saying that there was more violence in that period then there had been in the previous 30 30 years under under you know apartheid when there was resistance to in fact apart so so I often describe it as a as a kind of drool face on the one hand you have this peace process we were all in these rooms talking peace and on the other hand you had a bloodbath happening a concurrent bloodbath happening in the streets but here's the question here's the question and for those of you who were in the Mandela lectures you will remember I I questioned the nature of the secrecy that surrounded some of the secret negotiations that Mandela and others were involved in that seemed a precursor to the formal open public negotiation process and is it right to do things in secret and so forth but do you think could it be possible that a peace process might have moved forward had this agenda item not being ring fenced had it not been reinstall for the agenda could it have been possible for us the 25 odd parties that were there to talk about a peaceful process moving forward had we focused on reparation had we focused on reconciliation would we have managed to achieve a peaceful negotiation process yeah so I'm putting that forward as well as all of this other perspective just to give you kind of thinking points about that strange hybridity that I spoke about the strange creature that emerges during transition this weirdness this uncomfortableness this discomfort that you feel when you begin to contemplate some of the reality that we went through in this transition process and begin then also potentially to link it to some of that theory where I suggested that this hybridity is a strange creature and I'm hoping that you might begin to see here some of the emergent strangeness that I'm going to be describing over these weeks that were that we are fortunately together now it is true to say that negotiations and the negotiated process in South Africa confirmed at the time with the legal processes with the legal framework that was in place at that time so we're talking about the legal framework that was in place under the apartheid government because the apartheid government remained in power until to 1994 so our negotiated settlement happened within the framework of the existing apartheid legal framework and in order to begin to sketch the inheritance of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission because this inheritance shaped the way it functioned I want to focus now on a thing known as indemnity indemnity for crimes the government of the day the National Party government of the day in 1990 introduced a first a first act an indemnity act and this indemnity act was designed purposefully to allow African National Congress South African Communist Party and other folk to come into South Africa to sit around the table because they worse they were wanted folk they were wanted people they had they come to South Africa the police would have grabbed them probably the intelligence services and they'd have been tortured legislation amnesty legislation was passed to give these folk in fact temporary amnesty initially so that they could come and sit around a table with the National Party now I know that that was much more a pragmatic thing for the Afrikaner than a than a heartfelt thing because the africana at the time felt that they were inviting the Antichrist to the table and lest you think I'm pretending lest you think that's hyperbole believe me that's how they saw Mandela and others Joe Slovo the leader of the South African Communist Party was heated he was seen as the de facto Antichrist he was an atheist need i say more I actually don't know what his religious views were but that's how he was seeing like a communist must be an atheist so so for them to pass this indemnity legislation and get that far while big deal in 1992 the government of the day the National Party the africana party passed further indemnity legislation this time the indemnity legislation was in stark contrast to that of its predecessor which enabled negotiations to begin to start what did it do and I'll dwell on this in a little more detail in a moment its intention with that legislation and it achieved this was to give immunity to those whom it felt were responsible for human rights violations so it unilaterally introduced indemnity legislation which indemnified a lot of people i'll give you the figures in a moment indemnify them against what they done in the past 1992 yeah so we're building up the backdrop to the to the TRC here I'm sketching the things that the TRC inherited because certainly you might be saying but Clive that that's the remit of the TRC surely surely you're taking away the remit of the TRC here you're pre-empting what it might do that's what happened now let me just say that in in in the wake of an of other other other a number of centuries that were characterized by violence and depression in South Africa the dilemma that the Justice related dilemma is that is this one that that you begin to think about the possibility of comprehensive prosecutions which often more often than not is an impossibility even logistically never mind the cost and we'll talk about costs and logistics and why the TRC was limited to two years and things like that in a while because justice fell at that at that at the feet of cost as much as it did anything else and and certainly you will recognize though that despite the challenge of comprehensive prosecutions you can sense that sweeping amnesties are unjust you can sense that a sweeping a blanket amnesty feels unjust at least I feel that I I don't know i can't speak for you but i certainly feel that a kind of amnesty granted in secret doesn't feel right claims to justice claims the truth claims to reconciliation all of these claims that are made about our Truth and Reconciliation Commission they don't rest on abstract or theoretical claims they rest on the realities I'm describing they rest ladies and gentlemen on what actually happened and that's why it's important for me also to portray what happened before it came into being in the context of things that relate directly to its remit and certainly a large part of its inheritance relates to the way in which amnesty was handled during that negotiated transition to democracy and so any claims to success any claims to efficacy any claims to impact that we make as we talk about the erc moving forward have to also include the TRC's relations with other provisions that impact on it concerning the granting of indemnities immunities releases from prison and pardons it has to take into account legal cases as granted from time to time during this transitional negotiation process and certainly the social contract that was brokered which is a thing political parties broker as part of a negotiation process which in the South African case combined if you like the promise of amnesty on the one hand with the seeming threat of prosecution on the other all of this needs to be taken into account when we begin to think about why the TRC what it did what it did and how good was it at doing what it ultimately did and when we get to the contemporary perspective at the end and we look at some of the criticisms we need to understand some of those criticisms in the in this context so it is fair to say i think i think it is fair to say in fact i would say that it is fair to say that the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission entered an arima that was already occupied certainly by a series of amnesty provisions it didn't come in de novo it didn't come in tabula rasa it didn't come in with a blank piece of paper it inherited certain amnesties that had happened and let me tell you because I want to just want to for your benefit I hope dwelling in a little bit more detail on only on what those amnesties actually were just want to describe them a little bit so that we understand what they were and what their implications were let me say that in relation to all of these except the amnesties which were granted by the TRC itself all of these were surrounded by a lack of transparency a lack of accountability and certainly and I want to talk about a second amnesty you didn't think I'd be finished with amnesty did you you don't think the National Party would stop did you and it wasn't only the National Party in fact the picture becomes more complicated as we move forward all of these amnesty Relations Act sorry were surrounded by a lack of transparency and accountability so what would he acts let's have a quick look at the acts what were the acts that governed amnesty so the first one was the indemnity act number 35 of 1990 this one was designed and it had an altruistic motive it's a great act I liked it at the time it's fantastic although we should never needed to exist and that folk could have freely been in South Africa but that's another matter it was designed to facilitate the negotiation process it granted temporary immunity or indeed permanent indemnity in some instances for political exiles against prosecution when they return then to South Africa from wherever they were in Europe or in Africa in exile yeah and and it also in fact made release then for it made provision for the release of political prisoners who were languishing in jails at the time and enabled them of course then to become negotiators the second act was known as the further indemnity Act the further indemnity act number 151 of 1992 and this was passed unilaterally by the National Party and it granted indemnity to state offenders and made provision for secrecy regarding the actions for which indemnity was granted so we don't know we don't know what they did that's the law the law says we won't know what they did there is an academic greedy he's he writes so well and if any of you want to read a book about our transition I would recommend Paul Reedy he wrote in 2010 and I quote from his book on the South African truth commission on page 96 he describes this act ladies and gentlemen as an amnesty of the blanket and quickfire forgetting variety so he describes that he tells us that it ensured that up to 3,500 members of the security forces and the cabinet he says that we're secretly indemnified in the run-up to the elections in 1994 I don't like it one bit and I'm happy to say that on that camera the legality of this has been politically disputed it it's not as though we just accepted that they were folk who didn't like it of course yeah I'm sure you don't like it but the indemnity that were granted unilaterally by the national party at this time have been respected by the newly emerged at that time democratically elected government they've respected that now if I'm struggling with that how hard must that be to do how hard must it be to do that to say I will never know when we know that one of the key features characteristics of the TRC was that folk in many instances said you know I don't need revenge I don't need money I don't need reparations I just want to know what happened to my loved ones just please tell me they begged for the bones they begged if they couldn't find the bones to find the river or to find the dumping ground or whatever we know that that was a central feature of many participants desire yet yeah we have the secrecy and we have an honorable post dictatorship government led by Mandela who says fine I respect that we respect that we respect that legal process that happened so apartheid-era deals were being negotiated not only during the negotiation process but even during the TRC process and when I get to that messy business then yeah you'll begin to see how complicated all of this actually was and so greedy places the impact of these acts the cumulative impact of these these acts and secret agreements in perspective and he suggests that you ready for these figures I don't know if I ever like to read them between 40,000 and 21,000 now we don't know of course between 30,000 and 21,000 people received amnesty how many received MST during the TRC process 1167 and that was those that received secret amnesty through the conditional amnesty process by the way there was a conditional amnesty process attached to the functioning we'll still get to how it worked but I'm just giving you a sense of the smoked at this point of proportionality yeah that's a lot of people doing a lot of bad things that we don't know anything about right so I do I remind myself here that we will explore this messiness later at this point I just want to give you the picture in relation to Amnesty because I'm trying to give you a sense of the climate of the time the background and as I say a sense of this negotiation this political compromise the nature of this political compromise of which secret amnesty you can say was a part was embedded in this question of compromise it was part of the inheritance of the TRC and it created the environment within which the TRC needed to set up its operations violence levels during this negotiated transition were high they were as high as the stakes the government during this time constantly claimed that it was committed to routing out this behavior that it knew nothing about this politically violent politically motivated violence that it knew nothing about but certainly it's in action spoke volumes at the time as in action often does silence often does during this time its security forces were routinely and often accused of either direct or indirect complicity in this illness in this spike of four years worth of violence and certainly the vast majority of South Africans during this process looked upon the minority government at that time with a mixture of fear content and loathing because of all these emergent views on their complicity in fermenting this violence in our streets the government in order to distance itself and expunge itself and prove that it wasn't part of the setup to judicial Commission's of inquiry not one but two certainly during the early stages of the negotiation process right at the beginning you we had a thing known as the harmless Commission and it was it was established to probe allegations of police and military hit squad complicity and activity now its findings insofar as it was able to put them into the public domain and it was are a damning indictment of the criminal justice system up to that up to that point and and and from my perspective it remains a classic example of a well-staged and well-managed cover-up it had a successor and you may recognize the name it was known as the Goldstone commission so some of you may know Richard be aware of Judge Richard Goldstone and his work also internationally was set up in 1991 a year after this and it began to prize some of the lid off this cover up and began to surface some of the security force involvement in what was known as dirty tricks certainly towards the end of its tenure as a commission but none of neither of these Commission's did much by way of either surfacing the truth as would later emerged in the TRC and and certainly didn't help to stop the violence and the bloodletting in the streets now during the negotiation process so 1992 1994 the African National Congress had already begun to signal its commitment to probing accountability for its own past violations and had begun in fact to hold its own Commission's of inquiry if you want to call them that especially into some of the abusive things that occurred in some of its holding camps there was one known as Quattro in Angola which was particularly problematic from a human rights perspective where the African National Congress had as it then said at the TRC and you can watch it online if you like said that there were human rights abuses that it had perpetrated during the struggle to despite the limitations because of course that was it looking at itself and there's always a problem with that you know if I look at myself in the mirror well no let me not go there I was going to say always make myself look better than I think I am but it's the opposite it's the absolute opposite I need to go on a diet this kind of introspection was was unprecedented in fact for a liberation movement generally liberation movements across the globe do not necessarily introspect in the way that the African National Congress did and certainly this kind of introspection was was unprecedented also in South Africa and it encouraged those within the anti-apartheid movement and indeed in broader civil society it encouraged those to continue then to say we ought to pursue this agenda even if it isn't on the agenda of the negotiation table itself and of course you can see to what extent if the African National Congress was saying yes we want to look at ourselves that might be a heartening thing in a climate where one perhaps didn't want to do this the Zulus the Inkatha Freedom Party at that time was comprehensively and fully and classically as is its tradition inflexible and and never accepted blame it blamed the African National Congress primarily for all the violence that was occurring in our streets and always painted itself as an innocent victim of premeditated attempts to annihilate it and the Saudi the Inkatha Freedom Party in Concord distinction to the ANC has never attempted this introspection and has been a problematic participant in the truth and reconciliation process in any event as we shall see and always believes and has believed that it saw itself as a as a systematically vilified victim of intimidation and violence propaganda and misrepresentation by about 1993 how am i doing for time am I still good for time because I so we'll go a little longer and then okay we'll go another 10 minutes or so and then we'll do some some questions do you have burning questions yeah you have some questions okay because if you don't you know we can use the time either way we will fall the time but I do want to i do want to get to that that point by 1993 the African National Congress is leadership the other leadership had begun to accept this idea that there might not be any trials of the Nuremberg type there might not be any criminal trials they might not be a criminal series of trials for apartheid crimes and certainly at that point about a year before our elections the National Party and and definitely its security chiefs that the generals and the heads of intelligence and so forth had had begun to signal that they supported the idea of a general amnesty and that some guarantee was needed around amnesty in any event so so the ANC was beginning to say we can see that there might not be all these trials for atrocities and the National Party was still pressing hard on more indemnity than they had already passed in 1992 yeah and and and and in all of this and and and I say here by the way we should ask ourselves why why why were they doing that you know so so those thousands were only the tip of the iceberg the African National Congress was prepared at this point to begin to compromise on the principles around amnesty it was prepared to begin to think about a compromise but it wasn't prepared to tie itself at this point in 93 a year before the elections to a specific amnesty deal it didn't want to tie itself down to a particular prescription around amnesty it argued at that time that the detail of an amnesty process should be the responsibility of a democratically elected government and in fact that's what it had argued about a final constitution as well the National Party never wanted in the first instance elections and then a constitution and elections and then a TRC they always wanted a long drawn-out process of negotiations leading to a form of power sharing forget the elections so what resulted in this process of the ANC beginning to think about adjusting its view on trials and and and and criminal proceedings on the one hand and the National Party pressing hard still for amnesty was the inclusion of the provision for amnesty in the post amble of the interim constitution which was produced in 1994 together with an election so it was so the interim constitution was a product of our negotiation process and due to that right at the end at the back a provision for amnesty was slipped in right at in fact at the at the sort of tail end if you like December 1993 at the tail end of the process we had elections in April 94 this provision for amnesty which is now an agreement also between then the ANC and the NP so it's no longer you know we're no longer now just pointing the finger at that at the National Party which I like to do I hope you will forgive me for that I do like to do that they conscripted me I'll never forgive them for that and that's only the beginning they slipped this amnesty in at the end in December 93 presented it as a fait accompli to the nation there was no public opposition at that point it was slipped in the process we were on the threshold of our first elections let me tell you it was a euphoric time it was an amazing time to be alive it was a fabulous time to be alive for months before that April I mean you know I went into the Independent Electoral Commission as the director the national director of voter education I had the privilege to travel around that country orchestrating voter education efforts it was fantastic people everywhere were ready you could see that when the cues came out if you cast your minds back those cues those long queues people were just so excited for the first time to be able to do that it was fantastic no detail at this point when the amnesty provision was slipped in there was no detail about what this provision meant there was no commitment made in that provision to examine the conflicts of the past and in fact the African National Congress is position that this would be deferred to a new government then prevailed that so if you think about it you can see that the outcome of negotiations was that the option for pursuing justice the option for pursuing justice in the context of an accountability agenda was not completely closed down by the negotiation process despite the fact that it wasn't on the agenda ultimately the way it was put into the interim constitution meant that it was certainly probably in line with the ANC strategic thinking that this kind of provision would be a good thing to have in the context of where it might intend to take the country once it governed given the broad nature of these provisions and they are broad given the broad nature of these provisions in the interim constitution they allow for a wide interpretation they certainly allow for a wider interpretation by the then new democratic government then might otherwise have been the case so however we look at this and whether we think about it critically in the context of slipping it in and so forth they seem also then in the in the broader picture of the strange creature this hybrid thing you can begin to see also how many of these strange things somehow at the time might make some sort of sense for a peace process moving forward maybe within weeks within weeks of the historic 94 elections the African National Congress dominated government and it was then a government of national unity and that's another series is describing this negotiation process and how it worked and and so forth the the ANC dominated government of national unity immediately initiated a process that began to lead to an act known as the promotion of national unity and reconciliation Act and consequently that act then put in place the groundwork for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission and that was within weeks so one does have the feeling I think ladies and gentlemen that the groundwork for this had already been prepared such alacrity such readiness to put forward this this this this this act this legal instrument and and one does wonder to what extent informal discussion certainly within the African National Congress had already put in place the groundwork for that quick slip into the interim constitution and then an act immediately after the elections in any event key members of the African National Congress had always been and were keen to develop and put in place a mechanism some sort of mechanism test to examine past violations in order to achieve that and in sharp contrast Inge shin to the way in which things have been done in the past the African National Congress engaged several civil society actors several NGOs and other p prominent people in civil society to form part of a broader debate then about what was possible what could be done how might one do this and how might one shape legislation that could underpin a process of Truth and Reconciliation and of course South Africa in contra distinction to many countries that have gone through transition was the only country at that time to have engaged also now post post election in such in such public debates about these these these transitional questions of Truth and Reconciliation the terms of such a mechanism the scope of such a mechanism what it should do and so forth this this was unprecedented and and it is it is right and proper to say that a group of civil society activists organizations primarily from the human rights field from the human rights NGO sector in South Africa and certainly also the churches a lot of our churches played a key role and an influential role in the subsequent post 94 drafting of the formulation of legislation they were indeed a series of workshops that were held by these folk in support of the African National Congress and the government of the day to develop and think about legislation and pro and so forth there were also public hearings that were held by the Justice parliamentary portfolio Commission public hearings and and and the solicitation of submissions from the public in in in in in helping to draft the legislation so you can see post 94 already a really different way you know a really different way of doing things emerging almost instantly now there are two views around the way in which these recommendations were taken into consideration some say they weren't listen to but the broad the broad agreement is that the the the the views of the public the views of NGOs etc that all of us was taken into account that this was extensive and certainly the provisions in relation to transparency and the question of implementing a what was described and in their words a victim-centered process that these were achievements largely due also to the the public and and NGO and civil society input into the nature of the legislation civil society groups for example successfully opposed a recommendation from both the African National Congress and the National Party that amnesty hearings should all be held in camera that was an original design concept all MST hearings should be held in camera civil society opposed that and was successful in opposing that the ANC government dominated government listened to them and said fine we won't all those amnesty hearings in camera in in secret so so it wouldn't be so so the idea is so if you have a judicial proceeding in camera it means you don't have the public there you literally just have sort of you know yeah so so that was and and remember what I said the ANC and the NP had proposed that and civil society had opposed it and and and it had it had won the day that these would be pups oh so the ANC and the NP wanted a hidden amnesty process and of course the NP had a tradition of that so we shouldn't be surprised by that what is a little surprising is the ANC position it's twelve o'clock thank you so much ma'am I appreciate that it's twelve o'clock does anyone have a question or so so I saw a hand you're in a hand there will go first here during negotiations there were fourteen thousand people killed was there any can you give some sort of a very rough breakdown of the ethnicity of those who were killed hmm so the question if you didn't hear it was what is the ethnic breakdown of people who were killed during the negotiation process I'm almost inclined to ask you to answer the question because the answer to that and by ethnicity it's a hard question to answer because there are many ethnic groups in South Africa so I'm not going to answer it in ethnic breakdown terms they were by and large black and and in fact maybe I can say that because of the amount of violence on the on the in the mines a lot of that was Zulu and cosa so and this is the interesting thing about the way in which the zoo sided with the National Party in those clandestine activities in relation to the murder of causes and others and so the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party in relation to death squads and hit squads perhaps not so much but certainly squads of of thugs who would go into say mining compounds with what we call Sean box long whip-like things and of course worse things bangers and go in there and top people up and chase them and so forth that this would you know a fan the flames that were needed to derail the negotiation process that this was happening so ethnic in that sense ethnic in that sense but certainly by and large you didn't see on mass why people dying there was it was you know it was a lot and of course they were white death squads and hit squads that were also it was it was that it was an awful and messy and ugly thing and a lot of that came out we didn't know that they were the existence of farms were death squads operated from clandestine Lee and completely without the knowledge of anyone worth funding and so forth to do all these all these things and more to murder activists to send bombs in post and all sorts of things and there was a hand there could you give us your reaction and evaluation to President Jacob Zuma and his situation right now what do you think is going to happen the South Africa has a and this may sound strange because of apartheid but South Africa does have a proud and strong legal tradition despite the fact that the justice system of course was apartheid riddled and there's no doubt that it was that it was in favor of the white minority at the same time still has a robust liberal strong history of of principled argument and that includes in fact some of the Afrikaner judges and so forth who often or at least sometimes came to positions that you might think they would have pressure political pressure on them not to come to so this idea that we've had a strong and indeed proud legal tradition is a good one and I say that by way of preamble because if there ever was a moment when a South African like me could have hope it is the hope that we have in the constitutional court ruling a majority ruling in favor of telling the president that he's wrong telling the president that he is not right in enhancing his home to the extent of however many millions that he did and that 30 million and of arguing that his swimming pool is a repository for water in case of a fire you know he needed a pool for security reasons I like to swim in my pool I don't have one but yeah I use my pool for swimming so so my perspective is that finally finally someone has had the courage and it is our judiciary our highest court in the land that has had the courage to stand up to Zuma and tell Zuma you are wrong and now of course with Ahmed Kathrada who was in the rivonia trial with Nelson Mandela one of our elders saying he needs to step down and he's I think he's 87 now or any as well in his 80s very principled man saying that I think his time has come so from my perspective and you asked me my perspective the sooner he goes the better and I think the momentum might be there now the ANC he won an impeached he wasn't impeached in Parliament the ANC majority was big enough for him not to be impeached so he survived that but I'm hoping that the pressure he's an embarrassment he's an you know there are some politicians that are an international embarrassment I compete I just could not resist that you know I do that on purpose because sometimes people stereotype Africa and they stereotype Africans and they say you know you guys you know it's all corrupt and it's all bad and what's that was you know Africa and and South Africa might be all this you know and and and of course of course one needs to see these things seriously in perspective and so I made that point tongue-in-cheek but I make that point in all serious atty to you know that there are international embarrassments but they are bound in our political classes and I am embarrassed buys by Zuma i will i will say that yeah have we run out of time questions oh you've not wrong time good question over here and then the gentleman over there was this sort of thinking unique to a truth and reconciliation concept unique to mandela and this society no so the idea of Truth and Reconciliation commissions isn't new to wasn't new to us and indeed from Latin America we had many activists come over and we took design points we took lessons we took thoughts from them in relation to what our TRC might look like so no we are not alone in having had a a TRC there were presidents before us what what was unique of course is our particularly carefully constructed and certainly open process so so no we had learned from from others well uh yeah redland I think we had learned from others yes a comment relation of this latest earlier question in camera legislation it has been historically a bit of a problem with Tennessee legislature and we were quite familiar with that unfortunately I don't think I need to say a word now recommended a book written about the TRC written by Paul somebody I wanted to get that last name g r e ad Y greedy and I can't remember the exact name of the book it's a long name I can bring it with next time and I can also circulate it to Norma it was published in 2010 and it gives a great overview of transitional justice and then homes in specifically on the South African TRC some so published in 2010 there's amazing hindsight in that book wonderfully well written and gently but you know carefully constructed critique with a view to again enabling yet more folk when will it ever end to develop better TRC's than we had so that's why it's a and all the other critique that's why it's so so good to have these these books I think I think I wish we could get to a point where we didn't have TRC's anymore and didn't need them that's an idealistic statement of course I've been cute accused of being an idealist on this campus I'm an unashamed idealist and I unashamedly speak to students in that fashion because we need that perspective more than ever thank you thank you very much you will if you brought in coffee cups or things
