 good afternoon thank you very much for having me here can I my name's Rob cartridge i'm here from an international NGO so slightly outside of the research community we're called practical action we are a medium-sized NGO formerly known as intermediate technology development group for those who have been going a bit longer we were 50 last year so just a little bit older than IDs but we've been very much in partnership and also in partnership with lg's over the last 20 years you know we're regular partners or different projects here and there and you know I think we should really celebrate the impact of Elvis because for all these difficult goodest drivers had a fantastic role in international development it really helped us to move forward as well as helping the thinking around knowledge in develop to move forward so you know congratulations left let's let's absolutely analyze let's think about the next steps well let's also take sometimes celebrate the success that you've had so far um so practical action for those who don't know only has a long term commitment to international to knowledge sharing as part of our DNA we do stuff on the ground same as all international NGOs we work with communities in a participatory way generally around sharing appropriate technologies we see always though through our working model or the work that we do on the ground is a relatively small NGO we need to learn from and we need to share the knowledge from that going to create a bigger impact on both policy and practice globally so it's kind of knowledge brokering is in our DNA but it's not been without its challenges and with lots and lots of learning as we've gone along so these session the next four of us and we're actually compared notes because I think there's a lot of what's come up already will come up again is looking at what are the challenges and the opportunity of the institutional challenges and opportunities to that information management knowledge brokering and research communications what what have we learnt as we go along and just to be helpful make it nice and simple as we're getting close to lunchtime I've gathered it into 5 p's so that's all you need to remember and I'll put those on the last slide so if you want to nod off for the next 10 minutes or so you can do is just come back for that there so the first thing is um projects projects the whole way in which our business operates the log frame blessings you know great really helpful project management tool very very you know mainstream to what we still do for all lots of us are trying to be different trying to be flexible the log frame is still at the core of what we do it is the business nor on top of that you know the three-year project the way that donors operate they'll give you a three-year grant and donors get less and less capacity themselves because they want to cut back on their own overhead you know they'll send you away going come back in three years tell me what you've achieved against your log frame which was usually written probably 18 months before the project even started this does not encourage learning this does not encourages to learn as we go along and to adapt our program this says you know you have to go ahead and you have to deliver according to what their it has become it's not just eat even weirdo that we now have starting to get some sometime donors coming through far more flexible but it's kind of difficult as an organization to adapt our business models around that so our finance department for example really struggled with the idea that you know you cannot start spending until you upload your budget and once you've uploaded your budget you have to spend against that budget and we don't necessarily have the systems in place to adapt and to learn and to change when something starts going awry and we've already talked about the complexity of international development things do not go to plan and so just carrying on and carrying on and we'll even judged often as our project managers on there spend against their plans no and if you want spending quickly enough then there will be problems there are implications for the organization we take overhead recovery on a project which won't be drawn down if you don't spend so there's a real need to try and move away from these business norms which which hold us in in this place now for each of the challenges there if there are also opportunities in particular the new opportunities around adaptive programming the lots of people are talking about which is starting to come through we're starting to see this coming from donors we have a particularly major resilience project with rhetoric insurance who have given us very sort of loose framework to operate within and allows us to learn the theory of change i think is an approach is very helpful in all of this and personally I've been diving a little bit recently into the agile project management ideas coming from the whole software development industry this is the manifesto for agile and is all about instead of you know here's my brief go away bring me back a piece of software in six month time when you finished it very iterative lots of processes underneath this daily or weekly meetings between the customer and and the class loop between the client and the developer so that you can sort of continue to move recognizing that as you develop a piece of software your needs develop same surely is true in any international development project you know continually talking to your users you your clients or beneficiaries whatever you want to call them but the people that you're trying to work with in a partnership this is new they say this is this is something called participate redevelopment that Robert Chambers and others have been talking about for many many years so this is something which i think is quite exciting in my finest way gradually into the international development industry let's let hope that it does the second II which again we've already talked about a little bit today is promises there is bad news I'm afraid we are never going to reach a state of perfect knowledge we are never going to be able to get all the knowledge that people need to improve their livelihoods into their hands in the right format at the right time you know I'm a I'm an enormous optimist morals and values driven I really want to work towards that but we are never going to get there the world is producing enough data every day to give every person in the world 870 newspapers they cannot read more you know we we have to find ways of organizing that data and so the most likely the you know people will not have the good data in the right format or it may not even exist because of all the situations around will create the knowledge in the first place that we've talked about now faced by this reality it's quite easy for people to be hoodwinked by an apparent solution and Allen's already referred to this what you think you know put it out there what do you think might be an example of a solution which comes along to a management team and says we can knowledge for you everything is going to be fine any office chair there it is the beautiful SharePoint but you know it is just one one of many many of these these solutions IT solutions because it's easy as leaders as people controlling budgets you are able to say here's something which I can do to make this incredibly difficult situation better i joined practical action eleven years ago let's go this week in my first week we had a meeting where we agreed to start using sharepoint 2003 as it was and we are still struggling we are still trying to work out how to make it work best to get knowledge moving around the organization we actually to be honest you know we are in a much better place obviously you know previously was all on shared on sort of shared drive between teams things like that it is better but it was oversold it was over promised it was this was going to solve all our issues and it hasn't done and as a result of that of course you find that before you go back to people and say oh I've got another solution we can make things a little bit better they're less likely to sign up to it certainly not been a classier and it burns people's fingers it's also not unusual it's awesome really similar to Geoff's point around portals how many portals come along and sell themselves as being this is going to be the one shot stop shop this is going to be the place where you're going to find all the knowledge that you need to do X to do development in India and I'm looking guilty as charged i'm going to set up a group in a minute it's called portal owners anonymous is what we launched two weeks ago flow Brazilians portal with the Zurich insurance company and this is you know this is a one-stop shop where where you can go and you can find information about flood resiliency in the developing world context oh I think you know to answer Geoff's point about you know do we pack up the portals and go to the bar putting the information out there is it is a is a good thing you know if we'd said 30 years ago on the timeline that there's the potential to build a library a global library which in theory everybody who gained two with all this knowledge in a pretty much all the knowledge that exists in the world that we welcomed that and that in effect is what we've done with intimate but what we haven't done is the next bit we haven't really invited people in we haven't trained them how to access that library and we haven't dealt with the fact that actually some of the knowledge that people are going to need isn't even captured in the first place and has never been written down so that's the kind of you know I seen CT portals opinion up there another book in the library and we talked about you know ways in which we can we can leave them the opportunity Oh in this area there are things as I've already been mentioned great thing around the open data movement linked open day to the ok hub that we partner with IDs weird with our Latin America office and making knowledge available linking it it kind of still feels like it's very early days it still feels like this is stuff which is at the cutting edge and not getting into the mainstream but the potential is there to mash together that data and make it into something which is low contextually relevant and I think there's an exciting exciting things in the pipeline there another initiative a lot of you will have heard always go down the global open data initiative on agriculture and nutrition again these are great discussions yet to kind of deliver things but if we can leave we can move some of these born it will help us to navigate navigate the mess which is the Internet in effect third third Pete have cheated a little bit he's poor leadership not surprisingly how many and then maybe I don't know I mean perhaps this is different in a solar oven and academia and research world will be interesting to discuss how many of our leaders really do buy into digital you know many of our leaders certainly I come across think of digital ugh oh that's the website that's the website and certainly for others of the website is where we bring your money or where we sell our books or it's where we perhaps communicate with people but is a very simplistic understanding of digital at the moment and the potential power it's seen as being a channel and not as being caught our purpose and core to the objectives of what we're trying to achieve we're going through a new strategic process at the moment and it's not really figuring and being how do we use and harness digital in getting information and helping us to achieve our are caught in our case charitable objectives I think it's changing slowly properties a generational thing as new and younger leaders come through but I think I think there's a lot still to be done and then there's also an easy accusation as well if you want to dismiss digital you know it is it doesn't reach the last mile you know what wildly bothering with websites that's not going to help you know the field in Africa in Bangladesh wherever and just because you haven't got access to it doesn't mean it's not worth going some of the way there and then recognizing that you also need to do the knowledge brokering that completes the last mile you know but it can become a very easy excuse we presented we have an annual what we call the supporters that the practical action some of our are sort of most loyal donors we bring them together lovely we presented them with four different knowledge sharing initiatives we presented them with a call center in Bangladesh we're podcasting is in Bob way with focus groups that we run with marginalized women in Nepal and then with their digital presence in Peru now the digital presence in Peru riches in terms of you know its visitors however you want to measure them far far more people than any of the others but to the practical action supporters you know they were much more interested in the other things and when they voted on which was the most worthy of support the digital work came at the bottom and that's good okay they're not a hugely informed audience but you know that is reflected I think in general terms and by lots of people within our sector so they see digital as a luxury and not something which is which is yet to be prioritized and that's getting it under I'm not putting this up there as it's all their fault and putting it up there as we need to make the case much more strongly feels like we might have been doing that for a long time that we've got to keep on going and making that case there are however some where again some opportunities in this area the value for money agenda I'm coming strongly out of diff it you know surely it is better that George is more value for money if your research is properly communicated than if it shelf or your learning can be shared but you know again depends on who owns that value for money agenda in your organization so in our organization value for money is owned by the finance director for him knowledge sharing is an overhead which is added on to something and therefore actually drives down not buying for money whereas for me it is something which drives up our value for money because it increases our impact so that's it that's a bit of a double-edged sword the other one again Jeff referred to and it's definitely in the ascendancy again in our organization is the learning organization we're talking a great deal about it our new strategy is going to be an adaptive strategy and we're trying to now work out how we make the space to do the learning and to retain the knowledge when people need you know we have to see the reality is that we're still at the sort of the big what was referred to the other day is unicorns and rainbows at part of our strategy which is the sort of the you know this is our global vision but when that becomes a reality of a business plan are we going to say that we will sacrifice the delivery of projects on the ground in order to to make space for learning and that's going to be a tough tough argument but I've but I'm hoping that we'll go there I should speed up the fourth p people just a small small problem we used to have professional information managers people who processed data is another the 1970s but not entirely dissimilar to to the picture of BLD s 30 years ago but perhaps not quite as diverse as envy with dinner people most employed people to do filing to set up filing systems to do information management and we don't do any of that we just say expect people to do their own do we train them do we spend any time at all saying to people how do you train how do you organize you know I mention SharePoint we don't train our new starters in SharePoint respect sharepoint gonna put you stop on it if you're lucky they work out how to upload a document but in terms of structure in the data so anybody can find it mother so really important that we do that and then look indeed at the new skills as well skills like curation that we're going to need to turn move on opportunity in this area though with people as I've mentioned already learning organizations appraisal systems we have knowledge management as a core competency for all seven hundred of our staff you know and a call coughing that we look at it recruitment and valuing the knowledge worker this was I was at a business conference at Henley earlier this year they've done some analysis of the top flight companies those companies who are investing in learning and they found these were some of the attributes that then came out as a result so people are four times more lines and report they're responding faster to business change three times more likely to report for a minute staff morale so basically better businesses invest in learning and that's kind of generally accepted I think in most progressive companies and finally 15 is the lack of partnership you know wait wait wait we're one big happy family right we all we all have a common cause we're all working together we all have a desire to make the world a better place we're all really good at partnering and share we spend a lot of our time doing it so will you give me your data will you give me your content so I can I can give it away you know these are not easy questions and often the untapped to be no or perhaps or under the following circumstances because they're my donors and then my relationships in reality they're my intellectual property I think we don't call like is real creative commons but actually when it comes to proactively sharing there's an awful lot of a road road to go down and I know the O nonage hub is sort of out there you know we've lots people signing up in principle and then the struggle of actually getting people to commit to say okay take my information do with it what you want even if it's things like I need the impact data because I have to justify my own existence to my managers so lots and lots of problems with that I work on flood resilient as you've seen from from month later open you know with their we are finding as our aligns a new way of describing resilience the partners in it the we already had what it was called v2 our vulnerability to resilience the Red Cross have their own it's called PCV a mercy corps have something else there are so many different approaches to resilient I'm single is smiling I know and there's the whole braced program is that you know so many different approaches to Brazilians why why why do we not all work together because frankly there's none of an additional is an element of reality brand whether we like it or not even lovely people working in the development sector have an errand to run to think about and an element of not invented here we need our approach we need you know a lot of our strategy process has been about what makes us different not what makes us the same work where can we learn and then when you add to that the intrusion into the sector that we now see is an increasing trend from the private sector you know which is which is a good thing in general there's lots of things that we can from the private sector and I'm not just talking about you know the PwC's KPMG's Mott MacDonald present company excepted you know we have our own practical action consulting and some of our greatest challenges in knowledge sharing in our organization on with our consulting company because their knowledge is their value and so if they give up if they stick it up on the website and say to everybody this is how we do this then actually they really struggle to then sell their services so there's a huge you know and this is this is something which is not going to stop with the current sort of political direction you know we are very definitely going to have more and more projects so how do we get knowledge sharing working within that um the opportunity here are we through it in a sense is because we are being forced to work together through these enormous projects these multi faceted multi-stakeholder only channel only platform complex and soldier with multi-million dollar contracts those of us who may or may not be big enough to manage them they do force us to work together and there are opportunities to share that learning and move it around a little bit within the different actors of receptor so that's it um the I was going to say on that one you know you one of the ways you can happen with those big kind of multi sectoral things is donors can start saying this is the approach that you have to adopt which is an interesting that we have that got a lot of work with us age and that ict4d project where they say this is you know this is our learning you need to add altiris do you need to show us how you're adopting that that's fine to a point but doesn't that lead you on a road to standardization where then you can't begin to learn because nobody's trying anything new which is a bit of a challenge too so that's what it brings with the end puppies and projects over promises poor leaders people and partnerships you know if we could just solve those then go when we go to the bar thank you
