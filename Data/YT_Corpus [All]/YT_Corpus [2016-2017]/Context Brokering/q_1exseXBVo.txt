 but now it's time to welcome directly based in the G connect in Luxembourg the participation of our next participant Philippe gallon project officer of the creativity you need didja connect welcome aboard this morning Philip thank you for joining us our program that as I said in the indium in Catalan and then in Spanish according to the program is basically to have have you directly information presenting 34 of the challenges of the topics around or is a horizon 2020 that is touching rien rimmed really the creativity the creators in innovation and research for the putting together with culture as a goal and exactly as in our program is said ICT 21 ICT 36 and I ct19 they are going around really like soup or technology transfer to creative industries to boost energy is between artists creative people and technologists and media and content conversions and of course the one that Rufio was so nice to keep it aside because she was already going through the challenge the topics of the challenge six about virtual museums so welcome aboard the floor is yours we have your presentation right now I give time to a technician to put it yes and now it's going yeah absolutely that I that's why I was giving giving time to put the presentation on the screen go ahead Philip welcome the floor is yours I just would like to get a few a few hint on either I go for us on all the different topics or I focus on the first few depending on how the audience is receptive and how they prefer this to be handled so you prefer so up to you what i think i would say i would ask the audience but i would say that if you can give a kind of a taste of each one of those in over like usually I like to do that it's like throwing away the fishing tackle in order to get something in return like being sexy oh I have something here for me so it's not about going deeper it's more like being catchy so I would go for the little bit of briefing of the four of them but what do you think you want to your specific for once I would say that it's a mixed crowd and probably you are interested to hear about the four they were proposed because actually we are we are in the program i'm really thankful for all our panels we nail it we have the four the four topics that are really really interested for you so I would I would go for that it ok for you Philip so I give it glints on everything and I focus on 21 36 and nine key yeah ok absolutely so that basically the things I sorted them actually according to the deadlines I am trying to put my myself in your shoes trying to for you to try to submit your proposals and therefore you act upon the night usually and and money as well so that's most probably most hockey thing's been trying to be practical so I CT 21 and 36 are going to be having their deadlines in the prof apron so that's going to be soon and the ICT 19 is actually deadlines is only on the 8th of november so if we do not have time right now to focus on this one we will have more time to present it at least you will have more time to to seek for information the other two that i wanted to give a quick hand on which I activities seem instrument and the fti activity and have a typo there is a pass tractor for innovation and development disruptive innovation course these are actually continuous course and they have cut update but they have several of them so basically as soon as you are ready you can go and focus on it and then within a month or two you should have that man to be able to submit it ok that basically what you should be aware of so if i go for the first topic which is this one support technology transfer to the creative industry this is basically the repetition of what corn we have done in 2015 which was odd that had the core ICT 18 and this was better so i received that we wanted to repeat the experience it's a little bit a typical core and you will understand why basically what we try to focus out into target on is the creative industries and mostly SMEs it's me as they are representing eighty-five percent of the area we wanted trade to push them and we wanted to to foster the technological transfer between the academic world or the research centers to one of the real creative industries SMEs that's basically was the ideas and the best way we want to do that exactly to get as short at description as possible so we even managed to shorten it to one single sentence which is what are we expecting these are action should support creative industries SME leveraging original CT technology for the development of innovative product tools application and service with high commercial attention point and that's what was making it were received basically in the sensor everybody could participate not really but actually trying ICT intensive transfer towards the creative industry the other thing things that we wanted to insist in the text so if you go to the text you see some different system from the previous one but it's actually the driving roles in the actual so we wanted the SME to be really the leader in to that so we did not want the academics to ask the other startups to be participating in one of the research development we wanted the drilling to be driven by the needs of the sm ok every wanted it to be real and in fact also we wanted to have at least a draft business plan to be provided you know another for the people to know exactly what they wanted to solve ok and we wanted them to be clear about what were the impact they wanted to to to have either at European or international event international mean basically word line because what is interesting in this digital area is that as soon as you have a good even simple an apps in to be developed a website you can really target the whole world but we wanted you two to one wanted the proposers to be at least aware of what they are playing with and what they are targeting if they are get targeting the international markets the European market oh go beyond and how they are we measure it ok thats is activated the simple core and we try to adapt to your needs the needs of the acd so we did the project duration to be very short 12 to 18 months and the funding basically as a consequence is basically have a menial to up to 1 million it doesn't make sense to ask for project of five thousand five millions if you read funny 12 month in the sense at the time you warm up you already at the end of the project so we want it fast and precise actions the total budget is that we have allocated to this action is 14 million and it has been open and the deadline is actually going to be the turf of April these are typical actions understands that you anyhow need three partners from three different countries in order to be able to participate okay if if you are interested in this code base basically what I'm trying to do is to give two plans and then if you want to get further information the best way either you use an email you follow the twitter icons there is examples of the previous one which can give you him somewhat back been selected and you have unhappy with the HTTP linksys it's very boring tool to subscribe but i'm sure that you could be years we will the people in barcelona in order to get direct links or description of what has been selected from the previous code we expect to have basically the same portfolio I would I here to stop and maybe to open the floor to the question this is the very small one easy to understand but you might have one or two key question today or you want me to continue um what do you think you have questions so far yes we have a question in the floor the microphone is arriving yet Thank You Maria this is just for SME also for institutions so it's basically targeting you see me in the sense that we want SME as participant in the consortium ok it's not what is called an SME instrument we want them to be part of it we do not specifically indicate how they have to be incorporated in the consortium ok we want them to be in the driving a role in the action because we wanted you galleries when you will try to submit the proposal depending of the lay the structure of the essay means you are confronted with to be inside the construction on locked inside the consumption we did open to you definition but we want them to have the driving Road any more questions so fine go ahead flip ok at was the first one that was an easy one and of course now the most tricky one and its core ICT 36 it's basically a hidden in the end of the word program it do not draw a lot of attention because a better practice more but it has very interesting specificities deadlines same it's read to boost energy between the artists the creative people and the technologies while in the previous school we were trying to make the synchronization between the research centers and these nice here we grow one level below being the granularity being really add the people ok why it's basically because we have realized that including the artists of the creative people i prefer the term creative people because its broader but you will see the distinction into the core to really be incorporated in the development of novel tools is is really key for for the S&E so for the year for the it's not only SME but the industry to really develop novel and adapted tools ok so we have launched a broader initiative which is for start for SN T and honor which is science and technology and art to basically push the transfer of this artist or creative people into the normal development cycles R&D and I basically okay so how this topic is our Clips articulate it is a little bit tricky there is to section the a and the B the a is actually an innovation action it's read to establish a structure dialogue between the creative people in the technology developers it's basically we are seeking to develop a network for the people to establish a common practice and also to organize a competitive a competition between the creative people and the technologies to be in prototype actually to two people working together building a prototype and if they are successful and make in the competition they got money okay and then we have another action which is the B which is a coordination and support action which is basic encouraging the artist integration into the research and innovation projects okay in this score we want to develop a brokerage service for artists in research and innovation project basically a brokering service to self k i'm an artist i'm looking to participate in a research and innovation project or i'm part of the research and innovation project we think that we would need artists to be participating in here is the list please go ahead so it's basic to develop that such a list and it's also cover for a stock price so basically I will explain it a little bit further but it's it's to promote also the artistic integration let's try for the first one and took a little bit deeper developing a network what we want to do is basically all the relevant people in the DISA RIA to work together to synchronize and Tori establish a European wine sustainable social dialogue between the creative video community and the relevant SME to be participated in two and promote the replication of successful initiative across other industry and European country if you look at this this is a tremendous job it's basically putting all together the people to to work together and if you look at it and if you deduce the money you basically have close to no money to do it it's direct challenge on the other side is basically leveraging out all the existing structure that has been established at as we develop at the National at region and metal across Europe and push them we give them a little bit money for them to work together it is in their interest and it's in our interest as well it's more let's see it as an incentive ok and then is to generate a competition the competition is basically loads a every year for the best creative project ideas you promote the new sim it ideas and show the financial support of the realization and up to the prototype so basically you're sending people that have good ideas couple of people you want to have a creative person and technologies and have a good ideas then basically will be given monies up to 50,000 zero in order to develop their prototype and then the next year they come back with the result and you select the best and you promote basically you promote the best you make publicity around the best prototype that has been developed okay and we are asking basically to this easy strategy to be sustainable to try to find the skin to make it just in a bit better so basically the cycle is you wrote your competition you see make the best ideas you promote the best ideas you make publicity out of it but also you support the organization of a prototype and then you promote the prototype and if you do it every year actually you can promote at the same time the best idea is the new ideas of this year and the prototype that has been developed since last year promotion to a different II people beside you to the general public and the prototype already to the vistors okay evaluation criteria must be originality feasibility and economic or social value attention so as I said the typical financial support or experiment around 50,000 0 okay basically what we want to do is to do the one and the set the 1 which is putting all the creative active actors in Europe together and the tool is to promote this this competition we got three minions for that and we asked at least eighty percent of the funding to be dedicated to the prototype and we to already use what is existing in order to to promote and to make the publicity but to work together okay the open enterprise Europe network and the NCP natural for core of the publication of the promotion for the demonstrator okay you have any question on this one I'd call it this way because it's more tricky t we had a one yeah just a quick wisdom I'm not going to show I understand why this is an innovation action ordination i tranfer you play the character of all the boys did okay it's it's a naughty pic and innovation action I fully agree technically speaking it doesn't make that much difference in terms of the d financing because we expect the financing to be the partners to be group of creative cultural nonprofit organization okay we do not expect to have one company running the show basically that would be very search okay and second is to highlight the importance of this prototype and market ideas basically then to show that we want to go fast from ideas to the prototype it's really short term thing so in one year you should be able to get for the time and to already knock at the door of the industrialist in order to do that that was basically the message to put it as an innovation action again okay short fast and even faster and shorter than the producer it's it's really go up to the limit of what as the development commission and the H 2020 can go up to the funding ok not the second one here it's its core for the brokerage service or the implementation of the Sun prize the brook accelerates as i said is basically you try to set up an online platform which is a second point which I basically described to find to match our tanners between artists and research organization but also to function term resident fellowships in running etc to project or an institution so basically trying to sponsor the in-house residence of artists in in running is a sciences and on the other side is also organized annual highly visible event to promote this disintegration this initiative and the integration of artists into the science and technology world okay so either there you can if you have an idea so that you can submit a proposal for that exercise the budget is basically you four million and what we would expect is to have this this coordination is a production to run for four years okay you can also submit a call for start prize is basically to promote it's already is to showcase the division and innovation of the whole ideas to promote it and to reward or standing contribution there would be two annual price one to be a two under the artistic exploration where appropriate by the art has altered technology okay that's more there is a parent is it okay so the idea is to you get an artist and existing high-tech technology and you say okay try to have some fun with it to promote some to generate some really artistic approach of it and and you if you get something very nice and interesting then you could have at least price the second one is little more the work linking ICT in the are not that of a new palette for innovation in society it's more top-down so you have the technology and you work with the technologies and the artist another two to generate something another to an your price 20k each and that's the whole money for to the or si si would be to caprice I surprised 200 submission to establish the evolution and to organize the award ceremony and the budget is basically 1 million for that okay duration for years so you try to use a sign for four years that's it a bit more tricky and that's the summary for the two different take time to the point a and point B you have any question on the point B C microphone is coming I you mentioned that there must be some highly visible annual event in point B and I wanted to ask if it has to be an isolated event or you can be something attached to something that is already highly visible like a music festival again so so what we are looking for is to have as much to zbt as possible and to be able to run on already existing one so it's up to you to show to make the case that the targeted even is the perfect match for giving that as I visibility as possible thank you anyone else no keep going okay that was the second and the third one I'm ct19 it's this color is a little bit in the future so it's going to be the eight November since I the deadline is in the year time so you have more time to to sort all the texts to analyze it and the line it's Camellia and content convergence and basically the challenge and what we are looking forward to have project that would help us to make the best use of technology for reaching out the new to new audience adapting to the digital aerial thriving why it's really publicity leaflet here and traveling to the collecting digital single market what we are trying to to found its project to to transfer the digital domain in media and convergence okay when you will see a little bit more deleted after okay so what type of funding we would do we would support the large can demonstrate on peeler or to market prototype which are basically exploiting the convergence ideas the interpret interim oh hi it's an amazing world in terms of creativity and integration between podcasting broadband internet based services audio visual and social media so basically I see you have a descender convergence is really you put all the I te digital things together you shake them and you get a wonderful stable things that work on your phone on your tablet TV screen and ebooks and whatever you can imagine as much now as well ok that's the both of them so there is two topics one which is an innovation action and the other one is a coordination and sue protection which is really a basic one that you will understand on the innovation action ok what there we are targeting here is really to develop the immersive environment it is it's really to the keywords ok to to enhance the user experience in content consumption and to increase the accessibility and the like please go and read everything I'm not going to read the whole text in Texas pretty long it's pretty well it's basically totally to reverse than the previous color where you have only one sentence you have basically to peddle description but at least it's clear to understand what we are really looking for proposal should address one but it really more challenges so if you submit you one proposal there is I think for our challenges but you even go further to that you have at least two to answer one but you could answer to look through your phone ok the first one is the city of exploiting the synergy between the participation of individual collective through social media and the convergent environment so basically you case is under social the link between social media and and the convergence and art market could lead to the other domains and from the individual come to you okay do you have service around that but that would work on aggregation annotation media sharing search and Iraq the second topic is to lead the dig up immersive and pervasive solution for personalized experience so it's really the personalization hyper personalization real-time storytelling fury freed you bond of multi-trillion the license really to focus and to adapt to the people adaptation personalization the second is what is also called ottawa which is any device anywhere anytime in multiple platforms so having the information centralized but available from everywhere in the different format that you can use okay it's more nitty-gritty more technology and technological aspect again and if for former is accessibility solutions so basically having the system accessible to everybody so from subtitle sign language descriptive language automatic translation adaptation so really focusing on available not the first one was available everywhere the this one is available for everybody okay that's the idea so what we are looking for it's the typical size conversion between yin and the funding will be between two and four millions ok the impact be careful that the impact is important the description of the effect is important because that's how you would be measured or the proposal will be measured upon ok so be sure that you answer over the sense this this point and that you defend your proposal against not that merits as I said total budget here is 38 million and the corn will open the eighth of May and the deadline is the eighth of November questions any questions yes go ahead please I have one year to ensure that Bush does a quick one what is the definition of a large scale pilot definition of landscape large-scale pilots I'll ask a violent demonstration as you get demonstration of pie that if you want the idea is that you have to prove that it's scalable he that's a reason of ranch get this if you make a demo prototype or pilot prototype that work inside enclosed environment forget about it it doesn't match now you only have to go outside and then to make it run and just to showcase the feasibility but also the scalability of your proposal okay thank you okay i think the scalability is key yes you could say okay i will use amazon approach in order to make it so most caliber depending of the technology here when you want to implement you really have to have something and in explain how the pure proposal will be scalable thank you I have a question for you Philippe I'm yes being myself the representative of the media program the soup programming within a creative Europe I've been addressed by luffy eric alley the the chief the unit of media and she told me in the San Sebastian film festival you have to go for the media support for the artistic aspects but you have an incredible field precisely in this I ct19 because we had in the past as probably you know the pilot project call of support that was trying to develop what we are doing now with VOD and theatrical on demand and so on so so it's not just a question just like a kind of asking for your advice you think that I ct19 is it's good to be promoted by our office in terms of immersive experience audience engagement and new experiences to attract people to any type of platforms like the experience of theatrical on demand or all the innovation we have in video and demand and the other question because that's that's I know why I may I point out this it's because i know that this I ct19 as you were joking you have one year one so question but but for sure how it's related to how it's going to be implemented the digital single market that still there finishing the negotiations and probably is going to be implemented at the beginning of 2016 so it's related in how all those candidates they're gonna present the projects regarding how is going to develop the implementation of the digital single market so question a how media is compatible my field option B how we have to be careful in how that's white in November 2016 we're gonna change our projects regarding how is going to be the implementation of the digital single market okay the first one the first one you you highlighted to read I strength that that we are implementing which is the emerging and I like you body language because you were going back inside the merging between the research the 820 research and innovation landscape and the European do your culture media program which are more implementation and supporting the creation of content okay so it's it's indeed we are trying to merge and it will not be a surprise that in the in the next year's you will have curves which are really mean interlink in between ready to mega ring here if you can see it indeed you can see it as the first step towards the research area the H attitude which are getting closer and closer to the creative Europe media course program and you will most probably see the European media call to go a little bit closer to the pilot development underlies yes it's really a trend that we try not not to have any gap and this this text basically technically speaking defects and been drafted already close to a year ago so it was the starting point of this this module so definitely yes you got the idea of this dis bridging exercise and you will see it more and more and yes we will ask you and we best be already ask you now to promote to promote a 2220 course okay for the second one yes there will be impact but the impact of the DSN will mostly be legislative and arrives here what we are talking about this more the technology development of course if you are missing me than that building system a platform that you want to sell across Europe you have to be aware of the future legal constrained related to anything but it's honestly not Packard's here too much I mean from a business plan yes you have to be aware and yes you have to to develop a system solution which will be adaptable but it's not really at this level is not asked to be fully adapted to what will be the legislation in two years because we don't know okay thank you you answer my question thank you so much any questions in the floor we can keep going with with the fourth one okay there is that the second one which is the see the csa on the ICT 1960 it's basically an easy one it's facilitate research and policy exchange and support R&D program activities these are a really typical coordination of support action for the coalition's and social media ok that's a for people that are used to this exercise this this is a real typical one and widgets that you can ask for that is basically 1 million euro so I'm not going to spend too much time on it because it's a typical again expected in fact for that sister never repent for out of spec orders representing the evolved in me getting it under admin but is basically one sec okay sujit 1 million so we are waiting for me warm and lightly ok that is the next one then we get I get different I don't know how many minutes to us they have in front of you have like 15 minutes plus all those questions that are gonna generate but who so far were you going quite well so I'm not going to talk about virtual museum because mrs. Castillo has presented in before um I kept no actually a mr. Lucas video was going to do it but she said because in the program as far as I know he was announced that to you you could make a kind of a mansion what's in the program she was refrain herself so maybe you can do it and yeah we'll be fine will correct or wrong all right I don't have it is going to be profitable one of my colleague was usually doing it so the virtual museum so that's a sec so it's not a twenty20 day I'm sorry for this long and wording it's a different topic associated challenges but it's virtual museum the concept of virtual museum the real museum and happily provide only access to the public of 30 person of the assets we did not eighty percent of their set design basically in cavort or in da da da da attic but ended the tomtom rulings okay and they are running on most of the problem for console version the usage and the reuse of the day as it is one that's one of the problem virtual museum virtual museum exist is basically you could see it as a ginger net portal of existing museum but it's go beyond that it's also can gather addition a conglomerate of of existing museum and can even get no real museum attached to it okay is it a new concept no it's not a new concept we found back this apple cd-rom things getting from 60s graph 92 where you could go and browse an existing museum of the things of the contact list of you but it's really need to be developed ok so the ideas of the virtual museum as such is not only to get a virtual existence visiting virtually an existing museum but it's been mostly to prepare the tree to the real one so can elaborate you can prepare you have a better experience while you are visiting the museum in the sense that the trip as me and adapted to you need until new knowledge and the post experiences well so basically the channels what we are asking for is to further emphasize the y axis and developed the narrative for the collection and display adapted to your needs ok so there is two sections a and B course the a is to develop the hind innovation and the highly innovative technologies method and ICT tools to develop the ICT tools to improve what is called the digital encounters also to to to better match the need of the person who are going to use it and the what can be provided to them you can see it as a as a personalization as one okay to develop the narrative the you call that again I saw it on the previous one what what what the narrative the interactivity of the people the point B is mostly to develop the platform sustainable to a 2-d two to work together that's basically a CSA as far as I as your sis bit two together all the community around this virtual museum comes up make them working together okay being public or private stakeholders that's that's the easy so we are not that acquainted to the corner because you haven't as you can notice a little bit listen II used to be okay access it but basically it's to promote the virtual museum concept and the rate it's things okay the work the first one is a research and innovation action that's a reason the research is important that that aspect and guts we expect a typical size project to Anna Hart mini project depict calculation and we have conveniently located to that it the other one is the coordination of protection with a typical 1,000,000 I'm sure that you will have tons of questions on this one because it was not clear and then hope that they will be able two words for you go ahead and shoot um do you have any questions don't worry Philly because as I said a beginning we have hand-to-hand rocio can provide X information if needed any permit any questions yes we had it go ahead just one quick question to what extent this beautiful museum idea it might be suitable or it's going to be suitable to a particular problem that will be archaeological sites I mean archaeological sites usually 0 ball should be converted into a museum but but it's I need does it fit properly in this call yes it's it it's one of the chance of this virtual aspect of it we could it music because its wording but this can be able to to knock your particular site as well that you can see as an open-air museum basically as you mentioned thank you more so no question King so I will spend a few minutes I think that I still have on two different things one which is the S&E core I don't know if you have ever heard about that man I would guess it this this these are real as I items are interesting for the small company de cine but we do not always mention them because they are base they are open to everybody it's not topic-specific okay the reasoning behind it is like to me to support the development of an SME and in particularly here on SME in the ICT domain but and I want to talk about it because they are very successful tools where people can apply easily and I would expect that you have in front of you if you as a new representative at least that they can transmit to it so I think it deserves their attention ok so you have and how it has been designed using the instrument that's really the so-called in two minutes women there are three phase the first one which is small grant 50 km which actively support you to draft a business plan the second one which is called the face too much still make sense is to grab from one to three millions to really develop the ideas based on the business plan that you have prepared and the faith three is acting to support the commercialization and this one has no funny it's our interesting one you just help you it's useful okay so depending if you have an ideas if you want to support it or not but that's really the point of the threes or the feasibility on the innovation development and align the key point here is that you do not have to build consumption you can be one single destiny and you can apply that what make a big difference I mean that you do not have problem in terms of confidentiality you do not have the problem of seeking for partners outside your country and having did this scaling problem again the do the negative point is that you can get a half a million total minions funding to the Phase two but you get a nice L&T person of the cost to be covered as a genetic roots it cannot only be perfect we cannot design something perfectly it has to have a contract no kidding it's a very interesting one and the 70 person is definitely of interest for SME that anyhow wanted to grab something okay the first one I go very fast because I we do not have time anymore but I really want for the people who are in the audience which are aware until interested to it then to keep on a scratch a little bit on that domain to be to go and Tulu so the phase one is basically a 50k the duration to drive the work plan the business plan is six months and the further interest is actually when you submit the whole we ensure that you will have a natural within three months and you will get the money within i think four months or five months so it's very short-term things you'll have two figures a little bit later for the phase two is it to be the same so you get the ideas you want to write to develop the ideas of prototyping so we can support prototyping miniaturization design performance verification testing demonstration development of pilot rhymes validation of market replication and arrives and you can ask basically for the cost the funding to be between a half a million's or two and a half million and we support fifty seventy percent of the cost typical duration is basically one to two years and the outcome should be a new product let me kicked out make it an Israeli ready for the market to be not to the market or business innovation can as well because it's not only technology developments or so if you have a new business business strategy business model then you could developed it and with this tool zone okay the ferry is as I said is to support and to have access to support out to go at international level go and read it carefully so we have a typical so this call is open for all the SME but we have a specific one in related to the ICT and it's basically the centers at the same folder and we have 100 million funding and dedicated to that goal so there is money the problem for you well if you want to submit is that there is a lot of competition as well because it's happened to everybody it's very large but people cut it and the 100 million go away so which means that you could apply for it and you could get the money and it's reasonably easy to sue me it's so much easy to submit that we had to constrain a few things is that you cannot submit more than once that you have to wait for the answer in order to be able to submit to the next one it's the only way we could refrain a little bit the submission ok so the propeller for phase 1 i'll not required to prevent time for exploitation and amidst dissemination it makes sense because that's the ideas of draft one you get 50 K in order to draft a business plan on the China phase 2 has to have a business plan in order to be eligible the other aspect is that you can submit work basically whenever you want there is a lot of course the client it's been in snow every two month every three months you'll get a call so as soon as your ideas is ready you go and use a meal and as I said for the phase one it's even more than two months that three months as I said within two months we give you an answer after the recorded line and within three months later you can get you money on the Phase two it's basically the same every three or four months you get a good line and after four month you get the idea that you are in or you're out and after six months you can start the project you have any question and I took me the answer is easy first you google a twenty20 SME work program 6 17 16 and and the general as a nexus is of importance as well for you to be able to read the document be honest I went through it this morning it's about 20 pages will you read the joint appendix and then your convince if it's worth investing into it or not any questions no then we wrap it up Phillip it's being graced to have you
