 good morning and thanks for joining us for today's webinar regarding and privileged attacks and delighted to be joined by David Higgins from cyber-ark apologies for the lack of horde music today from the audience we've had some technical issues in kicking off the webinar hopefully you can all hear me and see my screen those are the instructions screen to the webinar and please do raise your hands and using the chat function if you have any audio issues throat webinar and we will get those addressed and I'm going to kick off zooming on as well and and lead you through our presentation today around securing the keys to your IT Kingdom so that's looking at privileged account security with our guest presenters from say brac just to give you a little bit of background into today's objective and what we are looking to to share with you today we want to give customers insight into how they can respond to the increased volume breaches they exploit privileged accounts and passwords within the organization nearby minimizing the impact of those attacks as for the format for today's and webinar we'll do a very brief bytes intro and if you do know it already so I will keep it brief but will talk you through recent attacks what we need to learn from them introduce cyber-ark and then Sai break and David will take you through detailed presentation on the role of privilege in advanced attacks of how you can what you can do about locking down and your most powerful accounts and some of the analytics that are available in order to track and understand in an automated fashion what's going on with with your privileged accounts will then do a live Q&A at the end which we'd be delighted if you had lots of questions for the presenters today a little bit of housekeeping and first of all lines attending lines will be on mute throughout the webinar and questions are welcome and we will do if your puny at the end as I said so please do post them your questions in chat and we do keep discussions today too technical strategic discussions where of course we are absolutely happy to talk about commercials or any particular technologies or plane and after the webinar and we will keep it to the you know the technical and the strategic to do so and it's not designed to be a sales pitch is designed to talk about how you can address the issue of privileged account and attacks we do have a survey at the end please do take time to fill it in and if you could and just make sure that these sessions continue to meet the marking and providing useful information for you and lastly recording will be available at the end for everyone that has joined us today so that you can review the session at your leisure and share this insight within your way to teens so a little bit about white security partnerships so we're an independent and security reseller up until four years ago when we were purchased by the buyers group and they have largely kept as an as an independent IT security specialist within their group what that allows us to provide customers is agility and specialism from that you would expect from a small independent but then have the backing and the resources to pray their customers that you're available from a large software group and some key points about us and we were very passionate about security education and and the technology niches that we work with this lends itself and shows itself and her partner statuses with them you know with world leading vendors such as cyber our checkpoint etc we're very passionate about retailing the top levels of a possible technical accreditation and support that we can provide people we're also proactive in our search for new technologies and and how to help our customers and businesses out there are future-proof their business against against future threats and that's what one of the reasons we do sessions like today so why is privilege an issue why why is this become an issue in the press and and why are we talking to you about it today so firstly I'm reaching the become far more professional and hackers are increasingly seeking the maximum bang for their buck so if they're going to be trying to input to your organization's they are trying to identify the most powerful accounts the most powerful roots in so that they have to do the least possible to X we'll treat the mass and the most amount of data and do most damage that's firstly coupled with that business is increasingly running far more complex IT estates there's more privileged accounts they're harder to track harder to manually know what's going on with them more password then it just becomes a very Norment tracking them manually it's very difficult and therefore give us those attackers are routed into the organization privilege means attackers can do real damage when they get in much quicker so they are able to actually you know get to their the absolute nitty-gritty of what makes the organization work changing passwords exfiltrating data much quicker and also with much less tree or for security teams to to follow and it's also in credentials as we've seen with your varied attacks in 2015 and continuing though one of the most common routes inside the firm in target were taken down by stolen credentials from one of their suppliers and the list goes on in order of various hacks that actually have had privileged battery at their heart so with that in mind I'm gonna get off the line and hand over to David and saibra to talk to you about how you can create a strategy around protecting the privileged accounts in your organization how you can ensure your most powerful access points can be protected and how you can know what's going on within your privileged estate and that I'm just going to hand over to David from cyber-ark and thanks everyone for joining us and I'll be back online for the Q&A at the end David are you on the light I am yeah thank you very much hopefully you can see my my screen I can indeed I'm just gonna put myself on mute now to avoid any feedback great thanks very much okay good morning everybody thank you for your time today so see you in line with the kind introduction I guess wanted to set the context of my presentation today which it's probably linked to something you you're all familiar with as a kind of change in an approach and and the culture error and breaches and that the kind of mindset these days is not so much when you're going to be breached but it's more case of having the mindset that organizations have been breached and that they will be breached again and looking at putting controls and processes in place with that mindset actually having a slightly different view of looking to not prevent attacks but actually prevent them from happening again and when they do occur actually provide kind of containment and limit the EM that the the way that attackers can actually move within the organization and that's going to be my focus really is is how to attack as once they breach the perimeter which is becoming a quite a fuzzy line these days as to what the perimeter is how to attack has achieved that kind of lateral movement and from my focus here at cyber which is focusing on unproved account security we see that in a hundred percent of data breaches stolen credentials were used and it's not just any type of credential here typically we're talking about those admin level accounts the initiative level accounts that allow attackers to move all really within the organization to ultimately get to their target to get well where they want to be whether that's to bring a system down with that it's to steal data mister privileged accounts that attackers are after and we're not just talking about state-sponsored attacks here we're talking about cyber criminals and even hack service and of course inside a breaches all very much have difficult different political drivers but they all have to get the same thing at some point which is to get that privileged access and it kind of introduces an additional security layer now when we have that mindset that actually regardless of what the attackers are going to do regardless what they're after privileged accounts is something that they need we actually see a new security layer coming out through this you've got the typical types of security perimeter controls and monitoring etc but the heart of the enterprise needs to be protected because these embedded accounts like root administrator or additional privileged accounts that been created main admin accounts whatever it may be these are the accounts that allow operational support users to move across the estate to connect to servers to connect to assets to perform admin functions so it's natural is actually these accounts that attackers are after because again allows them to move laterally across the estate and to get the access that they need and now I'll break down a an example in a few slides of time to talk exactly how that's done well I think before doing that it's probably worth just introducing what is privileged or what is a privileged account you know I think probably a few years ago if you'd asked people what proves you can't lose their amoebic just sort of well it's it's the root account in UNIX it's the administrator in Windows it's those godlike accounts that come with every piece of software and hardware that you purchase that you can't get rid of you actually need to set those systems up but I feel the the definition has really changed or not changed but evolved those accounts absolutely are part of privileged scope but it's all the other accounts that actually are created and built you know a service accounts application accounts all the accounts on the various systems that you see whether that just be on the premise data but as we move across the cloud more more privileged accounts are introduced by this process because you've got the underlying virtualization you've got the administrative accounts for things like 80 versus zero etc even ACS systems industrial control systems all have privileged accounts within them to control those remote systems and we even have accounts that we create for our admin users so we rather than give them give admin rights to their normal BAU account we create a secondary accounts David Higgins dot admin and what we end up doing is creating more and more privileged accounts so we get to a position where most organizations have three to four times the number of privileged accounts and they do human users and if you think about the amount of time that we invest and focus on things our IT identity access management that's actually only there for looking at maybe 20% of all the accounts they have in your estate that x-ray see percent that's because of the attackers there the accounts that they want because if they get hold of one of these privileged accounts that's gonna allow them to move across the state that's going to allow them connect to databases that's holding your client or sensitive information and maybe it's kind of reposition that the mindset here if we think about perimeter controls and perimeter security and if you purchase a new firewall and you punch that into your into your data center the first rule that is always on a firewall is deny everything and then what we do is we add the relevant rules in the firewall to allow the relevant access that we need out or in to the organization will I see when I talk to all notations about identity access but more specifically about privileged access this rule is actually kind of flipped on its head we end up giving users full up in access because it allows them to do what they need to do but it also allows them to do a hell a lot more than they actually need to do so the rule actually seems to be impervious access it's actually allow everything and then retrospectively we'll try to find ways and means to strip back that access and that actually becomes quite a complicated process and it's very difficult to do even though it's difficult to do officer natively with an operating systems or all or systems such as windows where there's no gray area it is very much your and you're a full-blown admin or you're not this there's no nice middle ground and various other solutions out there are other systems especially the legacy ones Rhys trouble with that ability to to control when users should be getting privileged access when they're not and we end up in a situation where we have kind of standing access where our admin users our support users operation users have full admin access to the estate which obviously they need the admin access they need that to do that job but they have the access whenever they want there's no kind of control when the user access it's no kind control acts approval or workflow to say ok although you do need admin access to this server you should only be using it in a genuine or a genuine reason such as maybe when there's an incident or there's a change to implement or a problem to respond to it's a kind of free roaming standing access that makes it a difficult to control when privilege is being used but also difficult to detect when privilege is being abused in an attack says so going back to my early statistic these accounts are used in a hundred percent of data breaches but if we don't have a good grasp on how they're being used or when they should be used it's difficult to spot what is a genuine activity compared to what is a malicious activity because a lot of these accounts are generic we can't attribute them to an end user so let me um I mentioned I'm at kind of diving into a breach and talking about where privileged play the role so I've got an example data breach here which which is of course based on a real-life example but for reasons all that customer I will I will keep their name sanitized what always starts off with in these attacks that you can imagine and I'm sure you've heard many times is it starts off with some kind of phishing attack specifically in this case it was an executive spear phishing attack that went after execs of this organization and their breach point that lying at the bottom of the slide represents the breach or represents the perimeter the breach point was they went after executives in the company they ping l'instant emails which was he contained links and malware and a single executive and that link openly wrong attachment okay so now they've breached the perimeter and the the thing that made the attackers life even more easy in this place was that the executive user was actually running with local admin rights on on his or her machine and various reasons why there may have been and I'm sure many of those reasons are jumping to mind right now which is you know the executive users sat at home they want to install a printer they want to install some new software and windows are saying you don't have admin rights so obviously what they do they pick up a firm they call eyeties support desk and say I need the access to install this and I need it now okay so what do we do we can either give them the admin password which we probably don't want to do because most organizations have the same admin password for every single workstation so having the admin password for one workstation would allow me to log on to any workstation so the next logical step is well we'll we'll put their account and we'll put it in the local administrators group now that user is a local admin and connections store whatever they want and that's the danger they can assault whatever they want or maybe stuff they're not aware of because they're clicking on links so we're opening attachments and that's where this attack site cycle started that user open an attachment that contain malware it was deployed with local admin rights and then the attacker was in their head there their initial footprint no initial foothold and what the attackers do at this point if they start looking for more access and you'll see that the error there is is cyclic and that's a reason because this happens several times in a stack process and there's different techniques that they use in in this initial instance what they did is they rally a process or attack process called pass the hash which is specifically focus in the winners environment and for those you're not familiar well I'll just briefly skim over it it's where every time you log into a Windows laptop desktop the credentials that you use are hashed on that machine which is why if you're sat on a train or in the plane in your login it authenticates you it doesn't need to continually just talk back to the domain controller your credentials are hashed within the machine no hashes at one-way algorithms same input same output so what happened in this process is previously three days prior to the attack or the breach occurring help des administrator had actually logged on to this workstation and nikodem insurance were there for hashed on that workstation that helped desecrator has been there therefore log into other workstations other servers you know if it's a desktop support team they of course need access to the desktops and laptops but they're probably also connecting to servers that are running antivirus running various other things back up monitoring whatever it may be that user was using the same account to access the desktops there the saidman account if you will that they were using to access the service so when the attackers run pass the hash they found a hash credential for this help desk user and as it's a one-way algorithm same input same output the same hash persisted on other machines that that user had accessed now what I've seen generally in in the field is that these secondary admin accounts that we create in the Windows environment typically have non-expiring passwords or they have a much longer expiration on the password because it becomes such an overhead for the support teams and the ops teams to remember to change these passwords this made it again this made an additional footprint for the for the attacker they could take this hash from the workstation and they use it to basically make a remote connection to other systems that that you had connected to and therefore started the process of the lateral movement this repeated process that occurs in the tax cycle where the attackers are looking for credentials so at this point they gain access to a server so now they've moved actually from the workstation of state from that tier they're now in a service day and what are they looking for well they're looking for more access continually that might be a repeated process of pass the hash over pass the hash it might even be looking for hard-coded credentials attackers love are coded credentials because basically once to run a server they find a file it's got credentials in it great that might be an application might be a script it might be an application that's connecting to a database and if they're after the database they're sold in customer information and they find hard-coded credentials in a script on that server their life becomes a hell of a lot easier they've got the username they put the password they've got the database details there's not much more they need to do than just open up an ad PC connection string and they're in that database as an admin user what happened actually in this specific attack cycle is they got access admin access to the domain controller and at this point in time once the gain access of the main controller it's kind of a jackpot for the attackers they can invoke something called a golden ticket attack which will allow them to impersonate basically write their own Kerberos tickets they can person any user in the in the organization and these kind of attacks are very what I don't say very con but these kind of attack C are executed a lot in the high profile breaches that you would have heard of and because the attackers can actually write their own Kerberos tickets they can have person at any user it becomes very difficult for organizations to actually realize they're under attack and that attackers are moving around their organization and it's not until usually a third party calls them up and say do you know you've been breached we're seeing your data all over the black market that they realize they've been hacked I'd say that's the high percentage and most attacks it's not the organization who finds out it's someone else telling them that they've been hacked usually a government organization now I've been working in this industry of privilege for about eight years now on a seeing various I guess practices that that are make sense as to why that they're being done there's it there's a usually an operational reason why bees and processes are in place but these processes as well make the attackers life easier it's these kind of processes as well of course you know vulnerabilities and the machines themselves Felicity certain processes that attackers are leveraging I mentioned one before and I won't go through all of these one-by-one but I just pick out a few so local admin accounts on whether that be Windows environments of UNIX environments or the enable account in Cisco etc whatever it may be these are accounts that at some point operation support teams are going to need so if we got 10,000 workstations it's without a proper solution a place or process in place the most logical option that let the organization's take is will will set the same build account saying build password on every workstation and will store that password somewhere maybe you know in a password protected spreadsheet or will put it in a physical safe somewhere but it's the same password on every single workstation so if just one password is compromised if that one password is compromised then of course I can now gain access as the local administrator to any web session because it's the same password how coded credentials are mentioned are an easy loop for the attackers in the clear passwords that are in it in a script in a text file makes it very easy for the attackers to gain access to these accounts they just need to do that lateral movement get onto a server with such as script exists and it's not just passwords we're talking about here it's also SSH keys because both of these are used to achieve authentication authentication is a privileged account on to a target server we see SSH keys use it in a very similar way not just off see the fact that keys of C reside on users machines and servers but they're also used by applications they're using scripts that using codes and without having visible where all the private and public keys are it kinda becomes very difficult to understand where the with the attack process could take place it's very difficult to understand which keys are actually generally being news of which done because lack of visibility you know bottom line corner is is one of the key issues here and it's actually one of the reasons why many organizations move to kind of separate domain admin accounts for their admin users we've shied away from using generic accounts because we want that accountability of whose see what sister them and when and that kind of works an extent for the for the auditing on the local operating system but we still have the problem of generic accounts the admin account exists the root account exists sa exists you know can't get away from the problem of generic accounts but of course many organizations create the secretary admin accounts in the window space so they know who it is connecting to a server a particular point in time the challenge with that actually and the reason I've got it listed here as being a process to expose it is it creates more admin accounts and typically these these named admin accounts that would create are set to non-expiring passwords because the admin teams complain that they're constantly having to remember two or three passwords and constantly change them they usually have standing access as well so there might be actually just simply plunked into the domain admin group and therefore have blanket access to all the servers in the estate they're an ideal tactic target for the attackers get hold of one of those accounts I can now access pretty much any server in the estate it's it's a full admin account okay so as I say I don't wanna go through all of these but these are just examples of things that have picked out of my time working in the user tree as two potential processes that attackers can expose now obviously compliance in order to have a view on this and I wanted to share the compliance view when it comes to privilege before I kind of go through best practices as there is to how to mitigate the impact of it of a breach these are excerpts have taken from just two compliant regulations around Sox and PCI and it is something the regulator is aware of it is something the regulators are driving home you should you should address the the privet accounts the admin accounts that give us access to sensitive data and customer data this challenge where the compliance a regulator view is usually it's only focus on a subset of systems our PCI relevant systems are Sox all that relevant systems it's not a view that takes place across the entire estate attackers view though is that they're not if one elements secure they're gonna look for that hole they're going to constantly probe specially those kind of state sponsor detectors persistent threats the constantly program they're looking for those weaknesses they're looking for those holes in the fence that will allow them to get access to your organization so although our PCI we to service or a Sox related service maybe lockdown we still got chinks in the armor we still got Lee servers that we see we obviously as much of a risk but actually once those servers are compromised then there's routes and accesses from there into the arrestee estate that Levent rather than access to those more lockdown systems so what I'll talk about now is is how to reduce the risk of previous account exports let's mention in the stat right hundred percent of the time these accounts are used in in breaches in attacks so how can we go about reducing the risk associated with what attackers are doing and I think you know that the logical thing to mention here is you know there is no foolproof solution there is no a hundred percent silver bullet that's going to make sure that no organization never breached and in fact going back to my very first slide the mindset that I'm seeing more and more is we've been breached we're going to be breached again what can we do to contain that breach I think that's the key thing here not necessarily be other mindset oh yeah we're no one's I go into organization because the perimeter is so blurred these days going to you know third parties going to cloud etc that the perimeter is becoming very blurred so the likelihood is your parameter will be breached and the question really is how do you contain that breach how do you stop the attackers moving laterally well the first thing is also you just ask some sensible questions review your current privileged access workflows you can't prove his access methodology and look to implement a standardized strategy for controlling that access and I'll come back to this point and talk about some some best practices and ways and means to do this but it's it's an approach that needs to be taken on every single layer within your IT estate not just at the OS layer but we're talking about your network infrastructure which one many databases in your applications business applications as well you know when we talk about network is it's not just you know you switches and your Reuters but what about your your remote KVM access your Eylau and RAC access all of these layers have privileged accounts within them and all of them will be leveraged if they can by the attackers and this is a nice video that I think represents the the attack process that I just talked about and a few we can logically break down the tiers of access so the attack is first of all the endpoint that's the external facing point that's what they go after once on the endpoint they then want to get into your organization they want to move up to the next stair to the server estate then once so they're if they can get onto a domain controller it can use something like golden ticket they can start in personally and use it they want and what I often see is that organizations have the same accounts that can access all three tiers so if I can compromise an account there's accessing work stations accessing service access and demand controllers that lateral movement because a lot more easier one of the best practices coming out you know not just from several from from Microsoft is saying well let's break down the access let's stop this lateral movement let's stop these the this is kind of moving between tiers it takes place and actually look at that containment again what do I do if my endpoints are breach well let's contain the access if they find an account and the attackers are going to look for an account if they find an attack account on a workstation that account shouldn't be able to move vertically just horizontally create a set of accounts that are specifically focused purely for the management of the workstations and nothing else the accounts can access those workstations should not be permitted to access the service and the accounts to access the service shouldn't be permitted to access the domain controllers so it's looking at again that kind of containment now creating these tiers create some management overhead you know how do we manage this so that if I'm a user that needs to access all three tiers does that mean I have four accounts five accounts and again I'll come back to this how we approach this within within the cyber ops space about allowing users to get the access that they need and nothing more and make sure we've got these tears these isolations on making that breach difficult or making that a lateral movement more difficult and actually before doing this the first thing actually so understand is what is your current position because most organizations don't have a good grasp of where all the privileged accounts are projects are spun up service accounts are created for those projects though maybe not necessary documented centrally or in a kind of standardized way and the visibility of where all these accounts become slightly blurred it's also difficult for organizations to understand how their accounts are being used so right again focusing here on Windows but we're talking all infrastructure here not just windows if I dive into Windows what happens if I have an account do I know what Services is running scheduled tasks application pools etc you know many of these accounts are non-expiring so clearly our best practice is to make sure these passwords rotate on a regular basis if I change the password for a domain account is that going to break a service how do I know where it is so one of the things that we do a server occurs and this tool that you're seeing on the screen is our DNA tool is - free of charge of utility and we provided to customers and prospects alike to help their understanding of what their privileged account scope is right now where are all the private accounts and what it does is it scans the estate windows in UNIX and it comes back with a report line by line of every account that exists that has access to the service when that account was last used well no passwords last changed and in the windows world it all start to map out your vulnerability to attack techniques just pass the hash so what it's saying here is if a particular file server was compromised here file server one if that one server was compromised and an attacker ran past the hash where could they move to laterally where else could they get to in your estate and that's what there's black arrows to know this is just one server needs to be compromised for the rest of the estate but you can see they're linked by black arrows and this is exactly what the attackers are doing it's that continual looking for for credentials to allow them to move with a need to be they never land where they want to end up they move several times across the estate looking for that access and what I've got next is actually an example from the field this is the results from from a UK organization who ran this utility and as you can see one one server being compromised and and the map pretty much goes black the arrows go everywhere and this comes back to that standing access that I talked about this the number of accounts that we have out there that could access any server any workstation near a stay and when we come back to that containment it becomes difficult right just that one is one ones that ever being compromised the attackers gonna be able to move move to the other blocks that you can see on the slide so let's um let's talk a bit about best practice and talking about all the problems but what can we do to implement that kind of containment I think the first thing and the most logical thing is putting processes in place to protect and manage these privileged accounts and it's not just the passwords is the SSH keys as well so creating a control point securing these accounts in a digital vault so taking out things like key pass taking them out of things like spreadsheets with a password on them and putting them in a lockdown hardened environment where there's there's multiple tiers of encryption and that these accounts are being managed so on a regular basis the passwords and the keys are being rotated whether that be able 30 days or after use we're rotating them we're setting them to be different customers and every machines even though it's the same username administrator that look I've been on every workstation or root in the UNIX we're making sure that on each instance of that account is a different password being set and we create a control point of this by this so we now have a situation where all approach accounts are being managed the step to put unique random value that the IT teams don't know and it's a control point so now as an IT avenues of what I need to do is I need to go to your vault I need to request access to that credential and therefore what we can do is we can define access controllers we can make sure that the right users are giving the right access at the right time but we're making it more difficult for either that malicious insider or that external attacker to find the credentials because they're now locked away they're encrypted that continually rotating the pass the hash becomes more difficult because the same hash isn't residing in multiple machines because we could enforce things like one-time password after I've used an account is then automatically changed by the system so the hash that's on one system will be different to the other again just making that that process that'll actually move it more difficult start to look at that containment having a central repository for accounts means that we could also start looking at those two tearing their Microsoft recommend I could log into the vault and actually see my workstation account my server Tirek error my domain controller tier account I don't need to know the passwords anymore I just need to know that I have access to the vault and that access is governed with two-factor authentication is integrated with change management so I'm only getting access to these accounts if I've got a genuine change record or instant got a problem number the next thing that addresses how are the users actually gaining access to these systems going back to the attack cycle one of the things that's compromises the fact that those users typically have network access direct access to the sensitive assets what they're supporting what they're managing our recommendation is to break that is to provide isolation make it difficult for the malware that's running on that desktop to have access to your critical assets provide a layer of containment we're talking about here kind of brokering sessions not sending credentials to the end-user actually launching the session for a user on a proxy server and then connecting them to where they need to be so the users still get the access that they need it's just the route that they take is through a hop so that that malware can't see the sensitive assets anymore all it can see is it can see your brokers it makes again it makes that containment feasible it starts to create that containment that makes it difficult for the attackers to start moving around and isolates your sensitive assets and what we can also do here there's an area for brokering access we actually start monitoring what users are doing without having to worry about the complication of agents we actually monitor all the sessions running on the broker and start to understand command by command key short by keystroke exactly what your open users whether they be internal or external users are actually doing on your systems eradicate hard-coded passwords it's a logical one the visual on there on the slide is is deliberate putting hard-coded passwords in scripts and text files is almost like leaving the keys in the door if I get onto a server that's got a hard-coded credentials crypt then I've got the key I need to connect to that database that may be containing customer information may be containing sensitive assets our approach recommendation is actually to take the passwords out of those scripts eradicate hard code as has put them in the vault but then with the rest of your interactive accounts and then provide mechanisms and processes for those applications the scripted processes to request the password on the fly as it needs it and what we can then do is authenticate the application make sure what is the genuine application requesting the password because the password is no longer hard-coded we've eradicate that problem of attacker seeing it but we're also making sure that these passwords which are typically non-expiring and now being managed because we can put them in those additional controls image before we can put them in the vault rotate the password on a regular basis and the application doesn't care it just needs to know that it course it calls the vault we call side rack every time it wants the password and there's no one outside to make so I'm to reduce the risks and to mitigate the risk associate with approach account exploit but the other areas as well that we need to address one is that this kind of you know as you can probably guess from the slide this kind of one ring rules the mobile approach where you've got this one app in account that has full admin access across a server or multiple servers typically though when we think about who's accessing machines you know say to DBA who's accessing the UNIX server they may be allowed to su tu brute because they've got to do maintenance on the database and some of the commands that they need to run in the UNIX estate I need them to be root level so the easiest thing well look you can su tu brute but at DBA doesn't need to do everything they don't need to create new users reset passwords format disks etc there's only a small subset of commands that they need to do same thing applies on the windows estate there's only a small subset of things that users genuinely need to do so the best practical recommendation is once those privileged accounts are under control they're in a they're in a vault that rotated to manage that we're monitoring their usage is it actually start to trim back access implement least privileged give users the commands and and they access that they need but nothing more so intimate kind of on-demand elevation of Rights but then also address why you know going back to my attack example why users have full I'm in access on their workstation why that user said I need admin access because they just want to install an application so then also implementing application whitelisting black this year and also gray listing on the endpoint estate making the deployment of Malwa again making that process more difficult actually controlling which applications were going to allow to install rather than giving the user full admin access will say well here's our trusted apps and I want this here's the ones we clearly don't like in the blacklist and any of those that we don't know developers are always always key for this constantly finding new applications they want or any of those that we don't know well we may allow to install but we're going to isolate what it can do we're going to say can't access file shares it can't call back to the Internet I you can't call home if it's a piece of malware and we're going to keep it in that kind of contained state until we get better understanding of what that application is so our solution also approaches that both the least privileged on the service thing but also that application control on the endpoint state looking to protect you from end to end when it comes to these privileged account exploits and everything I've talked about so far is very much on that kind of protection and containment side the other key thing is that the texture and response knowing that in a hundred percent of attacks privileged accounts are used we know what the attackers are going after therefore we can also have focused analytics when it comes to detecting threats and that's our approaches well we have a bit of a threat analytics tool that specifically focuses on the privileged that account activity and flags when suspicious activities are caring now that could be excessive usage strange location users somewhere connecting from an IP address that they don't typically connect from an and that's often the case in the tax rate you need these attacks that done by sips state-sponsored attackers are coming from a different part of the world and strangely enough those people like to operate 9:00 to 5:00 in their local time zone but it's not the local time zone of the user that's been exploited it could be also looking at whether someone's trying to circumvent your controls the other thing that we're doing as well is actually we're providing a solution that I'll actually detect with when techniques such as passed the hash over pass the hash or golden ticket are being used so it actually said well why she alerts you do you know someone's exported your system they're using golden ticket you need to respond to that in some situations our solution will respond automatically maybe issue a password reset but the main thing is it's giving that visibility is allowing you to detect yourselves when you've been attacked as opposed to waiting months before you get a phone call from the government organization telling you that you have been so this is also keys is that you need to combine they're both the the proactive controls and the detection techniques together so that you know you're containing you know we're making it more difficult for the attackers to move around you can hanging up reach you're monitoring the usage and you've got the analytics piece sitting on top to let you know when potentially it's taking place and to visualize how we kind of see everything hanging together this is this is our standardized approach for projects it's what we're seeing many organizations now adopt as an approach or reaction to what we're seeing when it comes to these these high are these sophisticated attacks it doesn't provide a standardized approach for not just your internal admins but your third parties that you're outsourcing services to a standardized approach for them ticketing privileged access controlling the way the applications gain access as well doing that account management controlling those act those accounts so that they manage their encrypted they're protected when monitoring what users are doing when those accounts and while providing that threat detection to ultimately mitigate your risk and reduce the attack service associate to privileged accounts and then when is grating with things like siem solutions just a selection shown on-screen so that this is now coming coming part of your overarching cyber security strategy this isn't a separate process this is integrated with the SIEM this is integrating with with your change management solutions and standardizing that approach for users to gain privileged access into your estate so kind of next steps what I suggest is that as my take away or or a next step when looking at this particular area of security first ik contact your byte represent eight representative to talk about the DNA tool as I mentioned this is a free of charge utility it doesn't require installation it just we send it as an executable that you can put on a workstation and put on a server and what it will do is I mentioned before is it will scan your server estate and it will come back with all the previous accounts where they are how they're being used when they were last use when the password was last set so you start to get an understanding of how many compliant accounts you have and when I say compliant passwords being changed within your your policy of say 60 days of 90 days it will also scan in the UNIX world it I should give you a similar map to what you see for pass the hash but for SSH keys show you where your keys are your key trusts where the private and public keys are it also goes on to scan application servers such as WebSphere WebLogic to give you an understanding of where hard-coded credentials are in JDBC connection strings as well increasing your visibility of where all your previous accounts are because that's the baseline you need to understand where you are right now before you can get to where you want to be once up running we also have a threat assessment report which is linked to the analytics engine so this threat assessment report analyzes all the previous accesses taking place and comes back with the kind of most suspected accounts of credential theft you can't so you need to look into and that's the key thing with the threat analytics is because we're targeting just privileged accounts it's providing certainly I need to see the wood from the trees actually saying you know you had 10,000 connections took place today but you know it's these five that you want to look into it's these five that could actually potentially be the tell-tale signs of insider abuse or malicious activity from external party again if you're interested in this contact your bytes representative representative and we're happy to get this set up for you from from my side these are all the slides that were on through to say my aim was to give you an understanding of of how we perceive privileged accounts being exploited in the attack process and what some of the perks practice is and approaches that we're taking to help organizations lock themselves down and become a much tougher target from the attackers perspective so at this point I think we've got a got a few minutes left in terms of the session but really I hand back over to you to the team of bytes and see if there any questions that came through and take it from there thank you very much thank you very much David can you just confirm you can hear me I can indeed yeah lovely and so at this point and we haven't had any questions come through during the presentation but if you've got anything that you'd like to ask David providing privileged analytics regarding common threat root succession please do take the time to pop was in the the questions box and then we will post over to David answer them on the line and any that that may be coming across for from a funeral that needs further follow-up we can obviously pass to your account managers at bytes as well I'll just give it 30 seconds so I'll give you a minute or two to pop some thoughts down some questions down and all that remains for me to do part of that really is to thank David for his very comprehensive presentation today and thank you all very much for taking time out of your very busy schedules to listen to to the webinar today and just reiterate as well that the session has been recorded so we'll make sure that that shared with you and in the next couple of days and also please do take the time to fill in the short survey at the end so we can make sure that these such sessions are prevailing relevant and useful information for you as I'll just give you 30 seconds more to a minute to see if there's any other questions and otherwise we will get off the liner and let you get on with the rest of your day okay so I haven't had any further questions come through I can assume that the David discovered a fairly comprehensive overview certainly food for thought on a subject of privilege and how you can think about managing those types of threats to your organization thank you very much David I am for joining us today thanks everyone for their time in joining us and I look forward to welcome you to future webinars in the future thank you very much thanks everyone thank you
