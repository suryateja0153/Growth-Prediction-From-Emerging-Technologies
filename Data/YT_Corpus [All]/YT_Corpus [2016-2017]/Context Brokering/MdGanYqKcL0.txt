 but I'm delighted to welcome Kim rye Holtz tonight professor of Egyptology and director of the papyrus carlsberg collection and project at the University of Copenhagen Denmark we first met I think about 25 years ago so Kim how did we get so old when did this happen that was back at the Museum of Fine Arts across the river so tonight's topic is a fascinating one especially in light of what's happening in the antiquities trade in the Middle East today and trade is maybe a word I should use in quotation marks so tonight we're going to take the longer view and look back a little bit and gain some perspective on how it all got going dr. ray Holt received his PhD in Egyptology from the University of Copenhagen and he's been teaching there on the faculty since 1998 he specializes in ancient Egyptian philology with an emphasis on Egyptian political and social history literature and libraries nationalism and identity formation and administration and archives is there anything he does not specialize in you may be asking yourselves his extensive research has included study of collections and archives throughout Europe the United States and Egypt and empty conducts visit several times a year and it's been doing that since 1989 from 2008 to 2013 he also served as director of the university center for canon and identity formation in the earliest literate societies he's been the editor of the carlsberg papyri series since 2000 and is also a member of the editorial boards of studies in ancient near-eastern research and the Journal of Egyptian history other distinctions include election to the royal danish academy of science and letters in 2011 and the inner hanson I hope I'm pronouncing that right in our Henson's award for outstanding research in the humanities in 2009 in 2003 he also co-founded the Danish Egypt illogical Research Foundation so if you're not convinced already that he's a very busy man in recent years I'll tell you that he's been invited to deliver over 25 international lectures including extended engagements at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore the University of California Berkeley Penn State and also Yale University so the list of accomplishments as you can guess now goes on and on but we will never get to the lecture if I keep going so please join me now in welcoming professor Kim rifled to speak on collectors and dealers the trade of Egyptian antiquities thank you Peter for that much too kind introduction this great pleasure and honor for me to be back in Boston after so many years and stand before you tonight as a young student I was given the opportunity to work as an intern in the Egyptian collection at the Museum of Fine Arts by the newly appointed director Rita freed Who am very happy to see here tonight with her husband and Peter took very good care of me during my stay my internship had a very direct impact on my research interest and also on my early career the introduction to the excavation records of George enter Reisner and the MFA archives in general made me aware of the enormous potential of archival research with in Egyptology the paper that i will present to you this evening is precisely that an exercise in archival research and I'm very happy for the opportunity to express my gratitude to both rita and peter once again tonight before I begin I would like to add that the present paper is the result of a joint project with my colleague fracked Eric Hagen at the University of Copenhagen the project is now complete and will hopefully be published within the foreseeable future Egyptian galleries in Western museums are almost invariably the most popular ones in their respective institutions attracting thousands of visitors every year and this is no coincidence such institutions have invested heavily in these collections over generations by sponsoring archaeological excavations and displaying the objects brought back from the field the majority of Egyptian art projects currently on display in museums however were not excavated by archaeological missions they were acquired through the iniquitous market the circumstances of the requisition our frequently obscure and until recently we're very rarely considered relevant in scholarly publications yet the acquisition policies of museums and collectors above all the decisions about which types of objects to acquire have played a decisive role in determining what empirical data or material is available for study and hints have if only indirectly dictated research agendas certain object categories and historical periods have traditionally been favored over others and as a result of this certain groups of source material are under-represented this bias in acquisition has inevitably affected the market and the efforts that were made to secure the most profitable objects moreover virtually all objects acquired on the market with disassociated from the archaeological context and assemblages found together we're often split up sometimes for practical reasons sometimes to optimize profits what I would like to do this evening is not just to describe the mechanics of the Integrity's market and the legislation governing the trade but also to take you back in time and introduce you to some of the people and the venues through which the antiquities flowed the impetus for research into the Egyptian antiquities trade was provided by the comprehensive a chiral material relating to the Danish Egyptologist hence Austin felt longer who was the chief of the royal library for many years and later founded the Danish Technological department at the University of Copenhagen this material includes very detailed travel Diaries from his to visit to Egypt you see them here on the overhead as well as numerous photographs and several thousand letters langa and his wife Jana first visited Egypt in 1899 through 1900 for a period of ten months long had been employed by the Egyptian Museum to produce the official catalog of Middle Kingdom stele a in collaboration with his German colleague hi by shaeffer he visited Egypt only once more in 1929 through 1934 period of five months he used both opportunities to acquire antiquities for the two largest his collections the new cards per clip to take and the danish national museum and in his diaries he provides detailed descriptions of the market and specific dealers Jana langa for her part was a skilled photographer and was responsible for nearly all the photographs taken during both visits including this dealer published in the museum catalogue she also contributed many of the entrance in the Diaries the two main questions I will focus on are the geography and the demography of the in sequence trade in other words what were the venues for the trade and who were the dealers not surprisingly Integrity's could be acquired at almost every larger archaeological site however the bulk of the trade was concentrated in a limited number of places the foremost were in geographical order Alexandria Cairo and cough al-ahram in the north and Luke's in the south in order to make the most of the limited time I have available this evening I shall try to merge the questions of geography and demography in what follows the dealers can roughly be classified as applied on the screen one group of individuals consisted of those involved in the actual discovery of the artifacts which subsequently ended up in the market this was almost invariably a local occurrence where local inhabitants either by design that is looting or by accident for example digging for fertilizer gained possession of objects that they then sold to sell a partial exception was the common practice among workmen on archaeological missions of forming small fines and sometimes not so small fines and then selling these off-site longer reports in his travel diary that it was rumored at the time that appearances excavations at Abu blows over half the objects found were stolen by his own workers who sold them to in sequences dealers and collectors this may be an exaggerated figure but another prominent Egyptologist reports to the egypt exploration society in nine 35 and a quote that the general agreement in Egypt is that anything from ten to twenty percent of the total number fines of any excavation are stolen unquote a number of you geologists and other academically trained individuals who were in Egypt for professional reasons were also involved in the antiquities trade two prominent Egyptologists were howard carter and ludwig borchardt and you see here howard carter together with another prominent antiquities dealer movies Nachman i will return to him in a moment and on the right is how long and his wife and luda four shot and his wife Mimi both kada and borchardt used their Egypt illogical knowledge and experience to position themselves as key agents for Anglo American and German collectors and museums respectively to given examples of the profits that might be made Carter on one occasion earned eight thousand Egyptian pounds brokering a deal and enormous sums some of mine in those days by way of comparison this equaled no less than six years salary for the director-general of the Egyptian and secretive service a number of businessmen were also involved in the trade and invested money in large-scale trading an example is the euro cough and Austrian carpet dealer who was based in Vienna but had officers in Alexandria and Cairo he became vault in the integrity straight with considerable success in the 1870s through the 1890s securing tens of thousands of papyri from the film region of Egypt the bulk of the famous for young portraits you see one here the vast majority of the equally famous amanha tablets and also important groups of mainly late antique textiles and many other end sequences among the Egyptian dealers who made a professional career out of dealing and secretive this situation was not the same all over Egypt in the nineteenth and early twentieth century consular agents dominated the market at Luxor in the south here now known for its famous temples the car not simple and many other temples all the consular agents at Luke's are sold and secretive but the English and German agents who both have their residence within the luxor temple itself controlled nearly the whole market this is a contemporary picture of Luke so you see the temple here the key when you arrived to look so here's the temple again along the Nile near the house of the German consular agent and here look from across the Nile again the house of the German consul agent and the British Consulate in here in the background behind the colonnade the constant consul general of any given nation in Egypt was a high official appointed by the nation in question and often the Citizen of the same he possessed certain judicial powers including the right to detain and take into custody any one of corresponding nationality who was involved in a suspected of criminal behavior while in Egypt formerly the role of the Consul General was to facilitate an oversea trade and advance the mercantile interest of the nation those appointed as consular agents were generally local businessmen of standing frequently said to be the richest in the areas but often without any formal ties to the country they represented and often even not even able to speak a language some visitors remain mystified by this arrangement and could not understand why the office of consul consular agents should be so attractive to Egyptians it was not well well paid if at all but in practice the special status granted diplomatic immunity which could come in anti-indian sequences trade this datos not only made it possible for consoles to arrange their own illegal excavations in order to acquire in sequences but also maiden them immune to most attempts by the integrated service to restrict the trade perhaps the best known example of consular agent using his diplomatic immunity to protect his illegal activities is Mustafa acha a former slave trader who served first as American consular agent at Luxor and later as the combined British Russian Belgian council agent he built a modest house between the colonnade here in the luxor temple and you see here very rare picture of mustafa akka and some of his many children who stuff Agha was the patron of the infamous up the result brothers who found the royal care the famous cache of royal mom is in the Theban West Bank around 1871 some of the mammals and much of the associated burial equipment was sold off over the next decade before the brothers were arrested one of the apt ur Rasool brothers who tried in vain to invoke his patrons diplomatic status as protection during the proceedings was imprisoned interrogated and apparently beaten and tortured in the process was tough Ark himself remained a free man throughout the process as a direct consequence of the affair he was deprived of his Belgium consulship he also feared to his British consulship but in contemporary American businessmen noted and I quote it is not very likely that the English government will revoke Mustafa for this he who sells in sequences to Englishman whence they come after a few years into the British Museum unquote and indeed the British authorities decided to take no action consular status also conferred a number of other benefits and this data is compiled with considerable personal wealth made many of them very powerful with stuff Agra for example is know to avoid avoided paying taxes for many years precisely because of his consular status the most prominent antiquities dealer it looks at the time however we us to tres puntos the German consul agent who resided in this resident right across from mr. Farkas tutors Beulah's was active already in the 1860s and was later succeeded by his son muharram sutras the ladder resigned as German consular agent in 1914 because of the outbreak of the First World War and his house at Luxor was immediately expropriated so that the area below could be excavated although he had lost his diplomatic immunity he was able to continue his driving antiquities trade from another house of his the business later passed on to his son saga rep suitors who came under observation by the integrity service in the 1970s and his storage facility was sealed on his death in 1978 and later confiscated by the in secret service and thus ended a family business that had extended over more than a century contemporary with the consular agents in the south edwin's at cafe haram the so-called pyramid village many of them related to one another dominated the market in the north the village was located below the desert plateau with the extensive Old Kingdom necropolis at ISA yeah just across from Cairo ya contemporary map showing the three great pyramids and here the village of cough al-haram mislabeled in fact in in this map this is the approach to cough and iram during the inundation here car firearm in here picture taken by hence longer or finally Shaffer and his wife together with a couple of dealers and agents of other dealers and sent out to fetch them and here the outskirts of the village the village was located below the desert plateau with the extensive ok Old Kingdom necropolis smaller tubes cut into the cliffs can here be seen the background vaguely made out perhaps Petrus trusted assistant al jabri who helped him while he was working at the pyramid lived in the village and also dealt with antiquities and he kept his personal stock of in sequences in some of the tombs here in the background a clearly visible ladder against one of the houses in the background recalls a description by langer of obesity made to the village in 1899 he writes when we arrived at Giza a messenger from Muhammad Ali was awaiting us he led us by very difficult route along steep slopes and through much sent to that party of the village kapha where the men lived just outside the village we met Muhammad Ali he led us to he led us by the most remarkable route into his house we had to crawl up a hint coupe ladder onto the roof of a hot brick house warg along the edge of this out of fear that our legs would fall straight through the ceiling and then down by another ladder now we were in its house and possibly it is this house since long I actually decided to take a photograph of it so they go through this labyrinth crawl up walk along the edge and down into another room not just the houses when sequences were kept were secluded even within the houses the most valuable and sequences were carefully concealed here's an example from a visit to another dealer at the car firearm Suleiman rang Lonnie Wright has an exceptionally beautiful statue of granite it is kept carefully hidden only after the doors had been locked behind us was it hold forth with with much effort he was lying under a bed in a room that was not used the illegal antiquities trade that went on at kaif al ahram was not entirely without risk to those involved but harsh reaction was rare Reisner felt particularly frustrated by the trade recounting his experience in egypt around 1900 he writes the natives of carvela rom the pyramid village were carrying on an almost systematic series of illicit excavation in the great symmetry and every year number of reliefs offering stones and private statues from the tombs found their way into European museums I should like to add that the that the bid wins at kahala rom not only plundered geese itself but conducted large-scale exhibitions throughout Egypt and sold off the Integrity's from that side thousands of papyri and other objects also passed through this site on March twenty-fifth nineteen hundred and twelve rising the notes in his diary not without some Glee that a certain for each family which had my quote been favorites of maspero the director of the antiquities service for over 25 years unquote had received harsh sentences for their theft of reliefs from a certain zoom it's a great satisfaction to me he writes to see that my judgment of these men were correct and to know that a severe lesson has been given to the car while around thieves the head of the family was none less that a government rise that is a form of a local for man in the executive service named ibrahim fayeed this is the gentleman you see on the left he was sentenced to five years hard labor while other family members were sentenced between 25 and 30 months imprisonment the man was sentenced on March 24th the day before right now Reisner wrote the letter I decided but maspero the director of the integrity service personally helped them appeal the case and in a match matter of only a few weeks on may first they were fully acquitted and set free again and Ibrahim they eat immediately resumed his function as a raise and an unsecured since dealer before we leave carvela rom i would like to show you a few more images of some of the people involved in the trade there this character here is particularly interesting this is a man known as ali al jabri ali al hajj al arabi and many other names he is perhaps the most prominent native egyptian antiquities dealer at the time we know that he literally sold thousands of objects to museums throughout the world and became immensely wealthy is sitting here next to the millionaire Charles Lang freer who was collecting manuscripts in Egypt at the time the man behind him Muhammad Ali is the son of hills and 30 was so grateful to their services and also the services the services of another son of oïleus that he gave gold watches to all three of them in addition to the thousands of pounds he paid them for the manuscripts that he was collecting now the interesting character is this man sake Mahmoud abdus samad who was the guide Indian sequences trade for Falanga during his visit to Egypt he was one of the first bid win dealers to open an official store with in Cairo proper and his yaseen standing in front of that store and he is remotely related to Ali almost all of the dealers at Covell around were related to each other one way or another this shop was located right across from the the Egyptian Museum at Tahrir Square in marietta street but it doesn't exist anymore of course the early 20th century saw an increasing number of professional antiquities dealers in Cairo including several of the bed winds from cafe Haram this is this was presumably a consequence of the new in sequences law introduced in nineteen hundred and twelve to which I will return in a moment the market in Cairo was divided in to two main area till more prominent was the European quarter surrounding is pacaya garden the botanical gardens this area was characterized by very broad streets paved streets lined with trees and larger and more expensive shops as well as the largest hotels the most prominent was the world famous Shepherds hotel where only the wealthiest tourists state the prospect of business naturally attracted businessmen including also in sequences dealers see here shepherds hotel the shop here's the shop of the Manzo family monsura monsura he his son in front of the shop this is a slightly later photograph at the other end of the hotel outside in the when the gardens of the hotel is the shop of the American Blanchard I was later taken over by a Frenchman right across the street from the hotel were further in sequences shops in this building still stands in Egypt almost the entire first floor of this building was filled with antiquities shops including chanson no again one of the very prominent dealers in Egypt but also many others and in each direction up and down the street and down this side alley and this side alley there were further insects in shops here one could easily visit a dozen prominent antiquities dealers within a few minutes from one another possibly the greatest in sequences dealer in Egypt ever is this man movie snack man his job was located at a distance from the hotel not very far perhaps 15 minutes walk in a small palace that had been built for Prince Baron in in the 19th century and he had an acute exhibition hall where thousands of objects were displayed he had his own custodians we see here a visitor and other impression of the kind of galleries that his in sequences shop boarded in addition to this main gallery his whole basement was also crammed with objects and he had objects in storage also I think there's probably at a single Egyptian collection in the world larger collection that does not have a lot of objects from waste knocked on a second center was the musky area which was named after the main street which you see down here leading off towards the east the Moose Kiara describes this whole area east of SP Kia garden this was the Arabic quarter which was characterized by small narrow streets and lots of noise and commotion a very picturesque area which I think stood in marked contrast to the European section in these mode aliens were located also several integrity shops here the shop of the car bomb family in the 1930s and here a picture of the interior of that job this shop looks very modest but again a very famous and large-scale pieces passed through this shop I will only show you one example of this this is a very famous statue of general Horemheb who later became king this is now in the Metropolitan Museum some of you might have seen it in addition to private dealers another key player in the integrity is trade was the in secretive service itself the director of the Egyptian Museum through many years Emil books this known to have put together several large-scale collections for various wealthy individuals in the 1880s and he received huge sums of money in the late 1880s an official sales room was established at the Museum located here in the museum garden it's just outside the photograph it was the intention that the salesroom would dispose of surplus items from the museum storage and thus make room for for further material however the integrity service soon began digging for Integrity's with the express purpose of gathering objects that might be sold off immediately thus for instance site sites known as good sources for bronzes and amulets work worried for such items since this old will and not friendly with any academic objective in mind the antiquities service not only sold smaller objects in nineteen hundred and nine the day nice etiology is to Valdemar Smith was sent to Egypt to acquire and Old Kingdom masturba before his arrival the Egyptian antiquities service asked the local inspector oh I missed an object here asked the local inspector Keeble to clear a number of Master bells at Saqqara for Smith's inspection and upon his arrival Smith simply selected the one he found most interesting it was then dismantled and the blocks were brought to Copenhagen and reassembled I missed this object here this is an example of the type of object that was sold through the cell dev and I've chosen this one partly because I'm in Boston and these are in fact the feet of my syrena's and partly because it's it's it's one of the very few objects where the original museum label was intact when it was acquired so this is d exception object from the museum and it was then brought to the salesroom provided with the prize and sold off and it was in many collections for the past I don't know eighty years until it arrived in the British Museum last year I would now like to turn briefly to the legislation governing the trade in antiquities I will only focus on the more important legislation there's not time to go through all of it the more important legislation is the 1835 high order of Muhammad Ali the 1912 law and the law from nineteen hundred and eighty-three the high order of Muhammad Ali from 1835 represents the first legislation governing the trade in antiquities in Egypt it was apparently a reaction to complaints by Jean Paul Young that in the three decades since Napoleon's expedition had first systematically started to record Egyptian monuments the full 13 temples had entirely disappeared he appealed to Muhammad Ali in the name of science and begged him to take action as it turned out the high-order dealt mainly with the export of Antiquities Muhammad Ali blamed the European for the dismantling of the temples and so he did not do much to actually protect monuments as such he did however decide to build a museum this was only realized many years later in 1858 the law of nineteen hundred and twelve formalized procedures concerning excavation trade and export of Antiquities one of the more important aspects was the introduction of two categories of state author ID authorized dealers licensed dealers with proper shops they had to apply to the director general of the interpreter service and stall keepers who only allowed to sell objects worth five pounds or less had to apply to the local Directorate which was a much easier procedure finally the law of 1983 effectively prohibited all trade and export of Antiquities in Egypt since then the trade has been illegal entirely illegal in Egypt current dealers were provided excuse me the law of 1883 prohibited all trade and export of Antiquities and since then it has been completely illegal to deal with integrators in Egypt current dealers that is the dealers that had stock at the time were provided a one-year period of grace in which they could dispose of the antiquities and they were given a few permits to retain private ownership of objects but it was no longer allowed to sell them or to export them from Egypt with the legislation of 1912 it becomes possible to quantify the legal market in terms of authorised dealers mesmero reports that the antiquities service received 205 application for licenses which would suggest that just over 200 dealers at the time considered themselves sufficiently well established to go through the procedure only 76 of those were initially approved but subsequently about twins I'm over approved upon reapplication and so by November of nineteen hundred and twelve there were just under 100 licensed dealers in Egypt it is unclear how many new licenses were issued in the following 70 years before the antiquities trade was prohibited the highest known lies known license number is 127 but older numbers would be used yet it seems unlikely that the number of active licensed dealers at any point exceeded 100 how did the dealers obtain their insecurities one method was to conduct official excavations in return for excavation permits with the granted to dealers collections or institutions the Egyptians the Egyptian Museum claimed half of what had been recovered during the season with the other half being handed to the to the excavator this practice was already established by the 1880s and was formalized by law in 1891 many of the excavations conducted by dealers were extensive and inevitably the focus was on the type of objects that might be sold for a profit this meant that countless ecological sites were subject to large-scale destruction and forever lost to zions many dealers were also involved in illicit excavations whether directly by sponsoring them or indirectly by buying objects from the excavations moreover many dealers unknowns who have acquired stolen objects from official excavations and indeed some dealers openly admitted to these illegal dealings thus for instance sean's I know whom you saw earlier sold a painted limestone bust to Albert Gallatin in New York after the Second World War and informed him frankly that it was I quote from a house at the El Modena one of the finest from the excavations of 1934-35 unquote this was the official excavations by Goya the French Egyptologist and we know those excavations were played by thefts and so here the dealer not only knew that the object came from the excavation even knew which season it had been excavated in and he did not hesitate to inform the dealer about this objects with the good provenance could sell for more money than objects without a prominence dealers generally found it difficult to keep up the demand foreign sequences that were never long enough objects to go around the mass production of fakes from the early 19th century onward was a very tangible result of this situation pressed to find new material some dealers and don'ts who have traveled all the way to Europe and to have bid at auctions only to bring the it sequences back to Egypt the apparent paradox that Egyptian in sequences dealers were actually more expensive in Egypt and abroad is described in an account already in 1862 by an American visitor fair halt all Integrity's at your tips than in London and less likely to be genuine for the demand is sometimes greater than the junior and supply most people would buy at Thebes and at a high a large price what they would not purchase at a moderate in London the most absurd sums are paid by travelers for what dealers at home would only be too glad to get rid of for a trifle unquote apart from the question of archaeological context one of the greatest challenges that face researchers today is the question of authenticity just this Saturday I visited a museum with an expert on Egyptian art who described how the authenticity of several object of several of the most prominent objects on display in that museum were still debated I'm no expert on the matter certain types of in sequences have traditionally been mods sought-after such as sculptures bronzers scarabs and papyri and the principle of supply and demand was naturally no stranger to the dealers several of the well-established dealers are known to have collaborated closely with professional sculptures Goldsmith's Silver's mills and other craftsmen and already in the early 19th century certain types of objects were mass-produced in small factories thus for instance one workshop mass-produced fake papyri or raiding the 1850s I saw one of some of them just today in one of the local museums these were made by rolling pieces cut from genuine genuine papyrus around a stick while such vague rolls are easily spotted matter matters are much more complicated with most other object types at least when the forgeries are well made although it is difficult to quantify the majority of objects sold on the antiquities market are believed to have been faked perhaps the most commonly faked Arctic category with scary scarabs which always sold well oh here's a quote from langa visiting Ducks are in 99 I don't need to recite it I will not provide a lot of example of fakes but just one which i came across at the British Museum some time ago this is a nice little amethyst scarab and it looks perfectly flying I would not have suspected it was fake under normal circumstances if it was not for this little stroke here behind the bird hieroglyphs this drug is unexpected and it was clearly carved and I wanted how might that be I made a note of it and passed on a few days later still working in the British Museum I came across this scarab which has precisely the same inscription butt an accidental stroke in the same position and there is no doubt that this scarab was produced on the basis of the genuine scarab there and both of them happened to have ended up in the British Museum so that was just my good luck even the most humble objects might be faked one collector was very interested in flints and she was good fortune he found that many dealers certainly had nice specimens for sale but as it happens there were expert for tours of even relatively inexpensive objects such as Flint's even mud bricks were faked in Thebes there was a professional mud brick fakir who sold them for 1 piastre piece these mud bricks were interesting because they were stamped with the name of Rama sues the third and so people thought they came from his famous temple at madinat habu some of them can be found in American collections the antiquities market saw a sharp decline with the outbreak of the Second World War where few tourists ventured to Egypt there was an increased after the war in in 1945 and many dealers also began traveling abroad on a much grander scale than previously because they had a lot of stock to dispose of however growing anti-british sentiments led to the successful revolution in 1952 one of the material victims of the Revolution was Shepherds hotel which had been used by the British Army both during the first and second world war and which was seen as an emblem of British imperialism and you see here a picture of shepherds hotel on January twenty-fifth nineteen fifty-two here the form and sequences job of Blanchett which had been taken over by Frenchmen and the main sewer shop is down here difficult to make out and this is a picture taken two days later after the hotel had been entirely burned down during loading this little shop and in this whole years where the men sir shop used to be the destruction of these two shops would hardly have meant much to the flow of Antiquities in itself much more important was the symbolic value of the destruction of the hotel tourists again State shy of idiot a few years later saw the suez crisis where israel britain and france invaded egypt and as a consequence egypt asked all foreign nationals to leave the country which again resulted in the decline in tourism the trade picked up again in the 1960s and 70s and you see here what appears to be a relatively well stocked sharp in the early 1970s at least as far as smaller objects are concerned the dealer whom you see in the middle is hint hip now we and share the final blow to the antiquities trade came with the law in 1983 which effectively prohibited all trade in antiquities the anticipation of this radical revision of the integrity of laws was already in preparation during the 1970s and let further dealers to leave Cairo including the prominent kawama brothers who shop I showed you earlier and who left for Paris in 1977 while violations against the antiquities laws often resulted in little more than a slap on the wrists in the past matters are now very different an example is provided by the family of her now if now we all share his father is my lil abdallah i'll share received the very first official permit to sell in sequences in nineteen hundred and twelve license number one his business was later taken over by his nephew who dealt legally until nineteen eighty-three however after the introduction of the law of 1983 he continued an illegal antiquities trade and in nineteen in 2005 he was convicted along with his son and several other members of his family of running one of the largest smuggling operations in modern times with objects reading reaching Australia England France Germany the Netherlands Switzerland the United States and other countries this mark alone included tens of thousands of objects despite this advanced age he was now in his 60s he was sentenced to 55 years in prison and so this was effectively a life sentence and with this perhaps somber note i would like to into my lecture thank you for your attention
