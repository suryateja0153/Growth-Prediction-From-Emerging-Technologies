 thanks everyone from joining today's webinar with control up on Doug Brown from da bcc and really excited today to have yoni the CTO control with us to show us what's new in their control 5.0 release and this is a pretty amazing beauty I management and collective analytics tools so but no further ado let's turn it over yoni but first of all before he gets taken away by great cool technology the only can you tell us a little bit about the company and of course a little bit about yourself yes sir so first backlog for organizations great seeing I'm seeing a lot of enemies I am seeing some familiar faces the name which is great you guys will be with us for a while now and I'm King some some new guys so hopefully everyone to enjoy this show and see what we have here would be five is a new controls inside platform so I will cover the we make an interest of the company in a bit learning myself I'm I one of the co-founders in this video of control up as you mentioned for a long while I was doing all kinds of atomization projects at large enterprise customers so mostly Citrix being where Microsoft slated the projects or the SVD I think it should be familiar to anyone at our customer base and at one point we said hey why not you know we're seeing a big gap tree with especially in regards to visibility management in the old vdi space and we thought we can we can kind of fix that by doing our own solution and this is simply uncontrollable one this was something like 44 integral things that we've gone a long way but initially it was basically no your platform for managing and merging your beady eye stack while I show is very something a bit bigger than that where we're also doing analytics now and you provide those reporting and troubleshooting and lots of stuff which also interact with the entire situation general community so hopefully you learn that I next hour or so I'll slice yeah yes i'm just going to dive in and again documented event if anyone have any questions then you know just use the chat you use the question panel and ask away bag if you see something you want to mentor this let me know and I'll uncover that journey you bet I'm gonna have my own questions this is you know I guess I'm gonna send expand they got a fish okay great great you just know for guys who have known as before you know for a long time we've been mostly about real time management that's the controller company our senior and clean shot now the situation will be different in a good way I think right now we are providing the food soup and end-to-end solution for anyone managing any VDI stack so any arriving view cities and have them desktop Microsoft Customer we find in control up a full-blown solution to manage military mistake we currently provide both real-time troubleshooting and management person we covered everything down and also pick up inside which is a web-based is totally pony module which help guys both see what's happening sterically and do some further analysis and global benchmarks so we'll cover of that in the next the next slide the metal and the agenda planned for today we'll do a quick intro just to again discussed and highlight what control to go about I want to quickly covered architecture this is something not sure we have shown before in a webinar and then because it comes up I want to show you guys what are the pieces that may control of how it's working in the background the cloud stuff their own transformation et cetera so we covered that and then as usual most of the webinar will be about Celine Prime and these tech demo so we show it will be the answer question recover them to communicate and wrap up with the TNA right yeah okay so as I mentioned before our retailers vision here we control up you could basically be the market leader in regards to VDI management mantra we have gone a long way since it's early we are now deploy the more than 500m enterprise customers both of us m and Western Europe and it's looking great so I think we have great attraction from both the city's numerous community we are doing a lot of conferences and and the user this meeting them and the scenes that we see really awesome so I know it's great to see the feedback and know that what you're doing is make sense the community the majors value we provide our customers or you sit here so you know troubleshooting and managing performance across the VI back from the host they're all the way to actually prophecies and apps you could have alpha system I can be any experience we cover some of that either basically low valuation metrics latency and community we added another party guy still out there new experience management management was only the cheap accentuated wii controller we have a lot of management actions being the screen based actions can cover that and i think it's great and finally the new controlling sites enable customers to both analyze the historical trend but also and this is quite unique you can also compare your own metrics to the global benchmarks we provide and we will see that into them one I think this is something really great and interesting and promised we'll start with the architecture so we show our we share to slide Wow you we're seeing the customer Network the on-premises environment basically has an three components the major one is the control of console itself what we've seen them or shortly this is an executable guys can download from my website launch at them and start managing their states the control of agents which is running on on the RAS then ask the horizon endpoints this is where we gather the in guess beta we've experienced metrics we have connections to hypervisor currency supposed VMware and Dan server and I can actually say right now the type of you being added to v6 which is planned for july so i could be is coming in soon so obviously all of these is happening on premises and finally we have the control of mojito service which is essentially a window service running on a dedicated server and you can charge this 24 7 no need continuous monitoring a learning instrument reporting and you in d5 it's also in charge of least Oracle data upload to control up insights now we cover that in the next architecture slide when you walk with the online solution or the enterprise model the backend and databases are hosted on our AWS cluster some of the important components there is the configuration database the incidence we spoke the infamous database and the Lord logging and licensing logic everything is not fully encrypted we use customer per customer encryption here so it's highly secure you can provide more day about that and about above the stuff we save their we have a full-blown secure document so if anyone who's interested can just send email to support and control your comments and more deals about the Delta texture and security precaution now regarding control inside this is a new platform we added v5 this was launched back in January this year and let me go over the architecture and now we actually provide bespoke available customers so here on the lower left side you will see the same components using in the previous slide this is happening on premises this is our agent running on the video endpoints are yes server all connected to the virtualization infrastructure all the real-time data is being aggregated on the control of Windows Server well it writes the activity files we focus beautiful in five minute interval to its local hard drive once that committee files are in place once every 30 minutes we upload the spherical data via HTTPS to an Amazon s3 secure in buckets and for their our ETL process actually crunch the data and put it in the redshift amazon based cluster this is was a bit of street address and from there our application server which provides the user interface on the web service will actually run the database query and expose the in-flight platform itself so customers you know the great thing about that and say that we can provide customers with an excellent first grade the spoken recording module without the hassle of installing and maintaining local databases in web services currently developing sizes available for online customers we are planning to add support for on-premises customers during q3 this year so it's coming if we take something like in a term two month or three months now to have this available for on prime as well right so so this is pretty much about architecture for today again questions feel free to ask them via chat or you can contact offline later so I do wanna say a demo I think this is usually the interesting part through fostering you know just we start with a quick orientation here and then I'll cover some these cases and you jump between the real time come true and the inside platform show you how we basically provide free end to end solution for your stack so this is control console this is the component is running on promising either on the feast admin and coins or publish them on from RAF server and then you are going to lab manual lab here and app control officer on the left right here you can see which which managed computers and activate the connections are managing in this case you can see I'm connected to both VMware ESXi 6 cluster I'm also connected presents over 65 south of here the connection is quite simple in order to connect controversial visualization so that you always meeting the only thing you need to supply is the web service URL and right credentials and that's it no agents are involved it so it's basically remote API calls against the web service the other type of objects remaining is basically windows VMS or even though the physical boxes and on top of that we support all the major VDI bands so you can see in my lab you have an appt 65 environment and a number 576 both you know resv bi workload horizon v56 or 37 voter supported and obviously you can connect any supporting server your sequence server your connector surveyors convention brokering or PDF server domain controller any windows voltage can be added here and managed with our control of interviews and you still call reporting module now once the components are in place we will show you here that we actually populate the real-time view data okay what are seeing right now this is the host view so this baby is coming from vsphere and Dan server and I'm showing you a real-time the hosts the physical hosts that are running my virtual environments we have you know the metadata the configuration matrix and we have real-time performance metrics anything from simple stuff like CPU memory usage in real-time and some more advanced metrics like high latency drop packets io usage basically anything we need no to find out what the current health was the current status of Coast vm fashion when probably more on the stress level column this is something which is quite significant in the control of all the stress level is kind of a health index which takes into account the various performance metrics and can tell you in one column what's the current state of this object in this case you considered es 60 for this hyper visor live in critical stress level and if I click on the small triangle on the upper right side of itself I can see which metrics are actually causing this object to be in a critical stress level so we can see that the data stories which is quite high both the rate and the other is usage and i want to show you how can we can quickly use the real-time view to see what's going on here right so we can drill down here into a 604 and the next thing we show you is the VMG so these are the VMS currently running on your 604 now the cool thing here is is the aggregated data we can show for vm let me show you an example as we are dealing with the narration so I'm clicking on the Collins preset and I'm going to switch to the details view I or preset and control the mouse showed me a set of discs related metrics which are coming both from the VMware from the vSphere layer and also from the windows agent I so for example you can see in here that this video is almost in a 15 thousand reasons ipad apps and from the windows perspective we are seeing a pretty similar number so the fact that we can kind of combine virtual and windows-based metrics in the same feels great and it really helps when you're troubleshooting issues performance issues for vm then basically any this visualize local I can sort I can play this real I can sort of based on any column like virtual I ops like based on the latency or whatnot and obviously basing the stress level and here it's pretty clear that this VM here coz theta value is clearly the single VM which is causing the Irish you meet our host I just drill down into three RDS a 2-1 and the next step is what we show me the session view so these are the user sessions currently logged on to see research of one and again for each session I have metadata I have configuration metrics like the 11-time the idol states the physical endpoint name I used to connect to the RDS or video endpoint latest three usual students metrics celosa right but also lean time performance metrics so here we can see that this is my comp actually I'm causing the Irish ooh I didn't hear that 9000 is the only session consuming any iOS awesome on this VM and now I can drill down into the session itself and finally control can show me the list of processes or apps running inside a session again we've metadata like PA be like the command line like the processed version and obviously real-time CPU memory and i/o metrics so now we see the dynamics with this process here is the single process consuming a bit more than 10,000 ops causing the nation's our hosts affecting a bunch of straw in this case VDI users okay so this is pretty great right in a few seconds you can build on from the data center they seem to process and see what's going on and see with the culprit and you can even right-click obsession or process and execute the guest section screen of action we know that the scene real-time what the MU is actually being on your box ok so a just active ok to try and fix test sack so again the gun the guest sessions cleaners action especially maybe me to see the energy of cleaning real time let's do it again one more time should work this time right so this is the annual stream this is what we will is actually activating right now and now if I can see the screen I can figure out that Panama weekly lacking the engine behind I o meter this is the bisque infinity I'm using to create a load in first place try to the fact is I can drill down from the biggest interview all the way to a single app stream and kind of curl a performance issue with specific application this is true also for browser for your ear p app or anything which is running on your end users vdio audio inputs now I did mention that we are focusing on so management not only monitoring so some of the things we can do in here is it for example we can we can send the end of your message about this we can start a chat we can get a screenshot and obviously we can terminate the process now that we know that this is not a business critical app so I'm going to go ahead and terminate this time and risky process and in this specific scenario this should solve the i/o issue right I'm terminating the army to process and I can go back to the vm view for the sessions view I can see in real time the bi usage is dropped to zero you by the way we'll queering a windows-based metrics every three seconds so that's why the reality is almost immediate if you're looking on the host layer then we pull data every 20 seconds so in something like 10 seconds former we should pee be added usage drop on in 604 as well and the stress that we should go back to our to normal state I am there you go the a successful is back in a FEMA you know in green state energy be good so you know this is something we've been in for a while now enabling guys play with the real-time metrics and drilling down and see what's going on now i do want to show you how we can achieve the same value the same invest metrics for many stoker perspective okay so let me switch to control up inside so this is crop insight this is the web-based platform that's actually exposed all kinds of reports and metrics based on the aggregated real-time data together from the agents and the mobile service okay so this is obviously the web platform is accessible from from web browser such as chrome and ie you can see here that from a time range respective you can go back for hours you can go back bay a week a month you can actually go back all the way to one year well select Custom Rangers based know basically porch you're looking at the bare attention is is actually tied to your license types and over to the Platinum guide platinum license contain can go back on here and see stoica bail why I'm showing right now this is the host trend report ok so this report shows historical resource consumption usage the average CPU memory i/o and network usage for your hook this includes any host you're managing with the platform so this could be again in six I xenserver and I proviso in v6 well currently looking on the on the entire hypervisor folder so this average here it's actually the average for from all the hypervisors are monitoring over the last week worth of data so we can simply know the average cpu because if you have a dram and we can also see the average io utilization now when you hear you can notice that that's actually yesterday we had a pretty high peak in regards to i/o so I can go ahead and click on the data point and control please show me since we're looking on the entire fight about your folder drop is show me that the top five hypervisors we be highest amount of oil resources consumption so here it's quite clear that EF 604 is the obvious to single corporate is the one hypervisor would cause the iop so I'm going to go ahead and click on the link and we're still looking on the same report here this is clearly a let me show it is still the whole strain but now i'm looking on a single hypervisor i'm specifically looking on your 604 and again i'll scroll down to the io usage on the IOT vision graph and here i can see the peak right clearly it happened yesterday evening time and now i can give a better phone again but thinks i'm now looking on a single host control can show me which the onion has actually contributed to be higher usage okay so this is pretty cool right i can form a nice total perspective whenever I click on any day upon CPU memory i/o in the host view can see each VM across that ok so here again it's pretty clear that T is h1 the same thing we have seemingly risk on you what's causing the issue and now to the cool part we can click on the vm itself and insights automatically we preach the computer and the vm trend report and you show me the best because of vm historical resource consumption pattern over the same time frame okay so let's scroll down to the iou pitch and here we can see the same I opaque but this time from the vm perspectives so now we know right this vm is called the issue and again we can write you can click on the data point and now since we're looking at a vm konjo please show me this total process season session that caused the issue so you see ur this is attained the same dynamics the engine the same process we've seen in the real time demo but this time from an historical perspective so you no longer have to know rely on the real time data alone you can now go back in time you know if they a week a month even a year and see all the way to the process data to figure out what went wrong and what caused issues and leave me pretty great okay we can also see the user session with cause that but let's move jump your other scenario then i'll show you have the usual fashion report in controlling type google perfect i only have a couple questions for you if you have a if you have a good it now's a good time sure sure we are glad that's perfect so guys please use the questions please to go to webinar to to ask questions if you have any and i have one hears is there any support for at be outside of sba going to knock unafraid you do have quite a few previous action depending if tell you this I think we have not received a vision quest about specific Abdi metric or column so I'd encourage you know anyone will access please send an email to support that control the chrome with the feature request if you want to specific metric or a specific action and we will do our best effort to provide that it's quite easy for us to add data so you just need to know that this one or three customers who access code yeah just go ahead and Africa we have to provide additional help create na metrics ok um can you do custom counters inside the interface oh good good question right so yes or no right yes we can you can play the Carnot and with the given threshold when you believe right you can select we have quite a few built-in come here you can see beliefs from showing on screen right now so a lot of columns for vm for for users of processes so this is one thing we play it before this you can also play you the threshold now we got in custom columns this is not available right now we are planning to add support for that sometimes around the b7 version so it's coming but it's not available right now little hyper-v support so yeah that's a great question and that I can save money because you're adding supported in the next release so right now the top five is the the production relief control of six the beta by the way plan for june so something like two months from now shoot sorry props with beta and I Aviv fully supported news version both for classes I free stemologica be with all the real-time metrics and drill down totally pointing so yeah it's coming and coming soon so perfect and well we have a couple more we'll get to these real quick and then we'll all set you loose again can I run control on-premise totally yes so however done on Prem yes for sure we have a fully supported control of on-premise deployment when you'd be back in to install ambition through the control console and vital service you also have to install two components one is the control up for on-premises favor it's a windows server to run the configuration database and the second component which is optional is the insolence database which is essentially a sequel database and one thing does that you have a fully on premises control of installation it was not communicate with the cloud in any way if you want more details on that we're going to publish some videos on a web site soon but for now simply contact support and control those commonly you send me the installation guide and socialism everything you need perfect and the last question on the know what you move forward and the gentleman says uh I have been trying to create a custom trigger to send out an email when login duration is greater than 60 seconds so we can generate a ticket and take a look at a particular user profile is that possible yeah it's about to actually have a similar and similar condition my own lab environment firing off really great it looks like this let me show you my own environment it's part of the session stress a balloon type and you can see any here this is the show you the trigger so you can see an example alright we're looking specifically on the love and duration metric and if you tired in 60 seconds you can file an email alert when event log alerts or even a mobile push notifications so it's pretty supportive and miss you guys need any help with configuring that and you know the answer right context of support them and they will help you show yourself okay supposing talking grades in our own bar Julia please continue along sure ok so moving on I want to show you some interesting stuff about loading duration since we discussed it right now so right now we're looking on the session view right this is a view that shows the old usual sessions connecting from all of your managed computers we have customers or managers then I have 65 leggett environments and side by side let's say is ender specific environment so all of these users would believe them here and you can quickly filter this video shows the city username you can show the screen based on column and you can see all kinds of interesting metrics like the for example you can see the the HDX or pcip latency so you can peep in here this is the average latency inside session you can see the bandwidth usage because for pcip session we cover them in bit and you can also see the level duration statistics ok so let me show you here for example right we ever we have an account here see them all this is one user session and we considered loving duration was almost 57 58 seconds so initially we also provide you with details about the phases we show the profile Oh time the group policy person single time and the best of Sri Lanka and we have a helper column called valuation other which shows how long it took to process all the ugly metrics who are not directly covering so the real-time view itself provides a lot of value a lot of feedback about Karami you know the logging duration and how we break down what's going on in addition to the basic stuff we have script based actions which are essentially script you can import into control up which we can provide additional details about the low valuation process so two quick scripts gonna show you one is the analyze deploys the extension no time you can see in the real-time view but the group points you processing was a bit more than 40 seconds this script based action here you show you exactly which client side extension has caused the issue here we consider the drive map click more than 30 seconds we can which conveniently main GPL kogda okay so that's great that this can point you to the the exact expansion with the ftp a big issue and as to say that the amount of people to different customers about this is great right guys are saying eh i managed to cut down the log of eurasian plan for morrow I know 50 for 20 seconds by finding out the few gpo issues so again providing great value the Allen Street based action which is really popular you analyze loving duration based action and the way it helps is by providing additional sales or steps which are not not shown in the real-time problem so for example using the strip you can see places like Citrix BPM flow time we can see stuff like grupo scripts we can see the usually fail which Institute environment is important because which we will be map driver greater so all of this is exposed in the analyzer graduation script so another great value for troubleshooting love and processes you can see the table on screen right now you can see the Memphis pairing for each phase because it's a new phases that are not part of the of the real-time module right now now the garden level duration control open sites provide additional value as well so first of an installer perspective if you look on our users fashion activity reports this is the spiracle list of sessions we connected to my environment so it's really similar to the control of retail view you can see here the column you can see most of the important metrics but unlike the Rings and consoles will show you everything coming closer perspective so I can click on the one week preset like I'm doing right now and control we show me know in my lab environment over the last week we have almost 200 unique session now in some of a customer site they see here like 10,000 or even 50,000 photo session over the last week I'm thinking that they can export the data to excel they can tell you this or we use the sewing feature which is part of in fact I can go here to the lemon duration column and solve the grid based on that and this will allow me to answer a question like over the last week which user session have suffered from its low level so we can see it clearly here we can know quantities we can see what's going on now we can see the breakdown here as well you can see the profile Oh time the GPL a time etc so everything is available also from historical perspective so this is one great thing we can be concise you can get all kinds of insights about your user session you can even drill down into a specific session let me show you let's stream down into this guy here so when drilling down into extraction insights will show you a lot of data about that is photo session on the upper side of the report will show you the metadata which is again we know the long time a lot of kind normal duration the server name etc but below that we show you tons of details about this protocol fashion okay so first we'll show you we show you the session state over time so you can see what initially this session was active it became either after a while and then it was disconnected actually logged off we can show you the client information right so you can see here that initially the client was connected from this IP address on this physical endpoint and 10 series of disconnected we previously you know it does have any crime information but if this session was reconnecting from another end point you will xfinity here so a lot of details about about the physical end point about it states we also provide spiritual resource usage metrics for this session we show two types of metrics we show the session liquor consumption this is the you know the blue line here and we showed the whole screen computer a little consumption so here you can see for example the throughout the life of discussions consume something like you know 0 handyman to memory and the server itself you almost clearly remember and the same is true for i 0 and also for the cpu and finally in the same gum paste draft we can show you a list of process fee but to run an inside a session with the start mending so almost everything there is to know about this session is listed in this report you can see the states the crossing is running the repo consumption and it's a great way of telling in a wife and his photo session was I had that experience maybe because the CP consumption and the ocm point was high maybe because the latency was high or maybe because he was running them in countries apps inside depression Oh Gilly we have a couple questions you have time yes you're just just one one last point here regarding other direction radio station so just to wrap to wrap the level duration in the park the lovely duration reports will show you obligated long duration metrics walk your repair organization so we can show you what the average level duration on your entire organization for the last week or month we can show you based on silos and the price thing is we'll show you how it's comparing against the community benchmark now this is something really cool here this is think we're know since we have an online customer dating the cloud we can run all kinds of benchmark and provide them back feedback for customers so they can quickly see how they compare against the community bench or in this case for the Logan generation statistics actually Eugene one of our top is actually a VP for evaporation wrote a blog about that right what a blah blog about what with what we as a vendor or the community can learn from two million are gone right that's what actually if you month ago now now I think we have data for almost a big amazon but this is a girl too great let me let me put this in the chat if anyone wants for you I want to do that later not working first communion stupid sack so anyway what white whether the value we be providing this okay so here for example you can see stuff as we learn from all of those metrics so we can see for example there is a pretty big difference between the love and duration average in a published app environment against published desert environment now which is not that shocking again because published apps select the the desktop she'll fail but again it's just an example of an insight we can share with our customers once we have a beer so I do encourage you to know kind of visit this and learn more about this and I say that we pasted the URL in chess or feel free to visit like sorry Doug's yeah I'm going to be for question this pointer squad you that he wanted to have some questions from the audience I was I was talking away and I was on mute yeah yeah my fault so you had mentioned the interim delay and the question is what is the interim delay well the interim delay is actually the time between the phases okay actually there is a great there is a great blog from Citrix let me show you here when we publish to analyze loving duration scripts we also share this with the community as a free script and we can also copy and paste this link in the chat and you guys can visit this but here we explain everything about the script and what going on here so the interim delay which you can see in this screenshot is again it's the time between failures right so for example open these computers let me try and increase the one on the size of screen here so here you can see that the interim delay between the network providers fail and the physics 2pm phase was 1.7 seconds so then the interim delay is the time between phases we mentioned or monitoring description perfect in will we have the ability to add remove columns from the session activity you in a future release the confession excluded they mean the psych reports or the real-time concrete if you mean the evil session can be report then you can beat right now you can click here on the fitter and one of the option you could select a beefy left column so this is available right now in developing sites and if you were referring to the if you are referring to the real-time consoles and it's even simpler just click on the session view click on column and you can play the list of columns here perfect question of whether controls all when you guys also show login faces related to their desktop oh yeah this actually it's a great question so initially beloved durational script the anti-federation grip was referring to Windows now Windows related metric recently anything I have it in here yeah so this blog was published back in February and this is where we actually close to the new script which obviously you can write from control up but this adds support for then the stipulated metric so the major the major phase where there is the hd's connection fee which covers the whole phase before the windows logon so now we can show you how long we put to know to initialize the HD client the connection networking and other piece of good news we can share with you that will control up six this phase and other phases related investable going to be integrated into the real time here so you will not need to click for that we part of shopping sites power control real time if you provide additional value for the existing loving duration module very cool it's very cool um guys if you have any more questions please use the questions please ask the questions and yoni please continue along okay so just I want to highlight some of the new stuff we added in d5 so obviously the major thing we added inside we are showing you throughout the demo year but we also added some some real time related metrics so one example here and that's me for deriving views or rather we added support for four so the PCYC band with Lucas metric so we can now show you in real time what's the bandwidth usage for each PCoIP session by the way we're going to add eight weeks support for that in v6 so starting with vista to be able tomato both the HDX and the PCoIP bandwidth usage for each session so that's one thing one quick note i wanted here is we also release the screen based action that enables customers to figure out which PCoIP virtual channel are causing the bandwidth usage right you can see here that the bandwidth usage is almost seven megabytes so I can go ahead and fire the PCoIP bandwidth usage detail fear-based action it will run in the background which should show me in the output which PCoIP channel are actually causing this I bandwidth usage so you should be able to see the screen right now we show the other than the usage and you show a breakdown of features channel the imaging bites the algae on your device now guys if you think this would be valuable for education well just let us know or get a support or the feedback club for the metropolis would love to to add this to HDX well other things we added v5 is the branch name metric for session so you can see the you can actually configure mapping between client IP addresses in brunch name and that way you can see in real time for which physical branch the answer session was originated from this will also work with future in size report sorry another great thing we added with citrix I consider monitoring so if you deploy the control of agent in the Citrix item server we will automatically be back back and when you drill down into the server you can click on the Citrix licenses tab here because a new tab and b5 and you can see the real time life of usage for each licensed products king like accident people to xendesktop enterprise parish or user device like this i cube is is a six percent of devices already been to and one more thing I want to show you regard to be five we also added a new interesting colorful or for any PDS customer out there sorry so these are my Zen app 65 servers they're actually provisioned on their PDF 76 and we added a new non page to America and this is a great way to evaluate the PVS the pdfs ram cache size which is obviously a critical metric to evaluate because if the ram cash is running out then the previous and studies in the beach forecast literally moving object explorer so you can set figures here and it will can actually alert you in real time when your previous ROM cash is running out we have a blog about previous related issues you can see them here so we cover all kinds of PBS machine control and can can help with troubleshooting oh my throwing just like the one you know i showed you right now be cool very cool okay okay so these are some of the major features we added in this fine I do want to go back inside i want to show you a few other reports we haven't covered yet so we added to your record in the late relief like this is a good time to mention that since controller inside to the hosting solution or assassination you can able to school to add nearly threw in a very short cycle so essentially try to add to write features the reports like every every month or two and since we released the pony already added from competing singapore co 2 reports he added like two weeks ago i want to quickly show them to you and explain the value behind them so 11 in the top window there so what we are showing you well show you a distribution of windows are the cross across the previous month we can stats about them and most importantly we can show you the top 10 window there's an organization intel in terms of occurrences and this distribution so it's a great way to see one of the most common events both from an issue if you really know environment and tofino and how many of the answer there they're actually happening and to find more details about them using the research online link okay this would be a great time to mention that if you see something interesting in here and like let's say you feed that he has quite a few i know i'm a service event I between 989 your environment you can go to the control of incidence thing and dig deeper than that you can see on which server this was triggered you can see the time so I would say the support services and initial points to see the major issues weapon even of environment and from there you can dream down to the insolence pain in control up and gain more insight about those windows earth for in yon varlets another in fact we show here is the global distribution of those two the big events you can see how common these events are in an organization on which can be really valuable if you want to find out is within the common issue or something which is specific their own environment criteria have a key please continue no no no go i'm going okay wasn't ready crazy yeah yeah back to the PDF stuff you're talking about PBS ram cache sizes whether whether you monitor other PBS cash types like a disk-based cash things of that nature oh oh yeah for sure that good question so besides the PDF ram cast I've we also provide the ability to either the PVS a display cash okay this can be done evil we have the free space column we have four for those two the dragon well we are building scribus action right we have the ability to execute see if i could get PDF double devices um get to hear TRICARE side all right and once you run this against your targets you can see in real time what for what the cash type and if it's a disk-based guess we can also show you the size of the cache file etc so it's available both the screen protection also as a real time column which means you can also get alerts is the PVS cash drive is about to run out of space perfect perfect we'll version 6 show I RCA RTP people that are see it I see a RTT latency not easy for me to say oh yeah I didn't stand for the round trip it's a great night you got it yeah unlike latest we provide more i would say accurate metrics for the actual network latency so we got a feelin quest with that we are trying to ask this v6 the thing you can easily get the ret metric not available via the regular if you say p guys and this is a bit unfortunate it's not available if you have an old data API or the partial API it's only available as a WM w mi naturally so you're wanting to play this we don't want to cause performance issues so we just mean in the intestine same so you can get extremely busy litaker 37 perfect perfect okay so the last report i want to share with you guys is the brand new application uses be the report i know that a lot of customers have been looking for something like this so what we provided here is the ability for each process for each app running a lil environment we can show you i would say three major statistics first we can show you a trend over time off you know how many instances are being executed concurrently over the last you know day week etc which is great so you can see if you have you know if you have pics or what other users in addition we show you the unique number of named users we're running yourself so no sometimes for licensing purposes you need to know how many unique name gives running nap so the data we've been here and finally we show you the actual user name the actual end users who are running is that now this could be exported to a csv files you can play with the data yourselves but essentially we answer the know the top questions regarding the a people so what's the peak of current usage how the trend looks like how many unique maybe over using that and we actually using the app great value i think and it's out of the box appearing insights you can play with this can I think it's a great addition to our existing gunports inventory we don't have a little time left so let's see i can share number that any other questions that you're going what do you think so far beside rock me already answer the guy yeah yeah what do you plan do you have any new reports plan to the future great this is exactly what I wanted to see if they can share with you guys so what I'm showing you here on screen this is the midterm plans for controlling sites so hopefully the reports obtained on screen will be available in the next couple one so citrix license usage protocol agency right but protocol a dancing up from the specific session perspective but so empowered branches of the entire organization class version so we can see in this division of specie IP or eight weeks or even bigger versions i cross different devices and time frame and finally just like we have seen in the app usage detail report you want to share the similar report if we showed the app resource consumption over time so for a specific app how does it behave in terms of fios cpu and ram resource consumption so in all of these is coming soon so stay tuned and then i think it's going to add great value to be existing insights platform perfect perfect arm triggers for clients connecting with high latency generates more Thurman yeah for sure it's 20 supported so one of the existing columns is the protocol agency column so you can simply consider the trigger like I'm showing you right now for this session Jeff I'm doing it fast because we're running out of time and one of the criteria can add here is the protocol agency column right the average you can say right this is greater than I no longer millisecond I can go ahead and create the trigger and send me an alert or whatnot so it's fully fully supported perfect perfect arms we have a couple more questions that I let you go ahead and finish and then we'll ask those at the very end so fair yeah well actually the good news is I'm kind of covered everything I wanted to cover so we can just stick with Rita QA and then wrap up perfectly perfect so guys you know we have a few minutes left but we will definitely stick around and answer all your questions so if you have anything just you know use of questions piece of GoToWebinar there on the right side of your screen and ask away so one of the questions is enough said how is insights license oh yeah that that's that's a fair question I guess we should have a slight will get here Oh so essentially control up as a whole is license based on pre parameters right one in the number of concurrent session of the NGO managing with weed control and the other parameter is the is the data retention in fact okay so you can plead with you can see the version number here so controller pro enables one day of attention control of enterprise provide one month and control a platinum gives you a full one year of data retention for the customer side so again your license based on from tranquilo or PMS and the day retention period surface um integration with checkin in systems yeah that that's a good one so we do it quite a lot of customer sites the easiest way the currently resist way to integrate with with ticketing system we basically in the follow-up event log option i'm showing it on screen right now so what will happen is that no control wheel with the definition again a highlight of three high-level eurasian stressed host whatnot and once we pick that up we can create an event log on from the central my little service with all the detail and the easiest way to integrate it just tell your monitoring system you're digging system for that specific event log and whenever you find a control to control of events with the details just in the process and creates and taken based on that we have quite a few customers going to be calm with HP chief aide and all kind of stick increase them out there perfect perfect tom this one's for me and that is future stuff you know what we expect from you guys in awhile you talk a lot about future already but anything else that you've left out that that you would like to discuss or share with us well you have two things two things they can share with you guys so first as i said control up stix is coming and hopefully the beta we starting in june and we're adding supposed to hyper-v and you are also enhancing our integration with them back up going to be some cool stuff here in addiction we are going to add application load time modules it's going to be pretty great it's going to let you feel exactly what's going on in real time and you know how long it takes for apps start and become available for the M users okay so think about users running outlook or Excel for the chrome app we can sell you a real time how long is it coming seconds pick for the app to become clearly available for the end user and besides the real-time colors we also show historical reporting site joined up and obviously share the benchmark so if you know customers you ready to see hey now in my environment out it takes 25 seconds to load but the benchmark being 10 second so it's probably a great idea to know kind of look into that and see maybe I have a problem a galleon or something is not configured properly which is causing that that delay so this is coming in these shakes and insight we've spoke about some of the report reading but we're also adding from some more sophisticated benchmarking and another great report but anything this will be the protocol for next webinar I guess perfect Thank You yoni three minutes over and and we're out of questions so you guys have any other questions well here's one question came in its oil to this haha does the control monitor agent upload data to the cloud that's a good one yeah I so as I mentioned in the actually you can go back to architecture slide so it's listed right here alright so the Michael service is writing the story identifies the disk every five minutes and every 30 minutes the microwave is upload the HCPs we spoken disclosing dating so the file to secure amazon s3 bucket which is part of the developing side platform so it's done the https it's fully increasing both in transit and at rest and this is the no this is the process in higher level if you guys know if anyone wants more details again context definitely provides a full documentation about about that perfect um well one last question here and let's see if fréquence acts another one before we're done with this one but time frame for automated reports is a good question if it's a highly requested feature the good news that should be available in next couple of months okay in the works we're first preparing the bookmarks feature which will be no kind of a platform for the automation part and once this is in place hopefully in like a month then the month after that we can can release the automation feature for four reports perfect the only thank you so
