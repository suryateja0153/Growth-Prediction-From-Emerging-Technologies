 [Music] well well well hello thank you very much indeed patty to for the warm introduction to this great event and how nice it is to be here as Helen said we consider trinity college dublin to be one of our closest partners and will touch a little bit more on that legal deposit relationship later but i guess the other reason that my my pulse always races a little faster when I come here and why this is such a good topic to be talking about here is that looking around the room I'm probably not the only child of the 60s and I have very particular ideas growing up in that decade of what the future or to look like and kind of it ought to look like that clean lines modernism slightly dramatic beautiful sinister concrete floors shiny laws and I guess that somewhere deep in some psychological recess it gives me a clue about what the librarian of the future ought to look like as well and it's sort of all of a piece so it's a good theme to be addressing here and I guess those of us well my background in media but also in the library interest industry are always on a daily basis trying to think rethink imaginatively what the future might look like and of course help to shape that future and often it is about choices and I guess those of us who spend much of our time with in libraries this for those of you have not been there is the main London center of the British Library apps and pancreas in London and it is right by some pancras railway station built on the old goods yards very controversially I'm not sure people had a theory of the future geographically then but nonetheless that's where it went and interesting things have happened since then and in a way if you want to saturate some of the choices that we feel we're all confronting as we think about our future strategy you can do worse than to think about the geography of where we are there's an aerial view there are the great Victorian railway stations but the whole neighborhood is transforming in front of our eyes that's us just two red brick next to another great red brick pile the hotel is in pancreas and right next to the railway lines coming out of Kings Cross there in about two years time will be one of the biggest single office developments in the whole of London the europe middle east and africa headquarters for google the other great google headquarters for the world so I guess we're already feeling and you can feel it in the debates around where we are in the UK are kind of divided breaking up in people's minds in a few years time someone can stand in front of some pancras station and if it's information services thereafter I guess take a turn left or they could turn right they could turn left into a universe that maybe looks a little like that or they could have a different idea of a library which looks a bit like that and and apparently we have to choose apparently we have two to choose between two allegedly [Music] diametrically opposed set of values here and we worried about this some values which date back not perhaps just centuries but millennia which are characteristic of the great historic archives the great places of scholarship they accentuate the need to preserve to conserve to respect the highest standards of academic quality the solitary study experience and then others say it's not that it's a whole different set of values it's about openness it's about putting the accent on giving access it's about the social not the solitary it's about thinking internationally not just on the ground and I don't think it will surprise I hope a single soul in this room if I say certainly at the British Library we see no dichotomy here the glory the resilience of what great libraries are and can be is that they endlessly encompass and navigate their way right around that spectrum of values and it's the tensions and the creativity that is sparked when you are determined to deliver services and future facing services that encompass that spectrum of values that makes the work that Helen and others do and institutions like this dynamic and interesting so for us at the BL we've been trying to synthesize some of these thoughts over these past a few years and last year just over a year ago we published this living knowledge the British Library 20 15 to 20 23 which on the face of it is one of those gloriously random years plucked from apparently nowhere but of course for those of you with specialisms in british acts of parliament you'll know it's not a completely random year it will in fact be the 50th birthday of the British Library as a standalone institution there was the British Museum Library of course and there were the other great scientific and other institutions that went to make it up but we will be 15 20 23 and we chose that year because it's a good year because it's a little stimulus and reminder to some of our stakeholders paymasters colleagues that were young as well as old that the BL came into being within a year or two of Microsoft and Apple and we have that glorious ability which we cherish to be still moulding our identity while having roots that of course doing the terms of the collections on the items date back centuries or even millennia it's also i might say as a time frame a useful one it's a little bit beyond a political calendar and it's not so far into the future that it's unimaginable but it is long enough to get we think a few a few big things done and what else to say about this some of you may be familiar with an important predecessor document that my brilliant brilliant predecessor Lynn Brindley brought into being the 2020 vision back in 2010 and this and that had an accompanying strategy called growing knowledge that took us to took us to last year Helen I think in your time at the BL you'd have been involved in a lot of the work that went into that and that was a deeply analyzed look deep into particularly the digital future and it set a general direction which this continues there's been no break in continuity here but the plot has thickened and that's something that we want to explore a little bit i'm sure in sessions like this there have been changes and certain trends that were just embryonic there now feel very very deep part of what we do a move towards openness of all kinds institutional openness openness term or audiences publishing openness debates over open access publishing open data and so on data itself we knew we were moving into the age of data but boy does that feel the landscape now and then patty you mentioned there's something around the creative economy and understanding that the the conditions for creative thinking are not just a nice to have somewhere over in the arts industry there's actually something there in creating those conditions which cut right across the disciplines which bring different traditions together different cultures together and lead to innovation and success in all fields and libraries we assert in living knowledge have a crucial role to play in all of those areas and we talk about trying to be open and creative and innovative in what we do but we also stress here that this is a story where the continuities are as interesting as the disruptions I guess again those that left right picture around the values and i have to say when I was helping to put this together I was just a little disturbed though maybe not completely surprised that even people in very high political office in the land didn't always seem to understand what a library is for or what a National Library is for so we've been at pains here to structure living knowledge around a land sched of purposes which are if not timeless then very very long lasting indeed they're engineered if you like to see us well beyond the next five revolutions simply because our predecessors have proven that the idea of the library has lived through several industrial revolutions and social revolutions and there's a great deal of continuity there as well so we say that state an overall statement of purpose about making these extraordinary collections accessible and ever we thought carefully around those words research inspiration and enjoyment and we did put the word everyone in the middle of that a little innocent word which let's just say it raises the bar a little bit for us as an organization but we took a view that we are publicly funded the collections we look after the birthright of every one in the UK really they're a global birthright as well booth British history they encompass collections from all over the planet all the great language groups and we wanted to challenge ourselves to endlessly think particularly in the digital age how more open how more accessible and you can never do it perfectly can these collections be and then we have six simple statements of purpose one is around custodianship a timeless role which by the way consumes a great majority of our larger part of our public budget which is simply looking after and growing this huge collection 150 million plus physical items growing all the time still through physical legal deposit and of course the digital collections which grow I'm not sure allowed to use the word exponentially but certainly very very rapidly indeed all the time and all the accompanying almost industrial scale skills that go with that research of course you put these collections to work and we're here to support research of all kinds perhaps unlike a university we do have academic and student communities but we're also here to serve anyone all kinds of research novelist filmmakers family historians anyone with the spark of a business idea and so on needs to feel absolutely welcomed and supported at at the National Library business and some people are surprised to see the business purpose express so crystally but in our act of parliament we're here to support industry and that's true of the sort of white heat of Technology moment that gave birth in the 60s and 70s to the BL there was a determination that these wonderful collections were not just celebrated for their historical value but endlessly put to work and for business and a new kinds of entrepreneurship and we do that through our business and IP center and other means at the library culture of course we are for probably the majority of people certainly Londoners tourists around the UK a cultural institution first and foremost and it's our job to have memorable cultural experiences and allied to that is a commitment a little more explicit perhaps than the VL has made in the past to be a learning institution as well to grow the researchers of the future to stimulate people of all ages but particularly when they are young and I have to say that this was not something necessarily there in the founding fathers mind of the British Library but once you find yourself in the center for a great metropolis with school children all around and you can see the appetite for this and this is something where we're now stating it as a clear public purpose and we are fund raising and raising money to invest in it and finally we talk about an international purpose to advance knowledge working with partners around the world advancing knowledge and mutual understanding that encompasses in some ways all the others and brings us full circle and is a petite responsibility for an organization like like ours so those are that's the framework if you like and we've found that quite helpful because if you are going to take people on a journey deep deep into a quite unsettling future we've been at pains to stress this is not in the name of tearing up the traditions of the library but simply because the logic of those purposes ultimately takes you to some very interesting places so with our custodianship mission we set out a living knowledge quite a few big transformations and changes patty Helen have already touched on one where only two years in the UK I appreciate you not quite there here with primary legislation here but even in the UK were only two years into the business of actually learning what it means to have the privilege and responsibility of legal deposit collecting for digital content of course it's ebooks of course it's e-journals but the web is the most thrilling and the most challenging of those and if I had to sum up what I think the next huge challenge here is and Richard I'm sure we'll touch on this later it's putting that collection to work it's not enough just to compile a data set just to ensure its preserved but understanding that it can be searched it can be deployed it can be analyzed it can indeed be used for enjoyment and inspiration in the language of those those purposes so that has been and will be a very revolution of the next few years in a more mundane but vital way as ever in each generation you have pret simple preservation challenges ten years ago it was the newspapers in the UK the roof was falling in we were we were losing the fabric of the papers now we are in danger of losing another part of our fabric we are the National sound archive we have six and a half million constantly growing collection of audio recordings commercial music yes but all other kinds of oral history rare recordings unique material and 42 different format the formats are fading the machinery on which to play those formats is fading in front of our eyes the people who know how to fix the machines to play those 42 vomits will fade and there's a global consensus that we've got about 15 years or so to create a kind of Noah's Ark a digitized audio heritage before I'm afraid we'll have another kind of black hole which is the black hole of recorded sound and we have a big unified project here we called it save our sounds and part of it is remedial fundraising quite a lot of money we've had a provisional ground of nine and a half million from the UK heritage lottery fund to work with partners around the UK to identify the most at risk most important sound recordings but we also want to make that part of a wider bit of thinking around the audio memory there is no official national radio archive in the UK and we want to make sure that in a hundred years time the the radio that is preserved at these partially is not just the wonderful BBC but actually reflects the full diversity of commercial and community radio and also we need to think about in the absence of legal deposit how we continue to bring music in from a music industry which is becoming increasingly digital so that is a one of our major projects another is a different kind of future thinking around the other half of the British Library which is not in London at all but in Yorkshire and here's another fantastic visionary piece of 60s architecture which is the center of the again nineteen sixties technological marvel that is the British library's document supply center in boston spa at Wetherby in yorkshire and that in itself isn't is a great piece of visionary thinking that maybe in the internet age felt like it was coming to an end who needs a document supply service when you have wired connectivity but there was a reason it was put there because it was you know that's that site was chosen because good as London is here's why Boston safaris for those of you don't know it's bang in the middle of the United Kingdom of the kingdom the other British Isles inside and that was so of course interlibrary loans and other material could could be accessed easily by lorries and Boston spire is changing its character under our generations watch this is the this is a terrible photograph is taken on a blackberry but I've included it cuz it's the only the only photograph I've ever posted on twitter that ever was remotely popular because this was just a probably the first glimpse inside what we proudly now call the national newspaper building which opened last year in boston spa which is a kind of temple to journalism this is huge Cathedral 24 x 20 meters robotic ly controlled dark climate-controlled yes 750 million pages in there 33 kilometers of shelving about 10 years of growth every word of whatever quality committed to print by any British journalist since 1600 is in there and yes if you've ever had a letter published in a UK newspaper it'll be in there somewhere it is a marvel and it sits alongside our other repository and is beginning to change the character of boston spa to become we hope not just a british library facility but making full use in the age of openness of that geographical location as many many institutions of diverse kinds find themselves in possession of important but non-disposable but less used paper and print collections that the idea of a shared storage facility over the next 10 to 20 years in which not just BL collections but other collections can be efficiently managed looked after digitized on-site digitized on demand or on occasion making use of that wonderful motorway network to actually bring them in 24 hours notice to reading rooms around the country so a different take on custodianship and again bringing the technological the physical and the digital together in new ways so our research purpose derives directly from at and again you'll see in living knowledge we set out the knee of course for new kinds of research spaces more kind of collaborative environments we're already seeing at the BL simply by opening up new Wi-Fi enabled reading spaces in our public areas that we are creating a kind of book list but library environment very very dynamically used outside the the reading rooms but we also talked about wanting to ensure that we contribute directly to research we do have an increasing body of digitized heritage every year now thanks to the mellon Foundation we've been able to launch a British Library labs competition where we open up purely for innovation to the whole planet people to come up with ideas for new form of analytics new things to do with different parts of our already digitized historic collections and it's been very successful it's led to projects like the mechanical curator other bits of analytics that extract different forms of language humor from 19th century text that were hard to capture by other means and that is of course just one tip of this iceberg that we are now just digesting what it means for cultural heritage collections to join the family of innovation very very dynamic around the Big Data universe and that's where this gentleman comes in Benedict Cumberbatch for those of you don't areas but here he is impersonating of course Alan Turing in the recent movie and [Music] Turing's name has been given to a new research institute in the united kingdom devoted to big data to innovation in algorithmic science in higher mathematics for social purpose an economic benefit the Alan Turing Institute is an alliance of the universities of Oxford of course and Cambridge Edinburgh UCL and war and the cream of many of their computer scientists and mathematicians are coming together to form the nucleus of it about a hundred and fifty researchers on site we hope by the end of next year and what was I think an important moment for us engaging at the highest levels of government with an understanding about what a library of the future might really mean is that we did a year ago year and a half ago win the competition to host the Alan Turing Institute on-site at the BL because i think the penny dropped that there's something very potent about bringing together deep deep intellectual collections with the the very cutting edge of creative innovation and research in big data and of course under the direction of the team of the Alan Turing Institute research will be conducted in all sorts of areas of social problems financed by a medical research but also culture creativity and cultural heritage and I'm delighted that we will be working to connect them to other libraries are the collecting institutions museums so that we we can begin to do a classic Library Thing of a bridge between worlds to try and live up to that promise of connecting people and ideas that will lead to business innovation and I mentioned our business purpose we're very proud of our business and IP Center were all so fascinated to see in this knowledge economy this creative economy what is happening even on our doorstep and a couple of years ago we were talking to our friends at the francis crick institute which is just north of the British Library a big biomedical research institute and we realized that this wasteland of Kings Cross had transformed utterly over this last decade and that now if you draw a circle around the library thinking the library at the heart you have probably the densest concentration within London of knowledge generating institutions universities research institutes companies and so on but they weren't talking to each other many of them were frankly competitive or suspicious and we were able I think in a small way to play that brokering role that a library at the heart can play I can see it happening with the unity within a university context here it's the trusted Center where different forces come together and out of that came a full partnership called the knowledge quarter roughly mile radius I think we had 35 organizations that launched now are up to 65 and that has helped to open doors stimulate innovation create more community engagement because there are poor parts of town here down here and above all deliver knowledge exchange between institutions big and small and that model we think is fruitful not just in London but in other cities around the UK and that's why we're pleased under our business purpose all to be also to be working with partner public libraries around the UK to set up business and intellectual property centers in now 8 and we said in living knowledge 20 centers around the country and we're determined that those are not just business centers but thinking of our culture and educational purposes that they also form part of what you might call a living knowledge network of libraries that begin to talk to each other and share expertise in new ways because then what it's like here but certainly in England at least the public library sectors even the grandest of the most successful of them have had a very very tough time lately and one of the things in an age of openness you can do is simply engage more share more between institutions we've just done it with the wonderful library of Birmingham I don't know if you've been there of course possesses of the second greatest Shakespeare collection in the UK but not necessarily with the resource or capacity to do a major exhibition and by working with them we've just we've just co-curated our first out of London exhibition our Shakespeare the library of Birmingham which complements our own Shakespeare anniversary exhibition in London and there's a London dimension to this at all I know you think about the physical spaces your own exhibition galleries here we are seeing 10% compound growth in footfall to our public program our exhibitions are learning program which has been historically under-resourced when we have big crowds at the library they are really big crowds this is one of the the late events to accompany our recent propaganda exhibition so I hope over the time of the Living knowledge period you will see change and expansion on the somewhat underused and derelict land between us and the francis crick institute just to the north the famous land to the north of the british library to reorient and take a building which is something of a fortress and make it a genuinely open campus at the heart of the knowledge quarter finally our international purpose brings all of this together and there it really is the business of entering the digital age by sharing our patrimony and that means digitization partnerships around our Middle Eastern collections with the cata foundation we have projects underway bit by bit to unlock the treasures of our these are our malay collections hebrew manuscripts with a stavros niarchos foundation working our way through our greek collections persian collections with the Iranian Heritage Fund digitizing as much as we can of our great Indian and South Asian collections where proprietors of the India Office archives and records and we have just launched possibly our most ambitious possibly insane project so far called two centuries of Indian print where we have realized that we are holders of the greatest collection of Indian printed books outside South Asia and that we want to share those with the world that is really testing our international purpose to its limit but we're framing it within one of if you want to distill is all five big programs of change that bring all of this together and they're simply expressed but they will together i hope deliver what we think will be the british library of the future so heritage made digital making sure that those most at risk collections or most important collections whether it is indian printed books or audio collections are made available and interoperable with the other great collections of the world and the work that mike has been doing on triple i F and someone creates a massive global community here if we get this right everything available we want to ensure that this is not just digitized but dynamic accessible used everyone engaged you can sense this but wanting to test that word everyone in our mission statement to ensure that we're truly a national library not just a Yorkshire and London library by the end of this process and yes two important programs of work on our physical estates around some pancreas and boston spa so i think i will leave it there too to conclude because i'm determined that we do leave a little bit of time for Q&A but just to say as a final reflection i come into this world from the allegedly future facing world of broadcasting and digital and television and i can only say with absolute honesty that the library community is the most future facing profession i have ever encountered precisely because the greatest collections are the inheritors of material that dates back centuries or tens of centuries in some cases and that delivers a time frame for responsibility in future thinking that is always thinking 50 100 200 years ahead you see that happening all over this great community of national and international and academic libraries nowhere more than here and that's why it's such a pleasure to be here today and thank you for the invitation you [Applause] [Music]
