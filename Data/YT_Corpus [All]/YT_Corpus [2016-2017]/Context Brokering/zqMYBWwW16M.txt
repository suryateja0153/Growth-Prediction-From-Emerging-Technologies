 we're moving into a world where you will soon be able to plan trips chop even talk to intelligent BOTS all from within your skype chat and you see I have a visual video mail from from guru deep I'm gonna play it Hey I just learned that you would ask Suki not go that's again this year congratulations and you're seeing here there are some new things in this next generation of Skype you see this visual video mail so we have a video message with the transcript right below this is one of the examples where we're taking intelligence from things like Skype translator and bringing them directly into everyday features like video messages so in this next generation I said the other thing that you'll notice in the canvas is my personal assistant Cortana is always there in the upper right hand corner Cortana is there if I want to talk to her at one on one or in a group or even as you can see here she's subtly improving my messages by highlighting key points in my text so now you see Cortana is actually sending me a private message I'm gonna tap that and I go into the one-on-one conversation I have with Cortana so she's telling me the cups and cake spot would like to know my location for delivery and yes I'll share it the agent Cortana is actually brokering the conversation with the third party bought the cups and cakes but now I see this rich card that is showing me that the cupcake is on its way and that it will be here within a few minutes all of this is happening within my Skype chats this is just one example of the many ways that you're going to start seeing businesses using the power of Skype and Cortana to interact with their customers now since I'm already talking to Cortana and I've committed to doing this keynote I'm gonna go ahead and try to plan the rest of my trip now Cortana is proactively thinking about the next steps in coordinating my trip so she's actually suggesting that I connect with the Westin but anybody that knows me knows I normally stay at a Westin bot and so what you see here now is Cortana has actually introduced the Westin bot into the conversation but not only has she done that she has given the Westin bot context so I don't have to repeat myself the Westin bot knows this is for Dublin and it's for those particular dates all of this saves me a lot of time and effort and now because Cortana has all my relevant details the Westin bot actually leave the conversation now we're seeing a third aspect of Cortana she knows my connection she knows who I communicate with and so here you're seeing her actually suggests that when I go on this trip to Dublin that I communicate with my friend Jani and I see this card I could call her directly from here or video call her but I don't know what time it is and so I'm gonna choose to message her clicking that takes me to the conversation I have with Jani the other thing you'll notice is that Cortana because she has context about why I'm pinging Jani as she's pre-populated the text with context around when I'm going to Dublin and basically why I want to talk to her so this is just a glimpse into how Skype and Cortana powered by Bing can make our conversations more productive informed and fun
