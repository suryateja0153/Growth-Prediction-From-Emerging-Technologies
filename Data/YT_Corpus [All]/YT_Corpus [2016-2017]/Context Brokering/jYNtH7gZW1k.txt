 my name's lefel Corddry and i'm director of policy and strategy at NHS providers and I'm delighted to be chairing today's session which is about putting Vanguard plans into practice and we're going to run today's session slightly differently in that there's going to be a kind of Q&A interview between me and my two esteemed colleagues here and then we're going to open it up to wider question and answer so I beg your patience for listening to start with and then we will bring people in so I'm going to introduce our two interviewees to you on my left we've got Heather Tierney Moore who's chief executive of Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust and on my right we've got Jacqui Daniel who's chief executive of University Hospitals Morecombe Bay NHS Foundation Trust I only read those out because often it's so easy to get a trust name wrong and I don't want to do that so and they're more and more complicated as time goes on so really what we wanted to do today was to find the opportunity with two trusts that are coming together in a new Vanguard plan and proposal to really talk about what this means what's the nuts-and-bolts hands-on impact of pursuing a vanguard under the new fight well not new five year forward view four year forward view now as it is and to think about all of those elements that you really need to take into consideration when when pursuing this and I think one of the things we really want to get under the skin of is not just the hard facts but also the soft stuff which is the bits that we know actually make these things work so um I'm going to kick off to start with and just ask both both of my colleagues just to tell us a bit about their packs model and for those of you who don't remember what the acronym stand for and I've got it written out here to remind myself it's a primary and acute care system so I'm going to turn to Heather first just to talk a bit about that and perhaps your general context I know it's working well certainly when we started thinking about this we were quite uncomfortable with being label as a pax because that wasn't really how we saw it working through and obviously being part of the vanguard was important to us so we were happy to stick with the title but the reality really is it's more like 12 and MC ESPYs with an acute provider as a kind of overarching part of that because at the heart of the models that had been developed are 12 neighborhoods based around primary care very much a kind of place-based approach and then considering how the acute services support and span across those rather than starting as the acute provider being the kind of prime focus and then how does the rest of the system work to that I mean my my personal involvement is that I'm actually the mental health provider to about half of the locality so for me it's a very small part of my whole business probably only about 4 or 5 percent whereas for Jackie it's a hundred percent of her organization so so we're coming at it from from very different perspectives but with the same commitment to saying what is it that the population needs and and Jackson Murthy to talk more about the nature of the population we're seeking to serve because there were some particular issues that we face across the bay but really thinking about so so what what needs to be different for those different communities because for parts of North Lancashire the challenges are different from other parts of Cumbria Jackie do you want to contribute them yeah just to add to that that I mean the kind of geography is relevant most of you will probably only visit through through our patch up to the Lake District will appreciate some of it but you know as a truss we operate we have three main sites across a geography and a population that would probably barely merit one if you're looking in kind of average and certainly tariff terms so when I joined the organization three years ago was kind of scratching my head thinking what do you do with a problem that was and you know to a large extent you know is an improving position that still is Malcolm Bay where most of you will know had got pretty catastrophic quality failures but really born out of a broken model of provision and certainly kind of salami slicing here on year costing cost improvements so yeah population very dispersed very difference in barrow-in-furness we've got some of the most you know challenge wards in the country you know people in Barrow you know men on average a living six years less than the England average in Lancaster it's a much younger population a lot of students with the university they're very different issues in Kendell people could not often come and retire so lots of wealthy elderly people but yeah really really challenging geography to deal with so for a bit more clarity for the audits what we've got is is more convey and it's the totality of your services coming under the packs and for your trust it's part of what you do could you just talk about that yeah we can make that clear so so I provide the mental health services to the North Lancashire my colleague from Cumbria partnership provides the mental health and community services to South Cumbria I then provide mental health services across the rest of Lancashire and a lot of physical health services in certain parts of Lancashire so I'm actually involved in two Vanguard's and three other sub health economy transformations so so it's interesting for me in particular to to have done a kind of live random almost not quite a randomized control trial but certainly opportunity to compare and contrast what how things are working in Morecambe Bay how things are working in other other Vanguard's and other areas that haven't got the label of Vanguard of trying to do very similar things and it has quite important implications for my organization and probably later talk about how we're supported by the map the center and how people understand how things are developing in terms of regulation etc because I just live in a world of Venn diagrams and and nothing is neat for me in terms of how my organization needs to fit it's probably worth just going on to say just building on that so there were there eleven organizations in the partnership so for FTS to local authorities and to big GP Federation's either side for the pouch time to get involved to CCGs but it's a really important point that you make there because I've just I've seen Karen Partington in the audience somewhere but you know whilst we're kind of hundred percent of the Vanguard in the bay we also we play into the hospital's group down the Lancashire Coast so I think that Venn diagram world is probably familiar to see a lot of people nodding in the audience we're all going to be living in Venn diagrams you know multiple Venn diagrams I think that makes sense I think the watchword at the moment is ambiguity isn't it how you how you start to assess the nature of your relationships and where you fit within that um can I just ask you to expand and I'm going to ask you first Jacqui to expand a bit more on the the kind of more motivation for for you pursuing this approach the role motivation starts with them taking on a job with with the kind of quality failures that we were seeing across the patch it starts with the patient experience and what we're offering for the population it was broke and then you know these solutions weren't easy so we've been building this model way before five year forward view came in to just came into sharp relief but I think you know I can say hand on heart for all partners working at Heather but it is absolutely to leave a legacy for the next generation of population in the bay excellent and what do you think the key outcomes are going to be what do you hope they're going to be well I think I mean one of the reasons I was very keen to be involved right from the start was to really try and make the most of bringing physical and mental health services together and and really think differently about what is the nature of that so it's not about saying oh well we've got some established mental health services that we just want to be linked with some physical health services is actually about saying what is the notion of a parity of esteem what is the notion of well-being what what are the opportunities to support individuals in a way that is truly holistic and that actually makes a difference rather than just join up bits of a system a bit more and for me that's where I'm trying to come at it so really coming at it from a population health perspective rather than how do we just figure round with some health services and some care services and make them a little bit better than they are so the opportunities to kind of tear up all of the the role books so for instance when we're thinking about what might be the mental health component of some of these pathways it's probably going to involve some very different kinds of people than we currently have it's not about me dropping a CPN or a psychiatrist into a physical health team it's probably something very different and and how we've been working with communities again is it's very different model so there's still a long way to go I'm not suggesting that we know what the answers are but I think we're just asking some really big questions I think that's what struck me in talking to people involved in different Vanguard's is actually how how places are seizing the structural imperative and turning it into benefit for patients and that's just what you've articulated there I think and and is really really compelling about those the Vanguard's that are doing it well in a sense about how how do you pull that out of what is deemed to be a structural solution um I suppose what we've got here is a situation where this is part of your endeavor this is the totality of your endeavor that could be in certain hands quite combustible working relationship I wonder if if if you could both kind of enlighten us on on how you work together because I think one of the fundamental things is about how people work together around these bringing together structures so Jackie so we tell the pretend story no the real one well we have been at it a while so I guess that's first thing to say three years in actual fact probably no nest 18 months in terms of the relationship building and we do you know we do disagree we've got some really tough decisions about particularly you know we're moving to a shadow MOU and ACS which which is going to be real it's gonna have a real budget who's gonna have real delegated responsibility for what we're what we're coming to know is they care partners and with that you know it's territories which which we which is difficult not to come and guard fiercely and as the one that does sit squarely hundred percent in the patch you know I have to do is remember that you know the three percent the four percent is every bit as important if not more importantly natural fact and I've got to learn to kind of tone it down which those of you who know me well will know that that's not an easy task but I try and do it what about from your perspective is very different it's very different and it would have been very easy for me to say do you know what actually it's a tiny bit of the business it's we haven't really got much of a role to play initially most of the conversations were about physical health and when you're thinking about which which meetings do you prioritize it would been really easy to go you know I won't bother with that but I felt it was it was really important that we we play our part and that I mean being very selfish but it's a great learning opportunity to to be involved right from the beginning and to really think then about how can I take what we're learning from here to apply to the rest of of Lancashire and help spread some of that and avoid trying to avoid being a can of broken record about going what about mental health what about mental health but actually it it we did a bit of that beginning and then peak now other people are going yeah but what about mental health anything that's fantastic I don't have to mention that anymore and you can you can play across across the whole agenda I think I think there we are the thing that I really like about working with the Malcolm a vanguard is the quality of the relationships though because we've got pasts they just being polite and so some of the tension is is absolutely what you need because if we're all just in that kind of groupthink and nobody's challenging each other then we're not going to make the right decisions so we're kind of got a more of a grown-up relationship now where yes we disagree sometimes it gets a bit tense but we're big enough to work it through yeah I think the things you're talking about repeating over and over again what about mental health they do say that when you're sick of saying it the message will finally have got through so clearly yeah probably is really important to talk about commissioners because they out here we work with two commissioning groups at the moment they have really worked as one for the last year 18 months and and they will come together and we in the in the ACS there will be commissioners and providers sat side by side either making or buying our services and they've been they've been fantastic I have to say and we're really looking when I look you know and talk to other providers I don't see the same kind of quality and the same maturity in terms of leadership so I feel really privileged that we've got that I would absolutely endorse that I think the the partners that it's been hardest for actually the local flora and particularly the count Lancashire County because you know they've had to go through huge amounts of structural change they've got all of the financial challenges they a lot of their solutions to just managing because of their financial position is to kind of adopt an approach that works for them and it's this isn't a Christmas and it's just recognizing where they are so their ability to be as engaged and as flexible as we might want to keep the pace going in more conveys is a real challenge for them and they understand that and we share that with them but it is a real issue and and as we move into things starting to be really different ensuring that we've got elected members really well sighted all of this and supportive of it is going to be really important yeah I think that's certainly what we're hearing is that the role of elected members is coming center stage probably in a way that they of course have been there in the local authority setting but not as prominent as they are now in in all of the different arrangements that we're seeing I mean I think that's so vital as well if you if you are taking population health focus we're very fortunate to have a lot of Public Health my medical director quite unusually for an acute trust is a public health doctor and we've got a number of public health experts in the patch it's gonna be so important that we will look across housing we look across employment education etc we're beginning to do that but clearly you know we're long a long way to go on on that agenda I'm gonna open it up now for for Q&A and hands going up already before before we ask questions can I just have a show of hands who in the room is involved in some kind of Vanguard project okay I see why you're here that's really helpful to know isn't it the case I think that the first round of Vanguard should reach 10 million populations so I think it's it's heartening to see so many of you here we've only got one microphone in the room so please bear with us as our colleague gets to you so got the microphone coming to the gentleman there in the yellow tie you say who you are and where you're from yes here Morton Williams chair of ntw mental health and disability trust in the North East of England van guards are very complex beasts and they involve multi-agency working and multi partner working so my question is really how have you modified your local accountability and governance arrangements to take account of both Democratic involvement but also in terms of the governance of all your respective organizations how are you how you dealing with that okay Jackie come to UK I'll start it's difficult for me not to rewind the clock a bit we so we've had what we call a program board we've put you know we actually put funding in there for three consecutive years from our own funding to you know resource things like OD development backfill some of the really key posts to do some of the design work so that was it that was in place and I guess there was a an implicit rather than rather than an explicit sign up from all governing bodies and boards we're just about to if you look on any of our websites this month we take him through our Memorandum of Understanding for the ACS through every single governing body and board so you'll see quite a lot of detail there about the proposed governance structure but we can did what we felt was right for a couple of couple of gives really scientific I know how we're trying to the other thing that we did which was probably important laws we just didn't overkill it with project management because we've got a lot of clinicians involved and if it's if there's one thing you know it just it just turns them off completely so we've got to all the Gateway reviews but we've tried to do it with kind of project mark light if you look if you like could I just perhaps a question that you might follow up with was if your chair was here what would they say about the lines of accountability and how they feel sorry to put you on school give the interesting he would tease I think his Butler if he was here would say it's felt quite scary at times because you knows let us get on with it we we have had a line of governance through to the zoo to the board of course and services some of the subcommittees but you know you've got to have a bit of elbow room to the new manoeuvre and I think I've had that from my board my exec team have had that from from the board and then if you take it more widely think about your accountability as a trust then to to the other bodies how'd it have you seen that line of accountability working as has this approach altered your wider accountability in terms of regulators yes general well if I'm you know again I'll be really honest but you know we are grappling with we've just called a summit so we've called our regulators and an HSE and everybody around the table to try and work through some some misalignment shall I put it like that way and we've held a number of these summits over the last 18 18 months we find find that quite difficult is challenging they'd find it difficult but you know we've we've kept going with that yeah Heather from your perspective which you know is the other end of the spectrum yeah so I mean I agreed with my board right from the beginning that we would do the right thing by by the population and that that might mean some significant changes in some of our services and so I've kept them really sited on all of the developments as we've gone on and and interestingly when we took our paper through our board just recently the conversation of the board was how needing to have kind of more thought about how they can be fleet of thought to respond to the changes rather than allowing our governance to get in the way of the changes we want to make so really thoughtful conversation with the board and then on a very practical basis for the my mental health contract I have a lead commissioner who has been and that's been really important in terms of us being able to do a major impatient reconfiguration across the county reducing from 15 not fit for purpose in inpatient facilities so I'm kind of master plan to go down to four and we've open to granule units so there's something really important for me about the integrity of that cross Lancashire work across HCC jeans not being then undermined by trying to respond very directly to what's happening in Lancashire north and and having to have some different kinds of conversations between the commissioners to kind of free up particularly our community teams to work potentially in different ways within that overarching contract so and so far that's been fine but but part of my some of my risk is whether being involved in different Vanguard's and different sub health economies undermines what has been very purposeful in terms of having a Lancashire wide approach to the very specialist end of my services thank you thank you Hugh do you want to come back on any that yes but I suppose my conclusion on that is that the model that you're aiming for is not yet in vision I think would be the best way of putting at it but at the same time you're describing that everyone is working together and not getting in the way of ensuring that the Vanguard itself works yeah it's probably not in vision is probably not correct so we've got a very detailed - through your implementation plan if you walk about the patch you can touch and feel new ways of working today with we probably do that kind of you know I was going to use the word anyway you know we've been getting on with what what is just banned or obvious and implementable and I guess we've sought forgiveness rather than permission a lot I think I think new thing to say is that what we've done is we've set ourselves in effect a 12-month time scale in which to come to a be like a conclusion about what is the nature of the future organizational form so we're going to work in this closer shadow way over the next 12 months but with a clear commitment that we'll use that 12 months to kind of really test what changes structural changes have to happen to enable us to progress at the pace that we want rather than focus on what we think that might be now and potentially makes for the wrong choices so for instance we've said you know people talk about all of the barriers to integration well let's test those and see actually with with the right will and commitment do you actually have to change how much organizational form do you have to change to make that happen and I suspect some of it will be surprising so I mean in my experience things as simple as being really clear about which policy people are working to when they come from four different organizations but they're working together as a team of blessing the way of them being able to work well together but it's not big clever you know organizational form stuff that that's something much more operational no I take from that the conflicts of interest that you knew were there have been put to one side for the benefit of the patient absolutely but I suppose my cautionary word to you would be those conflicts of interest still exist absolutely gentleman at the back and then we'll come down to the front and then yeah hello Dominic Kahneman Chelsea and Westminster um two questions if I may you touched on on a key issue there about a number of schemes that you're involved in and I wonder actually you could say a little bit about you used the great risk word a little bit about some of the conflicts a lot of interests as a governance but around running parallel systems either because there are two different new systems or because you've got a bit of the old system in players where them where you is what balance you've got between the resilience of the old and the development of the new that's one and then two if I may like the rest of the rumors probably equally inspired and terrified by professor Williams's address about and what I think he's reading is a real understanding of your population how we can establish improve health and as people have been thinking about that a bit longer than the rest of us I wonder whether that what's Timmy I don't know ask you what you've got in play because a bit unfair an hour after he's finished speaking but what's that stimulated in your minds in terms of what that might might take us to in terms of a better understanding of our population yeah I guess at the moment it just feels like we within our own organisation living like should care we just have to work it feels like sometimes three times as hard just to sustain everything so there's real practicalities about how we physically service five different transformation boards between our executives how we balance being flexible to to what people say they want kind of locally and how we get consistency across services and thinking our minds sometimes the the perception is bigger than the reality so lots of the different health economies saying oh we need something very bespoke for us and actually when you boil it down it isn't that different and so we're focusing on kind of quality you know sort of quality standards and our professional advice particularly in relation to mental health services I think it's an interesting point that we've discussed actually within the vanguard around the notion there's a bit of a risk I think that people think that if things are done in the community that they're inherently and kind of the the governance and quality of those are easily managed and actually I think it's quite the reverse and in mental health the fact that we don't do stuff in a hospital doesn't mean it's not incredibly complex and specialized and and very risky so there's something about the governance of the models and ensuring that there is the retains adequate supervision and oversight of standards within a more integrated approach and so we've been thinking a lot about how we might do that and we've kind of referred to the kind of mothership and the relationship to the mothership even if you like staff are gifted into some kind of new organization so so I think we just have to just feel that we work quite twice as hard managing those risks actually but I think when you it's the transition that's the problem when you get to the final status I can see an easy solution but it's very messy at the moment and and there's a lot of brokering of conversations between the different commissioners and the different health economists about what is it really that you think is so different that you really want I'm just struck by one of what Chris said in the keynote speech as a futurist chief exec and the trust that was very broken is still in special measures fingers crossed we get our CQC inspection report in a couple of weeks time but you know thank you but you know you've got one foot in this kind of holding on to stability you know you can a struggling transition with a foot in transformation and that's a juggling act I guess all of his own a kind of facing and trying to communicate that to staff within the acute sector about you know improving day-to-day practice etc whilst also trying to describe you know this this new this new accountable care system that we're creating is an absolute juggling act and quite right and I got my wings clipped this week by colleagues for you know a word that I got wrong in an advert that's out of the moment for our director of strategy and you've just got a seat forgiveness and just being quite pragmatic about it yeah yeah but I think I think that we've created the environment were stuff on the ground are just doing some really sensible stuff almost below the radar as a classic example in Lancaster I provide the specialist mental health care home liaison team blackpool acute trust provides a physical health nursing home liaison team and jackie has dementia in hospital team and these teams just got together they actually physically moved the black ball team into the building in Lancaster and said can't we if we just all work together wouldn't this make a whole lot more sense and then I found out about it after the journey and it was just brilliant and they're now working together really well in reach out reach supporting the across from care home into community and into hospital just two further points if I may just we have invested quite heavily heavily in OD so we spent a lot of time working through what we need to do all levels of these you know integration in order to make it as easy as possible the other thing just going back to your point about population and you know you know equity equality etc I think you know the real prize for us will be we're very privileged to have some some very compatible joined up informatics and IT and we've spent quite a slug of the 10 million Vanguard we we got recently got allocated on in information systems and we were really using that to accelerate what we can do in terms of understanding the needs of our of our population so we're not at first base with that yet but I think we will be quite quickly just we've joined up IT and information that's great okay so gentlemen down the front here who wanted to ask a question the microphone is just coming and then I'll work my way back up thank you Richard Patterson Royal Brompton and her field um I didn't I didn't really have a clear picture of what you're trying to do what what is this gonna look like at the end and and I suppose you know you wouldn't start from here if you were trying to get wherever it is but I I don't quite see what the plan is can you can you try and define the plan in a couple of sentences that would be helpful I can and look on our website and you'll see it and you can go on the better care together website you'll also see it that's it that's the terminology we use and it is all about integration is across the different sectors including the ambulance trust and social care so it's all about putting teens together Heather talked about twelve twelve localities there if you if you if you come up one step from that they're in three locations so North Lancashire Kendall and barrow-in-furness and it is all about providing care at around the patients around in those localities interestingly the GP Federation's are also organising themselves in that way so at the center of it is absolutely primary primary care so it's around integration we have been working as you might expect on some plant care pathway redesign so we've got eight pathways that look completely different Children's Services lots fundamentally different across the bay they're all Bay wide provision and they slammed the same is true for emergency care pathways and also important to this is a can of advice and guidance service at either end or in those three localities so you know I've kind of gone full circle in my career in terms of GPS talking to Hospital consultants they actually have live conversations every day all day and sometimes during the night about the patients so hope that gives you a bit better feel probably miss lot and and our expectation is that that ultimately will be delivered by an accountable care organization that will both Commission and provide that service and take responsibility for the totality of the health care well the health of the population which will also involve obviously the social of the social care and wider determinants okay I'm gonna move question on to gentleman in the middle and I'll come to you different and then you can thank you Alan are not from Peterborough and Sanford Foundation Trust so I'm sort of towards the same end of the spectrum is that the last questioner there I'm variant I can I can heal the process I can hear that you're in the process they can hear that that something will get delivered on the track and it would be a legacy for future generations because it does sound like it might take quite a long time to get there and I can hear the integration and thoughts about a single budget maybe in the countable care organization maybe kind of sliding towards that but I'm very interesting to hear if you've got a clearer picture or on the outcome where it looks like it I think I heard you're saying that you did have a clearer picture be good to know what that is but also have you defined the prize I have you defined what sort of transformation and patient care or patient experience is going to happen and that that is which you are driving for and have you have you defined the financial price your home much how many tens of millions of pounds are going to drag out of the that the overall cost structure as a result of doing all of this because that's when it starts having purpose isn't it so again yeah we have to a greater or lesser extent defined all of those things so where we started was a problem at the bay and I talked about the quality families but you know whether a quality failures finance follows pretty quickly so the prize and I think this is just I think this is like peeling the layers of an onion so at the moment we've got savings costs of 13 five years that we're going to take out that is that is just today's workings out and actually I suspect as we get into looking at next year and we do get greater integration and that number will get bigger I could I could see it coming as high as 70 million across across the budget of what's probably I don't know three quarters of a billion so yes we've got some hard edged metrics yes we've got some real deliverables in terms of both quality care and I'm capacity you know you'd expect the usual stuff around reduction in hospital beds where I'm hoping to save around 70 outpatient clinics a week from from next year actually some of those are already happening this year reduction in length of stairs already happening you know flow through the hospital hospital I'm speaking from a acute sector provider we tested a couple of weeks ago two wars worth of patients we were able to accelerate just working in the day way as we call it so yes there are some real hard age tangibles and more and more to come I think okay I'm gonna yes I'm sorry about the previous finish my question okay it was based on the finance the individual organizations and whether you've done any financial modeling to get an idea of whether all this is fantastic for the patient and is it actually going to save money but I think you answered that with a figure of 70 million and at that point I passed them microphone on I can partings and chief execs teaching hospital and there's some fantastic work that's going on but in his keynote speech this morning Chris Hobson said that vanguards and new models of working probably take about five to ten years to realize any benefits and in lancashire we have a 800 million pound gap between now and 2020 I just wonder how are we going or how are you going to keep the Vanguard process moving for the future and deliver today's efficiencies today because I don't think there's going to be much mercy for any of us not doing so well not withstanding the fact that we've we've got some targets around money and so on personally I don't believe that the Vanguard's and all of the work that we're planning even across Lancashire is going to be able to close that gap it doesn't mean to say it's still not the right things to do and I think one of the big leadership challenges is to continue to do the right things to do it to the very best of our capability and continue to push the argument about and be you know as chris said this morning have that honesty about it isn't there isn't another plan we all know that but I don't think this plan is enough so I think increasingly it's about how we collectively have those conversations and we've had some very honest conversations with monitor and others about the pace at which all of this can happen and there's my sense and Jackie might have a different view is monitor could have taken a very different approach with with the bay and has actually allowed us to continue with this plan and believed as in that we think it's the right plan you might say it's because we're there isn't another one but it at least they've held off rather than for clothes and bring people in and say you know that's it stop because I just don't think that's helpful so I think the important thing though is that in the in the going that none of us do anything kind of in a very selfish way that solves our problem but causes a problem for the rest of the system and again that comes from the quality of the conversations and the relationships whether it's within the bay or across across Lancashire but I don't it's not it's not going to solve it all absolutely I think the interesting add up to that is it absolutely depends I mean so that was being greater than some of our past it absolutely depends on me delivering you know I've got a thirty million cost improvement program I've got an underlying debt deficit to that you know that's before we start to talk about the control Terfel of the vanguard so it relies on each of those you know and it goes back to that stability transition transformation quadrants you know we've got to straddle it we've got to him I'll deliver and keep things stable locally whilst we're whilst we're trying to you know redesign the future either it's a tough balancing act and we've got a hold of each other to account for that you know if the premise position starts deteriorate and then it brings it brings the whole control totally starts to give us all a wobble so you know that's the deal really it moves you on to a more symbiotic relationship doesn't make no sense okay Chris and once we had Chris's question there I'm going to be quite directive now there are two areas that we haven't really covered yet one is the relationship with the central bodies and the other is about clinical engagement so I will either ask those questions but if people have questions from the floor get your brains thinking in that direction Chris thank you Chris mother from these of your palm chip fascinating I'm just wondering however the about the local authority position so does your financial model encompass where the local authorities but imagine themselves being because as we all know it's getting kind of more and more desperate out there so for example in Leeds the latest number that's kind of floating around is around 800 million over five years if things don't change in some way but two positives if I'm a great focusing on the local population because it's about people I love the idea of people clinical teens just getting on with it and telling you what they've done mate or that's I'll say fantastic so Chris to start we've got a sliding scale of engagement on this what would call any MOU the Memorandum of Understanding so initially it would be fairly obvious that the far F cheese will play it play into that initially the GP Federer Asians probably won't there may be some individual practices that do sign up the local authorities Lancashire probably won't come Bria are debating it but they do understand the risk I think and we've had explicit conversations of the risk of putting that Social Care provision in and the risk is because you know Services has just been pared back so finally that what we end up doing is by necessity just you know putting health cash in to mail out social social care so it's not a done deal yet and we are still debating but certainly it's a Lancashire level we've just done a piece of work which we call the alignment of the plans which is explicitly looks at all of the local the three local authorities and all of the providers and all of the commissioners and that's where they 800 million comes from in terms of again you just think of something astrological there where the planets align okay um does anyone have a clinically focused question or shall I ask that I'm going to ask it no hand shot up so really I'm keen to understand how you've sought and got clinical buy-in for this new model because we know that there's one thing focusing on structures it's another thing about bringing together boards and and other parts of organisations but what about the clinical buy-in for this vision and particularly because it's not just about one sector it's about bringing together mental health physical health different sectors out in the community in your bricks and mortar so what we've done and again it's probably important to recognise that this work started before the idea of a vanguard came along so actually we started off bringing clinicians together to consider what one of the futures might be and what the clinical models might be and those are iterating and enhancing as we bring different thinking in but I think that's where we started and I know in you know in particular in Jackie's organization huge amount of clinical time freed up bringing you know crowds of people together to have the conversations and work it out between them and and as we're working through the different places so you know my team in Garstang you know we've said well you know you guys get together with the physical health teams and actually with the police and with other services and start to understand what is it that this population needs and and what might your different contributions might be and and what might be different contributions and certainly the feedback that I'd picked and I don't know anybody asked me what was the difference it made but the conversation was going Han in one way and then when the police came into that conversation it completely changed the whole paradigm of the conversation around that population so I think fishin's are hugely important and there are other wider public sector voices that need to be brought into the conversation I think I think it's been quite we have done we have done it I've had a lot of my clinicians engaged but nowhere near the amount of GPS that are really really really ignited and passionate about about this it's I found it hard a job as an acute chief exec and I have managed to mental health and community services but to get you know impatient consultants really understanding the world inside out if you like and really really seen it through a different lens but God the gp's get it and and I think the challenge for us as kind of leaders is it wouldn't be true to that and you know as we start to devolve accountability into the three localities I can see the boards of those McHale ities with their delegated budgets and etc and their shared objectives you know they'll be led by clinicians so you know the challenge for us is staying absolutely true to that model because you know they they creep they will quickly get disengaged if we don't okay um any further questions from the floor before I'm okay I'm gonna move on to the national bodies and I think this is probably we've we've touched on the role of of the differ central body so monitor and others but I think it would be really good and I'm sure that this is probably something for others in Vanguard or thinking about new ways of delivering care you know what is the nature of the support you get from monitor TDA NHS England other structures to help you deliver this and what we're whether the pinch points come where were the crunches as it were with with the central bodies so I don't know who wants to take the step for we didn't talk about that birth and again it's it's easier for me because I've not been in a position where I have I was feeling the full weight of the help from the centre up till now and I think I had really interesting conversations with CQC about where we're going and how they would need to change their approach and that having not even just a single organization perspective but I mean I was recently well six months ago I was inspected and have three different teams who were looking at you know my adult social care services my mental health services and the physical health services all totally separately and saying and you know we're we're trying to provide integrated services how would you let's that methodology because you can't accommodate that and and think you know and obviously had in the consultation period and thinking at the moment but absolutely needing to move to a place base but to be fair the pushback was if you can describe clearly your governance model though as to whatever this future state is and that's what we can regulate but kind of don't criticize us for not being able to regulate you in that way when you can't absolutely scribe how it works now I think it's an interesting conversation and we can kind of dance around our handbags around about that for a while but I think it absolutely we'll have to share and quite fundamentally not just in terms of the different organizations but but the nature of the services that we'll be providing and that will be really important interesting notion of you dancing around your handbags or the regulator's but just key from your perspective what about a broader monitor oh yeah so I guess I have felt the full weight of every regulator and and it has been challenging so the business cases there is a business case there is a delivery plan we've kind of touched on these things for what we call in better care together as we move into starts moving to delivery in a shadow' acs we'll call it probably something different probably bed care partners but you know in there we're asking for capital provision for GP buildings for hospital redesign we've obviously something that I don't talk about it is a bit controversial but were the only trust to get a tariff modification and actually negotiating actually how the cash comes through the system monitor tick the box and telling you you know you've worn it you've won the prize but you know locking that from the Treasury through through kind of d-h or you know NHS England and other things so the way that we've we've tried to kind of a lot align it is just invite players around the table and when we've done that we've managed to work our way through it but trying to do it in the absence of that has been incredibly difficult and I would say that's without the TDA being kind of involved I think monitor have probably been one of the most straightforward regulators to deal with in my in my experience I'm just an additional question so how what kind of practical support if you had say from the new care models team will and think have you had that hands-on support yeah I think actually they've been great and I've been giving really clear commitments to I must say you know you pushes as hard as you want in terms of what other things we need to unlock and and expressing a very strong commitment to doing that and actually pushing us the best in terms of you know can you be more radical or the more that you you want you know don't don't be constrained in any way by the things you think are the rules we're here to break you know pull down those walls and get those rules changed for you and I mean recently came up and we've have been looking at what we've been doing I guess it's still early days and I think they'd be the first to admit that it's early days for them to so there isn't kind of piles of things that they can say we've concretely done this but I think they were getting geared up to be able to I mean they were really ready to you know allocate cash support like you say they've been given really really clear feedback when the other things that we've not talked about we have spent quite a lot of times a system working with alzira we've been over to Spain they've been over to us and we haven't really talked about that but we've got a strategic partnership with that healthcare system massively massively important in terms of influencing our thinking and our priorities particularly around integration informatics there they've got they've really really done a great job across their system okay I throw out back to you to anyone who's involved in a vanguard or a new model of care want to comment on on how they're finding the relationship with regulators because it'll be interesting to see how this is always an replicated because one of the things we do ask from our regulators is a consistency of approach so a big kind of good if anyone out there is prepared to comment on that job over sorry ashes diametre cleaning this item yeah around the outside so it's a big room with only one microphone hi John low achievers Eckhart nothing turn away mental health and disabilities trust I think to answer questions first of all bit of context and if you include up to a ce o--'s and our packs and my multi specialty provider and eye care home and Bergen emergency care Vanguard and we'll be that it'd be nice if there was some rational rationalization of all of these things and so I think from an NHS England point of view that would be our biggest question is how do we make sure that this doesn't just proceed with lots of them cheese plants developing across the NHS I think we've got an awful lot of them now and we've got cheese plum tree so I think that's not regulated per se but there's a real issue for me about carrying on the analogy the thousand flowers blooming is creating huge pressure on organizational capacities I've attended to ACO program boards in the last week and we are really stretched I think that's not so much a regulatory point I think I'd agree with Jackie I think monitor being reasonably sensible I do think there's an issue where they're the Vanguard's are being led by a single organisation to make sure that when we talk about a significant transaction it's looked at from both the leading organisation and the organizations that may have some of their services directly impacted on at the same time because that's not particularly happening at the moment and I see the CQC thing I'm asking is too early and but we're all being secu seed and very separately as organisations obviously that's the model that is currently in place but that's already an outmoded model for us in one of our footprints in Sunderland where we've got huge amounts of resource in the better careful and joined up and effectively a poor budget for the vast majority of things so I think a bit of a long comment but I suppose just like to understand probably from Kerry in particular how is that working given that you've got a number of Vanguard's on your pitch perhaps maybe not quite as many bands and quite as many guards as we've got it was just I think you mentioned in your bit about a number of different Vanguard's in your patch so it's really just to understand from your point of view are you having similar difficulty with capacity but also how the various different regulators are looking at you still organisation rather than solve as a system yes so yes absolutely in terms of capacity and and they're actually kind of forming quite differently at the moment like you I think it's a bit early in terms of the regulation but I can anticipate within the next twelve months or so that it'll start to be a problem if they aren't flexible and and a responsive to those changes so you know we're surviving at the moment but it's and that means my comment to colleagues earlier about just having to work extra hard you know I can't physically be at all of these so it's about how we spread it out between the executive team how we treat connected with all of these things and then make sense of it particularly for our clinical services because you know previously we've been trying to be you know very consistent in terms of the offer for the population and now trying to be very different in terms of some of that thank you so we're nearly at the end of this session so I just wondered if if you could both give just a few words on perhaps what advice you would give to people some of your experience so far what advice you would give to others embarking on such an endeavor Oh blimey keep at it I think I think the piece of that clinical engagement I don't think we'd have we'd have got anywhere near as as close to something that feels like it's working actually living and breathing and without clinical engagement I think just make sure you focus on the people it's all about people at every level and you know the relationships you just there's no room for any egos there's no room for throwing toys out you just you've got to do the right thing by patients and keep that focus in mind and you've got to be in it for the long haul so and there's some interesting discussions as leaders about how you keep particularly chief executives in place at seats long enough to to to get to the end end point yeah I I would agree with all of those things I do think fundamentally it comes down to relationships actually as you say every level in terms of making it possible because if you've got the will and the strength of relationships you can get through the difficulties I think the other thing is to keep your eye open all the time for the opportunities to progress things that sometimes come a bit left field so if you take the milem work which is is fantastic but came from a kind of crisis where villages were in the streets campaigning for their because it was concerned about their local praxis would would live longer be there and he's now a fantastic example of community engagement asset building and and different partnerships to come together you never have predicted that if we'd had the most perfect Gantt chart in the world but it's about spotting those things and turning them to your advantage rather than seeing them as a problem and I guess if you have that kind of attitude they'll stand you in good stead for the many pitfalls that will we'll face over the next few years thank you and I think what I've taken from this discussion today is that you have really brought to life for me and I hope for the audience as well their sense of what it's actually like to live in a world of Venn diagrams where you're looking you're looking at your overlap with everybody around you and you're sitting at the center sometimes and that sometimes you might be kind of right up in the distant reaches and you know a lone player and then other times so many people converging on your patch I think that the what's also come through for me is that relationships are fundamental they are the glue to making all of this happen and I heard the word brokering several times and I think that fundamentally this is about brokering relationships brokering agreements brokering how you put the toys back in the pram once they've been thrown out if that happens and in order to push this forward I would really like to thank both Jacqui and Heather for being so honest with us today about their experiences and and talking about what it's been like for them in their journey which started way before the Vanguard's came into place and I think that's also something interesting to note that lots of this stuff has been happening already and spotted the opportunity of the vanguard coming along so that's if we could thank our colleagues in the usual way you
