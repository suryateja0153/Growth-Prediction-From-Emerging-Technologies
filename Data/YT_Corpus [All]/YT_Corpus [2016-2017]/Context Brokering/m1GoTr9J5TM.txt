 well hey this is Seth from the RT tipster blog and in this video I want to talk about a legislative issue that I've heard about quite a bit over the past few years and it's called dodd-frank and dodd-frank perhaps you've heard of it maybe not but it was basically this big piece of legislation that was put in place back in 2010 and then it's been updated a little bit since then and it basically contains a lot of different rules and regulations that make it much much harder for the typical real estate investor to sell their properties with seller financing and this is kind of a big deal because prior to dodd-frank there were a lot of people who were selling houses and other types of properties with seller financing in it was a big deal to their business I mean that was really how they found buyers who couldn't otherwise qualify for loans and ultimately make more money in their business because they could offer financing and collect interest and all this stuff and when dodd-frank came out it kind of dropped a bomb on a lot of that for a lot of real estate investors and that Frank came about sort of in response to the big economic downturn that happened starting in 2008-2009 and going on for several years after that and ultimately this was the government's attempt at putting more regulation on lenders and making them follow certain rules what I want to talk about specifically is how dodd-frank applies to people who are trying to sell a vacant land it was seller financing because I remember when dodd-frank first happened and it was something that I heard from a lot of a lot of the voices in the land vesting space was that you don't have to worry about it dodd-frank doesn't apply it to land investing and you know I was really relieved by that and I did a little bit of research on my own and I saw mostly the same thing but just recently I was encouraged by somebody in the re tipster Club to just put a lot more clarity in this and just to really dive deeper and to get all the information and that's sort of what I've been doing over the past week is like really truly trying to actually read all the regulations and doing that deep a lot of the research to find out how this does and doesn't apply to vacant land and keep in mind I am NOT an attorney and this this is all purely my non legal opinion in summary of what I found when reading through it it's entirely possible that I missed something I mean if you've ever read through these regulations it's a ton a ton of stuff I mean it's kind of ridiculous how many rules there are so keep in mind I may not be covering like every possible aspect of it but just from what I found when reading through these regulations and also when sort of going through a summary put together by some other blog posts out there which I'll link to in the blog post that goes with this video there actually are some aspects of dodd-frank that do apply to vacant land transactions it's not like vacant land is just totally exempt and we don't have to worry about it there are some things but the things that do apply in my opinion are not deal killers and they're not hard to do but it is stuff that you should be aware of if you're trying to sell vacant land with seller financing it's not like you can just necessarily ignore this I think you can ignore a lot of it but it's not just something it's simple where you can just throw the whole thing out and not think about it and in this video I want to just take you through my research and what I found so you can just see what I'm looking at and when I do sell of Finance deals these are the things that I believe do apply to me and it's really up to you as to whether or not they apply to you or not because it's sort of varies depending on what kind of deal you're doing and how many deals you're doing but in this video I'm just going to take you through each of the regulations that seem to apply in which aspects of those regulations I think we need to pay attention to as land investors so what I could see there seems to be five big regulations that are sort of tied in with dodd-frank that seemed to apply on some level to real estate investors in general and/or land investors specifically and I kind of got this from a article that was recommended to me by Carl James he's a member of the re tipster Club but he pointed this article out to me and I thought it was really helpful just in kind of breaking down the things that are applicable to vacant land transactions specifically and the regulations are Regulation Z regulation B regulation X regulation P and a regulation n and I'm just gonna as fast as I can without boring you to death try to hit the most applicable parts of each one of those so the first one Regulation Z The Truth in Lending Act this is kind of like the big thing that most people associate with dodd-frank and just so you understand some of the background when dodd-frank was put in place it created something called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and this Bureau was put in charge of creating and amending some of the existing regulations that had already been out there for decades and these regulations that you hearing are Regulation Z and regulation B and all this stuff these aren't necessarily new things but the CFPB can basically go in there now and change it and that was what happened shortly after dodd-frank came out is they went in there and they added a lot of new requirements to some of the existing regulations that we're out there for lenders so the first one again is Regulation Z and Regulation Z is most commonly associated with dodd-frank because it contains the biggest list of just stuff that lenders have to pay attention to when they're lending money and I'll just sort of show you the things in Regulation Z that I thought were applicable and the things that I thought were not when it comes to you vacant land transactions probably the biggest issue that most real estate lenders had with Regulation Z if you scroll down here and by the way this is the actual text of the regulations so this is like from a government website here and if you go here to this section that says special rules for certain home mortgage transactions if you click on this you can really just read a lot of the stuff it's incredibly boring but if you drink a lot of coffee and might be able to get through most of it but some of the biggest issues that were inherent in this section is that it essentially requires some pretty restrictive things of people who want to sell real estate with seller financing this is the first of all if you do more than three real estate transactions per year with like a land contract or a deed of trust you have to be a registered mortgage originator which is a big obstacle that a lot of real estate investors necessarily I want to mess with it also says that you can't have a balloon payment sooner than six years so you know a lot of people who sell real estate with seller financing the goal is to like keep the lawn out there for three years or five years and then have a balloon which basically means the entire balance comes due and the idea behind that means that the buyer then has to kind of cash out the seller and go find a conventional loan so that the seller can then get their money back without waiting for you know decades to get their money back but it's basically saying that's you know you can't do that faster than six years so that's something that a lot of real estate investors might have an issue with and then another huge issue is that the lender is basically required to verify the borrower's ability to repay the loan and that can be kind of a complicated thing because it means the lender basically has to go through this a similar process that a bank would go through with to verify their income and just to make sure that that there are good creditworthy borrowers and that's something that some people may want to do but if you either don't want to do it or you just don't have the resources to do it that little rule kind of gets in the way and in some ways it's saying that the only people you can lend to are those who can already get a bank loan anyway so it kind of just takes out a huge pool of buyers and it also makes it harder for borrowers who would want to get a loan and now they can't because they don't qualify so it just kind of kind of puts a lot of restrictions that in my opinion don't need to be there but all that said there's a very important thing to remember with all these requirements all of these special rules have to do with certain home mortgage transactions so let's keep that term in mind and then let's go back up here to the definitions down here in section 24 says residential mortgage transaction means a transaction and in which a mortgage deed of trust purchase money security interest blah blah blah blah blah is created or retained in the consumers principal dwelling to finance the acquisition or initial construction of that dwelling so first of all the consumers principal dwelling so that's like a place where they're actually living and then that we're dwelling what does that mean if we go back up here dwelling is defined as a residential structure that contains one to four units whether or not that structure is attached to real property the term includes an individual condominium unit cooperative unit mobile home and trailer if it is used as a residence so as I read that definition that is not the same thing as vacant land vacant land seems to be excluded from all of these special rules listed out in subpart E so that's my understanding as I read it and I've talked to more than one attorney about this and they seem to agree with me and again I'm not an attorney and I'm not saying I'm right I'm just saying that is how I read and interpret that and I'm not alone in that conclusion so you can kind of take that and do with that what you will I don't know the specifics of whatever deal you were working on and there can be some issues that come into play for example if somebody chooses to build on a piece of vacant land immediately after they buy it then it sort of is considered a dwelling at that point so that can change things and for that reason it may be smart to put something in your loan documentation to the effect of requiring that buyer to pay off the loan before they can start improving the property because that would kind of ensure that for the life of a loan it stays as a vacant lot and is not considered a dwelling at any point so really the most problematic list of issues right here is kind of dispelled by the fact that with vacant land it's not a dwelling it generally shouldn't apply so that's good news for vacant land investors however something that I will point out is that when you go here to this first section of Regulation Z it explains the coverage of what Regulation Z applies to and it says in general this part applies to each individual or business that offers or extends credit when four conditions are met and those four conditions are the credit is offered or extended to consumers and there's actually a special definition for what that means but for all intents and purposes most of the people I saw my properties too are definitely considered consumers and then the offering or extension of credit is done regularly and the credit is subject to a finance charge or is payable by a written agreement more than four installments so that's definitely what my cell phone has deals fall under and the credit is primarily for personal family or household purposes so person plans to use that property you know for those purposes and not for like a business purpose so really a lot of the deals that I do still fall into this definition in are covered by Regulation Z it just isn't covered by this problematic section of Regulation Z so what it is covered under is from how I read it it's considered an open end credit and open end credit is like a catch-all for all kinds of different loans this is not just real estate loans I mean this can be like credit cards or home equity loans and all that stuff and according to subpart B here there are actually some disclosures that lenders are supposed to provide to their borrowers and I'll just be totally honest I did not read this entire thing so take what I see here with a grain or two assault but as I was sort of skimming through it and just getting an idea for what types of disclosures would be required of somebody like myself to disclose to my borrower when I'm selling them a piece of vacant land on land contract or with seller financing of some kind and a lot of the stuff that people in my situation it would be required to disclose to the borrower are things like what kinds of fees are associated maybe like the interest rates sending out periodic statements on what the balance of the loan is and how much of their payment is going towards principal and interests and escrow and servicing fees and all that stuff a lot of the information that I would be required to disclose to the borrower is stuff that is already baked into my loan documentation like the interest rate and the fees and what the payments would be and what the term of the loan would be I mean all of this stuff is baked into my land contract or deed of trust document or my note or my closing statement like it's all going to be in front of that borrower at the time of closing if not before terms of the periodic statements of letting that borrower know what their payments are on an ongoing basis that kind of information would also be provided to them if I'm using a loan servicing company or if I'm using a service that sends out automatic emails notifying their payments and that kind of thing so I think that this section of Regulation Z probably does apply to vacant land transactions but at the same time I think a lot of this information if you're closing your transaction in a way that documents it thoroughly and it requires the borrower to sign documents that disclose a lot of this information you're probably going to take care of it through that process this is a section of Regulation Z that I honestly didn't spend hours combing through like I did with some of the other regulations so I'm not necessarily telling you that you should just blindly take my word for it you may want to get your own advice from your own attorney to verify this but as I was looking through it that was my understanding and just given the way that I document my loans I'm not terribly worried about this so that is sort of my understanding of Regulation Z so with that said let's move on to regulation B and hopefully you're still with me I know this is really dense stuff but the purpose of regulation B is to ensure that borrowers are not being discriminated on the basis of their age their race their religion their gender it doesn't necessarily mean that lenders can't say no to people but if they do say no they can't be saying no based on the borrower's age or race or gender or nationality or anything like that so for the typical real estate investor again there are some things that they would have to do if they were going to extend a loan with seller financing to a buyer however similar to Regulation Z all the rules listed in this part seem to be geared towards those dwelling type properties in terms of what lenders have to do but again if you go here to this section and you scroll down to where it says dwelling dwelling means a residential structure that contains one before units whether or not that structure is attached to real property the term includes but is not limited to an individual condominium or cooperative unit in a mobile home or other manufactured home so again based on that I do not see how regulation B applies directly to people who are selling the vacant land with self financing now with that being said I should say that just in general if you're ever going to say no to a loan applicant say somebody wants to buy our property and take you up on seller financing you can say no to that but if you say no you should have some kind of a verifiable documental reason in terms of why you're saying now say like if you pull the credit report and they have a terrible credit score if you need a certain down payment amount and they can't do it should not be a reason that has anything to do with these things that honestly shouldn't matter and also when you're advertising your property for sale if you talk about how seller financing is available don't say something ridiculous like you know seller financing is available for white males over the age of 40 I mean that that would be just a clear violation of this and most people are gonna have no reason to do that so it's kind of ridiculous for me to even have to say that but just as a general practice if you want to steer clear of any issues that may come up as a result of regulation be just don't say those kinds of things and if you decline people make sure it's a reason that has nothing to do with these issues that shouldn't be issues in the first place for most real estate lenders out there regulation B would apply and it would require them to send out certain disclosures to their loan applicants but again when it's a vacant lot it does not seem to apply to those particular rules and those disclosures wouldn't mean necessary for that specific type of property so with that said if we move on to the next regulation regulation X exists to protect consumers from being told that they're going to be getting one thing and then things sort of change at closing and they end up getting a different loan with a different interest rate and all that essentially what it requires again is that the borrower be giving certain information that the lender uses a certain type of settlement statement that includes certain information just to make sure that the borrower is fully aware of all the information kind of like over delivering on the data just so that there can be no mistake of what they're getting versus what they were told they were gonna get so all that's good and fun it just requires that real estate lenders have to follow more rules and more regulations but again good news for land investors as far as I can see if we go here to this section where it says coverage of RESPA which stands for Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act first section up here RESPA in this part applied to federally related mortgage loans except as provided in paragraphs B and D of this section so if we go here to pair B says exemptions and if we scroll down to item 4 it says vacant land any loans secured by vacant or unapproved property unless within two years from the date of the settlement of the loan a structure or a manufactured home will be constructed or placed on the real property using the loan proceeds and that's a very important detail to note if a loan for a structure or manufactured home to be placed on vacant land or unapproved property will be secured by lien on the property the transaction is covered by this part so basically what that means is that if you're selling a piece of vacant land with seller financing and it stays a piece of vacant land for the duration that alone or at least for the first 24 months after you close it then it should be exempted from the things that lenders have to follow under RESPA if your borrower has plans to immediately build something or improve that property in any way then it could very well be covered under this so this could be another instance where it would just be smart for you to include something in your loan documentation verifying that the borrower is not planning to build anything for the left alone and/or they are planning to improve the property they will have to pay you off before they do that and that should just sort of add that extra layer of protection that they're not going to improve that property as long as you've got a loan out there on it so that's more good news under Regulation X it shouldn't apply as long as it is vacant land it stays vacant land so if we move now to the next regulation the next regulation here is Regulation P in Regulation P is all about protecting the privacy of the borrower and in terms of whether regulation P applies to some of Finance vacant land transactions unfortunately there is not a straightforward black-and-white answer I can give you because you sort of have to understand some of the details of your situation and that should inform you in terms of whether or not you need to follow any rules here so first of all if we click on purpose and scope the purpose of Regulation P says this part governs the treatment of non-public personal information so that's the first key term we need to be aware of about consumers that's the second key term by the financial institutions and that's the third key term we need to think about listed in paragraph B of this section now one nice thing I was pretty happy about was that the Federal Trade Commission actually put together a really nice guide and I'll have a link to this in the blog post which is link beneath this video so go ahead and check that out if you want to read more but basically you need to understand as a real estate investor who's selling vacant land are you a financial institution are you selling your property to a consumer or a customer and then what kind of information are you collecting from that borrower and is it considered non-public personal information so the first issue in terms of whether or not your financial institution this says that the privacy rule applies to businesses that are significantly engaged in financial activities financial activities include things like this lending exchanging transferring investing servicing loans debt collecting all this stuff so as I read through this I'm fairly confident in concluding that as a landowner who is selling land with seller financing that is considered lending and that is considered a financial activity and in terms of whether or not I am significantly engaged in that as this guide explains it it says first is there a formal arrangement in place is there like an actual written agreement between the lender and the borrower and in pretty much every case the answer is yes there's either a land contract or a note or a deed of trust or something like that so there's definitely a formal arrangement in place and then also how often does the business engage in this financial activity am i somebody who's doing this like once in a blue moon say like one time a year at the most or am i doing like three or five or ten of these deals a year and I would say it's up to each individual to figure out what can't they fall into if you're somebody who is literally just doing this one time it's the first time you've ever done it you have no plans to do it again then you're probably not significantly engaged for somebody like me who you know I don't necessarily do it a ton these days but it's something that comes up on a fairly regular basis so I would say that yes I am significantly engaged in this activity so an answer that first question just looking at myself and what I know I would say yes I am a financial institution and then do I have consumers or do I have customer and the difference between that is a consumer is somebody who obtains or has obtained a financial product or service from a financial institution like me that is to be used primarily for personal family or household purposes or that person's legal representative so it's kind of like an individual person who's gonna be using that product personally not necessarily every case but in most cases when I sell land with seller financing yes I'm signing it to a consumer and I can't answer this question for you that's something you'll have to come to your own conclusion on based on this information but I can't answer for me and that's my answer in my case and then lastly what information is covered it really comes down to what kind of information are you collecting from your borrower as part of your loan application or approval process I've done this both ways I've had some deals where I've literally just gotten that person's first and last name and their address and phone number or whatever they told me and that was literally all I got you know it was kind of a risky way to do it I had no outside verification of what their legal name was but in cases where I've bought a property for five hundred bucks and I'm selling it for eight thousand and just the down payment already pays me back completely in those kind of cases I may be willing to take that risk and it's not a big deal to me so if I'm not really collecting any sensitive information then I'm not collecting what they call NPI or non-public personal information on the other hand if I am collecting some kind of an ID statement that includes their social security number or driver's license number or a copy of their driver's license or passport or something like that that's the kind of information that is not publicly available and it's something that as a lender you have a responsibility to keep that private and I can't say some lenders out there for some purposes will actually share this information with third parties that's not something I've ever done nor do I ever plan to if for some odd reason you're planning to share that information with somebody else then you would actually have to give that borrower the opportunity to opt out of you sharing that requires a certain type of disclosure form and there's actually a template for that and again I will link to that template in the blog post which is link beneath this video so be sure to check that out if you are collecting this NPI information in your not planning to share with anybody else see if you were only getting their social security number for the purpose of pulling a personal credit report that's okay and that's not considered sharing it with a third party that's one of the allowed uses and if that's the only reason you're doing it just to have it for your own files and to verify that they are who they say they are that kind of thing then there's a different type of disclosure form that does not give them the opportunity to opt out of anything because there's nothing to opt out of I will have a link to an example of that form in the blog post as well and I'll just pull up this example this is the form that you can provide if you are not sharing the information with a third party so for example if I was ever collecting any non-public personal information from my borrower this is the form I would use because I'm not planning to share that information with anybody else and as you can see it's a fairly straightforward form and your form doesn't even have to look exactly like this this is just an example that was put out there by the FTC because this checks all the boxes and meets all the requirements and as you can see you really just have to insert some information here and then put the words yes or no in these boxes and answer to these questions and then include your phone number or your website and then fill in this information too and something you'll notice is that there's nowhere on here where the borrower has to sign anything and give it back to you it's literally just you providing it to that borrower and you just have to show that you gave it to them so it's a fairly easy form to fill out it's not complicated but if you are collecting information to pull a personal credit report or any kind of sensitive non-public information like that you would simply have to give this form to your borrower as part of your closing process just so they understand what is happening so it's really not hard it's just another thing to be aware of if you decide to do that and again if you can answer no to whether you're a financial institution or you're working with a consumer or if you're not collecting any non-public personal information then you can just ignore this altogether so it really just depends on the specifics of your deal and who you are and who your borrower is and what you're doing so that's my full understanding of Regulation P if we move on to the last one now Regulation N and regulation n is all about mortgage acts and proud this is in your advertising and really the idea with regulation n is to verify that any information you are putting in your advertising say if you have a little section in your ad saying hey we've got this property that's available with seller financing with an interest rate of 5% in 2009 payment payments of $4.99 a month if you're advertising your property with that kind of specific information then you can't change it up when you get to closing and then sell them something different with a different interest rate and a different payment if you go here to this section where it says prohibited representations it just lists out everything that you can't do in your advertising all the stuff that you can't effectively lie about and apparently this regulation was born out of necessity because a lot of lenders were doing just that where they would advertise certain interest rate and then give people something totally different at closing but really what it boils down to is if you're gonna advertise certain terms in your listing saying the seller financing is available and this is exactly what you can get then you better actually use that when you get to closing and don't change it up and do something different and one way to avoid that say if you want to have the flexibility to do something different when you get to closing to just not get all that specific in your listing you could say something like you know seller financing may be available on this property contact the owner for more information and just leave it at that and any information you you discuss about the financing you're providing especially if it's in writing don't put it in writing in or don't say it unless you're 100% sure that that's actually what you're going to close with because you don't want to get in any situation where somebody can prove that you said one thing and then you did something else when it came time to close it so from I read through it it didn't necessarily say that you're not allowed to get that specific in your listing it's just implying that if you do get that specific then you better follow through and don't flip the script and change the story when it comes time to close it so essentially in a regulation and unlike some of the previous regulations it doesn't necessarily give us a specific exemption for vacant land it does talk about how the word dwelling is defined but when it talks about what's covered it defines a mortgage credit product to be any form of credit that is secured by a real prop or emphasis on or a dwelling and that has offered or extended to consumer primarily for personal family or household purposes so if this just said dwelling then I would say well great because vacant land is not a dwelling so it doesn't apply but real property is more of a catch-all term for any type of real estate including land so if you have a property that's just vacant land my interpretation is that regulation would definitely apply to that luckily it's not really that difficult to comply with regulation name it just means that you need to be aware of the fact that you shouldn't be promising all these things and your advertising that you're not ultimately going to deliver when it comes time to close so does regulation and apply yes is it difficult to comply with not really you just need to have a basic understanding of what you should and/or shouldn't say based on what you plan to do in the end with your loan so that kind of wraps up the gist of dodd-frank and the specific regulations that apply to vacant land transactions specifically there's also something called the SAFE Act which is separate from this I'm going to put together a separate video explaining the ins and outs of that as I understand it in my own again non legal opinion from my read through how it works so keep an eye out for that to you just let me re-emphasize the fact that I'm not an attorney dodd-frank is a very complex complicated ball of legislation it took me a lot of mental energy just to read through it and understand it so I don't want to by any means convey that what I'm seeing here is the ultimate final rule and truth on how vacant land transactions should be handled I think there's variations in every deal and again since I'm not Masseria there could very well be things that I'm just missing here but based on what I read from at least a dozen other articles and blog posts out there and based on what I read directly in these regulations I'm fairly confident in the conclusions I came to and this is how I'm gonna be treating these regulations in my own set of finance deals so that may or may not apply to you but hopefully just through that overview we went through if you're still even watching this I know that's a lot of left brain stuff I just covered but if you're somebody who's selling vacant land with seller financing I hope that gives you at least a little bit of clarity in terms of whether dodd-frank applies to you and if so which specific aspects you should be paying attention to so again I'm gonna have a very detailed blog post linked beneath this video which really lays out all of my research and thoughts in a written form I think that could be helpful if you really want to dig deeper and find out how I came to these conclusions and by all means if you're watching this and if you're a lawyer and or if you're a real estate investor who has experience with dodd-frank as it relates to seller finance vacant land transactions and if you think I'm flat-out wrong about any of this stuff or if you think I'm just missing something I welcome your feedback please feel free to leave a comment below let me know what you think if anybody brings up an issue that I think is significant enough I've been happy to update this video and/or blog post if I think it really applies so that's that hopefully you found that helpful on some level and thanks for watching
