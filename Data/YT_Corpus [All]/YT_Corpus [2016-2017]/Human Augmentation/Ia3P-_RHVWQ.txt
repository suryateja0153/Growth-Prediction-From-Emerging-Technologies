 the Dare says we want it to be the window to the future what we're trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable functional and beautiful prosthetic devices to our peers I'm proud of being one-handed it doesn't make me feel any different but wearing this instead of having people come up to me or give me like the sincere look Oh you've lost your arm they go oh wow this is fantastic in it mate I just like to see people to have a smile on their face about it that's what it's all about for me because we're heavily promoting this kind of technology some people really think like we were producing you know augmented arms and you know some fans or some moms and so on we're asking what can I buy you on and unfortunately we have to say we're not building any arms we just video game company but that triggers you know the thing where we say we should do something was a really natural fit when they got in touch with us we were almost expecting it at some point and we formed this idea to try and turn Adam Jensen's arm into a real-life Bionic limb I was actually born my left hand so I've never seen any different and I've always wanted to have like a robot I can I've never said I wanted two hands just a robotic one just to feel more cyborg because it's just so much cooler especially being into sci-fi and comics and stuff I developed the first Bionic hand when I was 17 just tinkering in my bedroom at my parents house when I was younger so when I went to university a few years later I wanted to take the project a little bit further and found that Bionic hands existed for amputees to wear but they were extremely expensive and so I used that angle that's an excuse to be allowed to create a Bionic hand for my final year project at university and then after university was when I co-founded open bionics and we began working on the same problem with a more kind of definitive goal of being able to offer these Bionic hands to people at a really affordable price so this is a custom-built one for myself we use sensors in the top and bottom of my arm so if I tense my bottom muscles it will close and if I loosen up but tense upwards slightly it'll open we have a fantastic art director his name is Jonathan Jack Valdez this guy is a visual he's completely crazy and the way we wanted to depict you know a future world was that human augmentations couldn't be like just medical advice we wanted it to be super rewarding you know people are wearing these kind of processes in a fashionable way for their sex we never wanted to do some gimmicky big robots hand and so on we wanted something to touch upon you know the high-fashion very refined design something that looks very slick and very you know you could be very proud to wear it and then you can change all the functions like that gotta cool at this point we've made a semi functional prototype so we've made one that's functional and looks similar to Adam Johnson's hand the next steps for us will be perfecting the functionality of it so that it works really nicely and it's very good at grasping objects and then making the finish really nice so that it looks the part as well the design files that we're working on in this project will be open sourced as well so people will be able to download them they have a 3d printer they'll be able to make themselves an Adam Jensen arm that will be functional and they'll be able to use it we don't want to cut this technology this accessibility to people who have their both hands and so on so we partnered with Intel with a real sense division and Razer with their stargazer division also multiple points on the hand in motion is captured in real-time the result is a one-to-one mirroring which we need to use his hand and a Bionic hand we want to show Lim different people that the products and devices that they're seeing in in science fiction and gaming and in movies can become reality and can become reality very soon it's mind blowing for a lot of people but I cannot wait for the future of this everything we're doing is somehow a new step forward we now define in the future
