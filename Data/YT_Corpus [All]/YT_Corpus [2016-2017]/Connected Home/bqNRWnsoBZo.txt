 let's face it you don't have time to open the door for everyone you can't actually which is precisely why you have August I think 2016 is gonna be the year of the connected home it's just the stuff is too difficult for the benefits that it gives you I'm always a little bit skeptical about the connected home in so much as I think it's I think it's good I think having a fridge that can tell you that your milks going out of date is great and is buying new stuff but I think while people have to chase it I don't think it's going to happen 60% of almost all new products fail and part of the big reason is that a lot of manufacturers have a wordly optimistic predictions of how quickly things would be adopted a technological change does not come easy and one of the big reasons for that is that it is not easy to change existing behaviors it's also too difficult to set up it's not such a pain in the ass I've like used all of these things and it's just it's why I've got no hair basically if I have to go out and buy an individual gadget to set up all of these things I think that's just going to be a barrier for people I think the connected home will come into its own with new builds in the future it's not so much they're not interested I just think the story is easier to tell when you see something that's in your face I'll really one that I know what it does I think it looks great I want that in my home that's a much easier sale than saying look this is a little bit more complex it's going to be a setup to this there's a there's a you know there's a support structure around that that becomes slightly more complex but actually as that grows I think it will become vital to everyone's home in in the future I think in terms of the adoption of these new technologies there's going to be a big age influence I think younger people are going to take to it much more readily because they're much more used to very rapidly changing their lives older people some are older people at least may find it harder to adapt to what you tend to find as you well know is is early innovators these are people who will adapt adopt things just when they first come out and they will enthused and then they will kind of spread back through so the waves I think with technology are big part technology is how it looks in a field and I think you don't really get that in this in the connective home genre so I think we've people have been struggle to tell that in a marketing sense but actually what you're now beginning to see is controlling your music controlling your heat security I think is a major part of that which is coming to the fore now and I think as that develops and as people are reading about it more and more we'll start to see that growing it really can sort of make a difference even if it's just an awareness of how you could you know save a bit of money here and there so well I think you're right that it is still you know quite a sort of techie kind of geek area I think you know people should probably be taking a closer look at it and because it is acting it in a lot of cases it is simpler than you might think to sort of add a bit of intelligence to your humble abode
