 dorsal aerospace presents a revolution in drone flexibility our upper spine tactical attack system just swap out a few containers and the same airframe instantly transforms from a cargo hauler to an air tanker to a versatile weapons platform our unique containers automatically monitor the weight and balance of their contents they're designed to fit on existing trucks and trains individual climate controls allow them to carry an unlimited variety of cargo fuel ordnance and equipment all on the same flight and that flight can launch with minimal ground support from a very simple base our movable platform drives right in and the containers become a structural component of the airframe allowing this ultra lightweight drone to carry up to 60,000 pounds for bigger jobs up to twice as wide twice as high and almost six times the weight big enough for a full-size helicopter ask about our most powerful drone the lower spine heavy lift system but the upper spine tactical attack system is designed for lightweight low cost and maximum flexibility open the rear doors a touchdown for extra drag and it can land fully loaded in just 1,000 feet drop off its cargo and take off again in that same thousand feet all without a ground crew it can even airdrop the whole load on command but cargo is just the beginning load in fuel tanks like this one and the same drone becomes an airtanker capable of providing midair refueling support or load in our weapons pods and it becomes a versatile attack platform firing air-to-air missiles and dropping bombs on target radar and defensive features are built in at the nose and the tail now let's look at a combat scenario an attack on an enemy base defended by ground assets and enemy aircraft one tactical drone deploy countermeasures returns fire to intercept missiles aircraft even Jets and attacks the enemy base bombing ground-based threats a second drone provides refueling assistance a third airdrops a set of containers which parachutes safely to the ground where they deploy robotic tanks to secure the perimeter now our final drone can land and deliver sensitive equipment for our new forward base all without risking a single human crew member in the air or on the ground affordable powerful infinitely flexible the upper spine tactical attack system from dorsal aerospace the future of unmanned aviation
