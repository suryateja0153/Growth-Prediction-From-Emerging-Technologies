 Hi there! How are you? Thank you so much for waiting. I made it and I'd like to say cheers! I have a nice drink with me its water because today was very hot so tonight thank you so much for being here we are studying memorization vs mind mapping for conversation learning I think many of you when you were introduced to english it was at school and so it was a learning environment a school environment where they had to test you and an easy way to test us a school goers is through memorization of grammar patterns vocabulary or conversations where we fill in the blanks because we remember and that meant you had to have the exact right correct word or sentence structure that is not hell language in conversation works but it might be your habit to keep that as your studying as the way that you study for conversation and that is why I find my market here is in Japan because this is where I live and so many people are still trying to remember that exact way to say something and so that is what I want to work with tonight is showing you how you can test it for yourself because until you test it for yourself you don't believe it until you try it and feel it and get results oh it works oh ok this works alright i'll change it's just the way humans are we don't like change we like habits we like things to be the same and this is truly whether you're American like me or Japanese or French or German if if it were easy for people to change oh my goodness what a different world we would have if it were easy for people to shift and start a new action a new life a different this a different that yeah it would be a very you'd have a very different life maybe you know and even me I mean I change a lot but even me there are some things where I just go no I'm not changing that and then something happens and I try it and I go oh I should have done this before why did I wait well I waited because I'm a creature of habit and that is an English phrase creature of habit that means I like to keep things the same because change is scary change can make BB of raid okay great so before we get into the challenge that i'm going to share with you I just want to make sure that the time is ok before we get into the challenge I just want to share with you a couple of notes that I've got here and i'm going to do a screen share then and then and then and then and then and then and I love that all right these are just some notes for the webinar and what I'm showing you you know conversation exercises help you become a better conversationalist training prepares you for the real thing and you need to work with your stories your opinions and your I diaz and when you're from a culture that exchange opinions and debates and argues you need how you need to know how to do answer + + non stop speaking you know it's not just English that responds with answer + + non stop speaking French German Spanish Arabic to name a few you know it's the same our culture's argue we challenge we step in and we go no yes sometimes very directly sometimes very politely some it just depends on the situation so you have to look at your culture and understand how your culture fits into exchanging opinions debates and arguing is your culture comfortable with that is your culture not comfortable with that there's the culture of the family too sometimes families do not have a culture of arguing ideas and opinions there are some families that have a big culture of arguing and ideas and opinions so for answer plus plus we use a timer and if there is time left on the timer you always want to fill it and keep talking and find something to say the mind map is what I stress is an important way to learn English conversation and the key point is learning to be flexible and flowing in conversation let the mind map stimulate your memory let ideas pop up that add to what you are saying that's the flexibility if you memorize or remember something your brain is going no gosh I have to remember this oh can I remember it and you stay in a very narrow narrow pathway and if you listen to live with Katie you know I have a mind map of what I'm discussing always when I remember something I say it so i might get off track but i do say it and it adds to the conversation so in a conversation in a real conversation you may feel like responding with a simple answer plus + or you may feel like responding with 30 second non stop speaking response you'll know what feels best in each situation oh right okay very good so you see her I am just wanna make sure I've got everything here ok good here's our chat oh happy to see everyone here hi everyone yay nice to see everyone excellent some people are shy about chatting and so they don't chat and that's fine but there are chatters and enjoy it all right so let me show you the that you'll be receiving this PDF you know i will be sending this to you and we're looking at a challenge and the challenge is to test memorization versus a mind map and your first step is to choose a question and you can choose any of the questions and make sure got my questions here yeah what did you do yesterday where are you from or what do you enjoy doing those are the three questions that I'm working with for this mini-challenge step two is to right and i think you know a hundred and fifty words are fine and you can do it on a counter and i'm going to show you how to do this and there's a mini challenge where if a hundred and fifty is too much you can do 20 sentences and then do the memorization and you'll be receiving all of these pdfs so that you can do this mini-challenge on your own alright so back to the mentally challenged now what I the question that I'm going to be working with is where are you from excuse me what did you do yesterday what did you do yesterday so let's go to the mini to the counter now remember you're memorizing you're going to remember all this so the question is what did you do yesterday yesterday I met my friend for lunch now what I've used here is i am using the word counter and then i'm using dictation on my computer we went to an Italian restaurant and we had pasta . it was delicious . oh I think I did that wrong we went to an Italian restaurant and it was delicious we had pasta now this practice see it's counting the words and you're getting your sentences this practice helps you with pronunciation annunciation speaking and writing now you'll see here that the grammar isn't too correct so there is another way whoops Oh sometimes there we go up that you can correct your grammar also there are many online programs for correcting what you've written now I subscribe to grammarly . com it's wonderful and it will show you how to punctuate and how to write correctly so i've copied and pasted or i will copy and paste what I've written into the I'm sorry my connection is quite slow boy I saved my Wi-Fi - but that's okay so we'll get back to that is that's loading let me go to my pdfs here so you write and you can ride in the counter now you can also write on a piece of paper that is completely fine you know just the counter is kind of fun and i will be showing you how you can do that so in this counter what i would do is now it's already showing me where I need a comma and the rest of it is fine so online there are so many ways that you can study for your English conversation and combine it with grammar practice pronunciation practice writing practice and reading practice and memorizing so i will have all of these these steps for you are in the PDF and the links for it these programs the word counter and grammarly i will have for you also so once you've done once you've done your response to the question what did you do yesterday or whatever question then what you're going to do is you're going to set your timer for five minutes and you're going to remember your writing That's step 3. So let's go through this again. Step one you choose a question or your question step to your right step 3 you time it for five minutes and you memorize you do your best to remember now step 4 you can have your paper in front of you that is fine and what you're going to do is now work on speaking do not read your paper just look sometimes if you have to remember you'll do it three times and you'll set your timer for one set and it is for one minute then step 5 is no paper set your timer again for one minute and then do your speaking not the timer that i use is an online timer and it's right here I love this timer so we just set it for one minute and then start and remember to record yourself you can record yourself many different ways the iphone or your smart phone or your computer has recording software recording yourself is really important always start at the beginning alright so that's your memorization challenge let's go through that again you choose a question you write your 150 words you can use this software now you can type or you can use dictation acted in here I love eating and talking it's a lot of fun to just relax and exchange ideas and talk about business we both have our own businesses so we did much talking about business and again you know this is pronunciation practice its immense EA shin practice it's writing practice you can type or you can speak and then again you can come in here to grammarly taste it and it will show you what you need to do there we go just to relax own businesses good it's kind of slow the connection so it's coming up kind of slowly these are some fun tools and some fun ways many people say katie i have no one to practice my English with and so these are some ways that you can practice your English by yourself alright so that is the memorization challenge and then you memorize for five minutes memorization and then you can glance at your paper do not read your paper and set it for one minute 45 seconds is ok also and then you'll have no paper and time for one minute now the mini challenge is a little bit different version of it but this version the mini challenge works fine to just 20 sentences and then five minutes times and 45 seconds x 3 and then put your paper away and no looking at your paper and remember to record yourself ok part two is the mind map now you need to choose a different question a new question so the example that i have here the one that I chose with where are you from right and i'll be sending you the english PDF and the Japanese PDF so we've got where are you from and what I'm going to do is I am going to make a mind map now i use cago to do this and your mind map if you do the answer + + basics first so your step one is your answer plus plus and that gives you nine pieces of information to work with which is a really good start for your mind map so what I would do is here we go and we got cago again clicked at it we have where from and I have one two three because i'm working with one two three and so we would have a USA it's huge you also put here and unique qualities so 50 50 states and then we would have california and i put down and beaches and boogie boarding I think I'll put wanting to California has good wine and then San Francisco you can always add to your mind map right and then we have here great i'm upstate New York and New York that's New York in two thousand new york well and let's see ah the south and east it's funny a lot of my friends in California never make it back east they never make it to the south I was very lucky in junior high school to move to upstate New York so that i could see a lot of the United States and my parents love to drive so we drove everywhere I mean as kids we didn't like it so much but I saw I've seen a lot of the United States I feel very very lucky about that all right so here's my mind map and this is what I'd be using for speaking notice the difference I mean the difference between a mind map and sentences to remember I mean this just looks difficult doesn't it to remember all of this for conversation when you're learning conversation memorizing sentences that's hard on your brain but aligned map I mean this just makes it so easy you can go here here here here here then you can go here here you can if things pop into your head you can say them but if you're memorizing you know it a very lateral thing to do yesterday I met my friend for lunch we went to an Italian restaurant and it was delicious yesterday I met my friend for lunch we went to a hotel and restaurant we met and we had some pasta oh my goodness whereas this you can use any grammar or any sentence structure that you want and it can change each time but memorizing your brain says have to get it right I have to get it right must be correct must be correct but a mind map is really free and easy so let's go back to the challenge there yeah so once you've done your mind map and here you've got the cognitive effort and goggle it and then mind map resources then what you're going to do is one minute x 3 and remember to record it then you'll use no mind map and you'll do one minute for your speaking and always celebrate always always always celebrate yay part one is finished yay part two is finished yeah I have that here to celebrate with yay boo I like celebrating and then part three is just evaluating how was it did you like memorizing better did you like the mind map better and again it's that point of you know coming from a culture where do I have that yeah coming from cultures that have ideas debates and arguments non stop speaking is really important so that you know how to participate actively in a conversation so I'm going to come back here yeah ok let's see I'm going to check the chat room let's have fun oye how has that how is everyone yeah do you have any questions does anyone have any questions about the challenge yoshio that's very funny all of you that's very funny well I'll tell you what what I'm laughing at is a dictation won't work with my pronunciation haha i need to be patient with learning that is very very funny i love that oh you know what I can put all of these i'm going to send you these links but i can put these URLs in the chat let me do that right now i can do that right now that's great yep and like I said there's the word count this is kaga lit i am putting Coghlan right now and then i'm going to put grammarly man i'll tell you what i tell everyone i am conversation Katie I am NOT grammar Katie and especially you know living overseas in Japan you really have to have your language coming at you all the time so in the United states I'm seeing billboards I'm hearing I'm looking I'm everything is English and reinforcing English so sometimes my grammar and my punctuation go out the window oh so don't feel badly if you have trouble remembering english i have trouble remembering it but this grammarly . com I just got it I think three weeks ago and I i ended up there is a free version you can use a free version which is great start with the free version and then I thought you know I really need this so i'm going to buy it I don't remember how much it was but you can check all of that so I have the word counter I have kaga lit now my diagram may not show up and I have the grammarly . com and those are the three important links for doing this challenge and this challenge is fun i have tested this on people and it took me a while to get the exact formula down for the challenge but I think I did it so if you do the challenge I would be so interested in hearing how it goes for you so please let me know conversation Katie @ gmail.com not grammer Katie @ gmail.com not grandma Kate not punctuation Katie grandma conversation Katie @ gmail.com if you do the challenge I'd be very very interested in your experience with it and my point is for speaking for studying speaking and for studying the mechanics grammar vocabulary then yes some memorization is needed but you have to remember in conversation you do don't have a book with you you don't have the internet with you so you have to trust what you can do and that's really important this kind of practice this answer + + non stop speaking practice gives you the time and the opportunity on your own to feel confident about responding in English and responding with a lot of information now it's true in a conversation you will not have a mind map but our brains are amazing after you have practiced with the mind map enough times so that you're comfortable with it your brain will start making a mind map automatically and start popping ideas into your head for speaking and you will start listening to those ideas because you will get away from Japanese English Japanese English many of the textbooks many of the programs many of what you study has Japanese in English closely together and that's okay that is an important part of studying you know you need that but you also need the English only and that's true of listening as well it's hard at first remember because we are creatures of habit I have so many people say katie i can't understand the English when I listen to it and most people give up most people stop listening stop trying to hear all english and that is something that you need to check with yourself about hmm or most people try for too long at first 30 minutes 45 minutes an hour well okay some people can do that but in the beginning it's like weight training you know for me I cannot lift weights for 30 minutes a home no way no I cannot lift weights for 30 minutes I have to do it in small small increments small weights at first maybe 10 minutes break you know five minutes take a break until I build up 20 30 minutes fool look at me and that's true of your english listening to you have to build up to 30 minutes of English only you have to build up to feeling comfortable that you don't understand everything you won't understand everything because you have been taught to translate every single word but conversation works in bunches English works in bunches this is an idiom it has a meaning this is a phrase it has a meaning this is that so if you're trying to listen to every single word the the conversation or what you're listening to is already down the road it's already changed you're still stuck back here but you've lost everything so again creatures of habit you just have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable for a while not forever not forever and it's possible it is possible so our it let me recap we've had the what I am putting to you is showing you that memorization has a part in your studies but for conversation you need to start moving into something that opens you up and that you start trusting the English that is in your head that you start trusting that you can say what you want to say you don't have to memorize it because there are a million ways to say the same thing that's true all right so let me check again if there are any questions or comments I might have to put my glasses on i I'm in denial let's see ok ok yes that's true yoshi yoshi code says watch the replay of this video you know if i have time i would actually like to make a very nice organized teaching video around this I agree watch this video again and again and again and it will be available to you to watch as many times as you want to but I think it's a fun challenge I i really enjoyed you know I study a lot about the culture in here in Japan and and i watch how the Japanese interact and compare it to my own culture and english and i think okay all right this is something i think that needs to be taught that people need to experience for themselves you know as understanding memorization for speaking English the grammar the vocabulary and mind mapping practice for conversation and communication if you're focused on speaking English you're worried about making mistakes if you're focused on communicating and conversation then your opening yourself up to all of the ideas and to learning how to express those ideas okay great yes um die ecke oh yes training step by step and repeating small steps oh my gosh tyco that is beautiful i love that you know i have two coaches I have three coaches body canyon is now my my weight training coach I because anyone who is good at what they do they have coaches they have teachers it's just that's the way it works i mean presidents of any company Abby's on has advisors Obama Obama's on president obama has advisors Michael Jordan has a million coaches ichiro has a million coaches ok not a million i am exaggerating that's true but my coaches always tell me Katy baby steps baby steps baby steps because they add up so in my head I'm always going baby steps baby steps baby steps yay and then one day it's like whoa look what happened and it's because of all the baby steps that I took and that I take and it will be the same for you too so I love that yes small small steps and i want to tell you I admire all of you i I am so impressed and so honored it's just you're all incredible I think we left to lose the webinar oh is it off there I know it's still on ok I don't
