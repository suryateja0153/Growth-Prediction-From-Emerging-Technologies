 so I'd like to just say thank you very much to dr. de nuit see for inviting me to come to give this presentation and to the Association for hosting this event i'm delighted to be here I've been enjoying the beautiful city of Turin for a couple of days and it's a beautiful venue also to be talking to you in so I hope all of you are sitting comfortably now those of you who need headphones my apologies I don't speak Italian and I hope they haven't charged you extra for the headphones for today but thank you also to the translating team without whom today I am nothing because my Italian I'm afraid is non-existent but I hope what I am going to be able to communicate to you today is not only a pragmatic approach to how to scale up the provision of psychological therapy services so that they become a truly universal service free at the point of need and the pragmatic case which I'll be talking about that dr. Lucy mentioned which has got a lot to do with the costs and the costs and the benefits I also want to try to communicate to you the revolutionary aspect of what it is we have been trying to do in the UK pragmatism is is very necessary when particularly when you're talking to civil servants and people who hold the budget but we also have been on a journey to really try to transform the whole of mental health but more than that as you will see a different approach to mental illness in society that should go across the whole of government now psychologists are absolutely key to this psychological therapists evidence-based psychological therapists psychologists are at the heart of this journey and we are a very fragmented field in mental health we have lots of different tribes psychiatrists psychologists psychotherapists counselors we have couple therapists and family therapists we have doctors we have nurses we have a whole different set of a family of our professionals who make up the collaboration in mental health and up until now we haven't really had an effective way of being able to work together probably the most effective umbrella concept which is really at the heart of the ayah program is is an approach called holistic care the holistic approach to the individual so that actually there isn't a division in a way between the physical health and the mental health of the individual but more applicable maybe to mental health practitioners you might know about this in the form of what we call the biopsychosocial model so a model that tries to integrate the different facets of someone's health needs the biopsychosocial model now the problem with this model and the problem with mental health generally where psychologists have been trying to find for yours where do we fit in where are we going to really make a difference the problem with the model is that it as it says it's bio first psycho second the social bit usually gets left out in the way that we approach the the emphasis the priorities in mental health treatment and what you will see today is that we have completely turned that around and and for some important reasons arrivederci Italy is the headline in one of our journals apparently the Italian economy is not doing very well well it's not unusual in that sense we have had a huge economic crash the eye appt story is about what happens when psychologists meet economists and say that we think we can do something about this great global crisis this is quite a bold claim to make that psychologists are going to be able to rescue the Italian economy but that is the your mission if you choose to accept it that I'm going to persuade you to try to undertake now there is a health warning that comes with this this is what I looked like before I hapten this is what I looked like after I at it's it's not an easy undertaking that there is a serious point to this humorous slide at my own expense which is that in trying to take on the scale of the challenge of depression and anxiety where we're talking really about one in four people one in six people and as you'll see a burden of disease which the World Health Organization says is that is the biggest single burden of disease of any illness this is not an easy undertaking we measured the the well-being of the staff in the iata program when it started or just after it started in 2009 and we measured it again these are 6000 therapists in 2015 and we found that although we are making an impact on helping the patients with their depression the staff are getting worse with their depression with their stress and their depression the eye apt program is very demanding in terms of its targets as you will also see and this is something we're going to have to pay attention to the workload expected of an evidence-based psychological therapist is significantly greater than the workload that we have been used to delivering in terms of throughput and numbers of patients there are ways of trying to deal with that through low intensity step care interventions but essentially it remains a very target driven pressurized environment so you need to go into this project with as it were your eyes open the eye appt story is also about when science when evidence-based practice met the psychological therapies family and I was the person the national adviser responsible for trying to bring together the different groups the professional bodies psychiatry psychology psycho therapy art therapy is all the different bodies with the mental health charities who've played a very important role the mental health charities who are advocates on behalf of the patient groups have been a very important influence in the way that the i't program has been rolled out and we we drew everybody's together to agree a single declaration of what the aims and the objectives of the program was which was called the new Savoy declaration I would recommend even if you don't do the exactly the same thing as the chirren declaration I'd recommend when you are starting kind of a large-scale project where you are trying to get a universal access service that bringing together the key stakeholders in this kind of way and including the patient groups is absolutely essential so the story that I'm going to be focusing on is really about a huge national experiment where we set out to reduce the burden of disease so to actually try to reduce the level of depression and anxiety and increase the subjective well-being of the nation what I'd call for reasons that will become obviously the great escape from misery and I'm going to talk to you about the the background to how you how you need to think about creating something that is a universal access service what the background to that is and first lesson about how there are some difficult challenges which which you may not succeed the experiment will come up against some obstacles I'm then going to talk to you about Lord Laird his intervention the depression report and the case that he made then the business case that he made for the eye apt program and there is there are some unique arguments that he as an economist put forward that really made the difference in terms of getting psychological therapies on the map of the politicians and the policymakers and then I'm going to describe the the national service that we created what it featured what its key components were and how it was rolled out and finally some lessons for you to think about if you are wanting to involve yourself in Anbar on similar sorts of project did the eye apt revolution succeed at least so far how is it doing in terms of its results and then six reasons why some of those results asker's or challenges with some questions that I think we need to think about in terms of adapting I'm talking to you as one of the revolutionaries and like all good revolutionaries I believe in the ideology of what I'm going to be telling you about the I up program but we also have a very serious commitment to science and to the evidence and the if the evidence is showing is that some of the things that we set out to do are not working the way that we intended them we will need to change the design of the program in the years to come so if you are thinking about mental health as a as a as a central aspect of what a government should be looking after for its citizens your starting point needs to be what was the basis for setting up the welfare state the institutions in which government looks after the needs of its citizens when they fall into hardships of various kinds and at the welfare state that was created in in Britain was created by sir william beveridge in the 1940s in 1942 during the Second World War where he produced the Beveridge report that set out what the welfare state should focus on and he identified what he called five evil social giants want idleness ignorance iguala and disease in other words people who are suffering in poverty people who are suffering because they don't have any work people who are suffering in life because they haven't had access to education people who are suffering because they don't have decent housing and people who are suffering from illness because they don't have access to free healthcare to universal free healthcare so these are the evil Giants and the solution that then he came up with and then that was built as part of the welfare state created a system of providing benefits payments Social Security payments of people who had fallen into hardship a policy where the government would support full employment would actually support ways of ensuring that people could get back into work free education schooling system free for everybody up until the age of 16 building of public housing and rent subsidies for those people who couldn't afford to buy their own homes or weren't in a position to pay rents on the private market and of course the National Health Service a universal health service free at the point of need for everyone and what happened of course to then the spending the government spending on these departments the the big-spending departments that were looking after these areas was that it started in Health and Social Security and education taking up about six percent of the gross domestic income of the national income 30 years later that the welfare state is only just over half a century or so old by now but halfway through its lifespan as it were 30 years later it has grown it is more than trebled in size and and is now taking a twenty percent by the mid seventies just from spending on health and social security and education of course this kind of pattern is common to other European countries and other countries that developed similar institutions and this leads us to the first lesson because by this time in the 1970s taking up a bigger proportion of gross national income the welfare state came under quite severe ideological attack the government felt that it was unsustainable not just in terms of its costs but in terms of its failure to deal with the problems that it was setting out supposedly to deal with as the great economist John Maynard Keynes had said look after unemployment and the budget the government's budget will look after itself but by the 1970s we had one and a half million people in the UK unemployed by the 1980s that had doubled again to three million people unemployed and we now then have the period of mrs. Thatcher's government where basically the policy of full employment as the government's responsibility and a plank of the welfare state that was important was abandoned by politicians and Norman Tebbit who was one of her ministers famously said get on your bike get to get a job for yourself it's not the state's responsibility to provide you you with a job you have to find a job for yourself this can this this view about the welfare state and the changing role of government wasn't however just restricted to the conservative to the right-wing politicians also the Labour Party the main party who'd been in government and created the welfare state an influential figure Antony crossland writing about the future of socialism acknowledged that the party's over their view also was that continually rising levels of spending government spending on looking after people who are becoming dependent on the welfare state wasn't sustainable either and that some kind of different contract between the government and the citizens needed to be developed and probably the best book to document this change in the political class and the attitude of the political class in general to the welfare state is Julian Legrand's book called the strategy of equality so basically describing a position where the the political consensus after the Second World War was that we should aim government should aim to do something to make our society more equal because actually that is going to make it a better society and by nine the 1980s that attitude had changed it was felt that that strategy of the government trying to make society more equal hadn't worked and had failed and of course the most famous person who put the nail in the coffin as it were of of the the attitude of government being there to look after everybody as well as make society more equal was moderate Margaret Thatcher who famously said there is no such thing as society there are only individuals and and here said she can't I came to office with one deliberate intent to change Britain from a dependent to a self-reliant society and and this was the whole ethos of thatcherism so the welfare state and and its provision including of healthcare was no longer felt to be something that was secure but but had to justify itself in terms of whether it was meeting the goals that it had said it would meet which was actually to reduce dependency on welfare provision it was set up to be a safety net not to be a permanent form of support for people who would rely permanently on state funding now what does this got to do with mental health well this is is really very important in terms of how you conceptualize the argument for a universal service for the mental health because you have to you have to make that argument based on what contribution mental health is going to be able to make but as you'll see we didn't start from a position the same position in a sense as other recognized social problems in beverages five Giants mental illness was left out surprisingly was a another conservative politician even more ideologically right-wing some would say than Margaret Thatcher Enoch Powell as the health secretary who was the man who launched our first model of social care and he did that partly because he saw the the problems coming from the way that the spending on mental health was increasing during the 1950s the costs of asylum hospitalization which of course was the main system of looking after people with mental illness in the 1950s institutionalizing them in these large Asylum hospitals was becoming unsustainable we had a hundred and fifty thousand patients being kept in these asylums by this time and of course these buildings were great Victorian buildings that were now falling apart and the maintenance of the buildings alone was coming impossible for health authorities to afford but he also saw a real opportunity to transform the way that we looked after mental illness through the discoveries of science that his expert advisors were were telling him about namely in the nineteen fifties the discovery of the antipsychotics and lithium in the 1960s the medications for anxiety tranquilizers and depression antidepressants and then those new generations of antidepressants and antipsychotics that have been discovered in the nineteen eighties so the two things come together for for Enoch Powell and a problem of the rising costs but the opportunity of scientific discoveries for a different way of managing people in the community I just want to spend a couple of minutes though looking at how radical a vision he set out for the way that the system needed to change because this is also relevant to the vision that we have been updating as it were in the eye apt program he described these these institutions the asylums in very sort of memorable speech that he gave to the National Association for mental health interestingly a patient advocate group not a group of professionals of health professionals so he's talking directly to the people who are directly impacted by the change he's describing and that these institutions represent notions of mental illness and attitudes to mental illness that are now outdated but that changing the system will not be straightforward do not for a moment underestimate their powers of resistance to our assault and what he was proposing was tearing down the asylums and replacing it with something called care in the community but interestingly that he ambled only being possible if you created a new profession who were going to actually directly provide this care in the community so yes the the discovery of the drugs was important in terms of managing people outside of institutions but it was the creation of a new profession that he envisage being the key transformative aspect and that profession in 1961 was identified as the new social workers who were going to be trained to specialize in mental health and in addition to the new profession as you say he says none of these changes can be brought about unless the endeavor is sustained by also a widespread public understanding and resolve that the whole of society needs to change its attitude to mental illness without this the planners may plan and the administrators may administer but the face of the map will not be changed and it wants a lot of changing so a radical attempt to transform the system in the 1960s and 70s it ultimately failed and it's interesting to see for a moment why it was that that vision failed in his in its first iteration it failed because essentially the public mood did not change towards mental illness and as newspaper stories for example about members of the public being attacked and murdered by somebody who was psychotic who was from schizophrenia random attacking randomly attacking somebody when they've been let out of hospital and were being looked after in the community as those stories were in a way sensationalized by the newspapers the public mood was that met people with mental illness were dangerous and politicians withdrew their support from the vision of care in the community and felt that it that the risks to the public were too great so the investment in the Social Care the investment in support in rehabilitation in prevention never really materialized and although the system we have now is certainly not the old system of looking after people in large Hospital institutions less than seven percent of people are treated in these institutions and they only stay there on average for ten weeks when they are hospitalized the the change the transformation that Powell had am besieged happening didn't really succeed didn't really take place and the best account of this is about Nicholas rose in that in the reference I've given you there we have to ask ourselves as a group of professionals why it was that we failed to bring about this first transformation because the social workers and the psychiatrist's in the end were not able to really collaborate effectively the psychiatrist's remained clear that the model they were working to was a biological model where the brain disorder was going to be managed by the medication the social workers were clear that actually it was the social causes of the problem that needed to be addressed things like the housing things like the poverty is like the worthlessness and they would be the things that would make the difference to the person being able to recover and stay well but the two professional groups were unable to collaborate effectively to transform the system as a whole and I think there's an important lesson for us there in the revolution that we're attempting now about multidisciplinary teams and the difficulty of trying to collaborate effectively but where we are now is in a sense no further forwards as a system from the failure of care in the community because we have a system that as you can see is a kind of tiered system where you start off with being able if it's effective to prevent problems in the community through good education good schooling through employers who are sensitive to mental health issues through a good work-life balance what we call public mental health and you go through the tears of then they the health care system through to at the top there inpatient treatment for people who are in crisis situations and need hospitalization but it's these tears here that remain the problematic tears that have not been given the adequate resources and have not had the effective methods to be able to make this system work and this is something that the UK government now fully recognizes that unless you put the resources into these tears in particular you're going to end up treating far too many people at the top end and once they are at the top end it's very difficult to get them to step back down and to stay well then and come back into services at the primary care level and look after people effectively there and that essentially is what I act has set out to do I have to set out to work across these levels two three and four so that it doesn't see them as separate services separate secondary separate primary care separate community care its eye apt attempts in its step care model to straddle across these three levels just to underline the fact that we don't yet have a system that is in balance that is delivering the resources where they are really needed look at the spending pattern in mental health and you can see here we have the highest spending on secure forensic mental health services for people being hospitalized who are still considered a risk to society and there are a very small number of people in terms of the population but they are taking up still the biggest single proportion of costs and down here you have psychological therapies which only take up six percent of the mental health budget which is a completely inadequate amount of resource going into psychological therapies Britain is slightly worse in this respect than other European countries but not that much worse there is there is no European country possibly with the apart with the exception of Germany and I'm not sure about Italy Luigi was telling me you have lots of psychologists here but I don't know what the proportion of spending is relative to the other areas of spending but certainly across Europe the although it may be slightly better than six percent it's not going to be anywhere near the amount being spent on forensic services so we need to change the system Lord Laird an economist was the person who really made the key argument that helped us to do this and his depression report the first version of which was in 2005 set out a way of rican sieving depression not just as a health problem but as a social problem Britain's biggest social problem was the subtitle of his report and he said he made the argument in this way that there is a mass of untreated suffering there's a huge amount of anxiety and depression which isn't being treated and that is imposing then severe burdens on the economy we have effective ways of treating it nice guidance has already shown that there are some effective psychological therapies that can treat this depression but we haven't provided the resources to to allow for that and cbt in particular but also other evidence-based psychological therapies are not then being made available on the National Health Service he backed up his case and he's developed this case more recently also in his book oops sorry his book written with David Clarke called thrive and the World Health Organization lent support to this case by in their 2008 report demonstrating that mental illness accounts for thirty-eight percent of the global burden of disease so that's not justly the prevalence the amount of illness as Michaela was was saying that depression is is on route to becoming much more prevalent the second most prevalent but it's also the burden that this imposes on health economies and mental illness accounts for thirty-eight percent compared to heart disease stroke cancer lung disease and diabetes put together which accounts for only twenty-two percent and when you look then at the UK and our our gross national product mental illness and the impact of the economic impact of mental illness in terms of invalidity benefits in terms of the crime that is related to mental illness in terms of the additional physical health care costs that untreated melted mental illness also adds two comes two together to about seven percent of the UK's gross national income so that is a huge social problem that governments cannot simply ignore that cannot simply allow to go on being untreated and in particular the UK government needed to take notice of this because it appears that the the costs whoops of of our mental illness as a proportion of gross domestic product are higher comparatively than other European countries so their systems must be dealing with things better than our system certainly up until the eye apt program so layout analysis then said something again very interesting for many of these people with depression and anxiety actually work employment is also part of the recovery process and when you look at the people who are claiming benefits the total population of people claiming benefits there are more of those people who are claiming invalidity benefits that they are too ill to be able to work as a result of their depression and anxiety then there are people claiming unemployment benefit and the problem for politicians is that the people claiming unemployment benefit usually claim for relatively short periods of time and if they're not ill then they do get back into work the people claiming invalidity benefit stay on invalidity benefit for many years and don't get back into work so the eye apt demonstration sites that we set up in 2006 the two sites in doncaster onium had demonstrated that we could help that population amongst the population of people with depression anxiety we could help some of them actually get back to work and therefore I app services should be made available around the whole country because essentially this was the neatness of the argument they would pay for themselves the investment that cost offset model that mckaela was talking about the investment in the extra service would pay for itself in the savings on invalidity benefits so that was a very important intervention and you can see that it's backed up by the figures you have here the people the population who are claiming benefits and the big group of people who are lone parents quite a big group of people that fluctuates who are unemployed but this by far the biggest group of people that doesn't really change and hasn't really changed since 2009 either is this group of people on incapacity benefits who are there because they have depression and anxiety and from the people in the Treasury this is out this is an unsustainable number of people claiming invalidity benefits like they can't go on affording this as a government particularly since the economic crash and again an important report by the OECD on mental health and work in the UK has demonstrated that in respect Britain is seems to be the sick man of Europe in that we see we have more new disability claims per thousand of the population coming on to these invalidity benefits than anywhere else in Europe so the problem is getting worse the rate of people coming on to in villages benefits is actually higher than elsewhere in Europe sorry I should just point out that although I said your economy is not in good shape earlier in this respect it appears according to the OECD your disability claims your new disability claims are not so bad as ours are so it may be this argument isn't as much of a crisis for you but it will still be taking up a huge proportion of your government spending that the solution then that Richard layout and professor David Clarke and professor Dave Richards then set out has three elements to it which you need to understand each of these distinctive elements first Richard loud said to meet the demand for treatment we could and then achieve the benefit savings we need within five to ten years to create 10,000 new therapists professor David Clarke said that those therapists have to be able to deliver evidence-based versions of treatment of CBT that he's been leading to match the therapies that had featured in the nice guidelines that had been tested by randomized control trials because those were the most effective treatment to offer and professor Dave Richards said the scale of this means we'll be treating something like 900,000 people a year so we're going to have to have a service model that can deliver industrial levels of access far higher of access and throughput then services previously have been used to delivering and and that is not a task that local health commissioner's are going to be able to take on it needs to be a national program so this is the revolutionary claim that the eye apt program has made that if it works if rolling out a National cbt service works in the way that we say it will it will reduce invalidity and spending on invalidity and it will increase subjective well-being it will reduce the amount of depression and increase the amount of happiness in society and pay for itself as a result and you can see then that whereas Cain said look after the unemployed and the budget will look after itself although that's been a discredited strategy in some ways some other authors writers are arguing that that still remains an important goal more equal societies tend to be more mentally healthy societies Lord lairds version is slightly different invest in cbt therapists who will look after the long-term unemployed and the National Health Service and the Department for Work and Pensions budgets will then look after each other these two big spending departments of the state their budgets will look after each other if you create the I am program and a couple of other colleagues of his who are also important labour politicians frankfield and Graham Allen have made a similar case for early years intervention for intervening early with preventive mental health interventions for children and in schools to create similar savings for the education budget which is one of the other big spending departments of government okay so what was the service then that we created and what were its distinctive features we set ourselves a recovery target so unusually for public services we said these are the outcomes at the beginning of the program that we guarantee we are going to be able to deliver fifty percent of patients who are treated in the service will recover we said we would only offer evidence-based therapies and those were the ones approved by nice cognitive behavioral therapy into personal therapy dynamic interpersonal therapy behavioral couples therapy and person-centered experiential counseling a version of counseling that is evidence-based for treating depression and we then created a standard national minimum data set that all the eye appt services would have to report to so that we could both the clinical level track the progress of each patient towards recovery at every single session at every single appointment and the national level compared services benchmark them against whether they were performing to the standard that we had set so that was also a very important feature of how the service was going to be different there were also three unique aspects to the eye appt service that I think are really very challenging one is that as I've already explained we we didn't just say Oh we'll get people better from their symptoms of depression and anxiety we said we'll get people better in a way that will make a difference to their ability to function and that will mean some of them will will be able to return to work for others it will be doing different things but but some of them will be able to return to because they haven't been able to work up until now and that allows commissioners to say we will invest in this service but we will only pay you for the patients that you actually get better who return to work and if you don't get them better we won't pay you for them that's quite a difficult way of commissioning services but it's it's a way that commissioners are now saying we can expand if you if you guarantee as these results we will pay you for those results if you do better than you've said you will do you'll get more payment and the service will be able to then invest that payment in expanding even further but it's quite a challenge we wanted to incorporate there for employment advisors in the multidisciplinary teams to make sure that we met those goals we also said that the traditional model of people accessing these services through their GP wasn't going to work and that was because GPS traditionally tend to refer people through to psychological therapies who are already not that ill they tend to be young people young women mostly in their twenties looking at the population of who gp's tend to refer who are not that ill when they get the therapy they do okay but actually they don't do as well as some of the groups that the GPS tend to neglect older people for example GPS that seem to assume older people probably are going to be depressed anyway and they don't refer them for psychological therapy but when they do when we've looked at the results for older people older people do significantly better in their outcomes recovery outcomes than other age groups and there are also other there are there are excluded groups people out of work black and minority ethnic groups who the GPS weren't picking up and identifying and referring through to psychological therapies so we said we don't want to have any gatekeepers we want to have access targets that will drive access increase access and we want to have self referral people can refer themselves into the services and the third unique element I've already mentioned was that we said it's not a primary care service it's not a secondary care service it straddles across these different tiers and whilst there will be a central team that will manage the performance of the therapists the therapists themselves will be located wherever it is easiest for the patients to see them so often in GP surgeries in other community settings the therapists will go to where the patients can easily access them I probably need to speed up a little bit I think so quickly then to look at the planning assumptions the service was built to see 900,000 people a year fifty percent recovery rate of those who we expected of the 600,000 we expected to engage with treatment meant we should deliver 300,000 people recovered every year with it within that care pathway the training organized in a very systematic way with competences identified for each of these national curriculums that people will be trained in meta competences according to the model whether it's cognitive behavioral or dynamic or or the other models generic competences that we would call common factors ability to engage people ability to develop a therapeutic alliance those sorts of common factors and then specific techniques to the both the disorder and the modality being treated and those trainings linked to national accreditation standards with supervision and training and the outcomes of the trainees being measured the the mix of staff is made up then of these different groups of staff offering the different therapies what we call psychological while being practitioners are delivering low intensity and the other staff are delivering the high intensity models and as I say very challenging productivity targets about 40 full-time staff looking after 250 thousand patients in a service that is meant to look after 250 thousand patients where we expect a level of access of fifteen percent of the population with depression and anxiety and we now expect them to be able to access the service within four to six weeks and this together education and training according to competency models evidence-based therapies being delivered outcomes being measured at every session is what defines what we then recall clinical excellence what I call evidence best practice a way of organizing the profession that creates a singular kind of profession a consistent model of delivery so um how did we do what were the results and did we succeed in what we said we would do well here you can see that recovery rates which we said would be fifty percent have stayed around about 43 to 45 percent persistently in the last year and a half and this has been the case since about 2011 2012 that they seem to have plateaued we haven't quite reached the target that we said we would reach this these other lines a slightly different ways of measuring reliable improvement is where people make a significant change but they don't get to below case honest but the recovery rate was the one that would target that we officially set ourselves and we're also in terms of the numbers completing treatment falling well short of the target of 300,000 you can see here the people entering treatment 114,000 are much higher number than the 45,000 who are completing treatment having recovered so we're not seeding in terms of the overall numbers recovered either on the access rates we are we aim to treat 900,000 people a year which is fifteen percent of prevalence and it steadily gone up to now just under fifteen percent and the latest figures I think will show that we're more or less there and similarly you can see that there's a gradual improvement there but when you dig into that a bit more you can see there is a large variations between different services in terms of their access rates that these services down here are delivering very low access rates in Manchester of just under five percent compared to Hackney city in Hackney at twenty percent now these are services that are grouped together because they are similar in terms of their deprivation levels so we're comparing like would like between these services there shouldn't be this much variation because they've got similar populations these are the services that are in the areas of the country that are least deprived and you can see that there is a higher number of access going on in the areas that are least deprived which is also what we don't want we want the areas of the country well as most deprivation to be getting higher levels of access but there's also variation between services that are matched in terms of not very much deprivation so there are some questions to answer there and that's a question about evidence-based practice really one of the main rationales for evidence-based medicine was that there are unacceptable variations in outcomes that surgeons in one part of the country were getting success rates in operations fifty percent with only fifty percent of patients dying from surgery surgeons in another part of the country we're getting eighty percent of patients dying after surgery unacceptable variations evidence-based medicine was about trying to get rid of those variations by everybody offering the best evidenced form of treatment so if that's the case which it is the case all these therapies are evidence-based and recommended by nice why are we seeing this pattern of variation then between the services with this group large group of services in the middle around about forty to fifty percent recovery rates but then substantial numbers higher than that and substantial numbers lower than that as well so evidence-based practice as we expected it to work isn't isn't minimizing the variation in the way that we thought one explanation might be the levels of deprivation because you can see that the recovery rates for the most deprived areas of the country are not very good compared to the recovery rates in general for the least deprived areas of the country but you still get variations again between these services that are matched so deprivation might be one explanation but again we did say that we would set out to help people who were deprived as a part of our task so I want to finish them by some sort of take home points as it were about the revolution and some challenges I think we've still yet to to overcome beverage said that the object of government is not the glory of rulers or of races but the happiness of the common man so that is that is what we've set out to do we set out to position the eye appt service as a major social intervention to increase the happiness of the common man but I act on its own is not likely to be able to do this it's a huge task an eye apt as a service of 6,000 therapists certainly is nowhere near big enough to be able to take on that task and the OECD report which I showed you about the figures for mental health and work indicates we're a long way off getting there yet what are the reasons for that well reason number one is that we failed to reduce the level of depression I think as one of your opening speakers said in Italy the amount of prescribing of antidepressants is rising the amount of depression itself is rising that's also been the case in the UK that despite I apt when I up started we had antidepressant prescribing at 30 million prescriptions a year last year it was 50 million prescriptions a year so we don't know why that is and we don't know in a sense whether it's the CBT or the antidepressants that is achieving the benefits such as they are because we're not disaggregating those outcomes so that's something we need to change the second reason is the dropout rate from the interventions now Michaeli said that the low intensity interventions feature very highly in the model that he was talking about and they do in our model as well mostly based on behavioural change and positive psychology principles but they don't seem to be engaging patients successfully and we missed a trick in our minimum data said I think by not tracking at every session whether the client feels the session was helpful with that practitioner in other words at the end we measure the symptoms at every session but at the end of the session we don't ask the clients to report through a simple questionnaire whether they felt the session was helpful whether they felt the therapist was understanding them and we know that if if a client scores highly on that it's a the best predictor of whether they come back to the next session and whether they complete the treatment so that's something I think we should we should do the third reason to do with recovery I think is probably because although it's certainly true for some people that removing their symptoms reducing their symptoms actually equals recovery they feel better it's what they were wanting from the therapy for a large number of people the symptoms is not what they define as recovery it probably is getting themselves back into work or it probably is improving their relationship with their wife or it probably is a whole load of other things that they expect the therapy to be able to help them with that would also accompany reduce symptoms but the reduced symptoms don't capture it so I don't think we're targeting quite the right problems and we're not measuring the person's quality of life which is their improvement we're measuring the reduction of symptoms but we're not measuring at the moment the improvement towards the the quality of life goal that the patient says is relevant for them the fourth reason is that we unfortunately have a model which is any evidence based therapy you like as long as it's CBT that we focused on training the workforce in cbt initially and said that we would and this and reason five follows on from this we we develop these other brands of therapy but we haven't routinely made those available so finally then the last reason I think is that we don't yet understand not so much where effective psychological therapies fit in to the system of welfare support it's more that we don't yet understand what the causal relationship is between mental distress and these other forms of welfare dependency that people get stuck in so for example if someone's depression is caused by them losing their job it may not be the therapy or or a particular kind of therapy that is the relevant response it may be helping them get back to work employment support that is the relevant response if the cause of the distress is the unemployment itself equally if someone's anxiety is due to the breakdown of their marriage offering them CBT which is the evidence-based treatment for anxiety may not be the right intervention and likewise if someone's depression is down to just bad luck should we be treating that as a mental illness in the first place so getting a better understanding of the causal relationship between mental distress and people remaining stuck in these areas of welfare dependency I think is a key scientific goal for the coming years reasons to be cheerful however I think that we've started out on this revolution there's a long way to go I'm particularly involved in a new experiment in Greater Manchester where we are offering the full range of therapies and we're offering them targeted specifically at this group of people on what we call Employment Support Allowance so we're taking a cohort of people in Greater Manchester who are all on long-term invalidity benefits and we're wanting to test the thesis the bold thesis that getting the right match of intervention is going to actually get as then the results that we looked for so that's an exciting further stage of the experiment that i'm looking forward to essentially where we're not so much asking which disorder the person has but which person the disorder has we're doing what what what i said we need to do in terms of identifying the improvement to their quality of life and targeting that as the match for the intervention that we then allocate to them and we can only do that if practitioners can understand the causal relationship between distress and invalidity that's an exciting challenge I hope it's a challenge that you feel inspired also to take on and that the eye apt revolution is something you think is applicable to the Italian context thank you very much for your time today
