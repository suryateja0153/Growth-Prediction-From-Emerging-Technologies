 well hello and welcome everyone thank you for joining me today for the webinar that's all about blogging for accountants and advisors with the objective of generating leads and positioning you as an authority in your field of expertise will drill into what that means today as we go so first a little bit of context for you if you're not familiar with me or with practice paradox my name is Michael Carter most people call me MC I founded practice paradox in 2010 after also co-founding business fitness back in 2001 so business fitness of the people behind the good the bad and the ugly of the accounting profession and also how now document management work papers and the light great bunch of people there I've no longer part of business fitness but still good friends with them so the reason we found it paradox was we saw a lot of people were talking about marketing in a very superficial way no one was specializing in it and it was also the time in 2010 where social media blogging and the whole content driven marketing space was very very new and most people had not seen any application for it for professional advisory firms but we were joining the dots and could see where things were headed so we're not general practice management consultants at all let's clear that right up there's lots of coaches and consultants out there that will teach you about how to run your practice in general we're all about marketing so that's your strategy that's your positioning that's generating converting leads we're not about workflow efficiency HR or any of that so it was super focused in what it is that we do and we were the first two to advise people in this area around content driven marketing thought leadership it's someone's become a cliche these days so many people have jumped on that bandwagon and talking about it but specifically of course today we're talking about blogging social media is not the focus of today we'll get some mentions because they work together very nicely we do separate events and have separate services around social media some of the really exciting areas of marketing at the moment automation which allows you to achieve a lot more with a lot less labour just like any area of automation so why this topic today in all of the benchmarking study such as business Fitness is good bad ugly firms keep citing growth as their one of their top challenges yet they're not achieving it by and large and there are a lot of reasons for that there are a lot of competitive pressures there's a lot of margin squeeze and price pressure on the compliance and traditional and of the spectrum of the services that you provide but most firms want to do more on the value add but really it's just not happening and let's just share a brief model with you as to why we see it's not happening now I'm going to summarize some of the statistics around them so in the surveys I also saw have seen surveys done in the US and out of New Zealand that the numbers stack up fairly similarly when asked the question do you want to provide more future-focused valuate services to your clients so the non-compliance side of things nine out of ten state that they want to ah only one out of ten actually achieves it so eight out of those nine are basically failing and the reason we call it a value-add chasm and not a value-add canyon is that it's not a huge gulf it is not difficult in our eyes to breach that value a chasm and to be doing more and become the one out of ten that truly is helping their clients with more future focus services I sometimes joke that you know it's lucky that those statistics don't apply to pilots and surgeons in terms of their success rate in intentions or there'd be a lot of carnage in the in the on the surgeons table and on the tarmac so what's the difference then if you think about it nine out of ten want to do it one out of ten is achieving it so what's the difference between the one out of 10 that's achieving it and the eight out of the nine that don't and it's pretty simple it's their ability to communicate value full stop let's assume that technically most advisors and account are and I know many of you would argue this but let's assume particularly as the market perceives it that you're all fairly similar incompetency difficult for people to judge so the one out of 10 is just great at communicating value and your ability to communicate value is essentially the foot bridge across the chasm and blogging is a beautiful beautiful way of achieving that it's a it's a pillar in modern marketing and we'll look at today why that is but first let's get an idea of who's who in the room today and let's do a poll this will be the first of a few polls today the question is do you currently publish blog posts gosh some of your quick so let's answer whether it no you never have yes but only a few times and boy oh boy do we see that a lot where people have this bright shiny new website paid a lot of money for it and three months six months nine months down the track the only blog posts that are there are the initial hey welcome to our new blog a we excited will be sharing this and that and then nothing's happened very common so the options no never have yes but only a few times yes that sporadically yes but around yes and around one per month so one article published a month yes and around to a month or yes we publish three or more posts each month and let's see how many of you have voted most of you have voted thank you for your participation there I'll click n poll and I'll share those results with everyone now so interestingly thirty percent of you never have and twenty-six percent of you have only done it a few times so what's that fifty-six percent of you haven't done it much if we add the 11 to it with up around two-thirds of you aren't blogging much at all so it's great that you've joined us today because we'll show you like the how-to aspects are almost are that they're easy we can teach you those and we can do aspects of blogging for you but the most important thing is to understand the strategy the why and how to measure whether it's successful or not now fifteen percent of you are doing twice a month seven percent once a month and eleven percent of you three or more so if we add those up at 22 yeah okay so two-thirds are not doing it much the other third of you are actively blogging which is good that's a good mix to have so the next poll that flows straight on from that is what do you want to actually achieve through your blogging and you'll have a different context on this by the end of today's session but I'll launch that poll and let's just share with each other why are you even bothering with either doing third of you who are doing blogging and the other two-thirds that are clearly considering doing it so do you want to generate leads do you want to position yourself or your firm as an authority and you can tick more than one here select all that apply to you get your name out there add value to clients and prospects that's one of the things I love about blogging and content driven marketing with an educational focus it's just good karma you know you are adding value to the universe by by blogging in a quality way attract potential employees not sure no one's answered that yet or other okay so around these numbers out eighty percent of you want to generate leads let's face it it's where the rubber hits the road we are in business the leader is to position yourself as an authority so 80 over eighty-five percent of you want to position yourself as authorities and it's really frustrating when you do have expertise and you are a potential Authority and you're essentially as the old saying goes it's all biblical phrase don't hide your light under a bushel which sounds with but basically don't hide your talents don't be meek or shy about it you know let people know what you can do for them so it's frustrating if you don't know in the modern world of marketing how to get your expertise out there others want to add value to clients attack attract potential employees twenty one percent of you have mentioned there get your name out there now blogging is you'll find today achieves all of those things will do the third poll bit later on now today I'll share some slides that we used in our recent masterclass we did a full two days on blogging for business in Sydney a few months ago but let's look at the wireframe of why is crucial for blogging it definitely grows your online presence and the main aim here is to generate targeted traffic to your website so targeted traffic is essentially people who are ideally profiled to become your clients and also of course your existing clients will go there as well so there's a term in search engine optimization you might want to write this one down called organic traffic nothing to do with health food it's just people it's a techy term for people that have searched on something they haven't entered your web address your domain even your brand name they've searched on something and they found you so when people are searching on topics on things that they want to solve in their life organic traffic are people that are discovering you through that now then the aim of increasing your website traffic is to grow your marketing database so that's your email database it's also your social media networks your social networks blogging absolutely when done well with an SEO focus boosts your google rankings and other search engines as well and especially when it's done in an SEO savvy way and search engine optimization we are unable in today's session to drill into this in a lot of detail because it deserves its own session and in fact we've done webinars just on search engine optimization but there are some tricks to it that enable you to rank fairly rapidly we often see within 7 to 14 days if you're targeting a specific phrase you can be page one even top three in Google search results for specific longtail phrases when you blog and you SEO your blog posts now the word authority look at the first what six letters of the word authority and its author so one of the easiest way to position yourself as an authority is to write and blogging is the easiest way to get your content out there so attracting your ideal types of clients not just generic clients not ones that might be price sensitive and just looking for someone to do their tax or lodge that quarterly basis or do the year-end but once it won't advise people who want to improve their business or improve their financial situation another nice spin off of positioning yourself as an authority is that it does attract other opportunities such as media so when people see you and by the way everything that we do and everything that we teach accounting and advisory firms to do we test on ourselves first so we walk our talk we see a social media platform or a new tool we use their selves some we go no it's not worth it others we go yeah that's good and then we teach others how to do it and so in this area we walk our talk I've just come back from New Orleans as I used to call it that I now call it New Orleans in the States and spoke to 450 accountants about the latest trends in marketing for accounting and CPA firms and that all came out of my blogging and social media so I know some of you in today's session that now have regular newspaper columns regularly get interviewed on the radio and are often invited to speak at conferences to do with business or different industry sectors because you have positioned yourself as an authority now wonder that one of the key traits or indicators that you are in authorities when you get paid to do your marketing so let's achieve that now evergreen is a marketing term that means a piece of content that will be just as relevant today as it will be in a month six months a year maybe even in a couple of years in other words it doesn't date quickly it's not about the federal budget that was done recently whereas you know that's not very topical is it in a few months or six months time so the nice thing about evergreen content so let's say a blog post about a timeless principle about managing a business better let's say managing cash flow or protecting assets or just managing your own personal finances perhaps that works for you like an unpaid salesman or salesperson 24 hours a day seven days a week because it's up on the web anytime someone searches for it they can find it and the content on a in a blog post is far more valuable than if you only put it in an email newsletter you still will put it in an email newsletter but emails that are a bit like today's newspaper if you still get the newspaper here today gone tomorrow valuable today you know wrapping the rubbish or fish and chips the next day so emails are very fleeting blogs work day in day out for you too beautiful thing when you've got that pumping for your business now on the flip side if you are not consistently blogging and publishing educational influential content you really haven't showed up you're really not doing marketing particularly as an advisory firm in your type of firm as an accounting and related advisory firm whether you also do financial planning and bookkeeping business advisory people don't find you in Google when they search your area of expertise you don't exist as they say you are who google says you are and I love the quote by Woody Allen eighty percent of life is just showing up so if you're not consistently blogging which is two-thirds of you at this point I'm you haven't shown up yet you'll effectively be an undercover operation to your competitors who are appearing on page one and preferably in the top three on page one of Google so your website traffic is going to be a lot lower why spend we see firm spend somewhere between two three four five through to about 15 sometimes 20 thousand dollars on their website and they think when the web site goes live that its job finished really that's just walking up to the starting line that is the start of where your most valuable content will start being published so consistent publishing is crucial because that's what will generate your website traffic you're going to have a much smaller marketing database your marketing database should at least be 20 times the size of your client base so 20 times as many people and organizations on your marketing database than just people you're actually engaged in supporting at the moment and you won't be much in avith ority and you won't be educating and helping people as much either and back to the lead generation you'll be missing out on a lot of inbound leads now write down if you're not familiar with the term inbound marketing that's the only style of marketing we teach to us outbound marketing is old school marketing outbound marketing is where you pick up the phone and call people or you go to that networking breakfast so you pound the pavement you knock on doors you pitch yourself to others hoping to get them now they can still be a place for that but I know myself as a businessman if you've got a choice of having inbound leads where people are lining up and knocking on your door and they already understand what you stand for what your values your vision your style of business your pricing sort of models how you structure things versus going out and dealing with cold prospects I know which one I'd take every day and I'm sure you'd be the same just a quick distinction between web pages versus blog posts so web pages you know your about page your services page team page they're all important and some of those are really important from an SEO perspective as well things like your about page so we're not saying to not have your typical structure of a good website but blog posts are where eighty percent and more of your content will be over time because web pages are what's known as static content then it change very often you might revise them from time to time but they are very much a one-way monologue they tend to be more formal they don't have to be and the often product or service focus you know here we are here's what we do who's who here's how we help and please buy so really that's brochure where so it's like an online electronic brochure and you know every business has a website but not every business has a blog because blog posts are updated frequently it's really easy to publish things to a blog that's why they call it push-button publishing is one term to use it it's really been a really catalytic thing in the evolution of society and the flattening of the earth is the ability for people to pub views and opinions blog posts tend to be more of a two-way dialogue because you can encourage people to ask questions through comments and so on and also through social media so it's more of it dialogue in two ways rather than the Manalo can tend to be more informal more conversational because of that and you need to have a focus of just being more education focused so it's educational not promotional we'll talk some more about that and more of an editorial tone than an advertising or advertorial tone you know everyone you know no one likes to be sold to but everyone likes to buy so if people are reading your blog posts and they're feeling like they're reading veiled advertising so it's like an advertorial effect we're really just promoting yourself they won't influence them they'll feel like okay then they probably won't even read the posts but if they're being engaged and they're connecting with the issues that you're teaching them about educating them about it will have an editorial tone like a newspaper magazine article or a book chapter and not every business has a blog we were really killed actually some of you who are in the session today we're at a presentation I did at David Smith's event that he runs each year the accountants technology showcase I spoke about years ago I think at the very first one about all the different cloud based marketing apps you should be using and you know people came up to me afterwards including vendors of our website platforms for accounting firms they said MC you are off your tree why on earth lab solutely really killing me so why would an accounting firm need a blog that's ridiculous they could just go off to blogger com and have a blog there if they want a blog they didn't get it I still don't get it that same platform we support a lot of accounting and advisory firms internationally with their blogging and I'll share it with you later today how we do that and some of these platforms that are extremely popular that many of you might even use firms that have businesses that have three-letter acronyms I won't name them you cannot even SEO the blog post you cannot specify what the title should appear like in Google you cannot specify the description as it should appear in the search engine results in Google that's pathetic it's all technology but the accounting profession is changing and innovative providers particularly in the cloud-based accounting space like zero and a whole app ecosystem they're really raised the bar and more and more firms are seeing how important it is to have a very modern presence and be educational in the marketing so sure have a website your position is the supplier have a great blog and you position yourself instead as a thought leader and to drill into that a thought leader is simply one whose views are considered influential you know you're the go-to person you lead your field you're an expert that people seek advice from and I don't know to put it in other terms you're a guru in your your niche keep in mind you can't be a guru generalist you know I joke that there's never been a Hall of Fame built to journalists it's a recipe to get lost in the crowd it's a recipe for mediocrity how can you be great at lots and lots of different things you really cannot so we won't talk about niching and focus strategy today but that's one of the key things that we teach in our modern marketing academy I mentioned this earlier but just in your brain scrub out the whole concept of marketing because you can tend to get overwhelmed and people over the years have tended to overcomplicate what marketing is marketing equals education so if you just think who do I need to educate what do I need to teach them then that simplifies but great content it really does educate but it does more than that you need to not just educate your readers but great content motivates action I almost said the word inspires but a bit over that word everyone's talking about inspire inspire this great word don't get me wrong but great content motivates action you want someone to read that blog post that you've just done on why they need to move their accounting and related you know back off us to cloud-based systems or why they need you know a rolling forecasts on their cash flow why they need to do their budgets each year when they need a real-time dashboard or need to do tax planning or you know should have better financial plans in place whatever the topic might be if they don't take action well you're not generating leads and they're not improving their life so I want to share with you a psychological principle of how you motivate people to take action there's a term in psychology called cognitive dissonance and cognitive dissonance is simply the state of having inconsistent thoughts beliefs or attitudes especially as relating to behavioral decisions an attitude change let's put that another way when people are not doing what they know they could or should on they're not walking they're tall so how that applies to blogging is if someone before they've read their a blog post of yours they are blissfully ignorant in your linguistic programming another area of psychology they call that unconscious in competence where they don't know that they don't know something blissful ignorance so before they read it your post that's where they are then they get the end of mega ah right so I shouldn't be managing my cash flow just by looking at my daily bank account balance is right yeah I now get why that's utterly flawed and they might even get your point of feeling a bit embarrassed about the fact that that's the way they've been running their business so once they've adjusted that belief system of right okay I need to be forecasting and predicting my cash flow my inflows and outflows based on data that's available that certain apps can do cash flow forecast so easily these days you've got to love that as a business advisor then if they don't take action they are experiencing cognitive dissonance and that is crucial if you don't create cognitive dissonance oh you won't motivate anyone to action so you want to educate your clients and your prospective clients about the principles and strategies they need to implement and we'll come back to this again but the principles and strategies they need to implement so if you think I'm going to sit down and write a blog post about how great my XYZ services you'll probably right brochure where instead you need to think what a principle I'm going to write about here that we're going to teach so the strategies the frameworks the approaches so that by the end of it they can see there's something that they can implement now they might not implement it straight away they might sit on it for months I love examples that I hear from time to time of firms that we've taught content driven marketing and strategy and blogging too and they'll pick up clients that share with them that they've been following them for months five months nine months and longer before they actually took their arm I suppose you know changing accountants is kind of like breaking up with them someone in a relationship it's it's not something that someone that's quickly for lots of reasons so people will watch you from afar so they'll look at your digital presence and then when the timings right I know let's say they've got the house in order and they're up to date with everything with their past account and they might think okay now it's time to go to someone who's going to take me to the next level and they meet with you so you know really it's like priming a pump if you start blogging this month you're not going to see results next month straight away people were always asking with people signing up for our blog article service how quickly can I see results how quickly can I see results fair question but what we say is look look at an arc of 12 months and beyond but you know in three to six months you'll be starting to see result and on screen here are some screenshots from graphs that we've taken from the marketing metrics dashboards that we built for different firms out of respect for their privacy we're not telling you who they are though one on one we'd be happy to share lots of examples we've got more examples later in the webinar today but if you have a look these are visits from organic trend so I mentioned that earlier organic trend people who've just discovered the business so I like to use the analogy of a retail store imagine your websites like a retail store and I don't know if you've ever walked into a retail store and kind of looked around up nah it's not grabbing me walk straight out whereas other retail stores will make you want to browse make you discover and explore and there's a science to that alone so that's what a good website does but what we talked about here is getting more walk-ins more people actually walking in to your store on this case visiting your site so these are examples are firms that we've been doing the blogging for in the last few months and you can see the trend there it is just so consistent that when you're consistently blogging good quality content that Google picks up on that their search and ranking algorithm has as one of its attributes recency which is why static web pages that haven't been updated in many months or sometimes even years that's there's a good reason why you're buried on page 6 of Google so these are empirical results that all those screenshots were taken this morning so how do you measure your blogging effectiveness if you're going to do something in business let's be hard-nosed about it you want to see that it's working so bottom line google rankings and website traffic now google rankings are for specific phrases which comes back to strategy and one of the biggest mistakes we see we've got a website or tool you can have a free audit done of your website on our website and you need to enter your web address you can enter the web address of a competitor if you want you don't have to and you have to enter a phrase so it's an SEO target phrase and nine times out of ten we get notified whenever anyone does one of these it pops up in one of our channels in slack and we say to each other or there goes another one who needs to be educated because people will often into their own brand name or their own web address or someone come through the other day strategy so imagine you're an accounting firm and you're wanting to get more people to visit your website and you think yeah I want to rank well for strategy I don't think anyone let's say business that is waking up going yeah yeah I'll need some help search strategy it's not going to happen they'll search you know such and such strategies for such and such so specific search on specific area and that's where you need to have your keywords actually documented that you are going to target in our SEO implementation service that's smashing it at the moment achieving some really great traction for subscribers to that we list out many different phrases that you want to rank well for but google rankings and then ultimately website traffic so if those things are not improving something's going wrong now think right now and in fact type it through in the chat area what's a value-added service that you provide that you're really good at providing it but you're not succeeding at the moment on the marketing side or the selling side so marketing generating demand selling actually converting the inquiries to paid engagements think of that service what are the principles the service is based on so I don't know imagine you are a lecturer at university and you're teaching some undergrads why this management accounting topic or this financial planning topic or this principle within bookkeeping not just teaching them what to do but why it's important so they're the principles that the service is based on and then in your in your article people are generally motivated either by gaining things or avoiding pain we all are so in an article you can emphasize one or the other or cover both so what are the gains of implementing and one of the pains you know what pain will experience by not implementing and in the space that you're in around financial management business growth compliance there's a lot of pains if people don't implement out there but you cannot assume that people know that it's the curse of knowledge sexual term for anyone who's got knowledge in a domain to assume and a fail to mention things when they're explaining whether that's writing or in person so you're always going to bring it back to basics and explain the principles underpinning your services and that gives you a really good start and to become a great blogger the cognitive dissonance point that I made earlier is the key reason that's crucial is that none of us buys when we're comfortable what we do is we buy when we're uncomfortable so you want to get people outside their comfort zone so before anyone purchases advisory services they've got to see that gap in their lives between where they are now where there could be and the fact that your service is the foot bridge in the same way we talked about before with the value-add chasm where one out of those nine crossing it and their ability to communicate is little foot bridge your value added services our foot bridges between where someone is now and where they could be so your blog posts make them realize where they could be and your services are the footbridge and until people see the other side by your education there's no demand for foot bridges they're quite happy where they are there they'll be happily doing things the way they've always been doing them in their business and you'll just keep doing compliance for them and compete in those bloodied waters of competition rather than getting out into some nice blue ocean and more profitable advisory where another tip around blogging is and these are some slides I'm sharing with you out of the recent masterclass you've got to find a non-obvious angle as kids might say to you if you're a parent from one from time to time tell me something I don't know now my kids aren't that disrespectful but none of us likes to be told something we already know so you need to find a non-obvious angle you know the last thing someone wants to be told is just super obvious things about how they need to be managing their business or any aspect even health and nutrition now everyone knows they should exercise more and eat more healthily but what are the non-obvious angles you want people to think what the huh how could that be and that's part of that the art and the skill of getting people to read your blog post in the first place is to have an angle that surprises people and intrigues them and that all starts with a great headline now drilling beyond the headline let's look over all at the anatomy of a great blog post you've got to have a great topic for status so it's got to be specific don't be really don't be afraid at all of writing a topic that you know will only appeal to ten percent of your clients that's better than writing one that is so broad and you're trying to appeal to everyone that no one takes any notice of it so it's got to be very relevant to a specific target audience and ideally timely to them as well based on maybe the time of year and do find that non-obvious or contrarian angle that might take a bit of brainstorming and creativity or you might need help from creative copy writers such as our team here paradox on that now the headline in advertising they call the headline the ad for the ad if an ad doesn't have a great headline doesn't matter if the rest of the ad is great no one is likely to read it and same with a blog post so the headline is crucial in our modern marketing academy we have some exercises to run through to make sure that your headline has what are called flagging words that for your target audience they get their attention has benefits or at least implied benefits in there and also some intrigue because the purpose of the headline is to sell them on reading on after you get their attention so they get their attention is intrigues them and a good headline if it's done in a search engine optimized way it will help your google rankings as well you also need a striking supporting image try to avoid the really typical stock images you know most people these days can spot a stock image a mile away and please duel do us all a favor and avoid using those ones where there's you know group of four or five multiracial people you know all from different parts of the world ethnic backgrounds and they're pointing at a laptop in a cafe or something like that lose those ones you know I stock photo com a full of those sorts of ones there's also good ones in there but there's some great sites now like unspliced com that have some really edgy images but it can take time to find those clearly it's going to be well written so some tips around that forget about what your university lecturers and your high skill high school English teachers told you about all of these stiff old rules of grammar right the way you speak so it needs when someone's reading it it's got to sound like you're speaking with them and not nothing different to that so if you speak fairly formally well right in that same style but it's got to reflect your conversational star and write as if you're speaking to one person so not a group of people avoid plural pronouns where you're describing group of people so it's you not all of you or some of you when you're writing and in the blogging master class we talked about buyer personas sometimes today some people call them avatars they're an imaginary person that has the traits of one of your target markets it was brilliant to see what some of the firms have come up with in that space I consolidate Wow brisbane-based firm that operates nationally has identified and even had their graphic designers designed like infographics to describe and name the different buyer personas it was brilliant and then when they write an article they know which target audience they're writing the blog post for it's very easy to go through a blog post and count how many times you mentioned the reader as in you and your versus us and we be very careful most people tend to we all over themselves bad word image I know that you'll remember it now don't talk about yourself you can't be like that bore at the party that just talks about themselves the whole time you need to talk about things through the eyes of your reader so have that editorial tone not the advertorial tone writing benefits not features so benefits our what will it achieve in their life not what is it they expect you to look after the details needs to be well formatted common mistakes we see on web sites are the headlines the way the style are done on the on the website the headlines are too small and sometimes the body companies too small as well so have a look at that headline should be big should also be mobile responsive should look good on the mobile but it's got to be well formatted here's a tip I saw a Qi the other evening that is something rhymes there's a psychological disposition for people to think it's more true so you're inclined to remember so here's one for you if you only have a blog about your core services you will forever be considered a bore so if you're an accountant and all you write about or here's a tax deduction here and here's the latest tax ruling here and here's the latest out of the recent budget that stuff's important you can cover that but if that's all you write about boy oh boy there's a million other places your clients can get that sort of information and they pretty much expect you to look after that stuff they expect you in handling their affairs to make sure they don't miss out on things so avoid the technical dry content don't try to teach some tax that's what they're paying you for don't try to teach some bookkeeping unless that's a service area that you do and you know don't try to teach them things that they just want you to handle they're paying you to look after certain things you want to teach them how to improve their future not just get their paperwork in order another mistake where we see overly technical articles is where people are clearly writing for their peers so they're writing to impress fellow accountants and advisors rather than just relating to their target market so you're not out to impress anyone with your technical knowledge avoid that so right for those personas that I briefly mentioned earlier not peers and that essentially is a very specific target market because if you're right view peers it's likely to be above the heads of your target market be a fairly safe bit of that okay now if you're not going to write about your core you might be thinking well MC what do we write about well you right around topics around the periphery of your core so you want to lead your readers to a better place in their business life financial life so you want to teach them and expiring in sight excite them but without sounding inauthentic it's still gonna sound like you so you need to write about things that excite you things that really light your fire so to put a little visual to it here's the core of what you do his areas that are related to what you do so a recent example of that I recall is after someone had sent us an incredibly dry and boring article to polish up that was very compliance based and we said look we're not going to polish this because no one's going to read it what are you excited about at the moment and the gentleman who is a partner in a to partner firm he mentioned two things and one of them was a particular app that enables people to have transparency across all of their investments when you connect them to your self-managed super in your accounting and etc and I said there you go right about that so it's real clearly related to what they do as a firm but other things that they care about as well you can write about that same firm was really excited about some of the charity related things they were doing so they also were relating and we're writing about that and that gets far greater engagement when you write about those things because people get to understand you your your values what it is you stand for type of person that you are and you know it is true that people buy from people it's important to build a brand for your business but at the end of the day most small and medium-sized businesses are really selling their own personal brands as well as their business brands okay third and final poll for today let's see what are some of the challenges you experience with blogging so there you go number one finding the time to write the article seventy percent of you cited that next biggest issue is knowing which topics to write about fair enough it is difficult to break out of that tendency to want to write about your technical core because that's clearly what you think about day in day out until you break some of those habits having the skills to write good articles it might be one thing to have time and to know what writer to write about but can you write about it overall strategy and SEO getting people to read so pretty even spread other than that first one is finding the time so going to share with you some ways that you can address that and ways that we can help you with that as well so getting people to read your blog posts I did love that movie that that phrase what was called Field of Dreams the Kevin Costner baseball movie I've never played baseball but I seem to be a sucker for baseball movies and you know that line out of it where he kept hearing from the ghost our build it and they will come where he built that baseball field in his cornfield but sadly that's not the case with most things in life build it and they will come so with a blog post you need to promote it so you can't just put it up and I think job done in the same way that all websites life job done well no let's promote the blog post so whenever you do a blog post depending how frequently you're doing them if you're only doing what a month well then you can do an email out promoting that one or if you're doing 23 for a month you could do one email that's kind of summarizes them and links off to them we tend to recommend having the headline the image and the intro or a kind of an excerpt of what the article is about and a link through to the full article that way you can track what's called the click-through rate in the email tool that you're using such as MailChimp or or campaign monitor or whatever it is you might be using on that in that space so you need to promote them with email need to promote them via social media but here's an interesting statistic I think it's interesting I hope you will too when you first promote a blog post in social media let's say you do an update in LinkedIn say hey new blog post headline link or you do it out and Twitter Facebook page wherever if you do that just once the reach of the people that you're connected social media hubspot has calculated that that's about fourteen percent so one for fourteen percent so eighty-six percent of your social connections is a very good chance they won't see those social messages so it makes sense then to continue to promote evergreen posts at recurring intervals in social media and there are tools to do that we have a tool called paradox social that we is brand-new we give you access to that as part of our social media update service and it's got a really cool feature some apps do nothing but this feature but it's just one feature where you can log sorry load a social media promotion to go into LinkedIn or Twitter or whatever it might be and you can say repeat that one every seven weeks and without you having to lift a finger again it will do it again in seven weeks time and then another seven and you can say but stop doing it after a year or never stop doing it so it depends on the nature of the post so email social media at launch and social media ongoing and also promote your blog and your recent blog posts in email signatures if you're not using a tool like there's y stamp is one tool when you can manage all of your email signatures across your business from the one little console so with one step you can change everyone's email signatures all they need to do is like refresh their Gmail or their office 365 and you can promote the laser low post in everyone's email signature a lot of people will see that now planning your content you need to have a Content plan or editorial calendar don't get scared off by that it's just a list can be just a spreadsheet a Google sheet or something like that list out which topics you're going to write about you do have to have a whole years worth mapped out no but one or two is a good start you know when are you going to publish these things because you know certain things for example at the moment tax planning related topics this time of year quite good and who's going to write the topics if you're a firm with a number of people who could write share it around you know you might only need to write an article once a quarter but plan out in the your content plan who's going to write it and what's the objective of the article the objective isn't always a commercial call to action but it might be might be to get them to download something might be to get them to attend an event but sometimes it might be just to achieve a certain specific cognitive dissonance get them to think about a certain thing in their business or financial life think ahead what is the SEO phrase so three four five words that if you could wave your magic wand that this blog post will rank really well for in Google because that then affects words you'll use in the headline how you describe the images their subheadings things that you bowl or emphasize image ideas just in words you know image ideas any metaphors that you might think of that would be a cool image to support it but then who's going to edit and polish it you always need someone separate to the author to do that edit and polish you do need a separate workflow and lastly who's going to publish it who's going to load it up now if you're one person start up the good and the bad news is you've got clarity on that and the bad news is it's you but that's fine but as you grow you're going to want to delegate different aspects of that but the thing is it takes time now we've surveyed a lot of practitioners on how long does it take you and if you're working with another team member or two how long does it take you to actually do a blog post so if you think through these things from the top of the page the planning aspect you know thinking of an article topic writing so first draft polishing it because generally you need to sleep on it and come back and revisit it often and these opportunities to edit it down and make it stronger as a result then you need to think through a good headline it's crucial that it has a good headline as I covered earlier spend time on that then searching searching for a good you know image that will support the whole message of the blog post graphics if your blog post column is say 600 pixels wide marketing coordinators among you will know what I mean they're your blog post image should probably be the same full width depends on the design so you might download something from um splash common it might be this big you need it this big sometimes too you can put words over the top this little bit of work down there publishing loading it to the blog post in your website's content management system or CMS takes time you might think that only takes five minutes we know from a lot of experience that it often takes longer because there's looking at drafts looking at previous tweaking things then there's the promoting that we just mentioned promoting the blog post in social media and also email broadcast now if you add those up you might want argue the point on any of those but some might be more some might be less we've had some people say oh it takes me two days but half a day is the pretty much the average that we hear from people now who's opportunity cost is that if you're a principal or a partner in a firm I put in a very conservative hourly rate there many of you will have hundreds of dollars more per hour ly rate that you charge than 250 but at two hours at 250 s five hundred dollars opportunity costs that could be productive billable time not that you sell time but productive time leading to billing and let's say that half of that could have been done by a support team member who assists in the marketing side of the business and let's say their hourly rate is fifty dollars depending with your regional a city that will vary but let's say it's fifty dollars says 100 there's six hundred dollars of total opportunity cost per article so one article a month 602 articles a month twelve hundred and i know im talking two accountants here ah and it's the economists of finances who are more into opportunity cost but to me when you're in business opportunity cost is a very real cost and it's something that you can't ignore you need to take that into account pragmatically so with our blog article service you think through if all of that could just be done for you you know by someone who write most likely better articles then you're likely to create yourself and someone will handle all of the loading all of the promoting and the publishing for you without you having to lift a finger other than select which article you want so i'll give you some examples of firms that are using our blog article service I blurred details on these screenshots to protect the innocent but here's one heel and the topic I'll just read out the topics as we go why modern business means cloud-based business so educational article that talks not just about the accounting aspects but the whole benefits of being cloud based around added security less risk more efficiency and so that's something that we wrote and that we published and promoted for them another one here chameleon contractors when a contractor becomes an employee and a liability next business success in sight why your business needs a real-time dashboard so these are all about the principles that underpin things that the firm's that are accounting business advisory focused can then help the reader implement three reasons personal budgeting is brilliant not boring so firms that help clients around personal budgeting like those sorts of topics so with the blog article service yeah we think of the article topics and like a good DJ we take requests as well we love requests actually of the articles you would like added to the library we write the articles and we've got industry special specialist copywriters for each article we include three different headlines that can be chosen we create five different images for per article that you can choose one from but we'll actually load it for you to your website and will promote the blog post for you in social media so you'll get a better article and all you've had to do is basically go i'll have that article and if you ever pick an article you can always see a preview of the article before you choose it but you know we guarantee that every article you'll be wrapped with and if not you can pick another one there's many articles in the library so that saves you time in terms of the value proposition we're talking about the benefits of blogging today and those benefits are there but we price what we do so that it's as they call this there's a no brainer we want it to be a clear value proposition just on the time saving and that the fact that it's better quality more engaging more influential than what potentially you could write yourself is a bonus now people that subscribe to the service can also do their own blog posts as well in the mix and that makes them publishing a lot more often but greatly reduces the amount of time and labor to give you a heads up on the pricing on the blog article service you can do one two three or four a month most most firms do one or two a month so one article a month in aussie dollars excluding DST is four hundred fifty dollars a month so that's compared to six hundred dollars opportunity cost in that scenario earlier two articles a month is 750 a month for the two articles so what we'd like to do at the moment in the lead-up to the end of financial year and with the growing of our team we've got some available capacity but this offer requires work on our in so we're we are limiting it to only 12 firms so for those of you who are in this webinar are listening to me now when you email grow at practice paradox combo you will allow you will send you a link that will give you a sign up for the article service where you'll be able to sign up for two articles per month so that's the 750 dollar service for four hundred and fifty dollars a month but I do read a rate that is only for twelve firms and we have to stop it after that so that emails grow at practice paradox calm do you and being that time of year we do get asked can we pay in advance and is there any discount for that you probably notice that when you go to a lot of software as a service website very common option is you can pay monthly neck it's X or you can pay annually in advance and instead of paying for 12 months you only pay for 10 months well we offer the same thing so to recap that offer you can sign up for the four hundred and fifty dollar a month one article service but you get two articles for that so you pay for 50 month instead of 750 so that saves three hundred dollars a month so it's 3,600 I know you can do the maths but we'll just step through it but the additional savings if you did choose to pay annually in advance with the end of financial year watching that means you only pay for those 10 months but you get 12 months with a particle so 24 articles and that's 4,500 australian dollars plus GST up front if you're in another country clearly you don't pay our GST so it's four and a half australian pesos if you in the u.s. so that's a that's the offer for today on that let's now go to questions let's hear a hum haha I'm just looking through chat and I'll look through QA a great tackle of zero books and pull group you commented earlier that you love marketing automation and Greg's example I shared an example of Greg's in a recent webinar where Greg picked up a client that was the inquiry came from a CFO of an aviation company that had offices in about four or so different countries and they wanted to outsource their internal financial control and payroll and we do the blogging 40 books and assist pool group as well in a number of areas and yeah you're pretty happy with that one or a call great okay travis's asked is it possible to get a copy of today's webinar yes it is we will put a copy of this on to our youtube channel so it's youtube.com slash practice paradox when you go to our youtube channel click the little subscribe button the red and white button and that means you'll get notified when our new videos are uploaded so that's a yes Oh actually I can see Tiffany heir to that earlier there we go and we'll slides be available David's asked and we can make the slides available yes so that was on chat let's have a look on QA Sandeep asset an excellent question SEO will be affected if other accounts using the same article prepared by you there's a concept called duplicate content in SEO and what that means is if the same article appeared in many different places all over the web that would be bad thing so what we do when we load articles for you is we put a no index tag around it meaning that you won't be penalized for duplicate content if someone has the same article that's one of the reasons by the way we also include our three different headlines per standard article but we do have a service where we can do custom articles for you cus a little extra because it's extra work for us to write custom articles but that's the way that we avoid any penalties around the duplicate content but that's why it's also so important to do the social media promotion and the email newsletter promotion of your blog posts with those ok sandeep also asked which types of blogs are more interesting for prospects accounting tax SMSF compliance in general no unless you've got a non-obvious angle on it and you can write it in lay terms that would pique their interest cash flow and forecasting yes if you can talk about the pain they'll avoid and the gains they'll achieve general business how to hire talent and not just staff SEO marketing yes to that inspire CA who are doing great guns i'm loving watching what they're doing with their marketing they've been through our modern marketing academy we taught them the whole approach to content marketing and they've written articles that a whole bunch of articles that have nothing to do with compliance about you know sorts of clients you don't want in your business things relating to HR technology and they'll often publish things around marketing SEO website stuff and they get their clients to guest posts works well I know growth ways will often do case studies about their own clients in their Facebook page they also use Instagram really well but with a different strategy Elizabeth asks in relation to ditching what is your opinion on having one website so you're blue emerald for bookkeeping 0 setup and a second website for you personally Elizabeth SOUTHCOM for training courses ebooks etc do you think it's better to have them combined or to have them separate currently they're separate ok in life there's often it depends answers I'll give you it depends if you publish consistently to both blogs it's good to have them separately you can have your business brand with very specific SEO focus and that also allowed allows you to build up a digital asset that can appear on your balance sheet and will increase the value of your business when it comes time to sell so it's good to have a separate business one but these days there's an excellent platform while we love WordPress we think it's great a medium calm is a brilliant platform for personal blogging and so if you're going to do a personal blog if you've already got it set up on WordPress that's fine but medium is a great way because you get a lot more traffic a lot more people will discover your personal blog on medium or potentially even in linkedin com as long posts so if you're doing enough publishing separates fine if you hardly ever publishing to each I'd combine them and get traction with one block and then Sandeep says thank you so much for helping us absolute pleasure thanks so much for joining us today hopefully you've learned why should blog some of the mistakes around blogging and how that
