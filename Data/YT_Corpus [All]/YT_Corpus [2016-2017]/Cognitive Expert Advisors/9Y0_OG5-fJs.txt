 okay hello there everyone and welcome to our University Business web seminar today it's great to have you all with us my name is Curtis udderly I'm the magazine's web seminar editor and I'll be your moderator the title of our event as you see here is driving student success with predictive analytics and is being brought to you free of charge through the generous support of our sponsor for today Jenzabar first as people are still coming in I'll start with a bit of a background about our topic for today predictive modeling seeks to answer the question of why students persist by discovering hidden relationships in data by leveraging a clear picture of past and present behavior predictive modeling uses statistical analysis to generate a confident simulation of future behavior institutions can then use that insight to positively impact student trajectories and influence outcomes today we'll be learning how to drive student success with predictive analytics from an administrator at Crown College in Minnesota who will share the predictive model they have developed to identify at-risk students as well as describe the communication flow and intervention intervention process that leverage the information discovered from the model looking forward to a very interesting presentation and discussion as well as live Q&A here so do stay tuned we're going to get started in just a minute or two but before we do just some quick housekeeping here for you just in case you're having any trouble listening through your computer speakers or if you prefer to listen over the telephone you may have

colleagues but I'll tell you more about that a little bit later on so with that on to our program here today we're fortunate to have with us Patti Pitts she is director of academic programs at Crown College in Minnesota also with us is Meghan Turgeon akashi is product manager of student success solutions at Jenzabar Meghan is going to start us off here with an introduction to our topic and so with that I'll turn it over to her Meghan it's great to have you with us here today welcome to today's web seminar thanks Kurt thanks for the introduction hi everybody like Kurt says i'm meghan torjussen the product manager for student success solutions at Jenzabar and today we're here to talk to you as Kurt introduced the idea of predictive modeling for student success and what that means and we're very pleased to be able to have patty she is one of our clients talk about what they've been able to do at Crown College to make a difference in their student success efforts on their campus so here's agenda for today really briefly I'm going to go over what we're talking about when we're talking about predictive success because she's me predictive modeling and predictive analytics because that definition seems to vary all over the place so we're going to talk about what what we're referencing in this presentation and then I'm going to hand it over to crown to Patty and let her talk about their student success philosophy and strategy crowns particular predictive model how they've been able to leverage the data the results and outcomes they have and then their future plans in the end we'll wrap it up with some pointers on how to start small make an impact and grow your efforts and then we'll finish with a question and answer session right so predictive modeling for Student Success what are we talking about here one thing that's really important is that when we're speaking of predictive analytics and predictive modeling at Jenzabar we are talking about custom predictive models so that means for every client that we work with we look at their data so your data particularly and don't try to assign data to groups or categories don't try and say this algorithm is going to predictive for every institution it's really important to us we say that you have incredibly rich data and some of its very specific to your institution and sometimes the results we get out of these models can be very very supportive surprising at some institutions disciplinary factors end up being a positive for whether or not students there go there are always these little nuggets that are so specific to an institution that probably wouldn't necessarily make a model that was built off a general algorithm we also are really intentional and targeted in when when we are creating these models you pay pay attention to cohort size so that means that we're looking for a group on your campus when we're going to model for Student Success purposes looking for a group that is large enough to have an impact but not so large that you won't have the resources to address that information that you've gained because this is all about not just telling you who's going to be at risk that's great that's wonderful information but making sure that you have the boots on the ground that you have the feet ready to move and support those students then also the type of cohort paying attention to you know is it really important for you to focus on your first-year students or potentially for your institution it's much more important to look at your adult IDI or some other cohort of students and that's where you really ought to start it's important to note that we don't just do one model that's just where most institution starts is with one but it's really important that when we're creating these models and working with you on that process that we have a very narrow focus and making sure that you get some of the biggest bang out of your efforts then what are the process of predictive analytics predictive modeling what do we do well you are developing predictive model with you we look at data and institutions are all over the place in where they are in understanding risk for their students at their institutions you know we have some institutions that have already started to build their own models and we have other institutions that only really have anecdotal stories about why students are at risk and so we work with this wide variety and what we do is we look for correlations initially between okay what factors on your campus end up correlating with the desired outcome of retention or progression or what have you and from there once we know those most predictive factors we put them together and we do a logistic regression and what's really neat about logistic regression it's much more than just a you know being a first generation student correlates with retention or departure it actually looks at the interplay of all the factors so that the sum of all the factors ends up being much greater than the whole so the individual parts themselves are predictive but when we put them all together you get a much stronger prediction out of them from this logistical regression model what we find out is a retention score for each of the students and that's from 0 to 100 euro B not retained 100 being retained and that information in and of itself is really useful but it's hard to take that information understand what to do with it so we help you break those groups down into thresholds so you're able to work with those individual groups we have three thresholds and Patti is going to talk about all this I want to set the stage for it we have these quote/unquote safe category the green and then we also have the at risk and high risk categories the idea is that by creating these different categories these thresholds for risk you're then able to identify students who are you are going to be able to work with in a proactive manner which is the entire point of what we're doing we're trying to give you information then you can take action on you create a communication plan for just like pi is going to talk about with what they've done and you really see some positive impact in your student success on your campus so with no further ado I'm going to hand over to Patty there you go padlock them thanks again I appreciate it yes my name is patty I am the director of academic programs on our campus so I do a lot of initiatives that come out of the academic office academic affairs area and one of those areas is retention just a teeny bit about Kron College we're located just west of the Twin Cities Minneapolis area we're a four-year private college about 1,300 students we have about 40 accredited majors were credited by the HLC and we have really put some intentionality into retention and were thrilled with the relationship that we've been able to build with Jenzabar so with that we'll get going kind of our background how did we get to where we started using predictive and we'll actually even talk about reactive modeling as well but we a number of years ago I want to say it was about 2009 it might have been right around that time our President's Council identified that our retention rates just really weren't where we wanted them to be and no one really at that time owned retention it was kind of everyone's responsibility but no one really took ownership of it and so the President's Council I said retention really needs to lie in academics and so my direct report my supervisor took on retention and started putting some intentionality into what retention looks like for Chrome College a retention committee was formed we actually created a partnership or we sought out a consultant that we worked with and we felt like it was very expensive and a lot of money with we didn't totally see the the benefit of that but we did put some intentionality into thinking about retention we created an early alert system that actually was pretty much hated by our faculty they felt they would submit an alert and no one would really know about it and so they kind of got some point well why submit this because nobody responds to it and so they kind of quit using it we didn't know that we were we thought we were but we weren't sure we were targeting the right students we really didn't have the ability to analyze the data to actually say you are the efforts that we're putting into this model or this we didn't call it a model at that time an early alert system wasn't actually working we really didn't have any ability to do that so in 2013 I was brought into the picture and I really was charged with putting even more intentionality into what retention was going to look like and what those efforts were going to look like for Kron College and we started our partnership then with talking with Jenzabar about their their modeling system and we we did a pretty extensive research of a number of vendors and landed with Jenzabar for a number of reasons but one was the assistance that we were going to get with the whole setup and the ongoing support we liked their early alert system we liked the predictive and reactive modeling that we got out of the system so and then the other reason real strong reason was that were part of a Chelsea and we applied to the persistence and completion Academy through the HLC and we're actually accepted in April last year we applied in April got accepted in the summer and began kind of our first year journey with the persistence and completion Academy with the HLC our partnership with Jenzabar said right into that and we were able to use all of the data that we worked with with our consultant last summer to really put some intentionality into what we were going to do with retention on our campus so we felt like that was a great partnership for us so we worked with Jen's bar consultant last last summer spring and some they actually came to campus in April and then we worked with them all summer to create a freshman retention model that's actually what we call it we call it our freshman retention model we did the the model on our freshman cohort so that's the cohort we decided that we were going to put intention ality in because our retention of our freshman fall to fall is our lowest group and so I think it is across most campuses but that was where we wanted to really make sure that we were putting intentionality into so um all summer we collected data that was a process but it was actually a good process our consultant worked with us hands-on and and we were really able to feel like we we have some good data to look at and we actually were able to get six years of data and we determined that we have nine factors that make a student at risk for Chrome College and as Megan said when she introduced the presentation these really are unique to chrome College I'm sure that there are many of these that are common among campuses but we really looked at what made a student at risk at Chrome and these are students obviously that are not on campus yet so this is our freshman cohort they aren't here yet and so some of those things were gender our females obviously retained at a higher rate than our males unmet need our students with a high need did not retain as well as those with with not I need distance from home this was actually interesting our students really close to our campus I don't know the boundaries off the top of my head but I do know that the students who lived within a really close distance the campus actually retains less been students who were in a 100 to 300 mile range so and then also our students who lived on long distance from home retained at a lower rate the fourth one is Department this was an interesting one and that was our students in our Bible and theology and ministry Studies department retained as much I won't say much tire but at a higher rate than any other department on our campus and that probably goes along with the mission of our College and that that's a strong focus and so that's the type of student that we probably attract and retain at a higher rate our FAFSA date so students that submitted their FAFSA a lot later tend to retain at lower late rate high school type private public and homeschool deposit date you know the later they deposited the higher the chance that they weren't going to retain high school GPA and then ethnicity so all those wrap together as Megan said did give us a retention rate for each of those students in that freshman model and as Megan said they're in three categories they're in the high-risk category or the at-risk category the high-risk category in the safe and what was really kind of a aha moment for us I guess was in August I think I remember it was like uh between the 15th and the start of the school semester when we were thinking okay we're going to roll this out to our freshmen our consultant ran a model verification on our freshman cohort from 2014 so he actually ran the data that we had collected for our fall 15 cohort and ran it against our fall 14 and he identified that there were thirty three percent of our students that fell into that high-risk category the alarming was 100 percent of those students were not back they did not come back for the fall of 2015 so we felt like our data gave us some really rich information that if we could somehow intervene on behalf of these high-risk students we potentially could retain some of them so that was our strategy so our retention rates are higher than the national average for four-year private schools but they're certainly not where we want them to be and we as ice this really came out of an initiative from the President's Council now president's cabinet and so some of the things that we did is we created a persistence and completion team persistence being you know retention and completion being graduation a team that was really focused includes our athletic director the director of our study lab Student Development our enrollment director myself so it's a a faculty member so it's a rich group of people across the entire campus that are going to put some intentionality into are we putting the strategies together to really target these at-risk and high-risk students we did some really intentional training with our faculty and staff across all of our across our entire campus I was able to spend an entire morning so three or four hours with our faculty talking about retention talking about the value of predictive and reactive modeling training them how to actually use the system helping them wrap their minds around the value of submitting alerts and following up on lurtz and we really wanted them to know that they had a research a resource they had a quick way that they could notify us if a student student seemed to be in trouble so that we could intervene and hopefully keep the student on campus so kind of our tagline was that we this goes along all with our mission statement and kind of how we named our our gems of our products but we basically want to provide the tools and support for our students so that they can run the race persist and finish the course or complete their program of study and graduate or for those students who are here for two years given a a degree so again they're basically a reactive model and a predictive model and Megan talked a little bit about the predictive I want to just talk a minute about the reactive model because this was a huge part of our work with Jenzabar as well basically what we laid the expectation that we expected our faculty and staff to submit alerts we told them we wanted them to notice students engage with students and submit alerts on students and what I kept saying over and over all in the training and I have throughout the entire semester is that if we do nothing different than what we have done in the past we will retain at the same rate we've been retaining for the past ten years but we have to we have to stop and we have to do something different than what we've done in the past and the reactive model and the predictive model that we've been able to work with Jenzabar on has given us the tools to be able to do that so again we challenge people to notice students to engage with students and then submit alerts and we gave them four eighth we said submit alerts on assignments so if a student is missing a number of assignments in a row or throughout the semester where now it's becoming a problem and it's starting to drastically or negatively affect their grade submit an alert we said submit alert for attendance we basically put the guideline that if a student has missed more than one week of class unanswered for no reason submit an alert assessment we asked our professors to submit alerts on any student when their assessment in the class is dropping if they were an A student and they're dropping into the C range they're B student and now they're down in the DNF range or any student that drops down in the DNF range for our nursing and teacher ed courses maybe it's even the C range because their standards they have to have a C or higher for the course to count towards their major so assessment and the third the fourth one is attitude and this was basically a change in a student so the student was real bubbly and outgoing in the beginning of the semester and now they're just flat and they're not engaged they're coming to class but they are really not there that's a change and somebody should know about it so talk to the student but submit an alert on them as well to get somebody else involved so our alerts for the fall we were really pleased with they were great we had a over a thousand alerts submitted and if you remember we're a fairly small campus so people were submitting alerts on lots of different things and of those a thousand alerts we had over 850 of them resolved what that means is 850 of them somebody intervened and the and somehow it was taken care of whether it was a conversation with a student and the student got back on track or a conversation with a student and the student said they were going to get back on track somehow the alert was addressed by somebody with the student and it was resolved of those a thousand alerts 700 about 700 of them were submitted by staff so that includes me as a retention coordinator I kind of fall between faculty and staff and some roles but coaches mentors our student development staff something going on our billing office our chaplains office those 700 and then we had almost 200 of them submitted by our faculty so that means 200 issues with students that maybe wouldn't have ever been told before that somebody was able to intervene on behalf of the student so then the next as Megan talked about is the predictive model and this was we took that six years of data and we ran it against our freshman cohort and we identified that we had 7% of our students in the high-risk category so students who if we didn't do anything aren't going to come back and then we have 31% in the at-risk category so this is their rate was high but not extremely high and then we have 61% of students that were safe so what did we do with those high-risk at-risk and safe students basically we at the beginning in the year I sent out an alert on every single student that was high risk and at-risk and I sent it out number one to their advisor and I asked for their advisor to follow up with them and have a connection with them within the first three weeks of the semester certainly they were not going to have a conversation such as I understand you're at high risk at the college and so I want to talk to you about that we wouldn't do that but what they would do is say you know I'm your advisor and I want to make sure I have the opportunity to meet you so that if you have any problems you know where I am and you know who you can connect with so it is an early and ongoing connection with a student that potentially could be at risk for leaving your institution our institution we encourage the I also copied if I knew if a student had a mentor three weeks into the semester they usually don't so we also sent it to all the coaches so if a student was an athlete I sent the high alert and at-risk alert to the coaches and asked the coaches or informed the coaches that they were an at risk or high risk student and made sure the coaches put a little more intentionality into connecting with those students because a lot of times as a freshman that maybe don't know the head coach as well as the upperclassmen we also for international students we involved the person that connects with them on campus to make sure she knew that those students were identified as at risk and high risk we encouraged the advisors the mentors the coaches and the international advisor the RDS to meet with the students on a regular basis and develop a relationship with these students because if they can develop a relationship with them the chance of keeping them here increases we also also shared the high rare scan at-risk students names which are very easy to find in the in the system with the department chairs and encourage the department chairs to engage those students some way in the department so if they had a department meeting to make sure that those high-risk and at-risk students maybe got their own invitation or a number of things and that is something that we're going to continue to improve upon in this ex year we certainly did not do everything right so the other thing that we did was we identify transitional students and we get we provide traditional student assistance these are students that are identified throughout the whole enrollment process so we actually have started to identify them for the fall of 16 you know already in January February March and and now in April and these are students that may fall a little bit below our entrance requirements but we feel like they with some assistance would be able to persist well we identified transitional students last year and ran them of those transitional students that were part of the freshman cohort and modeled by the Jenzabar process they were identified at high risk and at-risk so we're actually really excited about that because we said these are definitely students that according to our model are at-risk and according to our admission standards are at risk and we put some real intentionality into intentional advising pre semester meetings setting an academic plan with them weekly meetings with the director of our study lab encouraged or required them not to take more than 15 credits in the semester minimal co-curricular involvement we certainly wanted them involved but not over involved we wanted them involved in their athletic you know if they were on an athletic team we don't want to take that away from them but not overly involved and then we and we required them to have a study lab requirement which is really a tutoring center we have success with them in the fall we had a number of them that actually moved out of transitional status those were at risk and high risk students that we felt really we're doing well enough that they didn't need that weekly monitoring but we did feel like we need a little more intentionality with them weekly so I've actually started meeting with them instead of the director of the study lab and I do have weekly meetings with them as a group and it's really a kind of a cohort mentality of we really want you here in the fall what can we do to help to help you come back in the fall so it's it's been it's been great to work with these kids and yet frustrating with some one of them decides not to come back so so historically our data from fall semester to spring semester historically we retain about 91% of our students that wasn't high enough for us this past fall to spring we actually it actually went up to 94% so we feel like wow some of our intentionality is working I think Jenzabar alert system the reactive and the predictive modeling have been a key factor in our retention rates quite out certainly we have to continue to analyze data we cannot say that you know our retention rates are going up off of one year one semester worth of data we will continue to analyze that but we haven't been intentional about putting focus into reactive and predictive modeling and I someone just asked what what do you use for safley in fact faculty to submit alerts it's the Jemez of our retention the reactive modeling that is where our faculty can submit these alerts so it's it's a great system we provide students with the support tool they need to succeed or we hope we do so the next slide is is really going to kind of show our let me see that I do that right yeah the next slide is going to show our kind of where our students fell so fifty-eight percent of our student body our entire student body not just our freshman cohort received at least one alert and we feel really good about that I feel really good about that because our students are getting noticed people are interacting with them and people are getting others involved in things that students might be challenged with when we looked at our students that came back for the spring seventy percent of our at-risk students retained if you if you contrast that to our at-risk students from the fall of 14 100 % of them left so 70% of them retained is a huge improvement our our high-risk students with lower it was only 54% of those students retained still a good number but not high enough and then 85% of our safe students retained some reflections on that is we sent a higher number of alerts on our at-risk students is that why 70% of them retained and only 54% of our at-risk students retained I don't think one semester of data confirms that but it certainly begs the question didn't we retain these students at a higher rate because of the alerts that were sent out on them and the alerts that people were able to follow up on so we'll continue to evaluate the strategies that we're putting into trying to keep our our high alert student students as well as not losing our app arrest students so this this slide and these numbers are probably what I'm most excited about and that is that students who did not come back for the spring were I is not because we did not make an effort to keep them certainly we're not going to keep all students on campus not everybody is a fit for crown we don't necessarily have all the majors that that some students want students leave for various number of reasons but ninety-three percent of the students who did not come back and received at least one alert the average number of alerts that went out on students who didn't come back was five point one so five alerts on a student who didn't come back what does that mean that means we really put an effort in to students who did not return doesn't mean our efforts didn't pay off I don't think so our retention did go up certainly it's one semester of data we'll continue to analyze it but we identified the non returners and we tried to provide them with the tools and support they need it so students didn't just walk out of our I think I can confidently say that students did not just walk out of our institution without someone trying to intervene to help them we didn't have a lot of surprises when I did the final analysis on the students that left I was aware of most of the students and directly aware of why they left and so I didn't feel like we you know there were a lot of things that went unnoticed or went unaddressed so yes we will continue to analyze the data that we get out of Jenzabar you get some really rich data on you know how many alerts were closed how many interventions were done how many follow-ups were done who closed their alerts who didn't I mean you just get some really rich data that can really help you strengthen your processes so we know we have to put some more intentionality into our high-risk students not at the risk of losing our at-risk students but we're talking about things like peer mentoring so students that have been successful with the transition program bringing them back in and having them - brand-new students and and help with that getting our Ras involved in the high-risk and at-risk students earlier in the semester I think we need to improve there we do require midterm advising but but make sure our higher high-risk and at-risk students are part of that midterm advising require the advisors to check in with them one or two times during the semester I'm not sure we followed up on that as well as we could have and then just hopefully work with departments to see how they can engage those risk students because we know that we retained 85% of our safe students it's our at-risk students that we lose and I think our predictive and al predictive modeling showed us the students that we lost or that are at that are at risk so we certainly have plans to reevaluate what we're doing for 1617 our persistent completion team will actually begin to meet again this spring and really put some intentionality and to do we need to make some changes for 1617 but we've been very pleased with the partnership we have with Jenzabar and the ability to use the predictive and reactive modeling so I'm going to turn it back to Megan all right thanks Patti you see here yeah that was great and love hearing the details of your program of course very very exciting so just to wrap it up here what's really interesting about the story that Patti tells about what they've been doing it at crown is where they started you know they've done they did some work beforehand and they had they had done some preliminary ground work and then they were looking for solution to help them to the next level so that's great we were ready to help them there we were ready to meet them where they're at and help them develop these models these workflows and communication strategies and really implement them I also want to make it clear though that you don't have to have as much done as did ahead of time we have a lot of institutions that we start with but like I said before really only have a antidotal beliefs about what what makes a student at risk in fact I used to actually work for client institution in my institution had a lot of anecdotes and not as much data yet when we implemented this product years ago and it's a pretty common thing but what you're able to do through this process that we work with you on is we're able to help you identify what factors are really predictive and work from there in fact we can help you with everything from the workflow how do you work with students who are at risk and communication plans to building that model there's a wide variety of ways that we can meet you where you're out where you're at and help you take it to the next level one thing that I absolutely love about what they're doing at crown and something that we try and stress to all of our clients is the importance of employing the cycle of assessment so you can see that patty has done a lot of work with not only you know working with students and trying to shore them up in a variety of different ways but then she's also pulling that information on the back end and saying okay what worked what didn't work and there's that importance in the cycle of assessment of being able to just really dig into ok this is our goal we're trying to retain students what steps we take in how does it work for these different categories of students and they're going to turn around and next year they're going to implement some more changes that are probably going to yield you know even more positive results for them and that's such an important and crucial thing to do with student success our most successful campuses always employ the cycle of assessment I did really briefly just want to go over you know we've done many many predictive models we recently did just a quick study of the models we've developed and we always get this question so I thought you might be curious about it the question is what are the most common factors if you guys don't use an algorithm if you don't have something done ahead of time what do you often see is making it into these models in recent years we've seen financial be a bigger player so we see a lot of unmet need being really important deposit date interval is one that's been coming is are actually third most common factor but we also have it in that in that list of ten top ten factors five of them are all financial related which is really interesting that's playing such a major role obviously and that's when you even hear when you speak with different institutions that they know that the big reason why their students are leaving its financial so whether it's that you know the parents were denied a PLUS loan or their EFC to merit knee differential is too high they just can't make it there are a lot of financial reasons why people don't make it then there's also also things like ethnic group college major high school GPA is still very predictive for a lot of campuses gender just like you saw with crown and a surprising one that is a positive predictor on a lot of campuses is of course Greek life it's not that surprising but can be surprising alright moving forward here last slide so I mentioned that we can meet you where you're at and what am I talking about by that Jenzabar Student Success Solutions has a host of products and services that are designed to really work with institutions wherever they might be in this process of seeing their students more successful at one end of this beautiful rainbow we have right here you see Jenzabar retention early alert so that reactive modelling that had was talking about that war slow process that's a big part of what gems are attention early alert is it's all about getting the right resources to the right student at the right time and then eliminating the grunt work we also have the gems of our Student Success survey which is a non cognitive survey element that's very brief powerful and efficient and it's huge for helping you would give tools to your advisers and different people on your campus so they're able to have really great conversations with students whether they're entering students or students who've been around for a while the gems of our appointments to help you make it easy for your students to sign up for appointments with you and then of course there is the full suite of gems for retention that crown has and that doesn't include the predictive modeling as well as in those those workflow components to help you make sure that your students have the right resources so that they're as successful as possible I've already seen that we've got some really great questions so I'm going to hand it back to Kurt to moderate here and hopefully we can get some good answers to them okay absolutely thank you so much Megan and Thank You Patti yes we're going to get to your questions here first a couple reminders I know there was a lot of great ground covered there we're getting some comments and questions here asking about accessing the slides as well as the archived recording and just a quick reminder everybody who registered here yes you will be getting follow-up email with links to where you can access the slides and yes this is being recorded it will be archived on the UB site and you'll be able to access that you'll see that referenced in that email as well so don't worry about that another reminder here if you do in question please enter in the Q&A box they're not in the chat window but in the Q&A bottom right-hand corner there and we're getting a whole lot of great questions here we're going to try to answer as many as we can here let's see first one might go to you patty with let's seeds there are several related questions here about your different threshold points someone asks here how are you determined determining the thresholds for in the logistic regression model are the generic cut points at 50% 80% 90% etc are using confidence intervals to create this separation is that make sense Patti it does make sense and Megan may have to jump in and help as well when we did built our model in obviously in the in August we I think we did just use a set one that Jenzabar identified as to who would be in the at-risk high-risk and safe but we talked with our consultant at length about really identifying where those cutoff points were and because we were just wrapping our mind around how to use the predictive analysis to influence retention on our campus we went ahead and went with the cutoff points that our consultant suggested for us as we analyzed the data this summer we may change that and may have different cutoff points does that answer your question that make sense okay I think so it Megan anything to add there yeah I was going to say that was beautiful generally speaking we recommend one standard deviation above and below the mean for the cutoff points but it is a consultative process just like patty said so for some campus they actually want to look at okay so how big of a high risk category can we have is we're going to work with them in this specific way so they might consider it in terms of resources and might set the thresholds based on that okay excellent thank you both and related question or questions for you patty there were several people were asking about the how you differentiate between high risk and at-risk categories several people asking in different ways there what's the cutoff what's the difference between those groups could you touch on that again well and again Megan can clarify because she actually talked about it in her introductory slide but each is given an actual score so we identified nine elements that make a student at risk at Crown College based on our six years of data and those nine factors all rolled together and I think it's logistical regression give each student a score and then those scores ranked from 0 to 100 and as Megan said zero is the student is you know at risk for good job retention for not coming back and 100% is they're not at risk they're going to come back and then in that we just identified which of those were at risk and which were high risk now obviously a student who's at you know right at the line could jump over between high risk and at risk the the really the biggest thing is the score they have Megan did that kind of answerís yeah it's absolutely determined by the student's score and then you divide them into discrete categories by you know those score groups yep okay okay great a questionnaire from somebody from a different kind of institution it sounds like so maybe go to Megan for this one it says I'm I work with adult students that come within with various levels of college credit and life experience can cohorts and data be gathered for this group as well so Meghan can you do this kind of thing with a different type of student population absolutely and that's one of the things about predictive analytics and doing it this way that's so important is that adult education is a really great example where a cookie cutter model probably not going to fit even when we go from campus to campus and we're meeting with different adult education programs we see that there are lots of different ways of doing it and even the student population is very so greatly in preparedness college course level so yeah we would probably look at things like okay how much college coursework do they have when was the last time they were enrolled in school how many previous institutions do they have you know there's all sorts of questions that would be different questions we'd work through with you on that absolutely okay great great thank you let's see Patti I think you addressed this question during your presentation someone asked about how the alerts are sent out and you talked about that being through the Jenzabar system so somebody follows up here saying how is the the data then entered for those alerts is that entered into Jenzabar how does that work good question I'm going to kind of do the kind of the logistical piece of how an alert is submitted and then I'm going to hand it over to Meghan to kind of talk about the data piece but basically when we worked with our consultant and setting up our whole system we got to speak in to where we wanted someone to be able to submit an alert and so we put literally a submit an early alert button on our home home page not the home page that the internet the internal home page so when a faculty or staff member logs into our site and ours is called our crown when they log into our crown this early alert button is right there it's a triangle it's a caution kind of symbol and it says submit an early alert they click on that and it literally is a form of about four or five questions very easy to use they don't necessarily have to write anything if they don't want they click the student's name they click what the alert is about we have a number of concern types from academics to student development issues to we just add an alert the spring that student is talking about not coming back to crown they click on the alert type I'm sorry concern type they choose from a drop-down menu of a number of reasons why they would submit that alert and then they hit submit autumn we we set up we determine it based with the work that we did with our consultant we determined who automatically gets that alert so we automatically send any academic alert to our advisors and that prevents me having to go into the system and then forward it to somebody and have there be a delay so instantaneously the advisor is notified the student is struggling academically but there are other alerts that we don't send to anybody and they come through the retention office to be read to determine who needs to see that because if it's going to learn about a student behavior or something like that we don't want it going to a broad audience but I'm going to actually turn that over to Megan and Megan can you talk a little bit about how the data comes out of it I work with our IT person to pull it out so I don't know that I necessarily have the knowledge there but I'll turn it over to you absolutely so you did a good job of describing the basics which is that those different fields on the form or what drives the intervention process for the campus so based on concern type and then also one of the things that we asked submitters to rank is severity so they found concern type and severity different people are set up to be notified about different concerns as they come through so a really classic example of this is that for instance financial concerns you know may only go to a financial aid person to review and then on the back end there's a great we provide a reporting package so that you're able to dig into the details of okay what concern types are really are submitted more often who is submitting them what's the severity and then also what's the outcome of all these alerts that have been submitted so that information is all tracked so you're able to turn around take that information and apply it to your business process the next year saying oh we see a lot of this type of alert just about midterm let's ramp up our efforts around midterm make sure we have more of a certain type of support person ready to deal with these particular issues okay okay great great thank you both ah let's see another one for you patty uh just as where there are other changes to your entering cohort cohort from 2014 to 2015 such as they may have had a higher GPA were they less diverse things like that do you know about perhaps other factors that that played into it seems like they're asking about the chance to change in your retention rate right what I said during my presentation was that we developed a model we ran it against our 2014 class and none of those students were back in 2015 they were identified by the model as high-risk and they didn't come back and I believe the the person is asking could there have been other factors as to why those students didn't come back and certainly there could have been and and did I did we do the deep dive to determine if those students that were identified at higher risk have a lower GPA and were they you know yeah did we do that deep dive we did not we did not we decided at that point that we were going to move forward and try and you know leverage the model that we did build and see if we could put strategies around the students that were here and we may do some of that analytics this summer you know when our students aren't here and we can actually take the time to do that and see if if the model is working like we think it is okay sure thank you someone else asking about your retention numbers there they say your numbers are a bit confusing you stays on that one of the slides there that you retain 94% of all students but then you had another slide referencing 58 70 and 85 percent oh yeah can you explain that I think is that those are very specific groups and the 94 percent is your overall is that right correct our 94 percent is we had an eligible number of students that were able to return so you take out the graduates and take out the students that may have been suspended or withdrew during the semester so in Alyssa you know eligible pool of students and out of that eligible pool of students 94% of them came back but when I gave the numbers about 70% 50 I think it was 54% and 85% that was just our freshman cohort that were modeled by Jen's VARs retention predictive analysis so of those students that were modeled 70% of the at-risk came back and fifty some percent of the high-risk students came back so that was not the overall number so does that clarify it okay yeah I think so so alright great let's see another one ask you does your analytics indicate which specific interventions were most effective at increasing probability of retention is that also part of it penny it will be if unfortunately you know you pull the data I mean we couldn't pull the data obviously until students came back for the spring and then you're already hitting the ground running with trying to put interventions into the students that are here so that is the deep dive that we want to do this summer is to say what what really worked at keeping these students here and I'm like I said this is one semester of data so for us to say this is perfect and it's working and everything we're doing is great it is foolish we will take a look the other thing that is really nice about the system is that it tracks interventions so you send out alert it tell it you can track how many times people did something about that alert and we'll we'll do a deep dive into what were those interventions what what did people do with those students to help them and and will will take the time this summer to do some of that analytic work we just didn't have time to do it between semesters okay sure thank you uh patty you you mentioned a number of factors that you found are our predictive of retention someone asks what about work status do you find student's work status is predictive in any way yes we do there are a number of factors that we determined even with data that make a student at risk once they're here but remember this model that we built and you can build different models with Jenzabar but the model that we built was based on our freshman cohort so our students that weren't yet were not yet on campus so they didn't have jobs they weren't attending Chapel they weren't involved on campus so those factors didn't play into this model does that make sense okay yeah I think so great you also mentioned uh intentional training someone asked here about that can you talk a bit more about those faculty and staff intentional trainings how in-depth are they yes like I said I I have the support of administration academic administration to really put some intentionality into retention so we we had you know two or three hours with our faculty that we were able to take them in very small groups twenty to twenty-five at a time in the computer lab literally talking about the reason that we want to do predictive and reactive modeling the reason that we felt like the early in' alert system was worth their investment the benefit that we thought they'd get out of it and and then just literally hands on how do you submit one how do you follow up on one how do you close one out all the logistics that go in with the early alert system and and then I was able to train small groups of staff and staff members around campus as well because there didn't there wasn't time to really pull the entire staff to so we did small group trainings with the different departments of staff on on campus so we will continue to do it again in the fall we'll do a refresher with the faculty will do time with the new faculty and then will be even more intentional with our staff cook that isn't it great great I think so thank you uh we're at the top of the hour here but maybe ask you one more here let's say patty this person asks when you share the at-risk lists with advisors or others do you share the factors that contributed to students being on that list for example if it's financial needs or social fit to share that with advisors do you keep some of that information private or do you let advisers and others know that information patty that is a great question and actually was discussed and debated quite a bit by our persistence and completion team and we did not share the factors with our advisors I'm sorry we did not share the factors with our department chairs or their advisors for the reason that we did not want them doing the analytics on it because that is not really where we wanted them spending their time we purchased worked with the consultant pulled out six years of data believed that we have a model that right now is working we certainly are going to have to analyze this model each year that we roll it out and that's what our summer work is going to be and we did not want our staff and faculty analyzing the factors and saying well you know I'm not sure this person is as a higher-risk as you think they are and that was really not where we wanted them spending their time well we wanted them doing was building relationships um working with the students on things that will keep them coming back to the campus not analyzing why they might be walking out the door so I hope that helps but it definitely a conversation that we had on campus okay sure sure very very interesting thank you so much well we are out of time here unfortunately we're going to have to wrap it up here on behalf of university business I'd like to thank our speakers once again
