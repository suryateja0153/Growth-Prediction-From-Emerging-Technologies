 the couple of lovely stories I'd like to read from this book for you with yourselves if that's all right this is a this is an Australian and Chinese so this is an Australian professional speaker who goes about delivering keynote speeches all over the world and it's quite similar to what happens in customers what happens in lost in translation so after one such presentation the Australian learned that the Chinese interpreters version of his opening remarks waited something like this the highly respected media expert is beginning his speech with a thing called a joke this is in China right I'm not sure why but many Australians believe it is necessary to start a speech with a joke pause he's telling a joke now pause but frankly would not understand this joke so I will not translate it he thinks I'm telling you the joke now the polite thing to do when efficient finishes is to laugh pause is getting close pause esteemed speaker has just told the joke laughs now so the audience not really loved appreciatively but stood and applauded as well when the Australian later commented to the translator saying I've been giving speeches for years and you are the first translator who knows how to tell a good joke she retorted and said your joke was rather rude plus I do not think the Chinese audience would have understood it so I just told them to laugh at the appropriate point this we the Australian went in there thinking if I deliver if I start with a joke he took the parameters that work for him in the Western culture to some drum Eastern culture and family just at work so cultural awareness is very important yes so let's have a look at these biases they have these aspects that affect our listening is everybody with me yeah please shout if you're not please make comments I really would appreciate it so let's have a look advisors and before we do that and I just said we're going to look at examples of this the first one by the way each virus is connected to the other and there's millions of them out there people have made it their life's business romantical cognitive biases lots of groups are supposed to google you'll find lots of information the first one man that will address is confirmation bias what do you think that means what do you think that confirmation bias means agreeing or disagreeing with something based on your perception you're hauling instance agreeing or the city it's slightly different slightly different current and I guess it's about what you agree is no agreement doesn't come in the end this is basically seeing what you want to see in same hearing what you want to hear it's overly paying attention to things that match your beliefs yeah give in a situation you're only listening for what matches your beliefs can you think of situation like this particularly at work football what about people go on very kind in the day of the match I probably just stopped in between getting off the bus came back home and talk about dinner with the family everything else in between are just switched option that's that's confirmation about you by a red card if I you see around is red yeah any others any other examples because this is this we have to nail this one guys because this is what stops us from being effective engages because this is a dangerous thing doctors through this all the time they misdiagnosed you come in with the temperature you come in with body aches nothing take some ibuprofen and go away the underlying thing could be as bad as cancer but they just put two and two together to make five sometimes it is full so think of situations right now right here where you might have experienced this you'll produce a road plate of it but this is dangerous because you often come to the wrong decision because you've just ignored the most part even thing there is it was just so focused and only listening a funny story a few years ago I went on a hike and I was not I didn't know anything at all about it just followed some friends and I picked up I went to we went to the pub we joined as a group and I just picked up a leaflet and it says challenge with attitude and do that song problem so I went 12 miles are very steep hi I was huffing and puffing and I didn't believe how tough it was came back rolled into the pub got my chips got my pint sat down there huffing and puffing and Victor the leaflet again and it says challenge with altitude and not attitude mr. edit honest to god as I stand here today that is a true strim administrative how good i mis-read altitude to attitude it was simply that i was sure i hadn't practiced for this I hadn't rain forest I just have to get on with it what was important was my attitude and that was what it was in the forefront of her mind I gotta do what I gotta do I've got to do so I read it as challenges and she doesn't cause Joe attitude if that happens in businesses is difficult you
