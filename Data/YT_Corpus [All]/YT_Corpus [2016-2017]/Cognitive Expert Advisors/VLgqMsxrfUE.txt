 we only operate based on reward you know you will talk to a girl efficient she's pretty that's your you are going to partner up with somebody if you think there is a monetary benefit from it yeah you're going to eat that candy if you know it's gonna taste good Matt made his first million at 18 when will you alright so i gotta i remember the last yesterday even even before we been on this stage I think Zach was on his age so we were on the stage and foreign people were in the conference and Zach was like so how many of you guys have discovered something and nobody to raise their hand right that's true yeah and he was introducing you oh yes Oh her mom and he was like that's how cool you are I don't know if I'm that cool but uh as a scientist that's what you supposed to do supposed to discover things yeah yeah oh yeah yesterday you mentioned that you know Charlie Munger he talks about 25 point advisors and you mentioned that you know there are many more actual yes oh how many over hundreds hundreds yeah at least 150 they don't know of you can actually google say cognitive bias you can get a whole list on Wikipedia of the different biases Charlie Munger what he did was yeah pick 25 of the ones that he figured he could apply the most business yeah and said if at least you know these you'll be way better off than most people yep begin with even if you know five you know you're conscious about five of them that they can help you greatly and your business and anything you do not just your business your relationship with your wife girlfriend assist in whatever it is you can get a mind trick everybody yeah oh which one do you think people miss like all which one works perhaps aw is like the sneakiest one they're all sneaky that's why there are cognitive biases don't know but I say the strongest one which I mentioned yesterday was a reward bias you know we only operate based on reward you know you will talk to a girl efficiencies pretty that's y at work you're going to partner up with somebody if you think there is a monetary benefit from it yeah you're going to eat that candy if you know it's going to taste good so the reward bias is one of the strongest one that we have no and you need to take advantage of it yeah you know other strong biases are the authority biases you know like somebody going up on stage saying all you're a doctor and this and that you've discovered so righty right there you have that authority the is forming wear whatever that's why I was joking with you guys and I said I can say whatever I want yeah and you're gonna believe me yeah that's authority by is right there one day I should do the test that should take something completely like ridiculous ridiculous and see if people like you know and I guarantee you they will actually they did a little psychological test once where they had a I dude with a camera like a big camera looked like a newscast and in universe and and they would stop people from the elevator and they'll be like what do you think about Donald Trump dying and they're like oh my god I didn't know he done and they would believe everything just because they had a camera on the guy who shoot so the whole point was like you see how you get tricked by authority and trust that's the other one the other baby also i got a camera here I got a suit so yeah I can hear people don't you hello young which favors against you because stuff you try to tell somebody it's like oh listen to me I'm this huge I be like now you're not really you know it's like really are you but yeah when you say hey that's okay but when i was 18 i created this thing that now making million people are like yeah then be like maybe i should listen to me yeah yeah when I was felt I was I had it kind of all planned out I was like trying to hatch chickens and I had like obviously big big plans and everything and I was calling a big company I was like I would lower my voice but I was like so guys we are going to any warrant eggs but can you deliver be soon yeah how about we do a lot of that and uh but I look younger than I actually a.m. I'm 20 people say I'm 18 if I'm in a suvamay tell me I'm plenny but if I'm not in to see me like you're 18 aren't you like no I'm not it you know I've always looked younger than what I am I don't know anymore if i do or not but like yeah when I was like all my twenties I looked like I was like early 20s so it was hard to do business yeah and one of the things I did was I bought a Ferrari because then people would be like if I grab this Ferrari yeah you know I Drive and I'm trying to do business with you you'd be like I don't know how old you are but you're driving something I can so you must be doing something right and that gives you again an authority and somebody might be like oh that's a compass or whatnot but I'm like a it work the minute I start driving the car to meetings people are like let's listen to this guy don't know it's just it's so stupid that's how stupid the mind is no I'm the same person nothing changed i know the same amount of information i just bought a cooler car than everybody else yeah to me also now I'm at an age where it's like okay you do look older you know I can listen to you you know so it's it's a trick it's yeah it's all it's all a mind trick you know that people use Oh yesterday we were also talking about you know you were you were talking about Troy monger and we 25 Harding advisors and you said you know that's a good book but perhaps you should better get a psychology textbook yeah because well Charlie Munger gives you the cognitive bias explained by him yeah you know and how they work which is great that the true question is it's like what else can you learn from cognitive I sir yeah where do they come from are there other cognitive biases the best source all these cognitive biases came from psychology studies yeah and it wasn't one person that discovered a hundred Yaga advice one doctor might have come up with the first one and then another group of doctors come with the next ones and then the next ones and then all the sudden and there's all these cognitive bias going around that you can find different ones in different textbooks Charlie Munger just combine and grab you know some of the most important one to go list which is the 2500 advices from Charlie Munger yeah but text books are always going to teach you more of the basics and explain a little more in detail what else are than a regular books regular books are more of a story yeah with like I said yesterday with a lot of fluff and the nation that you might not need but it makes it entertaining yeah a textbook is not entertaining it's like it's a b c d e you can learn this concept out you can't you know point yeah and that's it so i always go back to text books when I don't want to learn concepts if I want to learn about a psychological principle I go to a psychology textbook if I want to know how DNA replicates I don't go to some you know Richard Dawkins gene boat I go to a molecular biology book where it shows me exactly how replication works you know it's a step by step yeah that's why I was saying reading a text books they sound like reading a book you cannot read a textbook a day it's yeah you can't just kind of lean maybe someone here genius out there but even tie can really read a textbook a day because I guarantee you I give him a molecular biology book you know that's this thick yeah I test them the next you know three hours later on like he won't know even ten percent because it's all dense rich material yeah but that's not the key now you can still study from those and you get a lot it think of a text books as grabbing a hundred different books combined into one yeah with all the Nuggets altogether which forget that you know people forget to go to text books yeah then to a bookstore that was like I think half a year ago and i was going for a mystical I just Oxford and I see this textbook it and I take it I'm like this is a thousand pages that's a little bit too much yeah textbooks have hundreds that was the biggest that's what I have seen over 1000 pages in your science book has actually I think 1300 pages Wow like this thick it's all like you know pretty much about the brain not a little bit but a lot of it I love it and that's one of the textbooks I had to study when I yeah it might be HD but um I runny particular types what you recommend specifically for you know he's somebody is let's say Morgan or persuasion or in sales which textbook would you recommend the word did you just suggest are you just pick anything yeah you know eventually you're going to realize that everything goes around and everybody's trying to tell you the same thing over and over so you read this cognitive bias here though you read this sale technique you read about the reptilian brain you're all kind of say the same so you can grab a whole bunch of four or five six different books about sailing yeah and you're going to realize that Idol comes to get it's like okay here's the general concept of God I need to know you can also go to a psychology textbook to learn more about persuasion of course don't know it's a lot more in depth and a lot more technical information yeah but there's lots of little books there's one called web fluence that's really good mind hacks it's a really good one and my ex is a little more about how your brain does little things here and there but it also talks about how we are you know we're faulty with the deputy cognitive biases so never stick I yesterday somebody asked me the same question I tell them don't stick with one book yeah just like don't stick with one program so it's good you have a program don't ya so you're watching this it's just as good to get ties program Matt's program done and the next guys program because everybody's going to have some different points of views you know in the end it might be a lot of the same information but you might say something that tie never said that's like that's insightful you run your own business you do your own stuff that you're an expert in and you might give an insight to somebody else in it somebody else might give a different type of insight that so it's always good to don't be stuck with one book one author that one mentor because it's not enough yeah more than just that yeah of dampening month for me and he was he was very good teaching me about business and money and you know I he helped me a lot but then I had no social life I didn't go out and goes like map you don't want to get any girls like okay I think I'll trust you on this and you know it works but then I met thi and he's like are you saying on like yeah and then if he asked me why I'm like oh and my mind just went blank like I didn't know what to say are you single still um I go out but I'm still single okay you're a young bachelor 20 years old you should be single to my opinion it's like I i got married when I was 35 so I enjoyed and they worked from 18 to 35 I enjoyed my life to the fullest dating here and there and it's good you don't need to get married yet here you know her mom thank
