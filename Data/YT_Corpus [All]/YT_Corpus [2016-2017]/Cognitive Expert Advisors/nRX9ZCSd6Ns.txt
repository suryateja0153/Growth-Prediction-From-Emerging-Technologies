 Oh - playing survey best practices my name is Charles Vogel and I'm the vice president of products and marketing here at decision wise our presenters today are Kristen Chapman good afternoon and dr. David Mason hello everybody Kristen is the vice president of client services that decision wise and she leads our team of assessment advisors who administer surveys for clients around the world she's also an expert and I have a Kentucky conduct employee engagement surveys and get the most from the results dr. David Mason is a senior engagement consultant and Master Trainer decision wise he holds a doctorate degree in cognitive psychology from Columbia University and he consults with clients around the world on their employee engagement results decision wise has been in business since 1996 we specialized in conducting employee engagement surveys and then helping our clients use the feedback to promote organization change and improvement this broadcast or this webcast is scheduled for 60 minutes everyone will be on mute so if you have questions please use the question tool to submit them and we will try to address those as we go this webcast has also been approved for one hour of recertification credit through HR CI and Sherm and after the presentation I'll send an email that includes the program codes to redeem the free credit along with links to the slides and other downloads that we'll talk about on our presentation today you can also download the slides right now and the other sample is in the handout section on the toolbar so if you look at the toolbar if you look for the word handout you'll see that there's four different handouts there one of which is the slides and there's some other white papers and samples feel free to download those now and you can follow along with us so let's begin by talking about the these kind of outcome levels when it comes to running an employee engagement survey the reason why we have this slide here is many times people call us to conduct an employee engagement survey and they're at one of these four different phases so to speak when they're doing it either it's the first time they just want to get a benchmark see what's going on or they're their veterans at this we've been doing it for a while and they're really using the results to kind of drive organization change so Kristen and Dave I wanted you to talk the differences between these different phases that we typically see sure I would say for a first administration it's very common for most of most organizations to really be looking for a baseline and when we talk about baseline we mean what is it that employees think you know you may hear conversations around the water cooler especially if you are in HR you hear some of the complaints or the concerns that employees might have but how how valid are those are those widespread and so really understanding you know when it comes to engagement and it comes to the the factors that drive engagement and increase engagement what what really is the baseline for your organization what is the the company culture like what it what our employees really feeling and and where they're their biggest kind of hot button and also what's really working well in the organization and so that baseline is is really kind of the first phase and probably the most comments for a first-time Administration but what one of the key things and Dave can speak to this because he often works with leaders in this is taking it beyond just the baseline to how do we then respond to what employees have to say what their concerns are yeah absolutely it's one of the things is when you get into it you're kind of just happy to do it that was the baseline hey that was a lot of work a lot of effort and you count that up as one of the wins but if you don't do anything with that baseline then it actually could cause more problems than anything because now you've asked them how do you feel and I said okay well that's good enough now we'll go on and do what we're gonna do anyway you really have to take that baseline and then say hey we heard you and now we're gonna do something about it what we find is if you don't respond in your first time your first survey to at least do what we show here in the red box some executive team action planning what we mean by that are just high-level initiatives maybe be one or two initiatives based on the feedback here's what we're going to do to change if you don't respond if you don't create a couple of action items if you don't tie those actions back to the fact that you heard that you heard what they had to say then you'll find that if you do try to run the survey again you'll have lower participation people will be more apathetic and it's less likely that the kind of support and change for engagement will will exist within the culture the next days after that is that's that's really talking about getting some high-level buy-in and saying hey the organization is doing something about this but the next step down is what we're seeing in the green box and this is where we really start to dive into the transformational aspect of what engagement surveys can do for you is that when you when the high level rolls down and trickles down a lot of times it Peters out or bottlenecks around that manager supervisor level but if now we can get them involved in doing individual contextual nuanced action plans for their specific departments now the people who share their voice the people that answered this engagement survey can say oh listen this isn't just something that the CEO said hey let's do this and now we all forget about it this actually means something all the way down and this is going to affect my day to day this isn't just some high-level pie in the sky idea but this is going to change how I work this day in an hour you know what I mean so this is this is where it becomes very important and also very crucial to be doing it the right way and one of the key things here Dave with manager action plan is that you're creating a level of accountability and ownership engagement has becomes more tangible to managers at this point not only are they receiving some results that for their team but they're also responsible to create change within their unit or their group and so trickling up those action plans is just as critical is trickling down the results as you often hear as we talk about rolling out results the final one would be you know as as there are initiatives put in place as managers are setting goals for their with their teams and really trying to crab figure out how do we increase engagement how do we create change then having more team as well as company-wide initiatives around training leadership development that's where you get into some of the you know that the bigger organizational development initiative that really helps you know catalyst is a catalyst to increasing engagement across an organization I'm going to throw something out I just made this up right now so you tell me if you like it or not but I think that would the manager action planning that's where you get into the creative solutions to problems right and then when you go into the purple box the training the development the organization that's when you start getting into innovative solutions so that the creativity in solving what's already there but then saying we're going to take this one step beyond and be innovative about it now that's great and that's where you're talking about things like oK we've seen for a couple of years we've got this problem with maybe it's top-down communication we've tried these couple of different things maybe within our level or our sphere of control that we talk about what's in your sphere of control or sister Sharon but really none of that's working or it's not working as impactful as we want so what are some new big bright ideas yeah I like that I think that's that's true so as you're talking I launched a poll to to the audience to determine where you feel you are on this continuum so maybe you haven't done a survey yet and you're just starting and so you kind of consider yourself more about establishing a baseline or you have you know big plan to actually do manage your actions planning this first year go ahead and indicate which one really describes your organization best and that will help us kind of tailor our presentation today more to the the levels that we're seeing so I'll leave this open for another couple seconds here and I'll close the poll and share the results with you you know Charles one thing that's really important to consider as engagement is not just a one-time event you know conducting an engagement survey I think what we're showing here is that it really is something that can be transformational for your organization but in order to do that right you have to think in terms of more of a long-term strategy it's a what not just a one-time event but you've got to keep you know not only measuring but also changing and and you know it may sound like a lot of work but it's really any any significant change you know does take time rather than you know we always talk about change in terms of slight shifts versus you know significant swings slight shifts are really what you have to keep doing and tweaking and saying how can we make this better and then you can arrive at that place of transformation when you look back you know over a period of a few you say while we're making some great progress as an organization so I'm sharing the results now and it looks like 46% of people are in that first phase of establishing a baseline 19% executive action planning 20% manager action planning and 16% in that training organization development box so interesting I think that some this is a little bit different we've been done the presentation before and we found it split somewhat evenly but it looks like we have a lot of people looking to start this process off and establish that baseline go ahead and hide the results so what we'd like to do now is talk about what you know kind of a good road map for rolling out results so if you're starting your survey for the first time what are some accomplishments you can kind of expect during that first year second year and third year yeah it's almost like what are those what are those wins you're going for right so year one definitely you know having that baseline is important you really don't know what employees really feel and so having some data to support you may have some hypotheses or assumptions and having some data support I'll tell you one example a really great story I worked with an organization that was an you know very confident very sure that the location of their of their organization was a problem that's why people were leaving and what we found when we actually you know looked at the survey is it really had nothing to do with location and so really the data establishing that baselines helps you to validate kind of some of your assumptions or to throw away some of those assumptions another win is making sure it's a confidential process if you have an organization that is not strong or high in a level of trust and you're trying to build that sense of trust making sure you have a good plan around what the confidentiality looks like you definitely want to have some executive planning like we like Dave talked about having some kind of initiative one or two initiatives based on the results that you will then share with the organization and tie back those initiatives to having heard them sharing those overall results of course and then as we said do doing something making some change even if it's just a slice you know what two items but that's really critical for the first year if you do that you'll find your participation rates increased for the second year you'll find that you'll see some some score changes where the initiatives you've worked on you'll see some increase in improvement I know Dave you work with organizations quite regularly on year over year survey results what does that second year typically look like for them well the second year is going to be the best year for them a lot of times because what happens is if they work with us during that first year we go through all these things and make sure that they're using the best practices because as you alluded to this has to be something that you think of year over year you can absolutely do a one-off and then you can screw everything up because that's what happens but you'd have to really look at this as we're really changing the culture we're really changing the paradigm of how we think about things in here engagements not an initiative as much as it is a way of changing how you think about things and that's what this first year is all about is changing how you think about things you're creating that confidentiality you're creating that employee voice and so year two comes around everyone sees hey you listened in fact we had one just recently biggest changes I've ever seen and it was because it was strictly because of the Employment Service engagement survey and that they were over the moon that they'd finally been listened to and so the management actually didn't even do that much they were just so happy they were listening to that all their numbers shot up incredibly high and so that's a big part of it is really setting that foundation and and creating the narrative the vocabulary to move forward and what you also find in year two besides the changes that they've mentioned in in scores that you hope to see is that you you may want to look at some further demographics so for example decision wise sets up surveys where the demographics are not asked on the survey we put them on the back end and your your survey providers should be able to do that too and because of that we're able to not only maintain that sense of confidentiality but also start looking at stories in the data so what is it that managers may have some concerns about compared to non managers or what about people that are new to the organization versus those that have been there long term starting to look at those demographics also results this is where we get into that green box we saw in the previous page where we're saying roll those results down to managers and ask them to come up with one or two initiatives within their own teams that action planning isn't done just by the manager it's done with the team and that creates that sense of engagement it's more than initiative like you said it's that excitement and then starting to look at some business metrics and we'll talk more about some of the business metrics we work with organizations quite regularly on later in this presentation one thing that you're talking about that I really want to draw attention to is this idea of oh let's do some more business metrics let's do some more action planning let's do some more demographic breakdown the reason we're saying let's let's concentrate on those in year two is because a lot of times people come to us a year one and they want they want them move they want to do absolutely everything they want to solve every single problem and so their survey ends up being 560 questions long because they want to ask every question possible they want to solve every problem and what we're saying is know what you want to do is you want to create positive change and even if it's only on one thing that you move the needle that's what you need moving forward you don't want to solve everything all at once because you know what happens when you try and solve everything at the end of solving nothing and so really you want to just ease yourself into it and ease your employees into it because again this is new for them as well and if they see you bite off more than you can chew and then it fails then again it's going to fail in years two three four and so on down the road so this is one of the reasons we say let's just go for some quick wins in year one let's get some real momentum and then year two let's really start drilling down into more fine-tuned things so those of you it gets good point today those of you who are in year three or greater probably recognize some of these other you know things that we see in year three you have probably implemented more training programs based on the feedback maybe you have identified that managers across your organization may have some challenges or managers that are brand new to their role may have some challenges and so you've implemented a training program for new managers again leadership development can you know be all kinds of things from the individual to a team and then the accountability piece where where maybe at this point you're even expecting people goals to tie back to performance so you know if they improve or if they're able to make some change based on their goals then there may be some tie to performance and that's where the accountability piece can come in and then finally you know what are the bigger organizational changes that happen and how is the culture looking have you increased your culture of trust in your organization is there a culture of feedback where people feel like they can speak up do people feel like they can take ownership for making changes you know being empowered there's a lot of wonderful things that can happen as you start to create the narrative the story in your organization and looking at those scores and that measuring that engagement year-over-year and and figuring out how do we now move the needle one step forward I love what you said about about that accountability thing is that is one of the big things that comes out of this and that we strive for is this idea of taking it out of our hands and putting it in theirs letting them drive engagement from now on so that you're not the one that has to keep pushing and saying hey now be more engaged and some like that but they're actually driving you with how to improve the company and increase bottom line and stuff like that well and this feeds really well into our next slide which talks about employee engagement and and one of the things that that we believe as part of our core philosophy is that engagement is we call it a 50/50 proposition it's not just the responsibility of me as the leader or me as the CEO of the organization to create you know to to create engagement right that's not a sustainable solution it's not a sustainable I can't go you Charles and say Charles you have to be engaged and here's how you're gonna do it right you are still a choice so that's why we say I can create the environment as a CEO or I can create the environment and give the tools and resources and and try my best as the head of a team but it's still up to you David to choose to be engaged in in fact if you look at the definition that we've got here you'll notice that it doesn't have any behavioral component that they smile all the time or they really do all these things it's all about that personal choice the emotional state obviously of commitment passion energy things like that but the behavioral state of investing our best and that's not something I can ever force an employee to do I can make them do the job you know I can threaten them I can believe them I can carry them I can stick them whatever and they will do the job but are they doing the job fully invested with their hearts their spirits their minds their hands their creativity their passion their attitude and things like that no they're not and so this is all about getting your employees to make that choice to be engaged now this is our model of engagement right here and this is something that we really want to if you don't remember anything else from today we want you would at least remember this part satisfaction and engagement are two different concepts well a lot of times we talk about employee satisfaction and things like that and that's very important in fact we drew it on here on the model specifically to show it's a foundational component you want to make sure people are satisfied before you even talk about engagement satisfaction includes things like are people being paid adequately are they safe at their job do they have the tools and resources they need stuff like that right you need that in place if you're worried about getting mugged in the parking lot before you even get into the office then no you're not going to worry about like whether I'm investing my full self you're just trying to get in right same thing with being paid if that's something that's constantly on your mind hey they're asking me to do too much work for what I'm getting paid you're gonna try and throw that balanced equation that quid pro quo I pay you you work for me out of balance right because they're not satisfying the terms of the contract they're asking too much for what they promised now once we can establish that once that's out of the way then we move on to the first world problem as it was the the engagement this idea of the rich get richer is once we've got that satisfaction out then we can really tap into some of these softer concepts of engagement and the key to engagement here we've got several predictors that go into what engagement is that that behavioral of energy and passion and commitment and it's these these predictors these factors that we've come up through it through our research through studying millions and millions of survey responses is that meaning autonomy growth impact and connection are the key drivers of engagement you don't have to have all of them in place perfectly to be engaged absolutely not in fact sometimes it's not even possible but what we are saying is that every time any one of those goes up engagement goes up and so the more that you can get to increase the Mort everyone's overall engagement increases but now all these concepts that we've been talking about this kind of foundational information is contained in our book called magic five keys to unlock the power of employee engagement I'm also in the link out where you can find a copy on Amazon or other locations but it's really a great book on how managers can really help increase the level of engagement on their teams and we have a lot of good research in there from all of the survey responses that we've collected over the years I want to talk about or transition now to measuring engagement the best practices for actually getting a good indication of how engaged employees are yeah so when we measure engagement we embed what we call anchor questions throughout the survey and these are different than what you just saw the magic kaname growth impact connection that David mentioned there are also survey items that address all of those that help us understand the inputs to engagement but these really anchor questions are are true measurements they are we look at these six questions we don't ask we don't view engagement as binary meaning you're either engaged or not and we'll show you how we look at engagement here in a second but these anchor questions really give us a sense of how people are feeling about their job and you'll notice that for example it's easy to become absorbed in my job it's not a question that's extremely actionable so it's Charles if you got a lot of low score on that or your team did I'm not really able to say to you okay Charles go figure out how to be more absorbed your team or absorb right but but they are good measures of of engagement what we then do is take these items and we look at everyone's average score and we group them each individual into one of these four categories you know there's a lot of conversation I think we hear it in the in the industry in the media about 70% of people are disengaged which means in the days you and Charles are both disengaged when the only ones in this group here but in all reality we find that engagement is not binary either you're engaged or not engaged it really is more of a spectrum our continuum and I think that matches with your experience right that's just not if I don't if I'm not in love with my jobs that I don't detest my job that's just not how it is and in fact one of the interesting things about this is that people's engagement can fluctuate a little bit so when you look at what we're talking about in the top group here there's 32% we call them fully engaged and and one of the things that I found helpful when I'm describing to people is I call them often engaged it doesn't mean that they're always in love with their job that everything's fantastic hunky-dory every day is the best day they had right it just means that for the most part they're having many more good days than bad days you're still gonna have bad days if you were manic all the time that's not engagement that's mental illness and so what you want to do is you want to see like for example feels stressed behind your comfort zone personal satisfaction of the quality of your work it's stressful but it's the kind of stressful that's rewarding and fun and energizing you just love your job now the next group down the key contributor group makes up the bulk of most people's organizations about 50 percent roughly and that's where ever you go now this is the part that often gets overlooked these are people that are having more good days than bad we call them sometimes engaged they know what a good day at work feels like they've had them they enjoy them and they just hope with fingers crossed that one day it'll come by again right they have no idea how to create those good days they just wait for them and enjoy them so those are the people that are sometimes engaged you see they're not stretched by assignment but they still respond well to leadership they're committed they stick to what they know they're not they're not the ones pushing the boundaries necessarily now the next group down this opportunity group this makes up about 20% of the people that in your organization and we call them waiting to be engaged these are the people that are doing just enough to get by and not get in trouble and in fact they're very good about that they're very engaged in trying to avoid work a lot of times so but they spend time taking care of personal needs they'll be calling the bank or they'll be surfing Facebook you know they're staying because it's too hard to get another job or they just the money's too good or something like that you're just putting your time these are the people that will give the dumb but you kinda have to be on top of them right you don't want that in your organization but here's the deal the natural state of humans is wanting to be engaged so these people that are in that opportunity group if you give them a chance to be engaged they will jump at that chance that's why we call them waiting to be engaged that's why they're the opportunity group because you give them anything they're gonna skyrocket up that ladder now this last group fully disengaged these are these are the ones that are just you recognize them right they're the ones that are constantly complaining and sarcastic they're the ones that they quit but they haven't told HR yet these are the ones that are always bad-mouthing other people and it feels like there's more than there are but for the most part we found that at the most you're going to see four to six percent of these people in an organization and that's kind of on the worst unless you are the worst we're going to but but for the most part we're seeing anywhere between two and six percent and this it is these people can change it's just not often worth your effort to do it it's better just to kind of manage them out or something like that well the transition here and talk about the survey itself you know what how do you build an employee engagement survey with some best practices around that the questions you use the structure of the survey how long it is the rating scale that sort of thing yes so you can see that we recommend this is one of the surveys that we would use we recommend what we call frames of reference so questions survey items that relate to your job to your team maybe to your supervisor of the organization and there's a couple of benefits of these number one if you're looking at the questions themselves on a five-point agreement scale and you're able to go through an answer about 50 questions within about an eight to ten minute time period having a consistent scale having these frames of reference helps kind of set up the survey in a way that allows the survey taker to to be able to respond fairly quickly to these items another benefit of these frames of reference when you get to the action planning phase where you're trying to set some goals or look at the results is that they help put them into frames of reference that identify what is in my fear of control and find a supervisor of course but I get you know some results the show that I've got some issues with my team then I'm able to look at those specifically and address those if I'm the manager of a group of supervisors then I can look at where my supervisors having some challenges and that is in my sphere of control to try to help support them so there's a couple of benefits to setting it up this way you'll notice we also have a don't know not applicable option we do recommend having that what we find is that if we don't have that option that even though this is an attitudinal survey and you would hope that most people could respond to all of the survey items there are occasions where people don't feel like they can respond one example is if I would choose to remain here even if a job was similar and paying benefits were available elsewhere there's a couple variations of that question and sometimes people just aren't sure what other comparative you know benefits and pay are out there and so having to don't know how to separate that out we don't it also eliminates us from inflating the neutral category which is what we commonly see when when there isn't a doubt no not applicable we also recommend is to recommend to open-ended comments there is a lot of conversation around we put a comment box after each section what we found through our research is that two open-ended comments at the end has a couple of benefits number one we ask us strengths and then an opportunity question number two we find that there's a drop-off rate that happens as soon as someone gets to a comment so this helps to minimize the drop-off rate by putting at the end and really the most important being that we find that even if you do put comments in multiple places they come they boil down to these two key themes and what are the things that are working and what are the things that are not and so any version or flavor of those questions are what we would recommend yeah you think that people would be answering the question in the comment box but what we found is people answer the question that they want to talk about anyway and so you'll ask them about the I would choose to go somewhere else and they'll just say the same thing and so you see it over and over again just the same things coming out that you can do just by doing this and not scare them off with the comment box so this is something that we found it's very so Kristen what is it better to use an online survey like we're showing here or paper surveys or setting up kiosks and organizations because there's many organizations that don't have everyone with an email address or sitting at a computer all day how do you collect feedback from those individuals yeah so first I would say just be sure to collect feedback through everyone don't ever administer an employee survey and only give it to people who have online email addresses make sure that you are including everybody in in that survey of course if you have contractors or others that might not be full-time employees that's a different story but paper is an option that we use kiosk is pretty easy because all you do is send a kiosk code and people go to a website and enter their kiosk code and take the survey online if you have a computer lab or place you can set up computers for people who may be on a manufacturing floor for example and then of course online and if they have an email address that's most simple the other thing I would like I would also mention is you'll notice on this survey that we do not put any demographics on the survey itself so we don't ask people tell us what your supervisor name is what division you're in how long have you been with the company and putting that information on the backend so you you provide an hrs output to your survey provider and they should be able to code that information on the backend so that those kinds of questions don't have to be answered that is HUGE number one that increases the sense of confidentiality when you can do that and number two it decreases the length of the survey and number three it gives you more relevant and valid data what we found is that when people self-report their demographic information that up to twenty six percent of the responses are incorrect and that could be but they don't know the answers to some of those they're guesstimating or it could be that they are purposely trying to hide who they are because they fear you know the results coming back to haunt them for what it's worth I always lie on my demographic remember the employee service but any any online survey I take on I'm born in 1950 well there you go there's your reason yes you should be able to to have that on the back end and they can you're keeping the survey nice and simple I would also mention Charles that probably 70 to 80 percent of our surveys are pretty much the same questions because you're able to get some good benchmarks that way and of course we've put together a survey that really does measure engagement with those magic components with the anchor questions with the satisfaction pieces but there are also some things that are going to be unique to your organization and so you may want to you know be able to ask some of those questions you may want to customize it so we find about twenty to thirty percent of the surveys that we do sorry twenty percent of the surveys are customized all of the surveys we do are typically customized but twenty to thirty percent of the survey itself we will change based on what your organization's needs are and the idea here is that when we look at the results we're not just looking at the top result from the bottom results we're actually doing some statistical analyses because a lot of times the stuff that's actually driving engagement isn't necessarily your lowest question this is why we always recommend doing some advanced metrics because that way you can find out because the whole point of this if you look at engagement as your dependent variable and what is causing that what is affecting that and it's like I said it's not always the lowest question and so statistics help tease out what's really doing that and what do we do to change like what's going to help us to increase engagement rather than just you know to respond to the lowest scores of the heck yeah it goes back to what you were saying earlier is a lot of times people want to solve problems before they figure out what the actual problem is good point and then what is the best method for conducting surveys annually post survey is a recorder always on how should you kind of collect feedback yes so there's a lot of conversation right now about pulse surveys and and I've been doing this for about ten years now and and you know that that's kind of evidence load a little bit with you know real-time feedback always on surveys pulse surveys they kind of people get excited about it they're all good and they're all really beneficial and they'll serve specific needs needs right but our recommendation is that you do an annual for the first three years you do an annual survey about the same time every year and then as you have moved into that more transformational then you can move it to 18 months to a 2 years and start doing more of a pulse Dave what else have you seen work well with pulses as you as you work with organization so the idea with the post is really dependent on what kind of stuff you're working on so for example I was working on one right before the webinar for this for this large company out in California where they want to know how they've been doing on certain questions well this particular question is one that you're not going to see a huge affects guys and so on this one you're not going to want to pulpit every quarter you're going to want to post it every maybe six months because you want to give enough chance for the needle to move so that you can actually measure it otherwise it'll just get lost in the noise so you want to really have someone who can understand the data and can tell you when the appropriate time to pull someone in and then you can also run some power analyses to figure out how many people you need to do it you don't necessarily want to pull the entire organization unless they just love surveys and if they do is then given some extra ones but for the most part you want to just kind of minimize that survey fatigue so that it becomes more of an event and they look forward to it and they realize this is something that's going on I think with any kind of survey we would go back to our flock core philosophy is don't ask something unless you're planning to make a change so that people get into this sort of survey fatigue mentality where it's like let's do surveys let's do pulses let's do always-on and all of those have a purpose and they can be highly beneficial in an organization but what employees have to see in between the surveys if they have to see change they have to see progress if not then the survey loses its value in an in and of itself it doesn't really create change think about this on almost every receipt that you get now when you go to a restaurant or fast-food there's a chance to take a survey and most of the time they'll promise you free food if you take the survey how many of those surveys have you taken I'm gonna get 1% 2% you just don't it becomes noise because you don't see the impact you don't see the difference and it's just not worth your effort right you're fatigued on those surveys and so we want to make sure to avoid that same principle within the company and again that's why I tied back to really making sure that you do something with those results and making it so obvious yeah Sarah says she doesn't do any of those surveys either because she doesn't eat tested well Sarah pointing out that you're better than now so I'm showing here a kind of a screenshot of how to track participation and I guess the question is how do you how do you what can you expect in terms of participation what's a good participation rate and then how do you get high participation on police serving sure I'll take a stab at that so high participation is contingent on a couple things number one especially if this is your baseline survey which the majority of you a large number of you mentioned that that's kind of the stage you're at you want to make sure that you have a very good communication plan a communication plan thinking of thinking in advance a couple of things number one what is the process that's going to be you know two people are going to go through the take the survey what is going to be expected of anybody who receives results so thinking ahead of time and communicating that here's what the purpose of the survey is here's why it's important to our organization making sure that that first communication that goes out is is a letter from the CEO supporting the organization supporting the initiative and and saying here's why we're doing engagement here's why we care about it here's what we're expecting to have happen making sure that that's all part of your communication plan helps your participation rate again if you're at that phase where you're holding managers accountable to create action plans then that's another thing that can help participation rates you get managers excited let them know not only are you going to get a report but you're going to be asked to set some goals with your team that will create good buy-in as well the other thing to consider I guess I would say for a first-time administration we typically see about a seventy six percent participation rate we send we find sending a couple of reminder two people over a two-week window is ideal and then once they once they complete the survey for a first administration we usually see about a seventy five seventy six percent participation rate that rate actually goes up on the second administration if you have taken some action so if you had made at least a couple of changes from the company perspective and tied those results again back it can be little quick wins it can be big initiative but throughout the whole year year long time frame saying okay remember when you took that employee survey back in in December this initiative is a result of you know your feedback then so we as the as the organization are trying to make changes based on your feedback so tying those results back actually pops the participation rate up to about eighty two percent in the second administration and then again depending on the kinds of results and an initiative usually you you are at 80 to 85 percent over the successive years yeah in fact some of our best clients the ones that really do really embrace this engagement initiative we don't have to send out reminders because we're at ninety percent participation and and it's 90 percent participation within the first couple of days like it's not even it's not even an effort at that point they're so excited to give feedback because I know this is their chance to speak up say with a concern and know that it will be addressed and currently I want to talk about or transition to the best practices and reporting what should HR expect to see what should the executive executive expect to see what you should you give managers we're some best practices around using the data I think the biggest thing and and what we've seen kind of as a trend over the last a year or two is that employees or leaders want the data the information they receive to be relevant they want it to be focused and relevant to what is really important for them to to create change and so what we typically find is as we mentioned kind of a trickle down approach you start with the fifteen high-level HR might have everything but an executive you may want to give less information to they want to understand the whole business unit or the whole division that they're managing what are the key factors what are the things that that kind of stand out that might increase engagement so we talked they've mentioned drivers will on reports that we provide executives will point out here are the key drivers of what's going to move the needle executives want to understand how does their organization compared to the average organization or the top organization so benchmarks are really important for executives when we're talking about a mid-level leader you know they may want to see some how are their supervisors doing or how are their teams under them doing and and you know might there be some initiatives or issues that they need to address from that perspective as well and then when you get to the frontline manager that's we're not you know we wouldn't recommend any kind of demographic cuts or any kind of you're really focused in on what is in their sphere of control what and what are the immediate things that their teams need and again identifying here or the couple of items that will move the needle on engagement that that's really the kind of information that they want to understand as well yeah I think the two to sort of sum up the two main principles you want are to make sure that it's relevant actionable data not interesting data and not what they because a lot of people are going to want to compare themselves against different departments even if that doesn't change what their action plan is going to be they're just curious and so you want to just not let people get too lost in the weeds you want to make sure that you give them stuff that's only necessary for them and the other one being the confidentiality aspect which is again why you don't want to you don't want people to be able to worry that their manager knows what they said about them you know what I mean and so that's really just kind of where it comes down to it's just protecting that confidentiality and making sure that the data are relevant to poor action planning well we're showing here on the screen is our online leadership intelligence system and you know there's a lot of tabs a lot of filters you can see you can even look at the structure of the organization and you can see you know all of your groups or subgroups but what this would be a view that for example hu as HR might have maybe some high-level leaders in the organization might want to dig into here but again this is where you can get into too much information and you spend all your time trying to figure it out and then you don't focus your efforts on how do we create the change and so just make sure that when you're providing reports this online tool for example it can it's permission based so what a manager would see could be very different than what you as the HR analyst might see or PDF reports whatever it is that you're providing your your survey providers should be able to customize those reports in a way that provides the relevant information in a confidential way like you mentioned David I think more like you mentioned Kristin more and more managers are saying just tell me what to do I don't want have to look through pages and pages of results I just want to know what should I do to create a good action plan based on what's important to my team and the organization overall I think it comes back to the overall initiatives being established upfront by the executive team right so that action planning needs to happen first and then the rest of the organization can kind of follow that lead and that's a great way to do it I mean there's several approaches but one is that and David does these all the time where you go and do a summit with an executive team and you identify what are the one or two initiatives that we really want to focus on and though that can then trickle down to the organization if they okay one of our goals this year everyone needs to set an action plan around how do we do a better job at you know providing recognition to employees for the good work that they do if that's what the team is that comes out you know but also giving managers that chance to say okay my specific team scores are this and what what would be what would really move the needle if I made some improvements on the team and giving that ownership to the team again manager shouldn't set action plans and the vaccum either manage to look at what their team needs are and have that conversation and engage them in the engagement process so Laura has a question about showing year-to-year trends now what's the best way to use that information show that information I'll show a sample here on our online tool but how should you how should you look at trend if you want to take a stab at that when you say how you should look at trends like maybe a little more expensive he would help I I mean you want to look at trend and what you want to do is you want to look to see if there's statistically significant year-over-year because it's always going to be different right that it's always gonna change up four percent two percentage points or whatever and what you want to see is if you want to see if that's a meaningful change right and that's one of the things we have highlighted here in the Delta is whether they're statistically significant changes so for example this is this is a global versus your benchmark but you can do the exact same equation yeah normally I'd have trending in here I don't have it in this example report but normally we choose trending as the benchmark and then yeah so the killer say 2015 2016 it's the exact same stuff in the exact same calculation of t-tests and effect sizes and things like that to figure out what significance is and then you say okay that's fantastic like we've moved on that oh look this one's going down because here's the thing a lot of what we do with engagement research is kinda like balancing plates you know like when you're spinning plates on on those little poles and you spin a couple that you're working on and by doing that maybe you you let some of the other ones start falling a little bit so you gotta spin those get those going then you go back and you work on the other one and so again don't try and be perfect with your engagement survey don't don't feel disheartened if you see anything go down what you want to look at is what did I work on and what went up and if they're the same thing then great right you can't be everything to everyone and I give you permission to not be perfect but but you need to recognize that moving in and say did I change on what I wanted to and if you didn't and we really need to have a talk right but if something else went down a little bit short and sometimes you can pinpoint what that is and make that to go for year two so does that answer your question there I hope I answer that adequately I wanted to mention kind of as a follow-up to that as well as our conversation around the kinds of reports and making sure you're putting relevant information in front of your leaders one of the things that you were showing here Charles earlier was with engagement we look at what are the key things that drive engagement and you know when you start understanding what is an engaged person look like in your organization versus what the engaged person look like you can look at your your groups and understand for example to fully engage here's a profile of what what is working for them versus what's not you can see that being challenged and stretched that's a magic question a growth question feeling that they contribute to the success of the organization meaning question you know impact connection yeah so you have a number of things but you also see that it's pretty high-end question 16 attractive opportunities for training and development they feel like they're getting they have all those you know magic components that we talked about earlier yeah so that's really helpful for you to understand you know what is it what is it that might drive engagement for your specific group and then from there you're able to set you know goals that are really relevant to to how you move that needle forward let's switch gears and talk about goal-setting action planning in general what I'm showing now based is our Depot online action planning tool so this is kind of the tool that a lot of our clients use to do this action planning exercise based on the employee engagement survey results and this example is for an individual they can see their goals that are in progress they can go in and edit these goals and indicate progress that's been made or participate in the discussion or see the Activity Feed and that sort of thing but as a manager this individual being a manager they would be able to look at the goals set by the people below them or that they manage and also participate at goals and collaborate as well so all of this information kind of gets rolled up to HR as well so they have complete visibility down the system that's where the accountability basically comes in being able to kind of see are people really creating action plans and are they working towards completion and and what's important about this is it goes back to the very paradigm of the engagement to begin with is that we said engagement is not a thing well it is a thing that just happens to you but it doesn't have to be it's one that we can be deliberate about it's an actual skill and a talent to be more engaged and that's why we push the goal-setting and the action planning so hard it's because we want people to understand hey listen if I want to be more engaged I can do these things and be more engaged and this is why we really focus on the training and and the philosophy and engagement so that they understand those things and that's where a lot of these goal action planning things tie in so Kristen about how long does it take for managers to you know kind of get the results after the survey is done and you've got your results how long did it take for the managers to kind of create a goal to roll out the results throughout the whole organization yeah so typically we recommend that managers spend a little time reading through their results and then sharing those high-level results with their team that might be about an hour meeting within a week of getting the results and then telling the team you know look we need to set some goals as a team let's go back and think about where you know where our lower items are what we might want to focus on based on the organization initiatives from the company and then come up with one that you go so then maybe another a week or two after that you get together and create goals so within a month you should have a pretty workable action plan you put that information you know in the a tool similar to like what you just show Charles and then track the progress of that overtime hrs roll and this is a really key hrs role is not to create action plans for managers it's just way too cumbersome and it really misses the whole point of action planning if you as a business partner for HR for a certain facility or division or unit tries to do those plans yourself it's really up to the managers and leaders in your role is to help and not only with the accountability the touch points of how what progress is being made but also in providing the resources to help people be more successful yeah goes back to that 50/50 again remember you sir find yourselves doing more than that that means someone else is doing less than that good point so I I'm showing a let's see I'm transitioning over here to this slide I wanted to give an example of a goal for an organization overall and what we found working with a large healthcare organization is that one other they scored low and one of the questions which was this organization cares about its employees and this is really important to them for a few different reasons number one obviously they want to they wanted to care wanted to at least let their employees know that they did care because they felt like they did and they're also really concerned about retention attracting top people a very competitive environment that they were in and so from this goal this this particular survey question they decided that in order to increase this perception senior leaders need to be more visible and so they create a couple ideas or initiatives to make that happen one is an initiative called rounding where the managers were encouraged to get out every day and go meet with employees talk to people make ground this is both you know you know the health care leaders as well as those that didn't necessarily have a direct patient care role and they also were required to open up one hour of open office time on their schedule to talk with employees that employees would know this is when so you know their boss is going to be in the office and they can sit down with him and then they have the question on their survey and they told everyone about it that next year we're going to be measuring this item the leaders of my departments are visible on a regular basis and so there's some accountability kind of built into their process to make sure that it happened well the results were that the question this organization cares about its employees went up by four percent the next year and they actually did have managers you know more visible amongst their employees so that they actually implemented this action but now that all the managers did but the majority did so and that really helped increase the results of that particular score yeah four percent for an organization to site is a significantly statistical improvement it's a great at grading yeah was a large health care organization competitive thousands like to get to get tens of thousands of people on the same page that's a big deal right and so that's that's a big win for them and something that they can actually go back to their employees with the following year and say hey listen we heard you we implemented this initiative and it looks like it's making a difference and so you can kind of gain some momentum there I think what's also interesting about this question Charles they chose this one to focus on this organ if this organization cares about employees we've done some statistical you know analysis to correlate that those kinds of questions with with questions related to pay or I'm sorry customer satisfaction so for example we've seen that if people feel like the toys are cared about then they tend to be more caring to the customers or the patients in this situation and so there's a real strong correlate between and what's interesting is they didn't maybe address the patient care question directly they addressed this that the employees themselves felt that they were cared about and then that's where they focused their efforts the reason why I brought up pay is there was another organization we worked with where one of their lowest scoring questions related to pay and that's not typically a question we put on the survey but on occasion people do request that it's on there and what we what our recommendation was though was don't address don't focus on paying less pay really is under market you know compared to the market very low it was actually fine in the market but we said focus on the relationship between the supervisor and the manager which was a low scoring question as well what they did is they focused on that and then the year-over-year change the trend improved significantly and in fact the pay question improved the next year even though they hadn't done anything at all about changing the pay structure so not saying that it's always something that you don't address but what we're saying is really understanding what is it that's going to drive or improve engagement and making sure you're addressing the right thing and again that goes back to those things are built into good rapport yeah shows the importance of doing the statistical analysis and not just you know your your best gut feeling right winging it right right yeah and so that kind of would be I guess number 0.5 here in terms of organization goal best practices which is figure out what the right goal is and so you want to make sure that you're actually doing the right thing that's going to make a difference once you have that in place you know we have our six audience or you want sponsorships so it's executive teams now on board you're not going to have a lot of support so momentum to really make this happen not at all so that's really important make sure people know who's really driving this if it's a CEO or one of your other executives and that they're setting the direction yeah not just supporting it but setting the direction as well what's coming up in company meetings frequently people are hearing about it it's in the company newsletter you know it's really being communicated number three would put in a question from the survey which is I see how my work fits into the overall mission so once you establish an initiative at the top you need to make sure people understand why it's important to them and so that's where we talk about impact you know we're making sure that you're the managers are communicating to employees how this would make their lives better number four trend is all about transparency and again the question from the surveys I trust that senior leadership is looking out for me they want to know that that these decisions being made that these initiatives being implemented are for the good of the employee is not just the company number five we talked about communication but it's not just top-down communication it's bottom-up community communications people want to know that they're heard and by acting on these things you're empowering them they feel like they have a voice and so this question here goes up suggestions for improvement or listened to and taken seriously and then that six beats is this accountability following up making sure you're tracking what's going on so you can kind of see some improvements and you can also you know executive teams are all about what's the return on the investment for us right and so you're able to show by looking at some of the progress that's been made tying it to other business metrics or your engagement results seen an improvement year-over-year you're able to make the case for how this does impact the bottom line ultimately for for an organization yeah and if I get out of seventh and this is inspired by the meeting today but I would add the Sarah rule of David needs to eat less fast food that went on there as well put that in your your goal your Depot goal yes well I thank everyone for participating with us today look forward to an email from me with the slides from today's webinar as well as the activity code which I'm showing on the screen here briefly before we end but I also be sending these to you the email in the next hour so and we look forward to having you join us on our next our next webinar thanks everybody thank you
