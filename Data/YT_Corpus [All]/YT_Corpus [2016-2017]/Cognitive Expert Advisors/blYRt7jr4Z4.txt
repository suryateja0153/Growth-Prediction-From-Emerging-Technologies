 hi my name is David wild and the direct of the data science programs here at Indiana University and it's my pleasure to welcome you to the data science programs that you're joining in the spring of 2016 what I'm going to do today is just give you a little bit of kind of context for our data science program here and give you a few tactical details about starting your work here and who to contact and that kind of thing so just wanting to start by orienting you to some of the data science people we have here the first person you're probably going to come into contact with is Kayla Scroggin she's our data science studies and records manager she oversees all of the administrative aspects of the data science program student records she's the person who can fix things when they go wrong when I'm ed too there's something about funding or your records or how to do something she actually manages a staff of people in the data science office so when you send questions in it will either be Kayla one of the staff who work with her who get back to you I'm David wild and I'm direct to the data science academic programs I'm the primary advisor for residential students and you can find out a little bit more about me a DJ wild info and professor Ying ding is the Associate Director for data science online program she's leading an online curriculum and online students now and she'll be the primary advisor for online students you can find out a little bit more about Ewing at this address here will be going have more information later about how to contact us for advising questions and so on we have a really great great set of data science faculty again we'll say a little bit more about them later and there's a link there to the list of the faculty and then last on the list but certainly not least actually right at the top all of all of you so the data science students for spring 2016 we expect to have 337 students in tow for kind of a few more online the residential the online amex between our certificate and masters programs these are not exact numbers we never know exactly how many is gonna be until until the semester starts but we've grown rapidly we're really excited by the program without putting lots of resources into developing the curriculum and so on so it's a really great time to be joining us so the data science program is housed in the school of informatics and computing at Indiana University or psyche as we call it s OIC psych was formed in the year 2000 with the observation that computing was becoming pervasive we was no longer sufficient just to be doing kind of academic work or ivory towers kind of work in theoretical computer science that was important but those we had to kind of do field work in computer science too so psych was formed with the idea that we can go out and do things like human-computer interaction and domain specializations like bioinformatics and health informatics social informatics even music informatics grown rapidly since then without one the biggest I schools as they're called in the country and we encompass everything from theoretical computer science through to vary domain oriented applications and we've formed into three units computer science informatics and information and library science data science is a program that crosses all of these units and all of these domains so we draw from specializations in computer science in informatics the information library science schools rapidly expanding we're actually building a new building right now for the interest of the residential students the last figures i have we have just shy of a hundred faculty and actually i think we're now at about 3,000 students we're really working hard to increase female enrollment at both the undergraduate and graduate enrollment is still not where we want it to be but we've made big improvements in in female enrollment excellent job prospects for students and high employer satisfaction if you go to our website s OIC indiana.edu or click on the careers link you can get reports on hiring and so on really really great career services and really great hiring prospects for all students and is that every evidence that data science will at least be a strong hiring as in our other areas multiple are kind of major centers of research and areas of distinction there's a list of some of them here these are kind of funded centers and large supported centers and so on many of these are very relevant to data science like cybersecurity bioinformatics complex networking systems data and search informatics extreme scale technologies cyber infrastructure network science data to incite digital science and you'll be interacting with faculty for many of these these areas we have many other research areas going on this is just a list I'm not going to go through them but a huge breadth of research world class research going on in the school is I hope that you're you know you get to engage with some of the faculty and research students working in these areas the data science program at you is our newest major program he was launched in january 2014 as a certificate program at then as a master's program in november 2014 a kind of unique i thinking that we offer online residential and hybrid options we take a vision of data science that goes beyond highly technical training I her students can take technical and decision maker paths and we're also think very important not just training people to do things like machine learning and programming and databases but to be able to have the the vision and the breadth of experience and the ability to lead people so we want to train the next generation of data science leaders I of course is well designed to be high value using expert faculty experience this is kind of important because we've kind of made a operational decision right now not to be putting on courses on things like introduction to C++ or introduction to hour or so on we've we want to use our faculty wanna take the expertise we have in our faculty engine transfer some of their expertise to you so we really encourage students to supplement their study here with kind of nuts and bolts training from other sources there's some fantastic resources on out there everything from buying a book from barnes & noble to resources like Coursera I strongly encourage you to check out for instance the data science certificate on Coursera many many good nuts and bolts courses out there so our hope is that you can go out and learn the basic skill sets and then will help build on top of that with the courses we offer we're kind of proud that you know our program here is embedded in world-class research we've got many many world-class researchers here in areas related to data science we've got pretty comprehensive set of residential courses from the units in school of informatics and computing from Statistics Department and we're now talking some of the other departments we've got a rapidly expanding set of online courses to and really working hard to build that set of online courses you can find out more on the web at data scientist oh I see indiana.edu as I said we've got highly active research and teaching faculty these are just some of the grants and so on that news articles that have been released and we really encourage you to engage with with with the faculty as you progress through the program so now to some more tactical details of the course the one point of confusion is we have these terms which at some point we may retire some of them but we have two concepts going through the course of path and attract a path is not a formal part of your degree but kind of guide to help you choose which course is a right for you and the two paths we have a decision maker or technical what these really our kind of tags of course is so course is that a tagged decision maker a focused a little more on the skills needed by decision makers so I such as domain applications social factors how to utilize data science techniques they're going to push you on thinking about bringing different techniques and technical pieces together to solve problems technical courses are focused on the technical side often requiring strong programming skills and you know UNIX skills and that kind of thing now you can take whatever path you want through the degree so you can take really technical path a really decision maker path or something in between we just asked to do some of the other right so we want everyone every technical trained person to have some decision maker courses and vice versa a track is a more formal specialization for all intensive purposes pretty much everybody right now is on what we call the general track but we are working to build specializations through the data science program we have one right now called computational and analytic to a very highly technical computer science oriented track through the program these are really constraints on courses that allow a kind of like a prepackaged of courses for particular a particular specialization we are helping in the future to add more tracks to that but if you got your confused that don't worry beyond the general track is your default and paths are just about finding the right path for you through the degree I'm advising so advising is here to help you guide you through the program as a whole make good decision about what classes to take build helping you build your data science skill set and address any academic issues that arise in the program for everything else for all administrative matters like registering for classes accessing grades transcript funding and so on you need to contact the data science graduate office actually that scrub that wells library 11a we've now moved it's a 611 the park that 611 Park Avenue or it even better email data sigh at indiana.edu that's the office that's managed by kayla and somebody will get back to you from with your questions from there for questions about a specific class things I prerequisites course contact you really better contacting the listed instructor for the course they can give you the most accurate information about those kind of things for a specific class so to get advising help the first step is to consult the advising notes document which will be updated each semester you'll be given a copy of this document for quick advising questions email des advice @ indiana.edu that'll go to both me and professor Inge ding and one of us will get back to you we do offer individual appointments please use them sparingly we have got 300 students there's only two of us as advisors so please just use them a little sparingly but having said that when you need them please please book some time with us for residential students I'm the primary advisor and I'm available for one one advising sessions during my office hours which currently on Tuesday and Wednesday morning to buckle advising slot with me you can go to http DJ while you can book top me and you can set up an appointment there if you require an online meeting check the online box and I'll send you some connection details for online online students who actually we're going to just move ahead to there because this is a little bit formatted better for online students the primary advisor is professor ying dean for she's going to be available in office hours monday-friday nine til 330 you can actually drop in for office hours for physical meetings or professor ding can be found on skype with it that's a skype ID that underscore d so it just remains for me to welcome you again to the course I hope you have a wonderful time here and will very much look forward to engaging with you as the course progresses for you
