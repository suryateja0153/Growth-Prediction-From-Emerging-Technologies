 hi everybody this is fake sasaki four people already only gotomeeting bridge I'm not yet on RC please join IRC the free information in email or what I just put into the chat and then type present class so that helps us to have a record of attendance thanks and we will start a few minutes after the hour just to give more people a chance to drawing so then this time for the last time welcome to the free webinar if you haven't done so please join by RC cello and pointed out in vehicle to meeting chat type present plus so that we have your attendance and we are now going to start let me know the meaning now blue begin if first presentation part and then question answering part if you have questions please type them in the IRC chat and then we can come back later to it so that we don't forget what you wanted to ask also let me be that if we're something you don't want to have published then please let us know and during your questions so after maybe now and we will take that out by making the very law perfectly well I hope it's working K for everybody and then start a presentation so go to introduce you to a free project and framework and the outline I'm give you in a minute you can download these slides here linked from the presentation also and you can also download examples which are made available how to use this framework so this is as background material when for later so what will be the outline of this may be no first we will talk about in general from higher level perspective the second part will be technical as best aspects of freeing framework going more into detail and referred parts will focused vacations built on top of free and then we have a question about sharing session I will make this presentation but we have many key people involved in the framework on recall so the question answering fashion men will be involving Bobby's people so first let starts with a bird's eye view on what is free free ms horizon 2020 innovation action a project that started in February 2015 and lasts for two years so we are now in our second year we have four industry partners leading for business cases around digital content and linked our data sources from alert will prospective we are a bridging technology in the language technology area and in the data area and the project also aims at outreach and business modeling demonstrating how these technologies can help to make money to make money in the multilingual data value chain what is the situation in this area we are various challenges and opportunities around big data sources more more such data sources are being created across languages across sectors and domains here you see some sectors which are relevant and free like the agricultural sector certain data types which were relevant like metadata and some languages which are also covered in free look all languages which are shown here are covered but for example English and Spanish and the interest Rees we are taking the four business cases there are various challenges the four cases are digital publishing translation and localization agriculture and food two main data metadata and website personalization and you will hear more details about these four areas later during the webinar the current state of technical solutions related to these four business cases when there are solutions language area like machine translation terminology annotation or in the data editor area like healing data creation or linked data processing and the aim of dream is to address various areas that hinder businesses like there's a plethora of formats that needs to be processed the adaptability and flapped on platform dependency as of nameless for using solutions many solutions cover not many languages and perverts a big problem is usability in the sense that often solutions do not have a right tool available for the right person in a given a new enterprise so the technologies also influence job profiles we also assume that free will lead to new job profiles in these four areas business cases and we have technique so the general idea of frame is to provide a framework for enriching digital content making available technologies from a data site like machine translation terminology annotation and from the data site like link data creation air processing the framework itself is a set of interfaces mostly software interfaces as of today also to some extent gruffly interfaces which should help them various people to access these technologies the design is driven by before business cases so it's a very business oriented project and as a coherent approach we have the language technology in link and then linked data area assume various user types so people who to use enrichment technologies from a developer perspective or a perspective of Quadron Archie checked collared offer and so on and we goal off a project is to make available for all these user tabs for right technologies the goal of a project can also be seen business-wise so we are various estimates made available fiber project starting here on the upper left bears for framework itself so with technological building box and the portfolio of the six so-called eServices then we are going to the right for killer applications developed in various business cases which you will hear about when going to the left button there's also a transfer of know how about how the language and data technology should work together and go into the bottom to the right where for business models about how to exploit the technology in before business cases and how to expand domain specific expertise to also new business models so this boss high-level view and free and let's now go into the second part where we go to the technical aspects of a framework so this webinar is very much focused on these aspects looking in tuban registrations we had the impression that this should be a focus but if you have higher lever questions feel also free to ask them so from a technical perspective frame is a framework for multilingual and semantic enrichment of digital content that provides access via a set of programming interfaces and graphical user interfaces to six so-called eServices here I just have a list of e-services the entity is for enriching content with information on the identities a link is for enrichment for filling data sources key terminology for detecting terms and reaching them with term related information a translation for providing customer she translation systems II internationalization for processing rarity of digital content for months the publishing for exporting the outcome of enrichment processes in the ePub format so you may wonder and then from a practical perspective how to access free this framework and behind the line services where various options where's a live version as of today the world Oh point five is available here linked from the slides as a development version we also have the link whereas if you want to install this framework on your own runnable jar file for all versions they're also linked here we are source code in a github project we see that the development work some way so that people from outside can see the development comment and contribute remember yourself is available under an approach to point a license to ease commercial use the underlying services apheresis licensing conditions you have to look into detail how we are so design of a framework is as visualized here and client a piece of software making use of free makes a web service request and there's a module in frame which evokes we actually service there from one perspective two types of each of these ones are part of free server infrastructure itself for example the entity others are provided externally for example he translation or ii terminology and there are supportive modules providing conversion of digital content forwards or pipelining of services for example yes even celia it's possible to have a terminology service followed by a translation this picture should show you but phim is really a framework it's not a platform to do this multilingual semantic data processing but the set of modules and modules which are partially part of cream server itself are which are outside and this should ease also extensibility we already work has started into this direction which you'll see later how does this modular approach work and it's possible because frame is based on very standard standards from the so-called area of linguistic linked data and other standards related to language processing we are put into action in free so we have four standard live natural language processing interchange format for representing digital content and richmond information in the form of elastic menu based on the name data stack stack razmik on two legs lemon forward for representing lexion formation to be used for improving machine translation output for example as we internalization text set for representing various types of a mutual information and standardized manner for example related to terminology or named entities and verse for general linked data technology stick frame is built on the outcomes of our projects we Europeans M framework programme which have pushed the standard format like for example iterated Falcon some of these standards are not standards in the following sense yet but cream should also help to evaluate in which area is a need for formal standardization to make deployments when also from legal aspects so to say it safe so we don't do live demos here also to be safe in terms of timing but we have prepared for webinar various examples how to work with a framework and they are linked here from the slides it's as you have seen that based framework so that will be free mains evoking winds evoking HTTP requests we have used google chrome plugin postmen to create these requests so that they can be revoked be a Linux to curl of the browser via jquery and in the filing tier you will see various examples and that's a show using local or jQuery so let's start with a simple example API call how to call frame maybe eyes this here is how such a call can look like it can be analyzed like what's written here in the slides and is also available in the set of examples so request is made to be API for the e entity service the service veteran richest content left named entities the input forward of condoms in this case just plain text has made explicit by in format text here content to enrich is welcome to the city of Prague here given as the input the language of a content is English as said body English parameter the data set to be used for enrichment is dbpedia
