 good morning friends today we are going to talk about a very serious topic that is Korean I'm going to talk about Korea steam assessment in grade 11 and 12 now as we all know after tenth there are only four possible options in our Indian education system either you can go for science a group or you can go for science B group or you can go for commerce or you can go for arts then you move on to grade 11 by this time you have all taken a choice out of these four possible options and you are pursuing your stream either in science a group or B group or commerce or arts I am going to talk about today that how to assess whether you are in a right stream or not end if you are in a right stream what are the career options post finishing 12th and if you find a disconnect with the stream which you've already chosen what are the possible career options which are alternative to the pure stream which you are following most confusing question after choosing stream in grade 11 which children face is are they in the right stream what should they do next should they go for the pure stream that is for science a group engineering or science B group medicine or commerce which is a pure stream in itself and arts which is pure stream in itself what courses should I plan to enroll for if you have to shift and should you go with the herd listen to your parents or carve your own path well starting with the first advice don't listen to everyone a lot of people come and talk to you about various possible career options the first set of people who interact with you are your parents second set of people who interact with you are your teachers third set of people who interact with you are your peer groups parents now there is a possibility that all the people whom you interact with may not have the complete knowledge or understanding of various possible career options a successful CA would always come back and say finance or CA is an excellent career choice but a CA who did a lot of work and could not make it to a good level would come back and say ca there is a lot of effort which goes in becoming a CA but returns against the investment are not sufficient so I think it is an individual perspective which makes a particular stream good or bad for somebody what we are going to talk about is what suits you the best never blindly follow friends or trends there are a lot of parents who come back to me and say sir which is one of the most happening career these days I tell them just one thing Madame Bollywood now every career cannot be as happening as Bollywood and I think identifying or finding the career which is happening itself is a wrong question what you should look at is which is the most suitable career to you based on your own skillset based on your own aptitude that is what we are going to talk in detail about today there are three types of children and I am sure each one of you sitting in this room will be able to identify what category you fall in the first type of children are the children who we call academic oriented children they are those children who are studious who are interested in books and who love to spend time on researching through books and/or internet they are the children Jennifer nicknamed a Mahatma SATA other Papa markets in a book like yang or aqua friends are focal Nikola Berlin Tojo academic oriented child here whoa book una prefer Carrera Baja collagenous a second category of children are children whom we call as people oriented children they are those children gingka vanilla cremeux homogeneity jitna Manjula me but cheap carnem a counseling car name a mare American Amy bought Masada there the children were social creatures who can easily relate to people and who find it easy to interact and communicate even with strangers they are people oriented children and the third category are those children Jen cannot openelec name a masata nonagon Camila Angela may masata bus may or marathon high oxygen bar thinker day these are those children who are good at creative things like drawing dance art crafts music sports acting dancing and so on there the children were always interested in doing new and innovative things now the best part is each one of you have all these three orientations with you only differences you are high on what average on what or low on what you can be high at academic and people both orientations but low on creativity you can be average on all three orientations or you can be high on people orientation average on academic orientation low on creative orientation or you may be low on academic and people orientation but very high young creative orientation that's okay just what you have to find out is what is your orientation graphs and I believe after identifying this each one of you would know that you lie in what graphs category once you've identified that then identifying that whether you are in the right stream or not plus should you continue with the pure stream or switch to some other stream becomes absolutely easy how let's discuss who should take science a group specifically how many of you might have also been from taken might have also taken science a group a child who goes for science a group should be very high at academic orientation other two orientations if you're high or average or low does not really make much or difference now a child who has taken science a group can go for engineering or architecture can become a scientist or a mathematician you can go for piloting get into astronomy or become a naval officer these are the career options which are available after science a group but what you have to check for yourself identifying whether you are in the right stream or not is you should take science a group or should have taken science a group if and only if you were excellent in science especially with physics and mathematics so the benchmark which I give to the children is that in mathematics you have to be 95 plus and in science you have to be 85 plus in grade 10 first benchmark to choose science a group second are you curious in knowing how machines work you should have this natural tendency of getting attracted towards machines how do they work how do they operate and getting more understanding and knowledge about it third do you have the ability to spend long hours with books and/or computers now there are lot of children who might be 95 plus percent in grade 10 want to take science a group but when I ask them can you sit and study for long hours the answer may be no we don't like studying that much if you do not like studying for long hours then science a group may not be the right choice for you my thought process which I wish to share with you guys is science curriculum in grade 11 12 is a vast curriculum it requires a lot of labor it requires a lot of hours of study and if you are mentally not prepared to given so many hours into study then taking up science a group may not result in two very good marks at grade 12 level and/or you may also lose interest in the coming two years you should have good logical and reasoning skills and you should be willing to spend less time in fun activity if you fit in all these categories and you've taken science a group you are at the right place but if you feel that somewhere you are not fitting relax options of change after grade 12 are still in plenty available to all of us what are those options I will talk at the later part in this presentation moving on to the science P group who should have taken science P group I need a child to be very high on academic orientation and also high on people orientation if you go ahead and take science B group because size big group requires a lot of interaction with human profile also so if you want to become a doctor or dentist to homeopathy Ayurveda doctor physiotherapist nurse or a veterinarian then you should take science P group but what you need to check with yourself are you excellent in science and specially you are very comfortable with biology that is 95 plus in biology do you have an excellent memorization power so I say if your memorization power is amazing then and only then going for science B group make sense do you have the ability to spend long hours with books and our computers do you have ability to work in high pressure situations with many people around and crisis situation and are you willing to spend less time on fun activity that means again size B group curriculum in grade 11 and 12 is also a bust curriculum you require a lot of man-hours to be put in to cope up with the subject area of science B group if you are ventually not prepared or you do not fit into any of these areas then sailing through grade 11 and 12 is great you will be able to do it but post that getting into the pure stream may not be the right choice as I said before if you wish to shift or we plan to feel or we feel that we may not be comfortable with science B group as a power stream what are the alternate options I will discuss in the later part of this presentation who should take commerce if a child is high to very high in academic orientation then and only then you should take commerce plus Commerce open door to becoming the CA CS you can become a financial analyst investment analyst stock broker tax auditor banker or a nectarine now there are lost children from commerce background specifically who enter into commerce and when they see their peer group their thought process is I want to become a seal and when I ask them are you very good at mathematics and you like accounts the answer may be yes or maybe no if the answer is yes then my next question to them is are you comfortable sitting and studying for long hours because again see as the curriculum requires a lot of Labor if you are mentally not prepared to put in that much more of labour then CA may not be the right choice and if you are anyways uncomfortable with the counselor subject and you are not very comfortable with mathematics then again going for a profession which deals with finance and bottom line with the numbers itself becomes a challenging situation for you in that case you should not pursue the pure stream of Commerce but what you need to check that whether you are in the right stream are meant for the pure stream or not are you good at mathematics and you like accounts economics business management has subjects you have good analytical skills you have liking for numbers and data analysis and you are comfortable in spending time and analyzing data in form of company's financial statements either physically or on computer if you fit in all these areas and you've taken commerce you are at the right stream but if you feel some where you fit in these areas but you do not wish to put in so much more of efforts which might be required to become a financial advisor or moving on to the scale of finance getting into areas like becoming a CA or a CS or a ICWA then we might require to shift the field post wealth what I will share with you in the later part of the presentation moving on to arts if you are average at people orientation and you are average at academic orientation and you wish to get into area like becoming a political scientist or a psychologist historian geographer anthropologist archaeologist philosopher or a public administrator then you should go and take up arts but do check the following things in arts you should be good at subjects like English history geography civics at grade 10 level you should have good Theory reading and retention power you should be good observer of people society social needs monuments human behavior maps etcetera and you should be comfortable in communicating even with strangers if you have these qualities and you've taken some humanities or arts as a subject wish to go for a pure stream you are at the right place if not then you might require to switch your field post grade 12 now I am coming to general courses which are available to students from all streams there is a possibility that you may not wish to go into the pure stream which you've already taken as I explained before for science a group it's engineering science B group it is medicine for commerce it is finance and for Humanities it is pure arts if you do not wish to get into any of these pure streams and you wish to switch your stream post grade 12 then what are the possible options and what are the requirements for those options is what I am going to share moving to the first possible option if you are very hired people orientation and you are decently high at academic orientation plus you have very good ability to think and argue logically the ability to have do a lot of reading you have ability to communicate well with the different kinds of people and you have interest in politics sense societal needs or social issues then you should go for law now law is coming to be one of the excellent curriculum it is a curriculum meant for people who are wanting to create a difference or change in the society so if there is something wrong happening on the road and it comes from your insight that this is wrong what is happening or do something against this then you may be the right material for getting into area like law next if you are very good at people orientation and you are also good at creativity and creative orientation along with that you have clean interest in cooking and serving both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food I repeat because hotel management has a curriculum requires you to be very comfortable with preparing and serving non-vegetarian food it becomes something which is mandatory along with that you are extremely innovative and creative you have interest and knowledge about various cuisines you are able to identify the difference between an Italian a Mexican or continental a Chinese and Indian and your tongue as well as your hand in cooking both are excellent in differentiating hotel management can be an excellent field for you if you are very good at people orientation but your average at academic orientation along with you have excellent leadership skills you have keen interest in business transactions financial management marketing personal management you have good teamwork abilities and you are willing to spend long hours in a very disciplined fashion then business management can be an excellent stream for you initially the moment it used to come business management down in front of you the only thought used to be MBA that is Masters in Business Administration now there are a lot of excellent courses at post twelfth bachelor's level in business management which you can join for example you can join I am in dot for a five-year integrated BBA plus mba program you can join three-year business management programs at places like symbiosis places like nursery Manjhi Bombay and so on so business management can be excellent provided you fit in all these areas next if your average at creativity and people orientation you have flair for writing and language you are inquisitive have a very good questioning nature your ability to work for long hours with Delhi question on a single issue and you have ability to handle different types of people then the curriculum which can best suit you can be a curriculum in the area of mass communication and/or Media Studies post twelfth if your language is very strong and you want to pursue a career in the area of language then media and communication can be an excellent field next if you are average at creative orientation and people orientation along with that you like multiple subjects you want some more time to identify what you're like that means you are really not very short today that which subjects interest you or which subjects you are able to do very well then Liberal Studies can be an excellent choice in Liberal Studies actually you can choose your own subjects and study what you like you are supposed to study a bouquet of subjects in the initial phase of this graduation and then you can choose a specialization depending upon your interest area so Liberal Studies can be an excellent curriculum for children who are still not decided or want to explore something more next if your average at creative orientation and average at academic orientation along with that you have to ability to think logically you have interest in coding and computer languages you have interest in hardware and computer and networking and you have the ability to sit for long hours on computers not just facebooking and what zapping but genuinely working on computers then computer applications can be an excellent field a lot of children have this mindset that getting into computer applications or computers as a field you require mathematics compulsory in grade 11 and 12 answer is no you do not require mathematics in grade 11 12 even if you've done Commerce or Arts in grade 11 and 12 where you have not taken mathematics still you can go for computer applications provided you have a very strong interest in computers next if you are very high in your creativity you have good visualization and drawing skills you have interest in designing creating new and innovative things and if you are having very good creativity overall then design can be an excellent field and these days there are lot of excellent institutions at undergraduation level which are coming up with a degree that is known as bachelor in design that can be an excellent field along with that you can go for a degree which is known as bachelor in fine arts and so on lastly if you are very high at people orientation and you want to genuinely do something for the society you have liked to work for the society you feel strong about social issues you like to help others and understand their feelings you are humane polite and can even fight for the rights of the underprivileged then you can go for something which is known as social work there is a degree which is known as Bachelor in social work and can be followed by a degree known as masters in social just to share with you a beautiful data statistic Ministry of Finance has come up with regulation where every corporate has to spend 2% of their profitability on social work and all these big corporates require people who can spend these budgets for upliftment of the society at large that can be in the area of women empowerment childcare social welfare you know fighting for the rights of the underprivileged or giving more privileges to the underprivileged section of the society and so on so that can be an excellent job opportunity after the bachelor's and master's in social work next if you want to get into public administration you need to be extremely high on your academic orientation as well as people orientation along with that you need to be excellent in your leadership skills you should be comfortable with studying for long hours and should have the ability to retain the red stuff whatever you're reading you should be able to retain that you should have good teamwork abilities ability to handle high-pressure situations and willingness to work for longer hours in a very disciplined fashion if you have this public administration can be an excellent thing for you becoming a teacher again you need to be very high on academic orientation also very high in people orientation along with that the skill set which you require is you need to have patience you need to be telogen in the subject which you are teaching you need to have good communication skills student handling skills and presentation skills willingness to work for long hours in a very disciplined and dedicated fashion if you have that teaching again can be an excellent profession finally I move on to some skill based courses if we do not wish to continue academics so strong but move on to an area which will exhibit your skill better than your academic orientation you can go into any of these areas you want to become a DJ BJ RJ you want to become an artist painter sculptor cartoonist musician dance professional designer astrologist sports personal what you require for getting into these areas is a very high creativity a very strong passion to go deep into the discipline love for the chosen career dedication hard work and discipline and inner desire to be the best so and one thing last if you want to move on to the Armed Forces you can join army Air Force or Navy few years back only science a group students were permitted to get into Armed Forces but now in the area of administration and logistics even non science students can join the Defense Forces for that you should be ready to handle the crisis situation you need to be extremely disciplined and adventurous hard-working good leadership skills ability to follow directions and you should be ready to even lay your life for the country still if you want to go into piloting in Air Force or in the technical area in Indian Navy then you require science a group otherwise from any stream you can join the Defense Forces in other areas finally quickly wrapping up career paths after grade 10 after standard 10 you can either go for science a group or B group or you can go for commerce or you can go for arts and humanities but beyond that in the pure stream of science as I said you can go for medicine engineering or pure sciences in commerce you can go for become or higher areas of finance like a CSI CW in or you can go for Humanity's and then go for pure humanities like Bachelor and not send them going for master's in art if you want to shift your field post grades 12 then a lot of streams which are open for all students of science commerce or arts can be shifting can shifts to areas like law hotel management business management integrated BBA
