 so my philosophy of teaching Chinese well it's very interesting process because when I started I knew one method and I thought that was the best in the world to do drill instructor you know like drill the students all the time make them repeat but throughout the years I realize they can say certain things but they could not have a conversation so there they can do well and task that doesn't mean they can go I'll have a conversation so I think I've evolved and I right now I think the main philosophy for me is to have a welcoming environment to help students to speak the language not to talk about the language so that's my current full of philosophical idea so everything I do is to carry this out and create an environment for this philosophy so so I did a lot right for the past few years I start started changing and I did a lot they said the scaffold scaffolding instructions and very student-centered construction I used to be very teacher centered it's a very efficient don't get me wrong it's very effective too you keep the you kept the students on their toes they have to you know purge it back right away but really and I got this evaluation one year and it's all the teachers and is incredible she was so good I wish I can learn how to speak I'm saying what does that mean and you you spoke well and I realized he was doing the drill pattern he can say certain sentence when I asked him to say it and repeat after me but have him to have a natural conversation it was really difficult so that dawned on me I start changing and I try to attend conference and workshop not related to just teaching Chinese more like how to educate people more education and how to create environment for all students feel safe so I adapt those philosophy in my course to so my my philosophy is a working welcoming environment that means building a community for student feel very safe to speak the language in this community they're not afraid to make mistakes and they're they always volunteer their opinions that's my goal the first step as I said my philosophy is to create a welcoming environment to build a community so for example I am recently two years ago I went to a workshop called responsive classroom responsive responsive classroom is geared to a K to 12 is talking about it's more it's more treating the younger kids try to get rid of the behavior issue I don't need to do in my classroom but I think there are strategy there's actually works first thing they do is building community so for example I do the first week of my course and these are hard to learn there or didn't know how to speak but they are so embarrassed with them because they would tell me my pronunciation is bad I don't speak to anybody else only to my parents I don't want to speak in a classroom so basically I do the greeting the very easy things they're comfortable where the forces to talk about their name what their major they can all speak these you know in Chinese so what I do is the first day like that and they started I build into a routine so every class I spent five to ten minutes every day we call greet every class not every day we don't have an everyday class call greeting basically you I asked everybody to write their name on the car so I collect the car I put a car in the middle of the classroom so one student I would start because I need to model what it means so I will pick up a student's for instance I say all saralyn's okay and I call her in her Chinese name and I was started saying how are you today you know what did you do last night stuff like that daily life things and then I asked the student did you see what I did so follow my model and come here pickup car greet your classmates so every day I would do this I think after two weeks everybody knows everybody's name and while greeting this is not just simple greeting because you have a natural conversation when you say oh I went to bed really late last night and people I said why you know that so so I started a very structure for instance just everybody's just say very limited things and then I would say okay so Sarah said she went to bed really late last night do you guys want to know why you know all in Chinese so they will start asking so I built on that difficulty so um the weekend the Monday class is really fun they love it because you can talk about your weekend so kids here they did all kinds of activity during the weekends so they're so interested in finding out what their classmate did because they might not know each other summer took classes together so there were complaints in course together in the classroom many teachers probably the thing is a waste of time it's you know really you know what are you talking about that but I think it's through this you built a community so the moment they walk into the classroom after one month they're this they're the you know they could have a test before the top Chinese class the moment I walk into because of this greeting rituals they have to switch their gear into speaking Chinese right away and they because you're having a conversation so you really need to engage your classmates so that's what I mean building a community they feel so freely you can talk about anything they could and they don't know the words they were ask me how do you say this you know this is what I'm doing right now is really blah blah blah so and people really want to find out and I add another component after a few weeks is to buy the time now they already know each other's name so I like to every lesson I ask them to write an ass-ache I give them a topic to write an essay so I will ask them for instance I'll say we talk about family so our topic is Chinese family so I want them to go home to write about maybe Italian family or Spanish family so the structure model on the textbook so nobody knows what other students were writing about right so this time we call sharing so that's sharing parts talk about your what did you write so some students oh I I wrote about Spanish family and I said what was that tell us not just the title what's the content about so they talked about everybody has a chance to talk about quickly and then I said oh this is very interesting so so student well you know ultimate autumn actively natural they just asked why do you pick this topic it's so did you know any Spanish people you know so the natural conversation just flow so it get into a routine so every time they come to my classroom they know there's should speak Chinese and they should talk about their life and that's what a good at they cannot talk about politics they cannot talk about history but they can talk about themselves and so that make them the oral proficiency higher and they can speak much better I just remember there's one student after the Thanksgiving she came back she was so excited she said oh wow wow sure that's how they addressing you as a teacher and he said you know I am I my father had this friend and I always called him uncle he's from China he doesn't speak any English so I met him in New York when there was September I cannot communicate with him at all so during the Thanksgiving my home is so far so I went to my uncle's place and I can talk to him and he kept saying that my Chinese improve and he said oh my god it's only two months I can't believe I can speak the most Chinese even though I speak Chinese with my parents I can't ever speak to anybody and she just came by so excited you know so excited and then so I feel great so I know it worked yeah because to her is talking speaking in Chinese doesn't have to be something she have to think about you know how do I come up with the first sentence anymore because she does that and her in our class every time so it's very natural for her and plus she's you know she actually knows Chinese use it because our background so she crossed the barrier be able to speak to other people which is fantastic
