now we will continue with part three I'm going to ask you some more questions related to the topic of part two are you ready to continue yes then let's talk about special celebrations in life what makes special celebrations such as birthdays and weddings different from other events that's an interesting question can you give me some moment to think about it certainly digital and I believe special celebrations such as birthdays are different from other events and in that a unique individual is the start of the festivities as well these celebrations are on a specific date when the person is born or when they too to get them married why do you think it is important for societies to emphasize special moments in people's lives I'm sure a special celebrations are a critical part of society and the community because it tells members that they are valuable and their friends and family like them and support them in big steps in life do you think there will be special celebrations in the future that don't exist today if yes what will they be that's an unusual question please sir give me a few seconds to think yes yes I'm sure there will be some new types of celebration what we don't have today because we can see from the past traditions change however I have no clue as over DCOP okay let's talk a little bit more about organizing special celebrations have you ever organized some type of special celebration tell me about it yes and I have just last month I organized my best friend Julia's birthday I invited all of our friends and family for some food and bowling it was tons of fun and we enjoyed a should me together and even had some fantastic birthday cake what are some of the common challenges of organizing a celebration for someone and how can these be handled I think the most frequent challenge is scheduling it can be hard it can be difficult to organize everyone's time so it is convenient for our friends and family to attend I know the best reason one of the best ways to manage this is to plan early and the infant they invited as soon as possible of the intended plans if you could be in charge of organizing one big special event in your life what would it be and why I would love to be in charge to organize my best friend's wedding I have many great ideas about how to make it an unforgettable experience for her and all our friends and family I know this is going to be the most special days in her life and I would love to be able to have a chance to arrange this for her that's the end of part 3 and that concludes the speaking section of the IELTS exam do you have any questions for me no I don't have okay thank you Monica then you should have your IELTS results in about two weeks time and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day okay okay thank you so much yes what did you finish watching the interview great what did you think what do you think this candidate did well what do you think she could improve well there are definitely a few steps that this candidate does an excellent job to get such a high score first of all she pays careful attention to each question the examiner asks she thinks about the question takes her time and then gives a full complete response notice that when she needs time to think about a good answer she often buys time by using phrases like that's an interesting question can you please give me a moment this is an excellent strategy and I highly recommend that you do this especially in part 3 because part 3 the questions are often quite tricky they're not questions you hear every day even a native speaker would have to think about these questions before giving a response so don't rush take your time this is absolutely okay as long as you give a good complete answer learn to buy time with these types of expressions like hmm I've never thought about that before can you please give me a moment also this candidate uses a wide range of vocabulary and grammar she uses the present perfect the past perfect the continuous form this shows a strong grasp of the English language in addition her answers include logical reasons and specific examples it's very important that you try to give clear logical responses to these questions for example when the examiner asks is one difficulty of organizing events her response is scheduling most people will agree that scheduling is the most logical answer to this question if your answers are too creative you can get lost and get confused so I don't recommend this keep it simple keep it logical also make sure that you find any topic the examiner asks you interesting remember you need to get a high score you cannot think about these questions as they're boring or I don't care about this or I know nothing about this even if you don't like the topic pretend you must pretend and you must convince yourself that this is exciting and interesting for you this will help you to get a high score you can clearly see from the way that this candidate responds to this questions that she seems interested she seems excited about the topic all right make sure that you practice these strategies at home watch the video again if you didn't understand everything you can also watch it with or without subtitles to help improve your comprehension and good luck on your next exam to see the rest of this lesson and to see the other parts of
