 alright so we are team for we are vehicle gesture control our technology is a vehicle gesture control system that you can put inside of your car you'll be able to control features such as your radio your headlights and your dome light and you'll be able to control these with just hand gestures our system is designed to be intuitive and not require any wearables so we're using a product called a leap motion it uses infrared sensors to graph hand movements as you can see here on the screen I'll swap sides it recognizes a hand and we have it programmed to recognize certain gestures so for example if you do a finger circle it'll send circles this will turn the volume up in the car alternatively you can rotate the other way and turn the volume down so to talk a little bit about the details of the project so starting off we have the user gesture which is inputted into the leap the leap sends the signal to a laptop and then the laptop sends the signal to the Arduino and the Arduino relays the information to a steering wheel interface as well as the the turn lights and signals and then we actually have a demo over here where you can see the the whole system in action the presentation demo that we built for the project you can see here the leap motion controller and I'm going to run through a couple of the gestures that it will recognize to control the radio that you can see so if i do circles this way you can see that it turns the volume up on the system and if i turn my finger the other way then it's going to turn it down if I point to the right it's going to change to the next track and if I point back the other way then it resets I can do other things like control the lights of the system as well so if I were to swipe my hand up you can see up here that we have headlights simulated with LEDs and so if I swipe up again we turn on the high beams if I swipe down we turn on the low beams and if I swipe right then it turns on the turn signal we can also do the other one on the other side another feature of the headlight system is you can make a fist and you can control the dimmer control within the console and everybody's favorite Wolfpack pride and that's kind of a that's kind of how the system works as a whole
