 hi everybody this is Anastasia from into lab and as you may know we're getting ready for a pretty big release pretty soon in three phase version 5.4 and in this video I'd like to give you a little sneak peek for what's in store for you so the new release has several pretty exciting features but right now I'd like to talk to you about having to be facing braces design for accessibility we work together with Paolo to Shalini and Microsoft production studios to figure out how we can help you design interactive experiences for individuals with disabilities meaning individuals that are either visually impaired have difficulties hearing or have mobility limitations the new release will include three features to help you make inclusive experiences that are designed for everybody the first is a text-to-speech feature this feature enables you to synthesize the text from your experience into speech it will only be available windows for the moment and it works with all the languages that are installed on your Windows machine the next one is the keyboard events now this was a popular request we got it from many of you and it's finally here you can create triggers based on different keys pressed on your keyboard or devices similar to a keyboard like a click and the last one is the gestures on asset this enables you to create areas in your experience where the user will be able to do gestures on specifically designed areas of your experience gestures such as wipe left right or all the other gestures that intuitive sports and now I'm going to pass the mic to my colleague Sebastian's that will work you through these features and more details and show you how to use them ok let's see how it works so the three new features text-to-speech keyboard triggers and justice and static assets we will also publish a new sample which would be revisited version of The Da Vinci the museum sample I don't have the current the final name of the experience but it will basically we use the damage is simple and adapt it to blind people using the text speech and the keyboard triggers so this will be the design accelerator for the text to speech here you will be able to say hello to type the text you want to read aloud and then to select the voice if here if you have some speakers you will hear Anna saying hello world and on my machine I have several English languages several English voices installed so you can select the one you want to use in your experience let's see how it works and let's use the keyboard triggers and the justice to control this carousel as I mentioned these three features have been developed based on the collaboration with Microsoft production studios and Paolo one of our interface experts so let's go back to edit mode into the accessibility right so this is a better version of the interface five dot for composer but is going to be released middle of April so first thing the text-to-speech what I'm going to say is that what I'm going to rotate this carousel it's going to say artwork biography top museums to do that i will add some triggers on the carousel itself this one is not based on an exit five but it could and it would be actually simple if you have some kind of database to automate synthesizing the text so here on the couch that i would do it for the first one when the carousel which is the index number one that's this one okay then I will current action on my text to speech interface asset it has a start synthesis method will to text here i would say artwork so when the cursor is going to spin and to reach the index number one to read aloud artwork and you will do the same for the other ones so just repeat the same mechanism and say of this one which will be biography right here is the interface set text to speech you will find it and here is my panel the accessibility category text to speech that's it and it has three main properties the voice name with some help about that the volume and the speed so you can adjust these three properties for the text to speech so that's one featuring honestly the davinci simple will is illustrated quite a lot it will also embed a configuration scene when you can select the voice among the ones which are installed on your machine and we all have a big article about that on the knowledge base explaining how to install new voices etc it works see on my Windows 7 machine it will work it works also of course on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 so next one the keyboard triggers first thing here in the project settings you will see a new property navigate using a row keys if it's if it's checked like it is right now by default using the left and right keys or up and down keys will move you to the next scene or preview scene don't have to add any triggers on all the sins its global navigation using the arrow keys of your keyboard typically when you have a PowerPoint clicker it simulates this kind of arrow keys so it will work the same way now you can override with triggers and this is what I'm going to do here so the keyboard triggers belongs to the scene itself right its global so here on my sin I can add a new trigger and have a new trigger category key presses you have some specific keys like this one so here I'm going to use not the left and right because I want to keep them for my navigation but let's say the up and down so let's start with the down when the down key is pressed then I want my carousel to navigate to the next item right and when I can duplicate this one nope I want to duplicate here the trigger itself and say when a pro is pressed then I want to do previous all right now you can also have more complex key combinations here if you select that field and use your keyboard for example I would say control add s it takes the input your keyboard input as the parameter itself so you can create some expert combinations for example for the administrator to enter a hidden seen on the chaos to configure something or you can use the ctrl enter to do something in addition to what's going to happen when you press the enter key the return key right so I have all these keys and the arroz want left right up and down will override the default navigation triggers if you enable them in the project settings so let's hold it keyboard triggers and the last one is gestures on static assets so you remember that on the scene you have the gesture here just to detect it and you had a list of all the gestures you could use now you have nice icons so it's easy to understand what this dress is all you don't have to go into the documentation to see them right and this one isn't seen now if I select my rectangle here I will find in the touch category the same gesture detected so I can say here when I get a swipe left at this one on this rectangle then on the cowshed I will do next so you can have multiple areas on your scene handling the same gesture swipe left and it will do different actions so you get the better behavior a more precise behavior as what you have earlier with the scene gesture recognition on so that's it for the accessibility enablement of course for lots and lots of scenarios to imaging with these three features and we continue to post them on the community to share all your ideas about what you are going to do with the Texas page the keyboard triggers and the gestures and static assets
