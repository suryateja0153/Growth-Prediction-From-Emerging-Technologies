 hey what's up everyone this is wicked and tonight I had the honor and the pleasure to show you the latest version of I'll be wrong lolli wrong which is kind of a combination between Samsung Galaxy s7 features s6 Note 4 and note 5 so I'm gonna get to all of them but before of course I will talk about the design part the performance part and then we'll talk about the battery life so take a look at the beginning of this video it is 83% so we're going to be taking a look at the percentage at the end of the video take in mind that my device is now running LTE so LTE mobile mobile network mode as you may see LTE so without further ado let's get into the design part since it is a galaxy s7 brand-new interface it borrows some some themes some you know some animations from the galaxy s7 6.0.1 a marshmallow I like the recent side panel this is the recent sub panel that was borrowed from the galaxy s7 so this is how it looks like you'll have some a little bit of lag here but not such a big deal otherwise it is pretty self-explanatory how the design looks like it's this ROM is based on sorry this ROM is based on latest firmware from samsung 5.0 point one lollipop pa1 so as we see RB is 9500 in one version eight eight point zero so this is how it looks like again another cool design feature that with this room is this beautiful notification bar this cell looks like and this is how it looks extended with bunch of features we're going to be getting true in the following moments so talking about the design part I'm gonna be opening some apps just to show you that it is rockin beautiful galaxy s6 node 5 node 4 s7 apps and this is how they look like again opening messages and from these app openings it may already know that you may already feel and see that it's pretty fluid if we open up the camera app as you may see we have a themed camera app with themed icons and let's get into the performance part right now because you saw every kind of every application that comes with this ROM you know use your stuff so let's get into the performance part I have done a under to batch an untouchable under to my benchmark and take a look at the score I got it's a pretty decent score it is a thirty four thousand seventy one it's pretty pretty good take in mind that it has borrowed things from other devices which you weren't optimized for this type of hardware it is pretty cool it's a great school but otherwise it doesn't really the numbers doesn't really matter if you in my opinion because it the really the only thing that you need to take into consideration is that is how your phone feels in your hand feels and behaves so there's not such a big point in concentrating on these numbers let's take a look at the weather widget in ray if you want to know how to flash this ROM make sure you follow up the card right there taking my that you'll have to flash the latest modem with the same base as this ROM is and now also put a link there in order to help you have to flash your modem and of course in the description the link to the mode and the link to the files that you need to do to download and to flash into recovery so performance part great now let's get into the features of this room because there are tons and features that we want to discuss first of all let's activate multi window this is the multi window default one you can of course you can open up in a pop-up mode like this but you can also expand them like this and you can always get into floating mode by you know swiping from the from either the left or the right top screen corner border or whatever you may call it so you may also activate another app in multi window for example my files like this and why not memo like this so you can do a bunch of different things including playing with with a floating window and multi window okay let's get back here let me focus we have ultra power saving mode and power saving mode let's get into ultra power saving mode this is a well known port let's see if it works so as you may see it's turning off all the unimportant features and keeps the default applications as main critical applications so yeah it works perfectly how do you dx8 it turn ultra power saving mode off I was searching for the treetops menu in order to you know click option key will work as recent side panel okay let's get back into the features because they are bunch of them that do you want to be keyboard ever view an error gesture is self-explanatory we all know what they do because the original came with the galaxy s4 really mode Do Not Disturb option hands-free mode screen mirroring I don't know if this is working perfectly since you know since I don't have a you know a Bluetooth device or something like that to connect my screen to it but we can connect we can test out the Bluetooth because I have here at least a little hands-free which I'm gonna be turning on also the Bluetooth and let's see if it if it is popping out or something yes it's mushy bluetooth pairing request yes okay and it is connected the phone audio and now it's flashing like it's connected we have here smart lock new boot device paired keep your screen lock by adding as your trusted device yes so what is this all about for example you have a pattern or something or a code regarding the lockscreen if you want to unlock your device while connecting to this you won't be able to enter it because it's recognized as a trusted device so this is a trusted device yes ad so this is a device that let me show you actually let's test this feature also because this is an in-depth review and we want to talk about everything naming service is ready okay so for example let me set up a pattern yeah this is pretty pretty difficult to see but let's set it like this um like this actually yes and yes again and back up pin yes okay and let's see if it's working so actually no but you your device is unlocked well connect which you set as a trusted device to force your device to lock turn the screen off and then turn it on and touch the lock icon ok so right now it's working because it's connected to a trusted device but if we deactivate it then you'll be able to see that it is no longer safely locked so I'll put this a hands feet away from me and now let's get back into the features we have toolbox we have also download booster sidekick panel and of course the self-explanatory flashlight sounds pretty pretty porn ish flashlight so yeah so let's see the toolbox with Apple you can take up you can take a screenshot with this this is the extended power menu and of course this is the menu that opens up pops up when you want to edit a screenshot this is the side kick panel you can position it either on the left side or the right side for example let's say we're into phone app and we want to get to this screen to the home screen that's how it works okay screenshot screenshot captured you can also delete it from here so um yep that's pretty much it with the features now let's get into settings and see if we find something now different and unusual in the lock screen settings you'll get a default let's get rid of this pattern and show you to swipe you will get the default unlock effects the public colors let's see the light effect I think you're really familiar with the ink in water the popping colors we just saw the water color this is really cool take a look at this let me focus the geometric mosaic and I think I'll stick to the water called beaker because it looks pretty awesome you can also set up a wake up command in the lock screen display I heard that it's a bug while you know setting your phone's to extra meaning but I think the battery you know the battery phone - remains the same so I think it's not a bug show battery percentage you can hide this but we won't because we need to know how fast the battery drains out scientific Asians or saving mode again accessibility motion gestures of course everything is working smart screen interview voice control accounts here occasional security battery of course we have we have the brand new action is not a brand new application but it's something that you wouldn't find normal you wouldn't normally find a galaxy s4 is a smart manager that it will help you you know keep control over the battery life the storage random access memory as may see it is 79% used and I haven't really installed anything which may be a - for this ROM because it kinda it's hella lot of memory as we see 80% used 83% used because of this shitty Google Play services everything up sup again and again so yes with some kernel customizations this is running a stock kernel so you may want to again as I told you flash a modem the same base as this ROM is running on in order to make Wi-Fi work but you may also install imperium kernel which will also help you in other ways like setting your selinux Android - from enforcing to I mercy something like that which will help you install VIPRE for example so wiper doesn't work with that function on on and you may also find an application on a Google Play Store which will allow you to easily customize all the settings for example s tweaks but guarding the battery life it I think it was 83% at the beginning of the video yep it was actually 84 to 83 so right now it's 77 take in mind that this review is almost 15 minutes long I I would reckon that this is a modest not the greatest but not the best not the worst actually a battery life for a device that was overhauled with all these features it is a really great great you know performance - battery life ratio so yeah I think that's pretty much it this ROM is a pretty stable and it's wide outlets at minute it's a beautiful room with some kind of lags but they're not present at any time and it also benefits of teams as you may see project hero s4 this is the galaxy s7 s7 story notice for the team we also have home screen settings good transition effects sorry this is how the galaxy s7 theme looks like yeah I can pack because you cannot customize everything so yep I think that's pretty much it so thank you for watching guys if you liked my video please make sure it comes up and subscribe bye down to my channel by doing so you'll keep me motivating doing this kind of stuff again a really quick quick notice I have to tell you it's a sad thing but I cancelled my galaxy s7 order and there are a couple of reasons why I did that the first one is that it doesn't benefit of a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor chips it and the second one is that they disabled they haven't integrated a blaster so they get the got rid of that which which is really bad news so yep Samsung I'm sorry but I'll have to pass this galaxy s7 to in favor of maybe a Galaxy s8 or a note 6 so yeah I'm sorry guys so that means out people you know develop I'll keep alive the video regarding the videos regarding the development on the Galaxy s4 as far as it will be sustained supported sorry my our beautiful developers like I'll be 95 for example so again thank you for watching guys wicked Android is out bye bye
