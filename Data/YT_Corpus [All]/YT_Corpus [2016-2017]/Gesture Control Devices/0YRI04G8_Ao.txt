regardless which tool is currently selected if you are using a mechanical analog or IP PTZ camera you can bring up the PTZ controls at any point by clicking the PTZ controls tool in the toolbar or selecting it from the Tools menu this enables both the on-screen PTZ controls and the PTZ controls below the system Explorer when controlling a mechanical ptc the same mouse controls as digital PTZ will also control the optical zoom as well as the mechanical panning of the camera when scrolling the mouse wheel up with a mechanical PTZ will control the optical zoom to zoom in when scrolling the mouse wheel down with a mechanical pdz it will optically zoom out the onscreen PTZ controls will control the panning of the camera as you click in a highlighted direction within the image the unit

menu finally you can click the lock icon to prevent other users from controlling the PTZ functionality of this device whether or not you have the permission to lock access to a ptc device is defined during set-up of initial user permissions thank you for your attention you should now have a general understanding and layout of the vigil on control center client including logging in and out of servers viewing live video panning tilting and zooming both digitally and with mechanical P disease and a general understanding of using image panels and views
