 what is up YouTube once again welcome back to - a madman my name is Ruben aka the madman this is a special extra video for this week we all know I do one video a week but I found some cool things I really wanted to share with you guys out there figured it might be helpful to someone out there because it's helpful to me once I figure it out so just when I stressing knowledge this specifically made people who use touchscreen computers and they want to use gaming with them things like the Lenovo yoga the you know both ink pads the surface surface pro pro 2 pro 3 all of these will work there is an artsy version of this software we show you guys today this go to their website or go to steam and it can walk you through getting the RT version as far as the forum does tell me now all the people it was came real quickly I have not tried the RT version yet I've only used the one for then x86 x64 platforms but from what I've seen on the forums it is an artsy compatible version but let's get back to the information I got the us today because you can see I'm you reporting my desktop on my surface pro I'm like I said before I'm a huge gamer and this wasn't awesome fine for me so I can use actual gaming software on my surface on the go surface is very powerful as are most of the laptops out there for Windows 8 and Windows 10 that are touchscreen biggest problem was no mouse no keyboard you really can't do much for a lot of the more powerful or more fun games out there that isn't so yeah I found this so this is called gesture works gameplay you can find it on Steam only two dollars for the core software an extra dollar for the DLC the bells voice initial add-ons which you'll sell show you in a couple seconds exactly how you can set that up but as you can see it has a list of games pre-installed and what it does is gives you a virtual controller as you can use to play the game so you'll see here I have DMC or don't make fry which is the most recent double make live game but what really people didn't like it but I liked it so I play this program does give you options to actually control our games using touchscreen interface so if I go to this one and edit it we're now seeing my layout that I made specifically for this game you can download pre-made ones from a lot of different users out there with a lot of great things this one originally was a premade layout but I did a little editing because a couple things that were missing particularly an enter button which is needed to get past their tutorial from the beginning and a few pop-up second off here and there but as you can see now I have everything here so I can control each and every part of the game that would be a keyboard for normally using a on screen layout so if I tap one of the buttons here you'll see you get a key binding here that shows you exactly what each little mapped key will control now what actually with a keyboard function you can change the skin so get a whole bunch of different options to make it look however you want or on your keyboard so everything here you'll notice has different key bindings the notice that how it works it functions so it can emulate what it would be like to have a keyboard and mouse in your setup so now I want your gonna open up the game and show you how it launches so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna minimize this you can't you can close it very easily it doesn't have to be open while it's running it will run the back button to maintain functionality while you're there I'm just gonna pop this out want to expand my window a bit so I can get everything in and now much you know launch DMC wall gesture which is running in the background the launch the actual title in you're going to see exactly what happens okay this cup cycles for the game load up depending on your computer and for gesture works to pick up the game is running so I'm just going to get click open here so what happens after this point the game recognizes that gesture which is running this way around the game is running then you're gonna start seeing a couple of really interesting things including this an on screen actual layout now you know a little lag here because I'm recording with this however it's normally I get about 35 to 40 frames per second as you get 64 seconds more higher on my attachable laptop well on a surface I can't complain whatsoever so as you can see here this is a great software once again is gesture esteem play on the leave a link for it in description below you can get it on Steam prior to bucks you can get the DLC for voice control women haven't toilet too much but there is an option for voice control I'll show you that in one second as you cannot add voice feature to it but as you can see what I mean you see the start button here and start and the game will fun to function and we'll see the keyboard is working just like that but it's here just to control them I have an actual gamepad or machine to function a great stuff it's also neat the game now to have an action that games with too much just testing it out I go back to my desktop I share a few more features and medium itself I go back to gesture works I'm gonna see here a couple different control schemes you have voice you have touch you have motion and sensor so if you ask them the games like driving games would let that where you want for that blur for me for speed that do have a couple of games that are compatible with them like the surface surface is a very powerful machine without stronger laptop that has a video card and so on and I'll put some driving simulators you can actually add an accelerometer support using the motion feature so you can have your direction your display a pinch and drag head tilting based on the camera voice control which is certain phrases you can add it to it so things like mmo's i know there is a DOTA layout here you actually can add voice control to give commands directly to your team so just wonder chef but you guys i hope someone out there can make some use of it i know i have once again this is on Steam it is a paid software but it's not something that you really have to come out of pockets for heavy for $2 a good shows great software and give you real compatibility with your touchscreen computers and games what's the fun of having a powerful touchscreen laptop if you can't use the touchscreen to play games maybe that's just my opinion in any case this been my no madman thank you John remember to Like comment and subscribe and I will see you guys in the next video peace
