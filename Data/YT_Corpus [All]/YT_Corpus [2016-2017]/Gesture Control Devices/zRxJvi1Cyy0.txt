 Congratulations on downloading the Smyle Mouse-- the software that allows one to control their computer using facial gestures captured by a simple webcam. The first thing you want to do when you run the Smyle Mouse software is to select what webcam you'll be using. So in my case, I'm going to click on the only option which is the webcam built into my laptop. I'm going to go ahead and click 'OK'. And now the software will undergo a very quick calibration period. So during calibration, simply do what it asks you to. And in no time, the cursor is already mapped to your head motions! Now when looking at this main window here, there are two main key components to take note of. Number one, look at the camera view. It's essentially what the webcam is seeing. The first thing you'll probably notice about the camera view is the green lines highlighting my facial features, such as my eyebrows and mouth. This is essentially the software's way of letting you know how well it's able to track your head motions as well as facial expressions. You'll notice that if I sit far away from the camera, those lines might change color. And that's simply indicating that it's not able to track may face as accurately. It's also important to sit about an arms length away from the webcam for the software to work at its best. Now beneath the camera view, you'll also see the toolbar, where there are additional options for you to use. These include things like Mouse Motion Modes, Click Options, additional settings, as well as a play, pause, and exit button. We'll get into the additional functionality in subsequent videos. In order to hide the toolbar, simply click on this button right here. Now this allows you to easily resize your window as well. Another important thing to note is one does not necessarily need this window to be maximized for the software to work. You can minimize this window as well.
