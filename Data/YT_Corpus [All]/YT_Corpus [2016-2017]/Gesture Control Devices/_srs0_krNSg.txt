 three percent flex tiles a thin flexible stretchable and easy to fabricate pressure-sensitive tactile input sensor which consists of three layers of fabric we evaluated various materials to find the best setup for the electorate layers we are using deeper fabric which is highly stretchable in either direction as a sensing layer we are using a stretchable pede so resistive fabric for flex tiles we stack the layers of zebra fabric and the pea it's a resistive fabric over each other even when stretched the material keeps its pressure sensing behavior our sensor debugging tool allows us to analyze different pressure levels to demonstrate the benefits of flex tiles we present three prototype applications stitching multiple flex tiles together enables the measurements of large surfaces to demonstrate we covered a couch with three connected flex tiles this allows us to detect different body parts and recognize various interaction gestures you due to its form-fitting ability even complex 3d designs like a steering wheel can be covered this non-obtrusive setup supports tactile pressure sensing as well as swipe gesture recognition the high stretch ability allows flex tiles to be used on deformable shapes we demonstrate this with a wearable which can recognize arm bending and enables touch and swipe interactions we demonstrated flex tiles a flexible stretchable pressure-sensitive tactile influencer which enables pressure mapping of large areas 3d objects and deformable underlying shapes in a non-obtrusive way
