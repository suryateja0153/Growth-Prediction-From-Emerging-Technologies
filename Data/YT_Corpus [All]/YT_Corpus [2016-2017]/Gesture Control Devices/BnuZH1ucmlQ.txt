 this is probably the most interesting thing i've seen so far at CSUN i'm in the sesame enable booth with Oded bendell and what is this product call it's called the Open Sesame and this is an application overlay for android is that correct that's correct it lets you control android devices smartphones and tablets completely hands-free so this is for people with motor control disabilities that's right people with spinal cord injuries multiple cirrhosis cerebral palsy and more okay very cool so we're going to do a demonstration I'm going to have to describe this or if you can describe it it's even better because this is audio and video so the people who can't see are going to also want to be able to hear what you're doing sure alright so the first thing you're going to do keep opponent at him to turn the device on I say Open Sesame and it turns on and searches for my face so we're seeing a camera view right now that's looking at his face and it just turned turned on right and once it's got luck on my face it lets me control this mouse cursor on screen using small head movements like nodding or waving your head so I'm seeing the cursor move around as oded moves his head up and down and right to left just a little tiny bit right that's right and to make to make a swipe or a tap you same place you select a swipe so he just held his head still for just a split second and it opened up a little menu to choose to Swiper to tap that's correct that's exactly correct in this game you see a you can see I'm swiping he's actually playing a game right now he's doing a dock connect game that's right and this is just a game we got off the store it's not ours the technology works with any app you download from the Play Store and of course it's not just games I can leave to the home screen and you'll see so he just hesitated with his head pointed at the home screen and that opened up the menus right and I'll unlock the phone just like you anyone would and now with the home screen and this still works I can open up the app menu again he's just staring in one spot and then well actually it's not your eyes it's just your head correct that's correct its head movements and you can tap you can swipe so it's really anything you and I can do on the phone our audience can do as well this seems really responsive to it's not this isn't messing up he's not having trouble opening things how about if I direct you so we'll see what you can do I want to see Dropbox you want to see Dropbox sure oh okay so he's staying on his apps folder and now he swiped across to the tap and then I select Dropbox and tap again and he just opened up drop by so that so that was not a fake demo that was not a big demo and yeah you can adjust the sensitivity so you can use small head movements or large head movements you can change the amount of time you need to dwell in order to make a click or a tap and then you type with this so you can type yeah I'm not sure all perform on camera right now but we have users who are typing just as fast as you got to get good at this yeah yeah and you know at some point I thought I was the best user because we were developing this for four years and then I met a users of ours who uses it as his phone so he's so much faster than me because imagine you that's the phone you use every day so it's like that data with his head and things are popping up up in a way they're typing is doing everything with the phone oh that is fantastic that must have been so great for you yeah it was yeah I couldn't believe it all right so uh the company's name is sesame enable limited how would people find out more about Open Sesame so go on go online to sesame enable com it's sesame dash enable calm and the devices we're shipping at all worldwide you the US Europe and anywhere really you said device this is an application you add though right right so we're selling pre-install devices currently there is a demo app you can get from the store it's called Open Sesame demo and then you can play around with the interface see that it works for you and if it does then you purchase the phone online I see okay great so it's opened I'm sorry it's just me limited com it's no the website is sesame dash enable dot-com and the app is open sesame demo okay we will we'll have this typed out since I just messed it all up i'll have it on screen and in the article thank you thank you guys so much you
