 I'm drunken from industrial design department at Christ d cole haan jung kim and professor detection mom growing number of people are using more than to mobile devices such as smartphone and activity trackers or smartwatches with the popularization of wearable devices many motion sensors are now tracking your body movements in everyday lives so there's no reason we don't use these sensors for full-body gesture interactions despite of the potential of full-body gesture is very difficult to define a unified gesture for all users body language is highly dependent to culture context and individual preference different configurations of motion sensors also make it hard to define one universal gesture one way to overcome the limitations is to make users to customize their own gestures customization is free from context or dependency as well as individual preference custom gesture is also known to be more memorable than algester defined by other person our research goal is to propose and test or just chattering system that end users can easily customize accelerometer based the gestures using diverse combinations of mobile devices we chose to focus on an accelerometer as the main gesture sensor because it's embedded in many mobile devices is very inexpensive and power efficient while sensing reach just for information however an accelerometer is not accurate it's very hard to reconstruct the original motions from only accelerometer values furthermore the concept of acceleration is very unfamiliar to general users info user can understand the behavior of an accelerometer then it's very difficult to define and perform accelerate accelerometer very gestures these exchanges sure authoring systems can be categorized by two approaches programming by demonstration the as a gesture from users perform two motions it doesn't require any pre nology to define a gesture but when an error occurs is very hard to fix the problem or modify that modify the Defiant gesture another approach is declaration based authoring the gesture is defined by high-level language an adjuster can easily read and modify the gesture definition but you just are required to learn the test language and need to some effort to create create a gesture several systems combine the advantages of demonstration based and declarative approach for example Chester studio allow the users to demonstrate touches strokes while their sequences are defined in OT creative manner but because each method defines the separate features the limitations of each approach still remain within individual features this work is also inspired by visual gesture definition systems such as event hollow event Auto allows graphical just referring based on how the skin but the interface of in the event hotel was too complex to be used on mobile devices and if the recognition was inaccurate compared to programming by demonstration I'm justice system is based on the lessons from literature review and automotive study the goal of our research is to let users to understand the behavior and constraints of accelerometers it should be easy to learn and use and the definition is to be intuitively modifiable our formative study informed that our participants preferred the simple and software just emotions most of their gestures were linear or a two-dimensional participants also prefer the single device gestures much more than multi-touch gestures and when they define 22 device gesture about ninety percent of their motions were synchronized please read our paper for more detailed information about the formative study we present em gesture a gesture authoring application using the accelerometer values of diverse combinations of mobile devices the accelerometer values are visualized little physical metaphor of math spring or gesture is defined by demonstration and declaration the sense of value trajectory is is to visualize the in 3d space then the user declared the gesture trajectory using a graphical test authoring scheme I'm just sure visualizes sense the value using a metaphor of math spring the system shows a virtual ball on top of the spring that is attested to mobile device if the oscillation can be ignored the mess is affected by inertial force and gravity which means the position of the bowl is solely determined by the accelerometer values the message string metaphor allows the users to understand the behavior of accelerometers and they can predict how the sense of values will be changed when the sense when the user enter a gesture motion on intuitive representation could be the gestures direct path but we did not use it because because of it is in accuracy of the sensor another direct representation could be the acceleration value itself or a dental mass metaphor but the only users who experienced our system without the metaphor thought his behavior was unpredictable we then with the message 3 metaphor it was the result of design decision to make accelerometer waste digester in a way that human can understand while technically feasible a gesture is defined by demonstration and declaration in terms of demonstration a user can quickly and easily define a gesture with a single demonstration it calculates the distances from input trajectory and defined trajectory by dynamic time warping algorithm dynamic time warping is one of the most common algorithm for comparing two trajectories a hotel based adjuster scheme allows users to graphically specify the range of trajectory path a hotel is a plane that that detects intersection of input trajectory the sequence of a hotter intersection can be defined by user and it is represented as a series of arrows of other plane divides the range of allowing trajectory or short Hotel defines narrow and acreage esta trajectories whereas the wide hotel defines brief and diverse trajectories our interface allows the users to easily create modify or remove others with a single stroke touch input because a user can visually visually detect the intersection of input trajectory with the huddle she can intuitively determine well to where the holders should be located to sum up our hybrid just shot ring out just draw altering allows users to easily create the first gesture and then visually change the definition as they want we conducted two studies in order to answer the questions you see it easy to understand the constable massive spring do users easily learn and use em gesture is it precise and fast compared to conventional algorithms we conducted a web-based Tasker completion study with a post survey we asked the 20 participants to compose and correctly perform the registers as illustrated in the slide we designed the three tusk registers subtle and simple as you found in the formative study the later the later test task suit are designed to include more complex operations from demonstration hotter declaration and handling multi devices we gave the over instruction about our system to participants and before each task can we explain the necessary functions and they had enough time to practice those functions the whole study took about 25 minutes per one person every participant completed all tasks except one failure in task 3 the average time to compose and tester gesture was less than 100 seconds the biggest portion of the task completion time was Hotel authoring and modification ninety percent of gesture authoring took less than two and a half minutes and it can be improved considering all participants were the two beginners in the post survey participants answered the easiness of our system in five point likert scale one hundred percent answered the concept was easy or very easy to understand the ovary genus was evaluated easy or very easy by eighty-five percent participants were positively about an gestures interface and function in general one participant said it was good to visualize the dot noise of the accelerometer which is an important constraint of the sensor another participant said a participant liked the hotter scheme for allowing him to control the range of trajectory however some user issues were also raised for example it also hurt to see the interfaces screen when when a user perform a gesture with rotational motion to evaluate the pro evaluate the precision and processing time of an gesture we compared it with its original algorithm dynamic time warping we defined in 12 gestures from a reference and recruited 20 participants to perform or gestures in the graph the top is dynamic time warping and the barrel is am gesture as you can see em gesture was four percent point more accurate I mean more precise and twenty six percent faster than the original dynamic time warping algorithm the conventional dynamic time warping check rates all these senses from the info trajectory and define trajectories which is intense processing resource but I'm gesture system performs the hotter test first and prunes unnecessary candidate gestures before at exhalation the joder test saves the processing resource and is an important aspect in mobile computing there are some discussion points of our hybrid definition as mentioned earlier it made the recognition what's faster than use the original algorithm second a user can flexibly define a gesture between programming by demonstration and declaration she can quickly define a gesture with many more number of the holders otherwise she can spend some time in elaborating to gesture definition using many number of others and lastly our hotel scheme was a simplified by the supplementary information from demonstration if I gesture must be the defined only with declaration then the gesture expression must be very complex in order to specify various gesture features we also found some limitations and futures of em just and just your system because people can constantly make movements in everyday life a guidance system is it required to make gesture designs more robustly to pass the noise emotions there might be some undiscovered problem since we did not conduct a long-term field study our system may support advanced the users in the future such as interaction designers programmers or HTC researchers who wants to easily created create and modify a gesture interactions we propose I'm gesture system that allows the accelerometer based disaster customization using physical metaphor of massive spring with a hybrid approach em gesture was evaluated to be easy to understand learn and use the performance of the hybrid the authoring was a slightly more precise and much faster than the original algorithm dynamic time warping thank you for your attention and it's time for Chile hi Gregory about Georgia Tech did you get a chance to try seeing how creative people could be with this tool in the study reported here you gave them gestures to do did you give them a chance to try to explore the gestures that they would come up with on their own mmm actually not they they were given on me designated the three tests um but yeah myself I sometimes play with this a system and try to compose as many as early as possible but mmm it's kind of similar to what i found in the phone to study people don't want to use some very complex just just like in a three-dimensional space leave it completely unusable I just wondering also you give only one example so how do you know whether that gesture would be recognized in the future if you have only one kind of training example for it you may not be accessorized yeah yeah in this study I measure the precision of our system and we collected in 1000 gesture motions and compare it with 12 gesture set and its overall precision was the eighty-eight percent thank you one question be you show that it is a 3d space at the performing the test run and then most of your urine hurdles um that's very important question there Kim there can be is because the gesture is defined the in demonstration and declaration in terms of demonstration is full 3d there's no difficulties in this distinguish between gestures but in decorative manner as you can as you said is designed into this space but and um some academic people ask me if they can in composing three dimensional spaces in but yes actually it's the constraint of our system but as I said most of users generally defined a gesture like linear motions or treatments of emotions so we thought to the 2t spaces is enough for defining a usable gestures
