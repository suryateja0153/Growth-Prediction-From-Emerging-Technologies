 it's the smallest ultrasound sensor in the world and it's using a technology that nobody has used yet for ultrasound hi I'm Dave Horsley and I'm with Sharpe Microsystems the innovation is developing that tiny ultra low power ultrasound sensor we make micromachined ultrasonic transducers and what that does is we have a very low-power ultrasonic sensor so ultrasound is actually its pressure waves right it's like the sound that we hear around us where you know we're sending a pressure waves through the air it happens to be that we're doing at very high frequencies so it's inaudible right now we're actually surrounded by ultrasound that our sensors are emitting but none of us can hear it because it's so high frequency we use multiple ultrasound transducers and so the demo that we have here we're using four transducers like in the four corners of a device and the way that that works is that we measure the range using a pulse echo measurement using ultrasound so each of the four sensors in the four corners is emitting a pulse of ultrasound and it's getting an echo from my hand and then we get a range measurement from that pulse echo measurement so with four range measurements we do a technique it's some people call it triangulation it's a little bit like the way the GPS knows where your car is with GPS is sitting with multiple satellites and radio waves we do it with these multiple ultrasound sensors and open sound waves and so we think that ultrasound in many cases can be complimentary so it adds that third dimension where you can interact with your device at you before you touch it you
