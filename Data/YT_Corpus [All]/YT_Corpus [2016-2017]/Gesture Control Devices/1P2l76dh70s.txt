everyone and welcome to another episode of Android app arena I'm your host Jason Howell this week's episode is going to be a little bit different you see I'm a dad and I struggle with how much technology I want my three and my six-year-old to be exposed to on one hand I'm passionate about technology so I totally understand the pull of it my kids obviously share my interest in technology and I would never want to squash that drive but on the other hand there's just a lot more to life than simply technology so while I'm ok with them having some time with screens I don't feel comfortable letting them live their lives staring into those screens at least not yet and definitely not at such a young age so I have to find solutions that help me do the things I feel I need to do to put their usage in an area that's responsible in my eyes as a parent I spent some time over the past few weekends getting my home devices in shape for kids usage and today I'll share what I did it might not work for your situation specifically but it could spark an idea that you might have for your own children's devices so let's dive into a project how I set up my home devices for my kids we have two Nexus 9 tablets at home my wife and I kid ourselves into thinking they belong to us but in reality only our kids use them with any sort of regularity we've set up restricted profiles on each system this keeps our kids locked into the tablets with only the apps we've set for them to have access to here's how you do that first on any device running jelly bean or above I'll go into Android system settings and then into users here I'm gonna add new user and go through the process of entering their email account info to sync the account to this profile I actually have a special account for my kids that I use here and I make sure to deactivate things like location tracking Google now and other stuff that tracks usage I like to go into the account settings and then turn off sync for anything my kids won't need as well to avoid random notifications for things and you know unnecessary battery drain now Nova Launcher is a great way to keep the kids profile focused on only the stuff that applies to them Nova prime is actually essential for what I'm about to do with that app installed I'll go ahead and tap home and assign it as the new default launcher for the tablet then I'll go into Nova settings and then app and widget drawers settings now find that little selection down at the bottom the hide apps section and you select all the apps that the kids should not have access to that will hide them from them these will all be completely hidden from view so you don't have to worry about them discovering them I'll look at the app drawer now and it's nice and tidy and looks great now on to the home screen delete any icons to apps that they shouldn't have access to from there I can even delete that Google search bar up top which can be an unwanted portal into other things if you don't want them searching the Internet you might want to get rid of that now we have a pretty great starting point for a kid it's restricted to the apps that I like in this case but here's another super important part if they're gonna have access to the Play Store for installing apps I'm gonna have to go into the Play Store and make some settings changes I'll go into the settings to find parental control here I'll assign a pin this is for parental access to these settings so I can go in at any time and tweak them and it'll go through each category that I'm given so that the Play Store only ever shows content that's age-appropriate for my kids from movies to music too of course apps as well I'll go ahead and make sure that all purchases require authentication and that'll keep them from racking up charges on my card without me knowing you know until it's too late and now I have a profile that is a great starting point for adding games access to movies and music and whatever else I've cleared specifically for their access Nova Launcher is awesome for this kind of stuff find it for free and for $4.99 for the prime upgrade in the Play Store my children love to listen to music so I wondered what it would take to convert an old phone into a single purpose music streaming device I can get most of the way there yet again with you guessed it Nova Launcher here's my device fully reset and synced to the Google account the only app that is installed outside of the stock apps here is Nova Launcher with the four dollar $0.99 prime upgrade I'm going to begin tweaking things by first tapping home and then selecting Nova Launcher as my default home launcher next I'll head into Nova settings then into desktop settings I'm gonna go ahead and max out the icon size to make everything a little bit bigger and you can also remove the labels in icon layout section if you like now back out and into the gestures section where I'm gonna set up or at least make sure that there is a gesture set to launch into Nova settings here it's set to two fingers swiping up why is this important well I'm glad you asked we're gonna be getting rid of all other apps including the shortcut to nova launcher settings next stripping it all away so that only the Play Music app icon is showing first go to app and widget drawer settings now down at the bottom is the hide apps area here I'm gonna hide everything and I do mean everything except the Play Music app now back out to home and I'll go ahead and place the play music icon on the home screen so that it's there for me and then remove literally every other item on the home screen also I'm gonna get rid of the Google search bar up top and yes the app drawer button is removable inside nova launcher and that's great because now i can drop that play music icon where the launcher button used to be so everything's looking good now but it's kind to bear so I'm gonna go ahead and add the play music player widget and we'll be sure to check the box that asks if Nova can create widgets and access data with them that's very important I also like to add the play my library widget and have that tied to play music for a nice big graphical layout of the latest playlist and listens I'm gonna also launch play music and go into the settings there to turn on the setting that blocks songs with an explicit tag and now I have a device that is limited to music except one key element that notification tray up top which can be a portal into other things you don't want your children to touch I'll go into system settings and then security and make sure that screen pinning is turned on at the bottom and now when I hit the multitasking button I can go to the play music card and tap the pin that appears there the notification tray goes away and the only thing that device can do now is be a music player everything else is hidden if they manage to get to the home screen for whatever reason say they reboot or you let them out you forget to lock it up again all they have access to at that point is the music stuff that I have on the desktop older kids will get wise to this stuff maybe but it's great for the younger set again you can find Nova Launcher in the Play Store for free with a prime upgrade for $4.99 and there we go I have a few tablets that keep my kids locked to the things I want them to have access to and a device that they can use at any time as a music player I really want them and you know to enjoy music so having a device that isn't connected to all things Internet but still gives them the ability to play a song on a whim is just what I was hoping for that way they aren't tempted into the hypnotic world of the Internet where they pick it up to listen to Miley Cyrus so I've solved a few needs but I'm still missing a big component and that is keeping tabs on their usage I'll get to that after this break but first let's take some time to thank the sponsor of today's episode and that's blue apron

arena blue apron is a better way to cook ok now it's time to add an app to each device that will literally give me a window into them from wherever I happen to be at any time it's this week's big app so I have these devices all set up for their specific use cases my work is not done however monitoring how they use these devices is key to knowing whether my mechanisms are actually doing their part it also happens to be in my opinion the role of a responsible parent cuz you know there's a lot of stuff on the internet that I don't necessarily want my children exposed to dinnertime plus has two basic functions first I'll install it on my phone I'm gonna set it up to be a parents device this is essentially my window into how my kids devices are being used with that in place I now have to install dinnertime plus on each kid's device in doing so I'm gonna grant the app device admin control meaning the app can't be deleted or stopped unless it's done from a parent's device it overrides everything and the kids have no control over that very effective control in other words as I continue I'm given a pin that I can input into the parents device this actually locks the kid devices to the parents device and the connection is then made now as my kids use their devices I can monitor in real time what apps and games they're using and for how long I can do things like set time limits with weekdays and weekends given different settings if I'm a little more relaxed on the weekends let's say and if there are apps that don't count against the time limit I can go ahead and set that in there as well I can also set scheduled breaks or just have to take a break at any time complete with typing my own little message to appear on their screens when the break is introduced and they're gonna be forced to put down the tablet at that point I can go in remotely and deny access to any app that happens to be installed I can do this from my device which is really nice and in reports I can actually see which apps they spend the most time with dinnertime plus is free but for a three dollar $0.99 in app upgrade you get a lot of really handy features up to five different children's devices can be synced usage reports for the past 7 days a total of 8 scheduled breaks customize timeout warning messages and more it's really essential find dinnertime plus in the play store now now when it comes to parenting everyone has a different level of comfort for all these things no one solution is gonna work for everyone so I understand if you do things differently with your kids maybe some of this stuff doesn't necessarily apply to you that's quite all right but the stuff has helped me be the kind of parent I want to be and if that's helpful to you then my job is done until next week send
