 not sure to but I want to say a few words about this so this paper is about gesture typing which is a paradigm that is actually innovative new paradigm that's already on perhaps a billing devices but if you look at the very first paper Corolla and I published in kind 2013 2003 30 years ago the big part of it it was about defining the keyboard layout which shows the master I used to like you so the gestures on the gaming keyboard on demon layout will be all while defined and well separated and so therefore people can learn and remember the shapes better therefore you can get it to a truly shorthand writing a new way of writing stage but I would say that's still far from being a reality so we keep on returning to this topic that is how we can actually find a layout that is both much more clear much more efficient and also much more easier to learn and unfortunately the 30 together don't seem to come together easily and here is another attempt at making it at least easier to learn because the corgi is just about the most difficult or working sometimes worst keyboard for gesture typing in terms of the finding shapes and it can see here one reasons that quoted is pretty bad portraits of hiking you look at the top right corner / they are the three vows you I owe the pleasure together with court program which is a typing because in gesture typing your extern you are inevitably cross cross on the letters and control room here i use on granville the tip and harder to very common works and we have identical faces on just a keyboard and here for he and are two very common words because i am our place together they have very similar shape for the Dakota Dakota often get confused by which were you intending to include here are kids another example meet as not they have very similar similar ships so because cody is envisioned and inaccurate for hiking a lot of effort in optimizing keyboard previous work mostly focus on how to improve the performance public cruise speed and accuracy a little about that what a bigger challenge of ops and layout is our journey we have been using cooking for 100 years and we use it on baby mrs. will have a new leg up you have spent much time to switch to code it even though we know that they will eventually have German performance they are likely to switch on crooked or the layouts and this world will because I how to improve the living off of the optimized layout what specifically which has to safeway introduce some quota cancer basically we're trying to keep up as they are in of the protein want to say whether you're include of learning I also want to see other is consumed weather can still get my layout so we look at a three kinds of coding students here the first one the court cookie welcome to it it is known as chris okotie in previous one so basically forgiving letter on lay out his new position can only be at most one here away from its cooking tradition the coldest traditional protein neighbor so for letter gia are they out the first ball new location orgy Cooper occasion modest latest loss secondly of section constraints even stronger because the crew th1 construed basically the kids can only move horizontally on a single and of course it has at most one here when Scotty position so for lethargy here it had a mystery possibility of a layout and a pseudo hockey the strongest but we only do one soft will only saw a pair of teeth on layout / Cody and his two kids have to be pretty neighbor for demo IGN pitch or poverty but we want to investigate under this tree constraint we still get me out that are better than 40 and hope that is constraint will help you then learn a new layout and we ultimately up for just a piping so the procedure was very similar to what India must be is time business project but we hope charges I think they are for post nike SB what I can see we define we use the wing to do suggestion clarity metric it basically it to quantify 23 but given gesture on quick on the top or choose avuncular Lee payoff is separately father gestures so the higher education clarity a better the keyboard for gesture typing and the black you in for details please refer to his finger and a second objective is the typing speed we have a model with the property of the model to predict the time you look in to enter our work giving it's a gesture trace so this operation problem we try to knock Kelly off for two objectives speed and accuracy and most people either want to investigate if we add this sweet constraint separately how will it affect the performance and whether it will improve the learning we run so it's a very typical crater operation program you have two objectives and a final of the outcome of that operation procedure are a set of is the set of the pareto-optimal layout and will pick the most balanced or one the 1i have a balance between jitter accuracy and speed and here at the open the result so under one stop construing we having to say that solving ing you will get a layout that has a most balanced value between speed and accuracy very interestingly I am solving ing have some bubbles from Penn in fact we do not expect then phalange they are next to answer back to ignoring on quoting and also they happen to be constructive letters Roman alphabet and also if you look at least two letters they have very similar to your appearance so they just don't tell you that the whole garden I hope you remember i'll pay you swap it with edina to remember this the tradition and this is the doctrine they are under 20 h 1 considering that we have 16 please on route renewal of new location and this is they are we got under a crow th 131 Katherine digital keys change their positions and this figure actually choose the performance of itself differently out it also the metric aluminized between 0 and 1 this foreign gtalk indicate a layer that is optimized for courage only and waited and Atticus turn physically the maximum courage rather you have again because it is at the far end of the clarity access here we are we've optimized for speed only and with them at any cost efficient and it is any location and constancy a croquet is at the very low end in post active is indicate actually confirms our comfort off of the division that it's very inefficient and to aunt occurs for just hiking and visitor they are we optimized for both natural and you can you have no constraint sort of what you can get it's a kind of in the middle between street and narrative and future the performance of pursuing hopefully out under sweet constraint interesting still we can take that footage one that I can wholly have very similar performance out and force a better information especially in gesture clarity so let's just that by stopping only to tease i am j you can get those character metrics and sure i can go along work i would literally to look at some become going to get 100 each or reading of white heaven be here give some words I should at beginning of a practitioner because they tip and top by simply you found three better I to the second row it is two traces of clearly different from each other are quoted identical and for working and harm and see here you have more separate races I check or they learn on that coating and this is the jet surfaces for not and yet is to work clearly the most segregated home I do predicting that decoder will be likely to get it correct so for our silicone access to that I drew Cody and also house earlier we have a higher chest clarity and also hiring for speed including but they are all obtained based on circular dances next step we can talk it in prattville study the first the purpose our first we want to know whether it is fairly are other sweet constraints can include an inability second those want to see whether observe any performance can we really ask the doc it within subject user study and we test the sweet hope that they are together with protein and also we could we pick two tasks here first it free thinker task so a physically one who tests will use the first pick up the keyboard and win their faces when the you'll have performance improvement under hopkinsville the second task is the word petition task to pick 20 the vicinity of words and for each word user entered seven times in a row the purpose of that when you include your previously word again again the last few repetitions your reach the expert mode I will say when they were also any performance again at this stage and play the captor speed measured by world community and whatever rate here the result for phrase in good hands Tim you can say that for I do Cory it after simmering for speed with protein static analysis should be not sure different the difference between still a up and both of them are certainly faster than for h1 and 41 it should that you the first pick up a keyboard for speak of the hydroponic it didn't have any performance degradation but for other tools will observe that the graduations below we had at 40 each one and kruti 1 concern the missed you at the performance degradation which is the super stressed and whatever rate we didn't do any skin of any difference pyramid because it has you love three the video allowed to attract mistakes and use tax base and in the second study for their body big bird would repetition tasks some findings confirm with the confirmed what we all deserve in the previous study so once they for the first food for the first repetition with the work the first time user income to the world and enter on the new layout we can say that I do roti and Cody people have shot her in for speed in the other two layouts it's indicate that i can collate and you didn't even slow down when you're first in Congress I to cook in your layout starting from the petition three you can see that crooked I'd recruited from sweep all over the street optional optional layout have a shorter equal time than cooking you can feel faster difference between Korea and other adults they are a significant here and here the every rid of peril and other ways of the sweep of the folios can stay here for a joke rotate it actually has a lower everything okay it's I think that it in turn it's consistent with what they've observed by its consider what we showed in the current just a clarity in that you can say that because you move this to the separating so swim well actually get separate on choo-choo trains from others or I will study so in this research we investigate how can improve the mobility of cadre out I mean hi who is still heavily all that it's better than protein and we should that our not notice that we invest the street and streams so it could hide constraints to see whether they will help with just a piping they find out that I drew quoted the 3d to blow me out and introduce no performance degradation over protein when you initially judit and also this new yard is faster and workers and coated with a user which of the work fbook mode that's it partition thank you first line up in the middle of the my keys in the veto any questions all University and over no I think it's not sure it's all about okay so my question is in you basically allow a single small the IM DJ and you get this nice property what if you allowed a single swap but between using any keys so that you look at other constraints like we expect better or guess so I say yeah because yeah yeah well from yellow not afraid of yeah I have what I don't mean that the filter concerned or call your neighbor girl passing at least it's what but it will be worth to this situation don't be so artistic the stop set up at a new approach to me now you can solve any two keys right family are so so I think we actually do some experiments show that if you swap other two keys the photo sets honestest theoretical analysis it didn't improve watch over over the edge of protein and we can say even even in each one full HR constrain so could a one you have more freedom in getting the option way up to have a similar gesture clarity and a speed over IT projects I jungle is pretty sweet spot it is the first first first point second point that would allow the 3d swap entities I think if you are hurt but an ability actually we keep the project laughing in our last year's research we we introduced this the cookie similarity so you can move their kids away we didn't really confine them to cooking papers and the kids so the program for fun arrays didn't really improve learning because like somehow we needa come to the key you don't know the location so the idea of pretty constraint that we will fight when I look at route 40 it if you don't find our cookie neighbor correlation your first look at this neighbor and then body you might imagine create your such brilliance to the second team my few random is taught to case it is happened to be very far away if you are to give a lot of time four is two kids and overall it well add modeling hi more frustrations hi synthetic Microsoft Research to some extent to some extent when you're dealing with ambiguity some ambiguities worse than others depending on the length model context yeah so for example hi and go it's much worse than fit and topped right yes then you have the context so why didn't you guys consider using that as a constraint you know the larger you know constraint of the language model context and then the other thing is when you're actually evaluating the word air raid you're testing on phrases but are you evaluating on single word recognition so is it top vest we're single word without the context so for the frist its leading contact ways it's a task it's a fully functional people with language more than terrorism we're just physical change google and whatever we can see that there's sort of like a conflation there okay not that I was too excited I forgot why I was getting a few more words in the beginning I want to say that Georgian I have worked together for many years but despite free food and other more cinnamon perks at Google charging is going to join a stony broke up next year so that was the reason to that cousin Tim it's a very complete question actually last year in our last year's work in defining keyboard gesture typing clarity we spent a lot of time a lot of back and forth on that very topic that is how do you define clarity if you do consider language model context we decided to cut it at uni brent level the reason is that if you consider by ground or in grams another is the next level like what if we use lstm what if you use no semantic models and then the contacts with the change you can further the spaces will just become so complex that it would be very compromise maybe you have better ideas tell us haha if you choose them so my question is related to your experiment where you mentioned that in your experiment by multiple levels of typing but same user the expert behavior emerged out so what does the limit when do you see that that expert behavior half goes down because this is a problem which I have been facing with my assignment and every time I make users to be the same phrases the next time the Jewish pass the food what kind of limitations will you keep so actually if also similar explore forest in a second story which is a word attention it's not phrase reputation basically you enter a single multiple happening or go so the reason we believe is similar tax plus P because I can look at the time you learn it just to enter the work the repetition can say starting from the server petitions you cannot reach a saline so it means that at this stage mostly your performance is determined by your motivating a not buying whether you're familiar with me arms or that you need to search for that so I think it's a kind it's a way to it's a that's approach to simulate so as possible explore more info at a time hope I swear crystal so you might say that by repeating the same word for approximately seven times the motor sophie has been the cheaper too yes all the time yeah I think I think I mean it just taken in typing facility or your interest in couldn't I will be concerned by your first little motor over here and stop need other like the video such time and and whether you remember the words so the idea that you repeated sing or more times we at the first and the first second the child your mom used to meet you too Tom Brady search but once you repeat the same time in a row in the universe field plus field field two files we expect that you will be worth it work eliminates the video search heart and all community belong remember the shape just argue adjuster learn what ability to any of the world and I think that's the lot less 1x but we're doing the Church of happy and to test our hypothetical again to help them the curve of the ink low speed you can see that the speed the definite increase in last year 12 and then actually which pretty stable level indicates that target for improvement after that stage I think that that's that to confirm that the courage to ask the moment in this stage so perhaps perhaps what amenities is Mexican Chester whether that's a mistake but it's actually done on purpose it's actually presenting to your point because people would do better next well if you do it repeat it and we do that to measure what eventual performance people would be able to reach it doesn't mean the actual use they will reach that faster but eventually we reached an but it cannot do that let long experiment in order to prove a point so that's precisely into a point that is we want to take the event in fact that people learn faster if you repeat the same motor control pattern but the clarity would still show the same MO same way so the idea is that we try to test clarity if you're after after lung larger larger amount learning so it's essentially an acceleration that's the idea thank you right thank you
