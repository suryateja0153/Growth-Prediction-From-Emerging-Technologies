 Hi everyone! Welcome to Keith's Toy Box! Do you know what your surprise toy is? It's a Remote Controlled Car that's controlled by your watch and your voice. What? That's impossible! So let's open the box and take a look! This is the watch and you just use this to control the car and this is the charger for when it's not working and we use this charger for the car and the watch. So here's the car. Isn't that a cool car? It's like a sports car! Don't forget to remove this cover before charging. You put the charger here to charge the watch And put the charger here to charge the car This is the switch to turn it off or on. Whoa! Look at the lights! It even has headlights! And then you turn these things if you want to go left or right. Push this button to turn off the light. Push this button to change the speed. You can also push this button if you want to stop...the button in the middle. Okay, I wanna put on the watch. [Engine starting and running] Go forward! Whoa! Cool! It actually works! It goes super fast! Go back! And it can even go backwards. Is it cool or what? Go forward!
