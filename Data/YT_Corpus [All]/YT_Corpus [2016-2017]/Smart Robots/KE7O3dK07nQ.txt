 the Husqvarna Auto mower is not just a lawn mower it is a robotic concept that will give you the perfect lawn whilst giving you more free time to make it understandable how it works we installed Husqvarna autumn own in a large yard we will explain how Auto mower works how the installation is done how the mower cuts all the grass that it can handle almost any yard while the grass quality improves so much and finally anti-theft and safety features basically Husqvarna automo are consists of three parts the mower the charging station and the boundary wire huskvarna Auto mower works inside an electronic fence created by a loop signal sent from the charging station through the boundary wire when Auto mower comes close to the wire it detects the signal stops and continues in another direction Husqvarna Auto mower works fully automatically when batteries run low it is several ways that will ensure it always returns to the charging station he could follow a radio signal sent from the charging station it can follow a guide wire and it can also follow the boundary wire back to the charging station when the battery is fully charged it returns to work without your intervention a robotic mower requires time for installation however this is a one-time effort that will give you a more or less maintenance-free lawn for many years you can do the installation yourself but the most convenient way is to let your dealer do the job they use a cost-effective tool that places the wire a few inches underground and have experience in all kinds of challenges from other yards the boundary wire is laid around the yard ensuring that auto mower will never work outside this area the wire can also be placed around flowerbeds and other areas you don't want to be mowed when you place the wires close to each other on the way back the signal is canceled and the robotic mower will pass then you have created what we call Islands Husqvarna Auto mower has a collision sensor when it hits something it will stop and change direction as it is designed to regularly handle gentle bumps obstacles like trees and walls don't always need to be fenced by the boundary wire if you have remote areas with narrow passages guide wires can be laid there to guide the robotic mower through the passage some models are also assisted by GPS navigation we started the robotic mower on highest cutting height as you can see the mower works in a free movement pattern this movement pattern will efficiently let the mower find every challenging corner of the yard under bushes benches between trees everywhere generally after two days all grass is cut depending on the size of your yard now we lower the cutting the mower can handle really rough terrain slopes holes and temporary obstacles like pinecones and fruits are not a problem it is designed to work in rain useful if you live in an area with regular rainfall Husqvarna Auto mower is so quiet that it can work during the night without disturbing anyone you will have total control of its working hours for example you can choose to let it work only at night so you have the lawn for yourself whenever you like you can use the display on the mower or the app automo or connect Husqvarna have more than 20 years of experience of robotic mowers and have refined the technology over time as a result Husqvarna Auto mower is very reliable which is important for the concept if you leave your house for longer periods you can be confident that the lawn will still be maintained while you are away after a week you can already see a big difference in the yard all grass is cut and will never grow tall again it is now the auto mower concept begins the robot mower will now continue to work and constantly cut the grass as it grows but just a few fractions of an inch at a time this is by far the most gentle way to cut grass and the concept keeps moss away before you probably cut the lawn when the grass was too high and you took off a few inches you might have used a collector to get rid of the clippings however this removes any natural goodness from the soil the clippings from husqvarna auto mower are only fractions of an inch long they will fall to the soil decompose and serve as natural nutrition for your lawn since Husqvarna Auto mower works with razor-sharp blades the grass is cut with a fine edge which also helps improve the grass quality there are two schools of cutting systems one use a heavy and massive steel blade with high kinetic energy that tear off the grass Auto mower is equipped with us Varna safety blades they are very strong but then has a low weight and are pivoting when they hit a hard obstacle they just fold away Auto mower has several sensors when lifted the cutting disk stops and whatever it runs into the sensors will stop the mower and it will continue in another direction Husqvarna Auto mower is protected from theft in several ways a pin code is required for any intervention an alarm will immediately sound if the code ignores when the mower is stopped or lifted it is useless when stolen as it can't be matched to other charging stations and when reported stolen it will be read listed in all support some models have a built-in geofence if brought outside your home the alarm will go off and will automatically send tracking data Husqvarna has a wide range of robotic mowers that suit small to large yards all have the same clever technology in capability to handle complex yards in short when you install a Husqvarna Auto mower you will enjoy an almost maintenance-free lon that is nice-looking and healthy all year round
