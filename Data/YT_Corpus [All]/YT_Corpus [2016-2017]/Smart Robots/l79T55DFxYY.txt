packing it up again packing started packing it up to bring it back to Dubai right now I'm sitting here alone because kids and wife they are at parenting my parent in-laws I mean her parents home and they are enjoying playing around I'm enjoying my lonely time here a man has to be lonely sometimes sitting here thinking what to do I think I want to have a cookie now you think I'm alone but I'm not that along check this out hey Kim get me my cookie man meet Kim this is my little personal assistant for now here in my house and keeping me accompanied by his little cute company here he's bringing me some cookies come on Kim come on come here come on over come on over yeah don't be shy come on come on don't be shy yeah watch out watch out don't fall there watch time yeah yeah please yeah this way come on come on come to the left watch watch you'll fall down turn turn right yes come forward come forward yes keep going keep not there I'm here at your left yeah eat yes right here come on forward a little bit don't fall down a little bit okay okay no don't go forward yeah just wait here I'll reach and grab a cookie I'll reach over and grab a cookie don't move don't move thank you very much thank you thank you very much kid now try to stay at one place right there while I enjoy my cookie okay I got my cookie mmm this is nice man this is delicious we got this in America airline it's been a few days and it's still fresh hmm hmm I got one more cookie right there Cubans holding it so I'll let him hold it for a while well I enjoyed this one hmm mmm this is good man Aamir Salman has a good cookie you should travel by yourself not sometime cool movies program TV shows good cookies hmm I'm loving it mmm you do to me all right now that the cookie is finished there's one more cookie why don't we go ahead and check out what else kid can do this is a good nice boy actually all right so this here is keep a little self balancing gyro based robot it's basically a toy is not a very high-tech robot it comes with this little remote control that you can use to control it okay not much control just a little joystick for you to drive your kit around let me describe some of the modes for the kids driving or you know moving around right now you can see there is a green light on cribs chest that means Kip is in gyro or stabilized mode or in serving mode in this mode kid will move very slowly no matter how much you press on your joystick around okay this mode is basically intent for kid to serve you so you can put a tray you can attach a tray in front here on his chest and you can let him serve you something like cookies like a little bit of eatable not too heavy thing when the company advertises the kid they show the kid is holding a coca-cola came but actually that's what there was an empty cane okay I tried to filled camp and kid cannot hold it it always fall on its nose so kid can actually hold a little bit of stuff like cookies and a very lightweight stuff on the tray which you can attach right here alright so this is the mode stabilized mode for keep to bring you stuff and serve you around so so in this mode keep will move very very slowly and it is very much balanced and it is properly balanced to hold your items that you want him to bring to you alright so you press button one more time there is a button right here on the chest as well you press it one more time and keep actually turn and the light actually turns magenta alright now keep is in fast mode in this mode keep will move very fast alright and this is the mode sometimes where kid will actually fall down is very fast in this mode and it's not easy to control what Boeing sorry so this is a fast mode and you can move keep around in the fast mode have fun oh I hit there I will not recommend you to drive kid in this mode because in this mode he falls down very easily and then like that just like that you have to put it back up again sure his head is hurting all right so let's not try this mode we go to dancing mode maybe the other cool feature of kid is dancing you can actually amuse your kids by making it dance with music one moment I'm changing it to the dance mode here we go [Applause] all right he shoots some bullets from his ass I mean that sound came from his backside anyway and now the kid is back in control mode so it's red light on his chest is red that means he is going to be very very fast maybe and fall down so be very careful with that one moment let me control it and let me show you one last mode for kid and that is the gesture control so I think it's on blue but my camera is showing green light on his chest but let's check so when you put your hand this way or this way you can drive kids this way he goes backward easy huh he goes backward but if you want him to follow your hand you move your hand your palm to its face to his sensor oh no that was wrong he doesn't like the Pam all right let me try again yeah it was he goes back he doesn't like it yeah he likes the fingers only not your palm so let me put it once again the back of my hand alright he says I go back and I come forward right so you can actually use back of your hand to push it back alright so make it drive backward and you can use the palm to let it follow it no no and let it turn around oh he comes out alright something is happening let me try once and once again maybe just the fingers this way not the whole prom so let's try it hold on and now he doesn't like it hold on one moment yeah he comes and go there alright so I'm trying to learn now I'm trying to learn hold on back off my hand hey there's a radio behind you : once again so you just move your hand to its head like this hold on alright so you can push it but if you do this way maybe you will ask him to go so here we go yay that is the way okay so what if I just keep using the palm of my hand now he goes forward so it's a little bit tricky to learn to drive oh it's an obstacle collision mode maybe alright ah no he's not alright let's try it again Oh fall down sorry alright let's try again the back of my hand doesn't like it back of my hand again goes back back off my hand again goes forward well now I'm really confused now forward now the palm of my hand he comes alright he comes towards me he comes towards me and no matter back or forward so it's a little bit confusing but it's kind of fun for kids to actually keep interacting using using your hands using their hands not your hands so it's kind of fun for kids to keep interacting but for me it's making me tired holding the camera bending down like that trying to drive it around so what I used so what I like is to drive it with my remote control all right green that is stabilized mode blue dance red mode what is red mode for I'm not sure it's pretty fast and it doesn't detect anything all right so red mode is to race around maybe here we go let's see how fast it can go Oh in falls down gets up again go forward not very fast stabilize my dancing mode which mode is that all right we are in purple mode I don't know what mode is that hey where are you going come back here I'm here come on going all right that was nice come on keep turning around there's a carpet there and here comes the kid hello Boeing come back alright let me put it up here and one moment I have to put the camera down for a while and put a cookie on kid there you go come on hold it hold the cookie don't go forward go up wait wait hold my cookie well I wish it could actually hold more stuff or heavier stuff so I could you know use it to bring coca-cola but anyway time is running let us conclude very very fast ok so conclusion is simple this is a fun little toy I forgot it in China when I went to Dubai and that's why I couldn't post a review but I'm glad I came back and I found it lying on top of my cardboard and we got to it I know it's a copy of one of those branded robots out there which has the similar features but anyway if you want to get something cheaper and you just want your kids to have some fun Kim will actually do its job now everything works as at Tai's but the company forgot to tell you one biggest reason for anyone to not to buy this robot and that is after a few minutes of driving and playing around the batteries inside gets really really warm and once the batteries get a little bit low-power your robot will start falling down so often that you want to actually kick it right into trashbin so remember to put very high quality batteries in it if you want your kids to have fun for a little while otherwise if you put in cheap batteries your kids will be coming at you dad the robot doesn't work it just keeps falling yes that's what it about yes that what happens when you put in Cheaper batteries in it they get warm very very quickly in few minutes and then your robot will keep falling the other thing is the robot keeps going forward and backward it never stops anyway so you saw it in action you you heard my conclusion you watch my conclusion once again put in a very high quality batteries otherwise you're not gonna like it for me to finish this review I have used eight batteries to finish the review because first four batteries I put in got warm and the robot start falling so often that I have to replace the batteries and get back to the review so overall fun toy not as impressive at they advertised enjoy and more videos are coming come on give me my cookie man I don't want you to hold it and stop I'm moving right there hmm man these cookies from Emirates Airline they're really nice 29th April when I go to Dubai I'm sure I will ask the air hostess to bring me many of these and keep tossing them in my pockets enjoy and more reviews are coming very very
