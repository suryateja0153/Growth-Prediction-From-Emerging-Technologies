 so this is my submission for the Badger a hacking contest so the idea behind a POV display that's persistence of vision is as your lights sweep across they'll be blanking it so fast such a fast rate that you can't see them go hung off and it makes a sort of a tracer line as your eyes and it appears it is all one image first thing I did was I put it inside this to get it in there I hacked the ever-loving daylights out of it broke all the LEDs off of the main board the switch that was in there the haney power switch that toggles between two sets of LEDs I took that off of its board flip the board over bit the leads up to the switch was then surface mounted that allowed me to get the Badger in there without contacting the main power lead against the top of the ftdi chip so in three triple A batteries and that is hooked up via this connector to the the USB power input and that allows me to use that little L do right in there to regulate the voltage down to three eight point three volts let's see from there I took three of the digital gpios and sent them out on purple grey and white as three wires you need to control this three shift by nine shift registers so each shift register has 16 LEDs hooked up to it eight on this side eight on the opposite side each Bank of LEDs is hooked up to a bust resistor that saved me quite a bit of soldering and a bit of board space as well but adding all those tiny little rat nest wires in there was a lot of work I'm pretty confident I put 20 hours of work into assembly on these things so after the LED power and connect to the resistor that ground bus this side and the other side each goes to these transistors so that i could turn off the two sides independently the idea behind that was I wanted to display text and if i put the same shape of character on both sides of the wheel it wouldn't display right so i was going to put forward letters on one on the top and backward letters on the back so that that way the viewer would always see the text correctly what I discovered and recklessly is I can only get about 24 flashes in a rotation because of the speed of this little for kilohertz microcontroller I haven't tested this but my assumption is if i put faster like a full-powered you know 16 megahertz arduino in there or even the knee red board that this thing would work at a much higher resolution so it would have started all this in but I decided it would save me some time to use the pin headers and all these existing wires I had already let's see after after I got the thing together a bit of experimentation I realized that my hall effect sensors was on the other side just pointing out where it ought to be my health effects sensors weren't getting enough voltage to register the field so what I had to do is that another battery the model I have it's capable of 4 volt up to 24 volts or so i might maybe 28 so checking up nine volts to this was no problem it has a round in common with the rest of the system but the when the sensor is triggered it set its signal pin from Heisey to ground or digital low so there's really no way for it to introduce the nine volts into the rest of the system unless something goes horribly wrong with testing this turned out to not fry my system so that was a really good trial also if I had a higher power board it would be writing off a 5 volts and then I'd be able to drive the Hall effect sensors directly without a need for a separate power supply so as you can see there's no copper on this perf board so everything on here is a lead there's two coming through and they've been back together and I've slaughtered them together that way and it would be really nice to have the stability of actually of the copper cladding but I didn't have that on here you'll see these longer leads are from capacitors I used on shift registers as a convenient way to tie that in there just I put the tiny little ceramic capacitor underneath the IC socket up here you'll see the hall effect sensor I needed an inexpensive way to get it to stand off of the board so I found my bucket of cat five tips turns out super glue works great between a cat 5 tip and is perf board it does not work well between the cat 5 tip and the hall effect sensor body so this is covered in hot glue now so the board itself is attached to the wheel with five little zip ties now along one edge of the spoke and then one on the adjacent spoke I took a tip from a de fruits spoke POV in the shape of this
