 hi everyone let me see if we stop the editing Hills Iraq simply sit there and why ok so I'm going to start this has been a lot of fantastic work on part of Facebook everyone thank you for coming we did a whole blog running around and get this the last minute so all right well comparable to the 206 meeting of the new york linux users group this is one of our special presentations it is also we are working with I guess the puppet meet up I just want to yeah do you guys have a number for this no okay we try to keep track I guess just close to it so today we are going to be hearing from Daniel about Garcia and I'm in the necklace and close enough along I should have checked that first as I said running around but they'll be talking with a presentation titled Foreman latest updates puppet for remote execution and discovery first I'd like to say how much we appreciate facebook for providing us with this space again at the last minute working so hard to make this come together it's been really really amazing um it's been really short kindness and thanks everyone who came out here this was again short notice thanks for coming out without you we can't put these on we are here for you so the normal things turn off the noise makers that is your cell phones devices tablets whatever might ring beep Google where second any sexy hot please make sure they're not annoy Z wrappers and third I'm going to what we're going to do is we're going to questions at certain points I'll be up here with the mic just come on up take the microphone moment ask your question we want that so that the video recording in the back will reflect your questions as well as the answers that'll make it so later on austerity people will know both sides so just so you know our next meeting will be wednesday june fifteenth at city hall it will be a mere child Frey talking about unit hurdles and the toggle to talk with the unit Colonels what are they good for and the village they talk is going to be talking from the perspective of well probably slightly different side of the world to the rollout of the next focus we have um I like to thank facebook again as well as a regular space sponsored Bluebird and acknowledge our other sponsors past and present idn canonical random google in a right for their support as well as pearson in addition violent would not be able to function without a many volunteers contributed greatly and as well as today in the past is real estate announcements section does anyone have any announcements they would like to make about community events or anything coming up anyone ok i will mention that the call for papers and the registration for New York City DevOps today's 2016 will be opening real soon now that would be actually happening September 20 something but the call for papers will be in excellent and we will try to get that process going as soon as possible so take a look at them upstairs or if you are interested in presenting or if you're interested in attending for the nylon workshops the next one will be in two weeks on the 14th the day before our next presentation that will be no be at City College at 138 and amsterdam jun 14 6 to 8 p.m. and it will appear on the now and get a page very soon in case you missed it there are linux distro DVDs on the butcher block table and the back over there take a look if you were to take one will use it and it's yours after the presentation will be heading to pop up in 88 university place that's between 11 and 12 for drinks to talk to say hey so hopefully you'll be able to join us now as I mentioned questions will be coming at predefined points where our presenters will be giving us an opportunity to feedback these vulgar questions until those points and that will get them on camera I can get an austerity all right does anyone again last chance for announcements alright great well everyone thank you please welcome Daniel about Garcia and I'm in the nexus didn't decide on lakers our four lakes update puppet forward one execution in discovery thank you hey guys thank you for coming and also thank you again to the organizers who really did a good job during this civilized man we really organized this last week basically all right i'm so four men launch of what happened this is the front page of the formula that or give you don't use it what we're going to do today is basically speak like for 5-10 minutes about what what is it what we do and then he'll i'll tell you about what changes were made to sport papa for it but most of them you really have to care about them and you could be just about before it's going to work transparently and yeah and after if I'm is going to talk about remote execution which is up plugging that you try and change this outward maintain discovery so that it works in networks that do not have pixie all right um yeah again for mandatory if you have any doubts or questions or whatever just go there and check it out during the talker anytime you have any questions you can ask us later um all right so what is for manner as I said this is going to be quick just to get a feel for how many people here have used it or use it okay Wow okay so like twenty percent maybe a little bit okay so for those without music which is the various people here it's a open source tool for managing the lifecycle of your hosts hosts being defined as virtual machines very metal systems and they also have like your plugin for supporting the lifecycle of containers um what do we mean when we say light cycle it's kind of a load of work worth so its life cycle for us at this big provision in the house which means which means provisioning the hosts in a in a cloud environment like kind of a doer or Google compute engine or yeah liver whatever configuration which means configuring it with any any tool like like Papa for instance or it can be now an ansible Jeff salt and monitoring which I got to change that one to report it because that's mostly what we do we basically report about what's going on on your inventory of hosts it dangerous to infuse because I haven't owned a getting actual picture of how of what it is alright so for provisioning as I said before we support their men oh I think that's kind of how pretty started by solving that need of having a data center and having to register hosts thing for into a inventory but it's also extended to a bunch of other people virtualization apartments and cloud environments I called what you can see there and a lot more I'm gonna miss them all yeah and also you have like your own virtual education system at work there's this bug insist this plug-in framework that we have which is basically it specially rails but a little modify it if you don't if we not sports on some free rotation system you can just write a play for you and I guess like done about it video because we can play take care of things like packaging testing and so forth um okay that's for work your provision it how would you provision it it can be by a thick see which means that what your machine turns on it contacts it contacts a picture server and gets a definition for what it's supposed to do a hot start or via an image which if the usual thing that most people doing in calamari and after we provisionally host things like the NS kids btp Senate race when you're hosting a in our IP a real and journals comes together for configuration and Foreman dozen itself it doesn't do any configuration on on at seven it's faithfully relying on all these tools so what we do though is we provide a definition of how a host should look like so let's say I have a host and I won't you have MVP on it I won't you have an table sold on it I want to have some SSH keys in it well what Foreman does in this case is it gives dumb configuration management tool on the definition will see the moment in action because I think I'll be also confused about how if I haven't seen it too all right and for monitoring we do think like if your configuration failed and some hosts you get it emails if your if your hosts are running rail you can get our limits about that say some new cv comes up if you have cattle installed which is a plugin appointment we know the art games that are in your car your system so we can get you can get them you can get alerts about new cds that come up and touch them really quickly same goes for things like open scape which is a way of making sure security compliance policies are armed force and I think now I'm going to go into the brief demo okay there's like a bunch of Andhra buy things here like a lab integration and multi-tenancy so if you have like multiple organizations in your company some organization this shouldn't be able to assess someone else's hosts and so forth oh and something that it's kind of important if you have more or less production level network is that all these dreams like the big fixes are dhcp tftp orchestration and all that it all happens not in one post it happens on what we call smart proxy which is a host that is deployed on one network to do these operations and it's basically if you have six method networking okay let's actually go into the demo now get like one minute introduction of the history of it all the project again the foreman that are you having any questions they're bullying the Foley can be an answer in there all right so when you log in the formula what you see at first is this overview which is a dashboard of what happened the Glee on your inventory you see a future it's like in here 63 of my hosts have no report which means it's kind of worrisome because none of them have run any kind of configuration in a long time my husband what's like the limit of the things like two days or something like that okay well it's configurable anyway and yeah you can see they like in the watch commander Oh hosts run anything what happened like some tasks and i also created like some vm Cena in a private network in this computer and they were discovered so we can see that the last 24 hours i created this host from 1996 apparently yes i can see this kind of things if i go and click and let's say i can see the information about it and they find okay with with all of it i can just click on permission and start preparing the host all right he's going to do it them about how to do this hand of discovery but without teach the server which is kind of far it used to be a hard apartment on format okay another main screen a foreman is like the hosts page which is kind of during inventory what is that before i should like the oberon system the all of the information of you that you have about your hosts and it shows this thing called a host group which is a template template that would define as a template for how your hosts should look like so you let's say click on your host I don't want to create a new one I'm going to be able to select a host group and this is going to pre-select things like I want deployed in the network a or network be it's going to get an IP address automatically just concocted the dhcp server and saw that 16 street so it contacted it they also got a domain yeah i can ensure the operating system here chisel roast password and so forth and interesting part of this is the armature step and the top of closet staff when you create a host okay not this one because it's okay now so when you create a host what you can do is to define the public classes that have wanted that you want to be wrong on the host which means i have like some groups in gear like base linux it contains just a setup of the echo Bravo firewall message of the day and these standard library witches it's making a module that's installed terminal dental tools I think right so if i can click if i click in here I might get ok this one doesn't remember anyway if I clicking here next time you pop it runs in this host it's going to get a definition of the hopes that contains all these modules and probably is going to understand that that hose you look like it and run it so i'm going to show you in case you're curious how that exactly look like all right so let's say this one all right also you get okay this this one it's called the external nodes yellow dump it's basically what's provided to puppet so puppet can read the demo file and understand how the boat should look like so this one doesn't have any classes it's not going to do anything if you have any classes in it you you can pass these parameters and use them in your puppet manifests so if you have any help of manifest domain name it can read it from from gear and quiet and your manifest um okay um now that is basically all that I want to show you today about as an intro formula thing most people could get a feel of what it is just by seeing this you can do other things like get a console around Adele Howard the host on this is Warren soft and so forth but I guess that's just to see it in action later with Yvonne's mo hand and I'll try to explain a bit that would happen with Papa for I just want that thing there's this thing called for visionary templates which is basically every possible sorry I repository for uh templates that you may use when you provisional host so things like user data and you have like a hosting OpenStack any you want to create a new host in OpenStack you can have your clothing and templates yesterday in here and this is already basically in ER e which is Ruby with cuz it Cole it's basically you can interpolate viable from ruby in here and those variables come from the house definition itself all right um so Papa for all right slides for that it's not that interesting but basically a few points that I want to mention all right so one thing is it supports the all-in-one insult it's fine right now the Installer it's it understands that your config files are going to be in all other gloves and so forth um right now the Installer when you when you run it on on proxy you will insult up before there are a few things that you can do like running start setting future parser and stringy five facts on your topic 3 public comp so you can set up these two things up future Carter and string 25 facts and pop it up come on poppet three and then you'll see if then what you'll sir compatible or not other than that we don't really do like anything on with with the new features I just wanted to show one thing like if you have it pop3 up foreign masters are different well you'll see here when you try to import your environments you'll see the list of our elusive classes or environments that change you can more you'll see what was added and removed in each other master for you need to you need to have them insane right so right now I see that if I try to sync my pocket for master it doesn't have some modules so I just decided on updated and same thing with your if I hadn't up top three I popped a free master and i wanted to imported i would not get the impala for my job if I didn't want to as for smart variables and smart / parameters nothing really changed in there are imported just the same there's one one thing that's in the works right now which is the static typing the that parameters can have now in puppet for it it's not ready yet but it's not because of us it's them it's the resource type API and Papa for doesn't return the type of the parameters so if you want / right pop / graphic there's a lot before even even if there's statically you save like that that we type even if it's like that you have to still come to configure classes which is the parameter and choose the key type time i'll try to see if i can make the research type api a return the type of the of the parameters that that would be useful for us um yeah and there's not much else their structure of facts in public for it which are the way they are imported right now it's basically the same way as with all facts like if you have a structure of fact fact that has like several levels there's like colon colony between every level but their own important in the same level but since for an ansible sultan chef they're ready structure of facts support we should really look into how to extract that from these plugins and offer it from format itself and i don't think i have a lot more to say about up for try it if you see something that doesn't work notify us on the mailing list or the red my nature tracker or now it yourself something okay now give it up fema the in that case we will use it you want that question in this corner sorry what did you say you wanna take questions at this point away okay water don't you because they don't have any questions I'll keep this quiet music yes i'm currently running forward 1.7 i'm going to do it if you want meant a lot of grades to get to that level do you have any you know just rules of thumb for how to get clients from the agents for version 3.7 to pave ensuing yeah ok so first off you will need to upgrade also the proxies and for mine before you can create the clients for the fights themselves it doesn't really matter as long as your modules are compatible it's going to find you Jib i'll post it later like maybe on twitter mainly list or something i'll try to make a quick recap but if you set up a few options I think they're turning the written in the release notes for up before but there are a few options and polycom that allow you to see if your manifests would be compiled and hug before I think that's the only recommendation I can really give n F or F dating for men we don't support like jumping from for 17 21 12 so it's the temple bumpy road that you would have to go one one-ten one-twelve what why don't you and yeah and also the properties the proxy would be would be even more important because the proxy itself it's it's one it's what's calling the plat for a TI to read them to read them I call it the environments on the classes so so yeah actually you could do it if I were you out trying to do it like first get the modules to be compatible then starting a smart proxy like fresh from from metal like a last version of this matter to you that you can find which is come up with a pop of for API and yeah then like an experimental for men or try to make the calls to a smart fortwo yourself to see it works but yes come my room addition I've hot if it's if I can recommend in it I think I'm sorry does anyone have any other boys shoes corp gonna confront this work world from review why I didn't marry before yeah there's a quick question on on permissions the example you gave is great for somebody who's in dev and has full admin access everything do you have any segregation of certain types of permissions yeah example sometimes certain groups can only have access to certain networking things from personal access to Medusa videos 80 or LDAP other groups only run applications and so on right um you got format around in there okay is that you were just stuck over there we have we have the right input yeah the more run and so for informations we have actually a role based authentication control alright so it's something that you mentioned like networking you wouldn't be able to like prevent people from like deploying inserting something that I guess but they're there things there are things like you could like wait what we call computer resources which is um connection to your to your cloud provider or your virtual education provider and you could create different computer resources what would you use what okay okay but I mean how how do you create machines in that club it's it's not a okay hmm ok so in that case I guess you would be like those machines or would be understood by four minutes like metal machines that there wouldn't be much integration with liberalisation system because it's like main so you would be doing things like what you want is going to show it and like discover they're in the network then set them up and you can create rules like if some team was discovering this network thing putting this organization or location or whatever and then x y&z people have access to it or groups or butter but yeah I can give you like a bit more of a deep dive on onion rolls later if you want any of the great rooms next question can I go high on a case foreman for my racks which is fine networking devices um what will you use so essentially i'm wondering they can replace same i see em TV system right now I seem to me that's for your content management matter ok what does what does that leave a container I think there's any my entire inventory of servers for coming forward like registering things and it would be easy and I know there's this newspaper Brazil called global who wrote well they break a life support for a AIX and other and some cisco routers um like in terms of getting them in there it would be definitely possible configuring them and getting reports from them they have depends on whether these things support any well I mean the environment where you could run like Python or Ruby or or something like that but yet for getting them their ass in a DB maybe like right commented on it and put like parameters if you want to avoid this DVD and say hey this router was installed at this date and it needs this special thing you can definitely the if it's just a bit then then certainly yes if you want to configure that mean then it depends on the visa forward and particularly okay okay oh my Bush about the the fact that you're providing is that something that is that static file that you're laying down or is there an API that the client or the server is depending on configuration management system what access to to get those facts or okay grains award yeah thank you for whatever so 85 like it like that um most of these come by a factor and a puppet or oh hi or more handsome all facts for Tom manager hats phone consult but rain yeah they're full of grace right now boy I am from well guess what I'm asking is you lay a file down is it remote access or do you have about we have an idea can you know to like API and we also have a CLI for it so you can like you can write scripts that boy this API or just um usually does he like I wake up for it that's called hammer if you go to the formula you'll see like a CLA yeah I feel like things that they all tell you how to use it it's basically you put your name and username and then you can query things a bit more easily is that like a swagger you I or is it something you know over uh when it's on a new I like I see lights on a console so I see right it's like you don't have to write coral past like and sulfur 50 Gades and do all that kind of stuff you just like right hammer facts list and then like a search boy are no sudden and equals 192 168 00 and then you'll get fat for hosts hanging in there we can show you let it work able some time sorry thanks anyone else last chance all right and I think we have the author of the original author of the heavens Eli that we have here I think don't be weak do it yeah I think run oh sorry he goes comment so he's author of the line so okay so i will proceed to the second part of our talk before we get to their I'm regard I met in here you can notice at the top of the screen the time the local time that I'm used to so it's two in the morning for me now you just share about 4,000 miles and I'm going to people like them also what possibly go wrong so we'll see also I won it at 5pm and i got here at still be in my subway and trying everything i think i made the new record at least it felt for me that it was really fast and everything everything worked two hours from landing to JFK if letting in jaya karo to to hear downtown so yeah it work but I used to how fast the trouble but I'm really impressed so anyway so we'll get to the hands-on session here with just one hand because the other I need for meter phone but we'll try so I first we'll try the pixel s discovering first of all I will ask you if you know how the big c boot and know when you how the provision with big see how it works it doesn't yeah okay so that's why i will show the pics to us one and i'll i'm also pretty confident that it should work because i don't have to care about the dns and no tftp and all those services that we originally need to handle for that so originally for man can handle the adequate installation sweet pixie so we kind of the hcp record vm we can handle the tftp so that when I provisional you host the new tip tpe record gets on us on the right place so that when the machine boots up it just you know Bob's everything and everything just works most of the time and but sometimes it doesn't and sometimes people have environments where they even don't want us to manage the deep sea peor tftp services for various reasons so that's where the pixels discovery comes in place so first thing is just a discover itself because I think it's pretty amazing project it's applying to the format so i will show how that works i will simulate the Perito provisioning here using my liquid but no we can use some imagination here so i was similar that i have really had our boards if i've plugged in either no CD or USB with some I saw bootable iso iso and i've prepared one I saw by my own or I used the Discovery plug-in to generate one for me so it's really small in each running Center 7 we know we try to minimize everything we could so that it doesn't take too much to load and so I would try to boot from that and we will see how far will go just defaults are okay whatever i will use some same same network for this purpose and this should be so the image start booting and after it dallas drama sorry minimize version of some distro and we will run the format works see one that Daniel already mention so any mention at the architecture that we use the form and proxy just know too heavily thing or you know providing some API for external surfaces so one of the api's might be even controlling some external host so imagine you plug your USB in two some new fresh hardly did you just bought and you are pretty happy that you around something exciting so you get the page like this and you don't even have to care about that you know you just finding your done that they'd center and walk away and what you care about is this page discovered house where these hoes just appeared it's something that also done already shown so this new box shown there and we can try to provision provision from that so the traditional approach would be we configure the tftp and dhcp so that no the at the next reboot the machine booze from the network it gets the right configuration and boots but since we don't have the HCP and tftp configured here which I'm go ahead because it would break here for sure so I will double the pixel x version where instead of the dhcp we when i go and go to provision i can call it the 1i will said highly promising i hope is ok my luck is better and my name is nature's if you want to try this on but but sure is not that hard I guess so my life so I so right now if it should be prepared for provisioning and when i go back to do a machine he should start doing something so instead of rebooting it goes right k exec command so that we don't have to reboot and we just you know start you can on everything on there and the rest works the same as the big salute one so when i go to just to give you some overview let me just increase the phones so when I go to how the persian new template looks like so it generates for us the kickstart file that just gets booed in and you can see that you just started with story you know what what I track or what I ask it to do so this is first thing that you can do with the pixels or with this area itself so it's really very tall as a service and it gets even more interesting because you can do two things when you prepare the I soaps for booting you can build in some custom facts to to the to the itch so when I go and provision some more useless terminal and I have Grafton's come on that should create another vm with the same and will look more into details of the facts because I when I was preparing this ISO image I put their son has contacts and when I swish by the way this is a mobile version of the other thing which I written or even in its nice for demos when you have no big screen so let me decrease the phones so i will go to hear discovered house and we'll look at what facts we actually will have right when the Machine moves yet still so thanks okay we have another one my factory for VMS here which is nice so what I did was adding some effect into the host called hello what else I could name it and I like was the value for that so this is no value that I put into the night so you can probably imagine what you could do is preparing different I sauce with that you just different in the fact that use and I will show you how you can use it later so I don't hear something that I can use and then we have the discovery rules where I can set neuro groove here where I will search 3x hello so I was searched for this type and I will say that if a host with these tags boots up I want it to be in an Iowa user group or hose group in this case I can craft some nice hostname for that so in this case i will use nighlok prefix and then the last part from the i be using some regular expressions which is you could do some more advanced through be here if you want it but regular expressions are ok for now and that's pretty much it so what we just configured is when the DS machine was up next time it should automatically start provisioning it as you described so I'm gonna just to confirm that i want this location of organization and it says i turned on as well for now is the city that I'm coming from so we probably just won't show up to talk about that is very nice evening czech republic in central europe so ok now it works so so let's see how words so i can either see all the vows that match the room so that's one way to look at that and when i hit the other provision all you should start doing the same but now I did to select the whole Europe again so we just use the rule to configure the host properly but what's even more interesting is when I spin app I can cancel that and spin up another host we can go to home no control I almost there so i will use number two so when ice on another vm again it will again boot the discovery image but immediately the format will apply the rule based on the facts that you will start provisioning so you don't even have to go to format you just plug the USB your CD or what you are used to produce me and let it do its work so magic so that's probably know that's the core part of the discovery plugin and what was added later was the big c less things or using the kk exact so that we don't have even have tftp dhcp there so i have now three beams installing something so i will probably key on my laptop soon so me force of everything and this one part of my demo which worked pretty well and so I will leave questions for this press I'll any questions I'll eat questions questions come the lacuna or even what you want us to repeated or we have many questions okay yet so in this state so the question was if it's a pixel s boot if it's always from some buddah moment media you could configure your dhcp also to do just this static I so if you don't so if you have dhcp network that you don't own form and control or you know we have some corporate one that nobody lets you touch you know it's not a service that somebody would need to care about so you instead with us then just to configure the bootable image there so no dynamic thing then you will then control the risk so it's not limited just to the USB okay so that's one question and one who was loving two questions one is do you just use the native pics here can use I pixie there are multiple operators for that which I can publish show the provisioning templates inspection of us later on when I searched for Big C and hope we would find something this big thing I am saying button or something so we had even freebsd its kind of mixed with so it's Big C I think I pixie was there as well maybe Danielle become ok ok sir might I have a question totally different question oh how good is integration dude does it integrate with commercial p.m. cluster servers like VMware and hyper-v ok so we have their show with vsphere and its know all these providers we have innovation also for over it or read for leafy earth and others and they are on a similar level you can sometimes we hit limitations of the folk library that we use at the beginning so for some more advanced stuff we sometimes make the person that she's to folk to support this case and then use use the vmware bus it's still moving and it depends on which cases our users usually hit so but we have a large user base or around we see a hyper-v lucidum so as their support from Ellis PG&E that microphone so yeah we did a survey about doing hyper-v vs microsoft azure because it seemed like it was like an overlap with people that use one or the other and it was like 75 as your and the rest I pervy do you use is your know okay so yeah okay so yeah I preview where they don't do it and I wouldn't say it's not a road map but it's not in any in the near future yeah especially since which is hit the as your thing it was it was just big for you we can't do both how difficult is it again to add support so maybe you can check if you have internet okay so yeah it's right sure if it's on the form of the work there is there's a way of sorry a tutorial for great employment you have someone that knows a little bit of Ruby it really isn't difficult and we can help you out world they on the form iron and the form an adaptive IRC channels um yeah so if you're really interested in making I hyper you will help you do you program we'd set patches Bobby every last benefit seriously we plug in the plug-in use the model that former has its not that complex at least add to rudimentary pieces of this so you know go for it you know and then you will put your names and lights up trouble using free hat or something all the loop says if you got this year working you can probably do anything um anywhere else of questions it's a solid and I was like very very confused it could be question what does k exact up so and what the- nicotine exact copy so you've done a blue and maybe a vision k-tech instead of reboot yes that's right service running that the formatting can communicate to and when I need the provision through the API it tells a service from the kids kids like okay second question is this whole thing about shifting and I so I mean I think there was enough time for you to write an answer okay you know seven I mean you said your you've said you're somehow rewriting the I so that's good read loop but boy it's felt really fast and I so I really got to be ready I can show you how you can move it's the written stop what's the ring was cuz I think everything in my sister it's it's called cash so to say it doesn't mean it really sink at the end right so if i wanted to create so i don't know if the question was about creating you i saw ya know I I had prepared fun but I can show you how i can create anyone so this is the commands that we provide the discovery monster that reversal provides the building I so for you and all I change here now serve that I will change the hell effect two nighlok one and I can show you how fast eddies so as long as I ride my heart okay that's it right and so it's not that complicated so five megabytes rumors that a sentence and she said yeah it's interesting right right it's just in order to do a second stage hulo dad were tied for third stage or fourth or whatever with a question in the back yeah let me get you might perform you so on the topic of isos are they stored locally where where are they if you want to upload a new operating system so it depends you can really create no bootable USB from the ISO or you can configure for example they often use it in vsphere we're in the tone of the hcp so they just say when create the vm configure boot from the side so i did the same when i use the lift I choose at the beginning boot from so it's similar to when you have them say mr. I saw that you want to install from but instead of using the show I saw from blizzard distribution uses you use this small I saw that boots this discovery image so that's littering it may I ask if you also offer not to compare too much with other things but purchase like cobbler a lot of the features built into that or to mirror repose which I think that it is that something that you have a tie-in to make it help you all together yeah similarly still so I can show the I'm afraid I would broke my whole next demo so I want to do that I had a bad experience with collecting to defend horse over and over okay yeah I'm just really trying I ok so if you know spacewalk everyone's foremost spacewalk here spacewalker ok so cuttle provides peccato misapplying into the form and that provides the most functionality so it allows to synchronize repositories and provide local copy having ultra mobile updates and Erica if they need to use them and in the cobbler I guess the question was regarding some what's the installation make media so that's one thing that we have there so you don't have to probe you just from iso about you you can reconfigure different endpoints for different operating systems and the cord there are the provisioning headlights where you basically then can use let's say we have week vidiyum user base we also packaged the project into the BM and I think for VSA as well but I have seen some know the port's thing so at but it is we have the precedes templates we have the size of course we have the bsd as well so either e depends on your imagination and if the thing that you feed or it's always about providing the right line in the pixie so that no the kenya boots with the perimeter whether it's proceed or kick start and we can produce the templates for I think that you this month I'm charge escapes that work including it only works with other Linux kernels right that's not very little better operations it that's basically two layers there so when I show back the one was that I provisioned sorry I don't need to confuse things I'm just not familiar with the full capability so it is that's great i just i'm not sure ya mean it so i'm primarily a ruby and rails developer so it's like I tried my best to understand these things as well but so what I can just show is the demo machine we have different templates for different things so I can see what how the K exact thing looks like so this is what we send to the forum proxy on discovery so that it runs the casing with some parameters that we provide here so that's one stage one is run it was the provisioning template itself so this is no the past anaconda in can be passed to proceed and others as well if you use a pic sting instead this is what the big c configuration looks like so configured in on your tftp so it's pretty similar to multiple cobbler that I don't know provide as much i can compare one to one but you should be able to achieve a single things this great presenter have another question yeah oh we have to i'm going to give up stairs i'm gonna go over university here you go so even with the small i sell you still have to have dhcp on the network right no i don't know but like I can but I don't have to control thats over four month so that that's the key difference so I can have the dhcp just for the hopes to have some IP at the end but for mine doesn't need to know anything about this dhcp service so directionally we control the hcp so that when the host booted we reserve the IP for them we also owe it based on the mega make a dress we configure the tftp we can even confuse dns so that know the names and suction works and this kind of thing so we can do a lot of things when you give us the permission to control DCPD ftp and dns but in case you don't give us this permission you can still use for meant for what's billed for with the discovery plugin though you it still has to be able to obtain an IP on its up right died so doesn't have one pre provisioned in it I'm not sure I follow if you use the discovery I so you still have to have a I pee on their you if you don't have dhcp at all right yeah I guess I think there is even option to you know kind of pre-configured ad so the development I need a dhcp at all but I I'm not sure hobbit or surface or you're suggesting maybe if you were going to attach physical media that we would have to pre configure those in the yet so one thing that i haven't mentioned i'm not sure if I've so quickly I can do what I'm the host I need that in just throw the beginning how many gigabytes you have no what so I destroy exam so one thing that the discovering wish even provides is the tree so if you want to configure something additionally i haven't played too much that i need to asks colleague of mine come here to give the really deep dive but we have also the dives recorded on our youtube channel if you are interested more into how it works so may I think including up to that in the video Jen you can make sure you get those trust weekend and the other provision was faster than we saw I wasn't able to show you the the tree but there is really an ability to configure these things that you asked for sorry it'll prompt you if you if you hit it in terms of saying manually trigger yeah does anyone have you another question here we go it sort of sort of a thing since you started it maybe at some point you can give me the links or something talk a little bit about there plug-in API and I was just at some point the kind of like a little bit of like if you really want think we get involved like yeah where you go so what is it look like so really I don't have eternity but when you go to the deform at heart there should be no the links to anything everything that's needed for for this kind of glad I can share it like right after when you finish it up put my career here with the URL and you can see it there's like a community section that you can read and I told you how country of how do you can write a new fight and all that and if you've got about licensing histology bill too so I think are you single that you have a question okay yeah I think we're about to move on to our we're going to wrap up in a few minutes and we'll say normally we would have books here and give away today we are dry so however I did ask even and Daniel to have questions would you all like to do it for me a thing just for the Brighton rice should we try it out all right you have any questions I have questions all regarding the five of the demo deaths I haven't shown let's do it that's more challenging okay that might bypass up people's note-taking I can give you we don't do break we'll just break it until of this Jacob it's a shout it out go for it just ok so fun i will have questions about the formatting on execution so one question is what connects to the remotes host when you use the form an evil retribution so first thing is which do we come to use for the old execution we have someone in the back who's a go for an SSH SSH or first point all right i'm not sure if i right the second point so maybe somebody else what service actually SS AG's to to the remote host TLS like the setups or process you know you add hazard process of shorts up your shame I'm sorry so you're saying there's a process that starts up in the initiate signature oh we have the same right yes is more prompt so you have to finish it you haven't seen the talk but how do I sports so yeah what we do so I will use these questions and answers to really talk about their executions if I like it so what what we really use is women I need to show the demo I'm sorry oh my god I don't have this before okay so we can improvise you so what we do when you so we own execution is really about no one of things you need to do really about something to some host usually updates but you can do a little things we don't recommend recommended for using it for config management with their tools or the company management and no proper Jensen and everything but sometimes you really have to trigger one of job even if it was Papa Drac just some remote execution will come on so close oh ok ok so they're just think there's a thing called job template which basically contain the both the definition of what you're okay which one I want on the show well if they contain basically what you're going to run in a host this case of it was wrong systemctl and then an actual service it's basically a language that understands what your host is and basically characteristics of your host and then act on it multi pending on them so you give you were to run the script on a rather host everyone systemctl if it was not red hat more than six it was just from the old surface you want me to run this on some hopefully I guess I can just run command I don't know if I have more than one host on but anyway so well so what we do is we provide sssh we have the magnitude of this architecture that the way that we are not dependent for the sake so we'll add probably some messy face provider soon it was not her once I happy to see as I say Jing something searching somewhere it's like it triggers something in fight-or-flight instinct in some studies so but even for ssh we try to not be no set her eyes and whether the Magnus Foreman service would do the work but we can know Oregon's obstacles of networking where the main server would not even be able to connect to the SSH so what you will need to deploy the forward proxy again that's no one part that we integrated heavily with and you can deploy that on your subnet and then the only thing you need is selection between the main server and the foreign proxy you can also use it for botoxing you could have multiple or too much to handle for one process or vm for a cessation we can happen so we can store multiple ones and we can distribute the slope also when something some properties down we don't care we just know it's that we will not use it and one so we have their also ability to set the execution of the future or set the recurring actions we come groan groan like like thing and another interesting thing is being able to control the concurrency level so for example if you run yet yeah my leg if you had stuck 1000 all sort option suppose you could quite easily just go send your info section down because it will not be able to handle that so we can spread the wall with across some spy time or we can send home kind syllable so that we just goes one after another so result of features built-in in this simple feature and the most important thing is that it's also just plug in which is kind of an actual case of what you can do with plug ins info so that's really I just need to talk about them yeah so you answered your own question ready we have another question I can just open if I plot unlike this and plug this again though I I spent a lot of time to demo I rear good hey not to show you the process is horse I guess some wrap up the trivia so I think I think this is great i will take we need to ask this module ok so i prepared so I have some i protect them to be the end but they are really docker containers with a cessation because I don't want to run ten beams here so i have here simple screen that's exactly what you would use remote execution for because I hear that i will not have the internet here and i have the docker images with Seth Louis images that they point to do you know internet to get all the things done and I noted so I have healed miyoko end point I just wanted some I saw and I want to temporarily configure my bm's to to use that for installing something so what i can do is back here and run the street on the clients that I want and I want them to around them on the foreman house I can quickly check that there should be temples in debt and execute it now and it's running Associated Marshall progress so know how good because what but everything yeah but the next thing we can do is use this very same host but now really install something on there once we have the VMS so i will choose the package action and i will say that i want to install what else into the passage and execute it now and so I have my local mirror of the simplest imagery so you can just see that it was too fast show the progress but even we can even show like a taste of that and for the more advanced stuff that was talking about you can even say in the advanced fields that I won't say the comm console about set to 2 and when I examined execution itself again you can see that it started kind of one by one or two by two so not executing immediately insider yeah yeah I mentioned that that you don't want to be the obvious one is you don't want it to over about your network you might find other so it might be kind of boring solution also for the page a that you don't want to turn everything off advanced but we can add more that we are very but its second base for that do you have any yet bus where you can follow where the state is coming from where you can track the successes and failures they go along and the record of past jobs and such yeah all the things that we we have here are tracked and in the jobs so we have the days I know what happens where it happened we can also do things when you have something that failed so just not some host could fail so disabilities veririm just a failed once so it's we started into development last year and we can you know we are still in iterations to make it better we loop that's why we are talking about that because we are also looking for the feedback so don't worry you will try the remote execution itself doesn't need puppet doesn't it i think it just need to format proxy and message so my meeting something interesting to play with so i think we're covered in the end of our time i'm going to suggest that if anyone has further questions please come out we're going to go to pop up after this over on university to level 12 a couple of drinks SE lo ask your questions there thank you very much even in Daniel you you
