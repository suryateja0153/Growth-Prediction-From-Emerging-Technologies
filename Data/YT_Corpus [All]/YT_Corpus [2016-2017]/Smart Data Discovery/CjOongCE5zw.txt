 alright guys welcome for coming out to o microphone streaming media West today we're going to talk about how big data can increase ott ad revenue we think it's it's really an important time in an interesting time in the online media space because things are changing one more folks are using over the top television how things are measured or changing this year so it we're really honored to have our panel members here so just for us to get a sense of who's in the audience and the type of businesses you come from just give me an idea I mean anyone can go give me an idea of the type of business you're coming from is broadcasters is that Studios tech telcos and anyone yes sir cable emma is so perfect what else come on Sonya can't be use broadcast is perfect ah perfect anyone else yes ma'am CDN okay broadcast products and services okay any ad agency folks here anyone that sells to every ad agencies broadcasters of course okay got a good good idea guys gosh we've got a great panel here with us today we've got technologists we've got folks from the ad agency business that actually spend money on broadcast so so that's a good thing platform manufacturers are technology companies and also data scientists that take a look at all this data and predict habits and things so we're going to start off with the intros i'm steve washer moderator I've come from a company called Siemens have a background with ABC broadcast and I write screenplays and make movies too so it's a little bit of both ends and I started out actually in an agency being a media buyer when I was going through college and beating up broadcasters and doing that objection so I sort of relate to that so if we can go we're not sitting in order but we'll just go sort of what we have here Andy you want to do intro on yourself sure my name is Andy beach I'm a program manager at Microsoft work with a variety of the developers that are building the apps that folks are looking to monetize on right Jason yeah so I'm president and noble people LA where a media agency based in New York and Los Angeles I've been on the advertising and media side for about 15 years where did shia dad worked at whiteman kennedy we got to you about 35 people represent about 15 clients doing anything from you know small digital video buys up to super bowl buys this year expensive buys there at the Superbowl it's a bow valuable by valuable biases right prospective buyers are not want to introduce yourself I'm learn of I'm a graduate student at university of southern california electrical engineer and currently i'm working on a couple of data science and machine learning projects related to multimedia and advertisements and dr j um my name is jay yogeshwar i am director of media entertainment broadcast at hitachi data systems as they say director of fun stuff but you know hitachi itself is enterprise IT company and so we sort of the arms dealer to media companies in a good way in a good but they are more importantly i mean we've seen a huge transition from you know bespoke appliances within the broadcast systems to cloud-based and analytics based systems that are software-defined so i'm experiencing part of that transition and i want to share with you some of the learnings on how we're trying to implement media analytics on the types of enterprise IT infrastructures ok thanks you know I think we hear a lot of things going on in the market but over the top television and you know is it a new way people consume media and if so how do we build businesses around that you know we'll take a look at some stuff here are some statistics from the market you know one way is your the netflix model people pay x amount per money per month they get to watch all the movies they want a netflix has a bunch of subscribers x 8 that's your revenue stream the other way is an ad-supported model where someone watches something for free sort of like broadcast television and they have to you know we have to pay for that so they have to watch ads so the big question in the market is one you know is that model that we used to have when i was at ABC a broadcast model that supported by ad revenue is that sustainable x over the top television and if so at what rates you know we used to call it you know analog dollars for digital dimes so the question is what's happening is that it's a supportable model so let's just jump down through some of the statistics here so when we take a look at over the top television we look at at a world you know the siemens is a worldwide company so when we look at at the world what's going on at ott we clearly see in north america is the way that's leading over the top television compared to the other regions this is the most interesting point and this is really the the crux of what we're going to talk about today we look at advertising / internet advertising overtaking TV advertising this is the first year that that really happened so again what we're thinking a cost per point delivery of broadcast TV versus internet television this is where this balance starts to change right this is when over the top television business models that our ad-supported started to change and support themselves which in the past never occurred again we're going to get into this and a lot more detail ott app growth usage can take a look at what's happened in each very short period of time 2014-2015 the use of ott for apps for delivering and videos or TV apps I TBC HBO GO CBS mobile app a game chip has changed especially with HBO and CBS going direct to consumers so discussion points what are open platform for analytics because you know what in the old days we used to pull out the old old days arbitron and nielsen we go and i'd go project the program i give it to my sales guys and they go sell it but what today what is that open platform for analytics what do you guys say Steve I can talk to that so today you still have a big need to to host your analytics on a platform because quick time to inside is really the key to market agility you want to be able to perform data integration you want to perform data discovery and predictive analytics very very quickly on a platform that saves you time that you do not have to go and manually figure out how to integrate your different components how to batch ingest how to stream in jest and how to do all the real time processing that's needed to go with the analytics so essentially if you're able to build a sort of a software-defined platform that can provision that can monitor secure the media analytics and also do the troubleshooting then you save the the time frame to take an analytic idea a concept and actually monetize it becomes much shorter so so the goal really is to build a platform that any any ad agency for example can run their software on and quickly gained very valuable insights yeah so from an agency standpoint Honda comes to you say that your client they say look here's two million dollars for our fourth quarter by right you've got of course you got Nielsen right but you want to provide them more than the other agencies what what sort of analytics are you guys looking at and there's not there's not great analytics in the space right now right so you look I mean there is you know you've got kind of Nielsen on the television side you've got folks like comscore that's on the Digital side and again both of these are kind of sampling methodologies I think when you get into ott if they're not participating meaningfully in some sort of again open third party system like that then you've got to really take their numbers on a face value and so you're seeing a lot of that I don't think that there isn't kind of a one-stop-shop for us to be able to go for metrics you know app annie is another thing that will look at so we can understand kind of app downloads but again just you're grabbing metrics from kind of disparate sources and they're all based on the different sampling methodology so it's it's really hard to go oh that actually does equate to what Nielsen would call a point right that those are our apples to apples so that's the difficult piece of us right so so your clients are coming to you in there they want justification where you spent at two million dollars what what's the process with all the new technologies that you have at your fingertips what's what do you present to them there's I mean there's a lot of different kind of tracking methodologies for video that we can use right but I think in terms of I guess there's two piece of it there's what date I'm going to use to plan to make decisions of where I'm going to apply and then there's what data I'm going to use to say that that by actually delivered so in that sense like Nielsen's got both of those things for us I don't think you're seeing that you know there is no kind of industry standard platform like that stretching across TT some people participate in something some people participate in other things but that's that's a super big challenge so so Andy you're you guys have access to tons of data probably do more than we want to feel comfortable with so what's what do you see out there well yeah right so on the unlike acquiring the data side right there's definitely like but I think it's not that they're right I think I agree that it's not that there's a uniform way of doing it there are tons of data right so right now because we're still evolving this it's up to the company to sort of roll their own matrix for it and so there are tools you know online for for doing some of that on you know everybody's cloud platform of choices on the Microsoft side there's things like CI that basically just become giant dashboards you can plug all the data into it that you want and start start quickly sort of pulling out analysis and so that's the way we're doing it now because there's not a way there's not a way that anybody is identified as the the way that everybody wants to do it moving forward and I think it's probably another you know it's probably another four or five maybe longer years before we consolidate down to a methodology that everybody can agree to so in terms of like where we're taking that data though I mean I think particularly as we're as we look at like the sort of the mobile usage side versus console or TV usage we're getting tons of information not only from like how you act how you access it but like who's actually watching it because you've got sampling data from things like the cameras that are that are in there that can be securely transferred in ways now and so there's weights to parse that information so you not only know like what they're doing when they're watching you actually know who may be watching it and that's data that can also be rolled into it and I think that pushes that value price up even more interesting and an art of as a data scientist you see a lot of tools out there that there may be in other industries what what do you how do you see those tools from other industries being used in predicting what someone may watch or someone made by I completely agree with any that there there's no standards for collecting and collecting the data but there is no one good way to do it but there there are a lot of bad base to do it that if you do something and then it your model doesn't work it could be destructive to your business as far as technology goes there there are you could use social platforms you could use Facebook Twitter API is to get user in users information you could scrape the D there there's a company called gum gum that visits that that sees all the web pages that are user visits and using computer vision and image processing algorithms they extract the information of the images that's on that pages so there's there's a lot of models that you can use to extract any kind of information but how you use that I I know that hitachi has a great open platform for learning that distributed computing and how you use all that information to make a meaningful this season for for your business or monetizing the content or delivering the advertisement that's that's what really matters so ok to make everyone really nervous in the audience if everyone ops in so give us I mean can you really predict what someone's going to buy I mean is there that much information out there do you think are not definitely probably like I said there's this it's a digital world and there's a beta bytes and terabytes of data just maybe relating to one person or like a group of person or a demographic of person and the way you tap into that information really is all that matters I actually met this company right now and the exhibits lift igniter and they are doing this in real time and they're using all that cloud computing AWS and Scala and all these machine learning tools to actually do this in real time yeah I think one of you guys may have heard it but there's one a smart TV manufacturer forgot who it was that was turning on cameras on those smart TVs just the how they were using it I'm sure it was opted in to record folks if they were watching or not actually Nielsen sort of did this to on there wasn't the people meter was something else just to determine who's in the audience is it an adulterer on a belt yeah so the technology's there you know how we use it for the good could help us justify higher costs maybe I don't know perhaps the costings like a wide open issue there's so much that impact cost and I think like there's there's a rush in the advertising industry has been for probably four or five years to get really targeted with everything I think we're starting to see the backlash of that a little bit I think there are things like scale that still matter I think what happened in digital display around programmatic and machine learning left a lot of people not as satisfied no what do you mean by that give us any well I think you know part of part of in this rusty I think have data to justify a higher CPM so say I'm looking for people who are in market for to buy an automobile that you know that the folks who supply that data and these third parties who are doing this analysis to identify those people that are in market are incentivized to make those pools as large as possible because at the end of the day auto makers start to sell a lot of cars right so it's great to say like absolutely sure one person's going to buy a car but I've got to sell million of those and so I think there are a lot of people who exhibit characteristics you know within a given you know purchase pattern if you will and you can say that that's them I don't think it represents the market and a lot of this depends on product too so what you have is you'd have data vendors who are saying okay well I've been I've invented this algorithm to say these are this is these are people who are in market in Auto and they're incentivized to make that tool as large as possible to then sell that back to say a yahoo is going to sell it to me and so a lot of that third party data and that kind of like you know sizing up of those databases I think contributed support results right so then you start to see things where the premium that I paid for targeting those ads to automakers versus whether i had just blasted something out cheap right the premium i paid for targeting didn't didn't actually you know pay out in term so it would have been cheaper for me just to have all the waste in a in a mass by that's almost like the old model i direct you know versus a broadcast by yeah I mean there's the same kind of targeting like we've seen it we've done these experiments in direct milk doesn't really in any me oh is it is that premium I'm targeting actually worth it in terms of what your business results going to be and I think a lot of that depends on the product I think it's really different for rolex and it is for mac and cheese or a lot of people buy mac and cheese that need predictive behavior to know who is going to buy mac and cheese like it's pretty much almost everyone in America so I'm gonna focus on different kinds by so I think a lot of it depends on the product that you're in you know travels like a really interesting space right because there's time element so I have a rental car client so data becomes really valuable around I know someone booked an airline ticket within a week like I think there are scenarios you get into that you okay that is actually valuable data and you find the buyer you know if you're a seller of that media inventory or that data then you find the kind of right buyer for that but I don't think it's you know I don't think the answer is everything's not overawed it across interesting interesting so with google open source tensor floor libraries for machine learning how would it affect the industry what do you guys think I have a problem with this that this this it's kind of every two years or every few years someone comes out with a new library or some new technology and everyone's running towards said it started in 1990s with support vector machines and then it moved on to neural networks and then it move on to artificial intelligence and then a lot of machine learning with the distributed computing machine learning training models came in and we are back on machine learning so there's there's like like we've been discussing there's no real standard that we can use to make models and deliver advertisements or targeted advertisements so it's really cute that google released their tensor this tensorflow and I I did check it out and it's open source so we'll see how that goes with how the engineers use it and if it would be successful it's been successful for google but how ah now that they are open source it how successful it would be in for for other people any other comments well i think you know technology such as tensorflow our machine learning and content analytics as they said that they have they been around in a cyclical way and available but very few have been actually able to exploit these things a one great example was yeah i think digital smiths that managed to really focus in on the commercial aspect of content analytics and i think a few years ago they got bought by tebow and they use it for a very very specific purpose of recommendation engines and content personalization so i think here as long as you have a very specific area in mind then you're able to apply that in a clever way then you can be successful otherwise it's just no tool in your toolbox there's no one tool for everything right absolute interesting and again it comes back to standards right I mean where do these standards how do you create these what is the organization that's going to create these standards right so with data technology the science technology changing every three years what new language should a company's select if we're putting together you know TT system and we want to have data science tied with it what do you guys think do you select one or there are plenty of options you could do Python which is again open source it has a lot of libraries that are that many data science companies are using this scikit-learn which is machine learning library then there's standard scientific Python and I on syfy and numpy which is scientific and numerical Python libraries there's stint tensorflow now that google has released it and then a lot of natural language processing work is done in Scala and and and of course you can do to make that real time you have a lot of data you can use distributed computed computing system like Hadoop and if you want it maybe you can want you can have it on your own servers or you can do it on cloud on AWS or any any cloud service so it's completely autonomous like as in what do you want how much do you want to spend on this you can like cherry pick your options which language to use you whether or not to use this tributed computing whether you want it on a real time or not so it's it's really how much budget you have and how much you are willing to spend on this so Andy what do you think I know you have an opinion sir I was gonna meet you Andrew maybe I looked at the f course you learning on answer maybe check that out I am actually doing a course Microsoft course on azor it's on eggs excellent yep so yeah the machine learning has been a definitely been a big area in the on the azure platform over the last year refining using particularly around how they can start using some of those capabilities and tie it into I don't know if you've looked into this is not strictly in the data science realm of it but using some of those same algorithms to create something called Project Oxford which is out there now which starts pulling in things like the ability to to transcribe the the text contextually so based on you know all of the information you're getting making decisions around around the words and what they mean so that you've got more accurate items to search but also some image processing so being able to detect not only whether there are people in the in the shot but also like the sentiment of the people that are in the shot things like that so so being able to sort of pull in and make sort of calculated decisions around that has been it's been pretty interesting to watch how rapidly its evolved because even it was pretty cool like a year ago when I started first playing with some of it and the the more people who use it that they're more refined all of those programs become and the more accurate they all become it's it's all that stuff that you know they kind of made a splash with it like a year ago I guess my age and you know it was really bad when i first started because it was like basically you had a beard it added 15 years due to your age and it's actually gotten much better at that at that uh at those capabilities now and that's really just kind of scratching the surface of what you can do is with some of that but a lot of this stuff you know although it's new to the media it's not new to medical science that's not new the Securities and not my division but Siemens has you know software that helps protect nations we getting that in my division so the technology is there right right so I mean from a infrastructure hardware company i can say that you know we we do have to support all kinds of open source on our platforms so whether that's hadoop are you know any other OpenStack type of technologies we have to make sure that they don't know our platforms without any changes so so we natively support OpenStack API for example to be able to run no SQL or duper those kinds of processing so I remember again way back when I was at an agency when we used to do stuff or besides at nielsen we'd use you know furniture some other things or we'd have you know in-house like when we're looking for talent we bring about 10 people in a room we'd say run some tapes and say what do you think of this news anchor versus this news anchor you know which one do you like better and that's how we hire in a small sample or we'd subscribe to another service go out in the market and do serving a cousin would never be real time you buy it you know by the year or the court or whatever what do you see out there who when guys are coming to to sell you this new technology what what do you see that's different than when I was in the agency business like 400 years ago not a whole lot oh really yeah i mean when you really strip it strip it down i mean i think we'll talk about this up there's there's an incredible amount to measure I think Andy said it like it's it's there's almost too much data so there's always you know there's still sales guests so you know they're gonna pick the best data that they have yeah so you know we don't get to you know terribly terribly often exposed to you know what languages you know we're building these sorts of things then you know I built a copy testing tool and use some Python stuff but it's not machine learning or you know any other sort of thing so we a little bit of exposure to that but you know a lot of this works still done in Excel like it still needs to be able to fit on a keynote slide I still need to be able to get a CMO to understand it in about 45 seconds so be laboring this thing and you know trying to do multiple pivots isn't isn't gonna work for our business like we've still got to get it down to some common metrics and I think that's when we talk about these data platforms it's like definitions I think are the biggest piece in our business because if we have all clear definitions of what actually means when somebody's viewing it think is that one person rooms at two person rooms that somebody went to the bathroom is that it just started to play on facebook is that you know what are those definitions and I think it makes our job easier because we can we can do those like apples to apples comparison then XO I'm interesting so when your clients are coming to you the vice president of marketing the chief marketing officer at you know car company or an airline's how sophisticated are these guys what do they expect I mean their kids have iPads they've got the phones and they're seeing things I mean what what are they asking they're remarkably sophisticated about their business right and so they've hired you know they've hired whether it's consultants or have in-house I you know analysts to do you know really robust segmentations and all these I think they're really really wise to that but I don't think you know they could explain the difference between Hadoop and you know a sure they just wanted a good number look I doobs on it right so that's a space I say yeah I mean I think it's a different level of sophistication it's a different area of focus you know but I think it's everyone's trying to trying to understand what this means and what means to their business and try to get some common definitions new sort of things I think everyone's certainly sophisticated enough at this point to not just chase dated for data state right to really start to kind of peel that back and I think you know digital media's have a lot to do with that terms of you know as plenty of plenty of hucksterism and the things that were sold in early days of digital media that I think have made everyone in the marketing industry just aware of that I need to know the definition on that and the source of that it needs no scale of that those sort of things interesting interesting so what our open platform analytics what do you guys how do you define what that is sorry after you hit 50 things you know review so the ROI how's that been affected by companies using data science trying to monetize your content you're trying to solve the guys like this how do they get a higher rate but what do you guys see out there tell me well you know so I guess from a media perspective content owner perspective you know that there's two areas that you want to improve in terms of the quality of experience of your viewers one is you know how do you optimize your content so that it can be discovered and then the second is how to personalize the content so you combine the discovery with the user behavior and and you do you know targeted content so you could sell more premium content to that person or svod or sell through so you know just as ROI is measured today in terms of ARP you in terms of churn rate amino you are you reducing the amount of churn are you getting more per user I think those a metric still town today in terms of auto I if your analytics process can improve the quality of experience or the quality of service that directly results to introduce chair and I think you've got your investment return Andy I mean you're you're deeply involved with this what do you what do you see it was interesting that you talk about discoverability because I think that's that sort of that and that came up in our last panel Steve that where that's such a big part of this is like getting the not only finding the data but then finding ways to surface to the user is like the big open challenge in digital media now like we all knew how it worked in in television channel or I'm simple right it's like a super easy like quantity and and it's so easy to get lost right now in that fragmentation as we have all the different screens all the different devices all the different apps in those devices so that which is causing all of that data that we're trying to get but but Services Inc surfacing it back we're finding the ways to to apply that back to the end user so that they're getting the things that they want it's like the big challenge of the area right now so what do you see do you think that's more of a recommendation engine Andy or do you think that's learning about that viewer what was it a marketing thing it's definitely I mean recommendation is part of it and then there's it's almost like a you know i wish i wish i had the money to go just do a start-up right now with this because i think there's like a higher got some faces that's right but it's it's sort of part recommendation par curation and and then it's the model right there's that like there's you've got to almost be flexible enough in the way you're presenting it because there are going to be some people that are totally happy to have it as supported you then you've gotta cater to the people who are perfectly happy to pay extra and do away with the ads you know but hulu right now i think is probably doing it extremely low and hopefully that their their new tier of services has proven to be profitable for them but i think it's it's getting positive results anything it's probably helping with their subscriber base to i think it's gonna be almost a combination right yeah where it's not one you have one of the other to balance and i think the balance is constantly and you've got a you got to be flexible enough to sort of meet the needs of that and move because it's gonna it's going to sort of swing back and forth right you're going to go through heavy subscriber periods then that's going to drop off and you've got to be ready to meet with the the advis advertising side of that to compensate for it so it's a balancing it so some agency side just want to get your perspective would you guys rather have a pre-roll of a show or where they'd rather be product placed in that show a little bit off subject but still its marketing dollars right yeah I think it really depends on what you're trying to do and it looks like a generic answer but um certain things are best treated when I need to explain it right I need about 30 seconds to be able to kind of take you on a journey other things are hey I just need to have this brand visible in your life and we're playing a repetition game you're going to buy insurance every five years GEICO's on top of you constantly right so that when you make that decision your top of mine so just where where the brand is at I think in general like all advertisers want to be like you're in more premium places and they're in bigger places so it's also going to depend on the nuance of how your integrated into that show you become you know co star of that show that's really different like the old soap operas right it would be that yeah that manufacture yeah interesting interesting but it's interesting me you're like just there's the talking about our why that is which focused on like discovery and recommendation which is like antithetical to the conversation right because you're saying like well how big big data going to increase ad revenue how's it going increase cost per point the unit price of x which I'm selling advertising but then the ROI comes is like how many more people watching which is just that's that's the classic advertising metric right it is just eyeballs in and of itself I think that's that's the hurl we need to cross pers before we start getting chill we're going to triple the price on the CPM you're going to have to go a long way on the CPM to make up with Delta between you know the cost model of cable and the cost model I don't know the CPM is ever going to really come interesting a huge so you just scales mark more eyeballs or eyeball salted i think is easier certainly than more target so the question is are those eyeballs equal when you see an eyeball yeah that's see an iphone but yeah you know advertising lee see an eyeball on broadcast television see an eyeball and cable or see an eyeball on something like a netflix if they accepted advertising is that equal to you as a buyer of advertising no I mean they're certainly demographic differences in those audiences um there's there is this kind of squishy equation of context right and select these things like late-night like late-night might be really great and it works but like the certain brands were like I'm not going to be in late night TV like it's just it's going to wrote at the premium to swipe rats there's a lot of nuance to those decisions but if the time frame if we can say these are equal timeframe timeframe demographic kind of all the same it's a tough question i want to say yes although i could imagine there be scenarios where you'd say no but i'd say more often yeah its spot like and I think you know we're doing a lot of experiments is where we're doing you know digital video bias against television basright to really say like these like are these actually similar you know if you measure them to saying the exact same weight these sorts of things can you accomplish and I run digital video in one city and I run television another city like what what does that look like and so I think we're trying to move in that direction but beside that numbers out of it which it's tough it's the numbers game right I mean in the mindset of a media buyer yeah that do they see while network television that's more eloquent so I'll willing to pay more as opposed to someone on an iPhone you know it does that come into play it all or is it just a really pure numbers game I think it's a pure numbers game I know I again as much as it's like you know that that's a real person that you know that that's how they consume media that they actually are paying attention to their iphone and I think yeah i think it's i mean that's a shift in this business i think there definitely was like an older predisposition to like oh it's got to feel big you know we got to be on network ratings aren't there on network so sometime you're pulling together a cable by anyway so I think like that was the first thing to go like the stigma of cable right and then now you're saying like we'll get digital video like no did you justice premium as anything else this you know OTT inventory that I'm buying is just as premium as anything else so so yeah that since the eyeball is kind to the eyeball 95% interesting yeah um you know content discovery can actually lead to more eyeballs right there's a couple of success stories out of Europe both orange and the Portuguese as on it's a multi-screen service that they introduce call iris so what they did was they targeted social interaction so your friends would recommend a certain program that they saw and they like and so you would never have seen that program if unless if it was your friend that so I didn't document data to you so as a result of that they were able to get more eyeballs and and actually pretty successful in getting more revenue out of our the same content that they had previously distributed through the cable service right through the multiscreen service they were able to monetize it better interesting interesting that's i remember when i was with ABC back back in the 90s right i took our 5 p.m. news and i streamed it live through see you see me is like a million years ago i think five people saw it and then i got a note for my my GM at the stations stop wasting your time with the internet it's it's a fad so obviously not a bad anymore he's retired with a ton of those days capcity stock so he's a happy got a few minutes left but so what are the various functional components what is the end results of the outputs oh well i think in the end i'd like to put the analytics and do you know three buckets how does it improve the quality of service associated with your co TT offering for example because you know better the service buffering and less of the jitter and those kinds of issues then then of course people are going to stick longer and the quality of course and so the quality of services is key so if analytics improves that I think you've gone a long way quality of experience which I earlier mentioned about content optimization content personalization and then finally it's about content monetization through add analytics so so really that is the end result of anything that you do I mean if you're not able to improve those three pockets than all the data science and data analytics that you've done has not been of much effect like sensei and I think you said also for you to take action on it the hand to your clients you have to have something usable that they can understand measurable yeah Deb measurable and and I think you know as much as possible from a third party right i mean i think so much of our business is transacted off of those third-party numbers and like this is a space where there's not a lot of them so that's stopping the flow of dollars into this space in a really big way well that's a quite I mean if you're getting these numbers from the guy that's playing the video is that less credible from you than a third party that's providing this information I think it's the question of whether I'm going to get that's where I go back into like the question of what I'm going to buy or yeah how I'm gonna measure it so yeah like I can gather data out of any integration that I'm doing inside of a nap and I know that this thing's pinged my server X number of times and so that must mean that X number of people or pings were there right depending on what it is um so so yeah I think you can get that but it's you know no one wants to be the guy that recommends things babe so yeah if the sales guys telling me like we're going to have 1 million videos and that's based on his own data or some cut of a data that I'm not seeing and we get into the thing and it's got a hundred thousand be is still the best performing thing ever but I look like an idiot so you know that's what the third party thing needs to come in it's it's that upfront and opening the door to those conversations that less so like is it measurable in the back I think we're really good i mean this simple we've been using simple regression TV and radio for really long Thompson's and I'm base regression models we don't have to get super fancy to know that something must have happened right we're seeing more sales and so you can attribute that is it perfect no but advertising kind of never was anyways so it's okay but I think it's that opening the door and starting a conversation and be like this is something I should with God because I think media media buyers and then you know just predisposed to look at her like what are the biggest apps what are the biggest things that I am and and maybe missed some opportunities where like I think the podcast face is really interesting right now like what they're doing in advertising like Septon one advertiser getting really that advertisers are really integrating in a show and I'm like the advertisers I see doing podcasts are really loving it but it feels undiscovered and it's another space we're like there's not really good metrics like you got pop track kind of trying to figure that out so like need a little maybe a pod track in this space or Nielsen is maybe going to be involved in this or not but maybe it's good like maybe they should do that maybe I think interesting Andy oh yeah I totally agree about the on the podcasting side like it's sort of this like like Greenfield space that you know it like it did exist it was radio basically the event and that but now it's not but it it is where there's like some really interesting experiments in the way in the advertising model that's going on and it would be great to sort of see that make a jump back into a more traditional video yeah ott cool enough just quickly summarizing all three quick points that any ott service needs to do as one get consumers make users sign up for your service retain them that that's completely subjective that because because it depends on the quality of content that you stream and then if you want to go down that road advertisements and for all these three things data science can help so hire more engineers are more data scientists we're good at what we do especially from USC right yeah yeah so we've got about five minutes left I'm going to open it up to questions and I'm going to repeat the question so we can record it yes sir so let me repeat that guys so the question is if you were to mentor someone getting into the data analysis space with big data you're to advise them what would that advice be you want to start it down the line Jay I'm sure so I think data analytics our data science has got a lot of promise but the very first step is you want to make sure that the data that you get is clean that it's been called and that you're not dealing with noise or spurious information so so that's very important just to get started and then there's there's a lot of ways in which steps in between to go from collecting the data to actual monetization so I would suggest you know have the angle in mind first before you start to process your data make sense beware of spurious correlation I remember like in her early early days of Facebook that came out of sight he was starbucks and it was about the people like starbucks on facebook buy more coffee at starbucks and it was kind of presented as a thing of like that was a result of them liking starbucks on facebook when in reality it was like completely the other way around so it was like people who buy a lot of starbucks also take the time to like starbucks on facebook so just be really cautious i think when you're talking to if you especially if you're selling media like well what kind of conclusions are drawn from the data you're looking interesting and II definitely start with an assumption and then be ready to be wrong like it like no don't don't let the data pile up don't keep shaping the data to prove that you're right like fine have an assumption start to start looking into it and then if you're if you're wrong be ready to make a change people behave strangely yeah right exactly enough I completely agree with the end either I read this somewhere that the best time to apply machine learning to your product was five years ago all right now so it's really an experimental field and there are a lot of things that can go wrong and do go wrong so yeah but we gotta keep trying make sense any questions from the audience okay let me summarize again I feel like a translator here up so again we've got tons of information about what people like and what they may buy so how far away are we actually sending relevant important as to someone and not repeating it I'm going to say when I was at the station placing our own promotional ads I annoyed the hell out of folks because I would repeat our promise or five and 10pm lose intentionally got higher ratings but um right from a manufacturer part of you i can say that content analytics have come a long way so you can actually get very very good detailed semantic descriptions of Colossians and and the content so now the question is you know how do you apply ad placement technology to wood to the metadata that's been collected about the content so I think that's up to folks like you to figure it out and see if that's going to be appropriate it's gonna be backlash in the consumers yeah all right it's just an economic question of how much is the waist worse were not worse like a value of that waste right I don't envision a utopia where I think everyone's gonna love every at us because even an ad that's perfectly target it could just be a really shitty app so it's still gonna annoy people so like it's less of a problem I think we're trying to solve you know so machine learning won't fix the shitty add ya know it actually makes him worse right each of them how to be more right right yeah I think the I think just even as a viewer of OTT stuff the like lack of variety of ads becomes the like the harbinger of like like that's the part I'm also waiting on is like me we just need people spending more money in the space so that there's a wider variety of them because I can't see the same Travelocity add six more times yeah enough yep speaking from mathematical point of view there are a lot of things there are hundreds and thousands of models that you can train and apply so that you could use logistic regressions you could use maybe clustering which is maybe less compute exhaustive but it really depends on how good how much data that you have even like 10,000 samples might not be good enough to deliver d perfect content or d perfect advertisement it might repeat or it may not repeat so it really depends on how good your model is and how much data you have to deliver we're a perfect advertisement great guys we're a minute over so I want to thank you very much for coming out our panel is gonna be out in the hallway to answer any of your questions and thank you so much folks for coming out think we had a great diversified panel so again thank a harp and do thank you very much
