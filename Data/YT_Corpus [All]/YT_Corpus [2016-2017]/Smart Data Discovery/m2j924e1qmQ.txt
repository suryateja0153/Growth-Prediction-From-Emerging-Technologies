 hey guys we're going to begin in about two minutes so good afternoon good morning my name is John Park I am the director of sales engineering for smart insights thank you for joining the webinar today and we're going to definitely talk about exploring data without ETL so before we begin I want to thank you guys as well as just want to talk about a little bit about what mutant is so full mutant is our product that will bring out the market and what museum stands for is infinity so our value of value problem mutants you will see is one of them is really able to integrate infinite amount of sources and be able to connect explore and discover your data the way you want to small in size is the company that museum was caught produced out of and we are a company based really out of Japan and we been working with automotives for the last 10 years and what this company does is is really understand how to help help customers really develop solutions around recalls and manufacturing problems what we did in Japan about 10 years ago is started working with automotives to figure out how to handle complex bill of material issues its many too many issues that are happening about how what parts are causing recalls or what parts are having manufacturing issues and how quality is affecting sales we have a deep experience in that field and in the last two years we've been growing out of that field to you know consumer goods like cannon as well as finance and gaming companies like Bondi napco so to start this webinar off I just wanted to kind of frame what this webinar is going to be about we want to talk about you know challenges in data discovery the biggest challenges as we see from smart insights is is that there's so many variety of sources there's unstructured semi-structured structure and what we're used to is having everything structure being in spreadsheets or being in reporters and then because of the emergence of the big data or emergence of beta explosion we're seeing the typical unstructured and semi-structured sources coming into play and we're trying to figure out get insights from it that's one of the challenges we saw the second challenge we saw when we develop museum was the emergence of the data silos silos and cloud think in the past 10 years starting with salesforce com to work day to netsuite a lot of our customers are moving from their internal systems use systems and cloud and these are given us challenges we're trying to get a 360 view of the customer or a process or getting these reports right and the you know the other challenges it's getting very expensive expensive to do these ETL processes meaning you need a lot of servers you need a lot of work horsepower to get this done and you need to find a right type of labor is very labor-intensive how we address those challenges is really what this webinar is going to talk about and how we from mutant standpoint the challenges of data discovery really stems with us with traditional reporting only looking at structure and not having the Smart Search able to search through where each data set is not having a catalog or really a deep profiling a way of looking at data as well as automation and etl so with the drawing I'm trying to illustrate for you is this is that you know I'm with you we look at the you know ETL process in this whole data discovery export data exploratory field as the slow-moving snail that slows down everything and causes you know you to spend a lot of time doing this so why why are you why do we develop mutant why are you know why are we doing this is we believe the data agility you know the volume the variety the ferocity that people talk about that big data is getting solved but really we believe the data agility is what makes us different and the agility actually is the competitive edge it's not really everybody is able to score a lot of data process a lot of data they have machines the algorithms that are able to do that but how fast can when new sets of data new data comes in how fast can you extract insights and values out of there with this music we have this whole concept big data ops which is you know becoming mainstream and we used to call it something else but it's really i think data ops fits right and is that we want to we have to create a solution that reduces no hours you spend on etl or you know data integration hours you spent on data quality large you spend on data engineering and have that continuous integration so when a user says hey we we have a new program we're going to use a SAS service and we want to integrate that in there it becomes easier for the users to get that data or greater take a look and try to match those data together what we try to create what would museum is this whole platform that has a lot of automation and a lot of integration built in to help users move on how do we what's our value proposition what is what are we what are we trying to you know why you know what are we trying to tell to our users or tell to customer where's the prospects like you is that what the problems are solving really is is overcoming these data silos what we mean data silos we're not meeting just internal data and we're not just needing structured data like Excel and databases we're also meaning us unstructured data like your solar where data is coming in as well as cloud sources as well as semi-structured do what our technology is really based on is this whole notion of using a graph database or we call it the enterprise data graph to autonomously create connections between different sets the data different unique values and different entities to enable smart search as well as enabled you know autonomous correlation the the algorithm we I continues reference it's called a ton of correlation algorithm that will be built in with music music platform will actually build a graph database and look at entities and figure out how these entities are related to each other and if they're going to be a good if there is a good way to look from one source system to another source system and look at this whole whole flow things the last two things I think is very important the premise of being able to search I think search is the way to look at data away to wait for everything to be started regardless is analytics regardless ists you know searching the web certain documents I think searches the fundamentals of all all this so what we built with mutant and the enterprise data graph for the EDG is this search mechanism to be able to search data sis the last thing is we are a enterprise platform that allows you to look at the analytics and only you know surface the data that's relevant to you not everybody else and it is you know it ensures integrity and we have the government's platform on so next time we i'm going to go is how do we eliminate those silos right we eliminate the silos by actually building you know an enterprise data graphs and running to algal heuristics index algorithm and a autonomous correlation algorithm what they allow us to do is is to really look at sources as they come in and connect the sources to connect the dots right what you see on the graph is what you see on the screen is our screenshot of attack enterprise data graph which shows you how each store system whether you know you see the solar and a National Highway Traffic Safety Association complaints database connected to the recalls database via these columns and this is how we how we look at this is that with a graph rather than creating a global schema you're able to and would algorithm like we have with contents correlation algorithm that are you're able to connect the dots you're able to see how things are connected together so without building a single large global scheme I'm moving all the data into 1 pieces user is able to create a craft database behind the scenes and give you this few so how do you make the ETL problems go away so a lot of people are you know saying etl is you know necessary evil and something that we have to do is but what me does is that we only leave the data as on the source we're could we continue great however what we need to do is build that enterprise data graph layer which sometimes people call the metadata index or the search index of our technology and once that's created you are coring data at a source the enterprise data graph EDG only has that unique entities we query the sources and we cash the results for analytics be done as you see on the diagram it is all API driven and we have our own dashboards as well as we work with third-party tools to query the sources and get answers out we do have a patented technology called beta change what when you build the graph the beauty of our building of grasses it allows you to use that graph to figure out how one data set is related to another and that's the whole premise is behind the data chain and we are able to move from one source to another source seamlessly and be able to query different data sources easily and this is the I think this is a paradigm difference this is what we have to defer so you don't have to do as much ETL to make a global schema so why is search important search is important because it allows you to you know search across and figure out without know we have pre knowledge or training where your data is is to figure out where where you know get the relevant information would mutant you know having the enterprise data graph allows us to create a search interface just like Google or Amazon it gives you gives you relevant results and where those results are you see on the screen is what we're when we search for a keyword or just any any search right search freight is it looks at the whole and your whole enterprise data says this is where that keyword is and these are places that it occurs in and when you actually do a search on one of those data sources and what the keyword is it actually gives you the recommended dashboards and this is a a different way business users will interact and really you're not by searching you're actually reducing that ETL because you don't you you don't your data doesn't have to set a pacific format and it doesn't have to conform to a you know to a certain level of detail so searching really helps musin mutant uncovered insights easier than on any other tools on the market right now we're going to call them a couple of customer case use cases how you know they're using museum without ETL to really solve their solve their problems honda are in our customer really they came to us where because they want to do sensor or electronic computer unit out of a car whenever you go into a dealership you they actually download your driving record or your sensor readings and they actually select you know store data and the dealership they have all this data and how do they were asking themselves how do we really correlate that date how do we actually look at that data and what they did with mutant is is that you know these are terabytes and terabytes of data that are getting loaded in every time a car comes comes into a dealership and what they're doing is they're collecting it and storing it in a repository and allowing music to look at the kiva key values and you know the semi-structured terms of what the sensor logs are telling you and they're able to do analysis easily what the customer said was they were doing a lot you know three to seven days of ETL and tuning on the database to get the same result that it was taking music probably three clicks in 15 plus seconds so what we allow you to do is push down the workload take the analytics to the data as well as give you the flexibility to work with systems that are using semi-structured data like here our second use case is about would miss Vichy electric so miss we select Reagan is a you know a part of Miss B she that navigation and infotainment system and their use case really came to us because we you know the speaks to us because they were dealing with geospatial and usage data this is data that is collected on the actions you do on the navigation and infotainment system throughout the day when you're driving your car would you do when you drive inside the city how do you interface with your navigation system how do you interface with your entertainment or an infotainment system you know when do you turn radio up when you're going to city do you turn you look for a restaurant you look for gas stations so those type of products are what you know what miss Vesey electric wanted to develop right to kind of anticipate the user movement but when the data came in it was geospatial semi-structured data that was very you know it was not very structure uniform like traditional reporting and they couldn't work with traditional reporting platforms so what usion was able to do with this api's was pull that data together and give us you know and analytics on what's happening and what's happening real time because the navigation infotainment system certain certain ones for streaming data as you were going through so what do we what does this platform do right you know without really doing going to is this platform is a platform that has a graph database that does is autonomous correlation and and indexing and on top of that we placed a algorithm for smart data chains and a interface for search and one of the things I think the value we like to talk about we talk by detail is there's detail you do need to do EPL because to clean up and orale sources is hard but with our autonomous correlation algorithms you know we too have interfaces to anything like solar structures like teradata or or your relational databases such as Oracle and sequel server you are able to connect all those up create a create a enterprise data graph and actually access all that data this is really about you know connect thing the dots taking yours of legacy data and then putting it together and connect the dots so you could actually start doing and that analytics without move moving into a single location what what are we really you know what is mutants use cases and what do we do for our customers currently with our technology we're good in these five use cases the data warehouse augmentation use case is very very popular right we do have a data where else but you are starting to go into like claw out SAS type of sources such as salesforce.com and you want to bring that in and see that salesforce com data as well as your data warehouse would musin you don't have to download all the data from salesforce com into your data warehouse you connect your you have a multiple connection a connection to your day it'll wear as a connection to your salesforce com actually using muses abilities to merge or fuse data you could actually look at those two data sets together without actually physically creating a global scheme and moving that together and that's been very popular with our users and customer prospects iot r machine sensor data before it was really called IOT we started doing sensor data working with honda and the structure the of the data which usually comes in semi structure and usually it has you know the quality issues and it's just a lot of volume n and the way it needs to be queried is not a traditional you know ODBC JDBC really you know have us having that API capability the Machine IOT data husband has been great for us we've really been able to accelerate in size do for customers like Honda and Mississippi huge saw bringing that data and shown in size quickly the big data discovery analytics is is that we the amusing as a hub of connecting up to infinite number of sources and doing your analytics and connecting up and getting graphs and analytics out without really having to build with data lake or a data warehouse right and that use case has been popular because number of posite or ease or data sources in the enterprises or any company has been growing exponentially past the cost 360 view of the customer and 360 view of the products or programs we have to help customers develop new products faster faster and improved products as well as understand behavior of the customers and this really stems down from our paradigm of search right if you put all your parts database and then your claim your warranty and your claims and complaints database you could actually look at saying what are you know what what are the top issues of warranty what are because it all goes down to a graph database is searchable as far as the customer is you know what cost how are the customers actually using the product when they bring in for repair or when they bring it in to when they do their surveys what are they saying because one of the key differentiators we work so well with on structure semi-structured sources you can stitch the instructor with the structure source and get insights a lot faster than other tools in the market so this is architecture before we go into them with the architecture really shows shows us how really our works behind the scenes behind the scenes we are a we are a platform that has this really fundamentals of it's based on the enterprise data graph as you see in the screen and the data graph baha underneath the data graph we have a virtualization layer called the unified data access layer which allows you to connect any source we as long as it has either you know for a structure source we usually go through a JDBC for unstructured source we have our semi structured roads source we go to arrest enter page interface so we've been able to connect to your traditional sources as access such as Oracle or db2 but we've also been able to connect to s3 Salesforce and big data sources because we're so we work with these standards and we're so flex flow in here and on top of that once you build the data graph you have you're able to do we have a search interface that you're able to search a start graph for all type of answers just when you do Google or Amazon they give you relevant information we also have data chain that are that allows you to move from one source to another source using the linkages free mutant it's really important for immunity to know how data is linked from one source to another and the data chain algorithm or mechanism allows you to do that then on top of that we have your dashboards your API is you can use any type of tools or any type of graphics to you know take advantage of the data graph so i think i spent about 20 minutes going through the deck and that's really good the demo we're going to really look at is we have a demo on on a ton automotive data and inside there the demo we have we've loaded datasets for NHTSA which is National Highway Traffic Safety Association KBB which I kelly blue book I believe a lot of people that are you know calling in from the states understand edmonds and investigations database complaints and weak all the systems that are behind this or really the we have traditional systems like Oracle my sequel sequel server but we also have unstructured sports systems that are coming up like solar and elasticsearch we do have you know AWS services and all these are running inside AWS and I like to remind you that any time we create a data source we're actually pushing down this is real life queries and we do have a single smart insight server and the AWS cloud and that's how a month in the demo I want to kind of go through how easy is it is to explore your data without etl how easy is it is to create a created connection how easy it is to look at that connection on a data graph and look for like a root cause analysis and how easy it is to do analytics on top of dat o'clock rack so without any further you know do I am going to go over to my demo screen so mutant when you start using you're definitely going to go into a web interface and this is just a browser and side there you will see you will see that it is an html5 and when once you install using mutagen you just got to use your name and you login once you login you go into your last place your lash blast ash borer so we're going to take the persona of a data stewards or IT manager and you i want to show you how easy it is to add a new data source so i'm going to go to data studios and in this screen in this screen you're going to see that we have one for our demos we have about 15 you have 15 sources as you see what mutant does is it uses either rest endpoint or a KD vc connection string with a driver to access the metadata and unquote do how easy is to connect a new data source is easy because we're not creating a global schema where we're based on we're based on a date enterprise data graph all you have to do is click new and you pick the type of source system you want so for this i just want to use a rest and you copy since we have all the drivers pre-install copy your jdbc connection there and then you put your password for mischief and you hit create so what we do at this sorry there we go so what we do at that point is is that we actually go and scour all the metadata a direction and then you get to use either a table or a customer custom query to define the data sets you want to bring into the enterprise and state graph so what happens is is that let's say we you know we want to pick you know I'm going to go pick kbv new vehicles and I'm just going to type in test what happens at this point is is that it looks at the metadata and we create this enterprise data graph by looking at all the fields that are text or bartsch are less than 255 and we bring it in and we create entities out there and you after the entities are created and yeah it's tagged with what source to come from and it would met definitely metadata what column it is from we actually eat the unique entities are created and inside our enterprise data graphing that we actually run autonomously shin that's just the association between these you know kb make and model and what other columns are very similar or not right so that gives you the ability to that i am going to not save this because i've already done one for you and actually ran it because if you run the creation and the EDG will take up autonomous correlation will take about five minutes I don't want to so if we go to the one that's already be done and kelly blue book what you see is you see the same thing here and what you see when we actually go into our text field is is that you want to model or make it tells you right it tell well after we run the autonomous correlation it tells you in a this supplier is a my sequel database there is a field called make and it's very highly similar because the unique values that are coming out or very similar as well as when you look at sequel server and this bomb databases sequel server there is a field called model in some medium so music actually figures in southward this is why you know it actually is doing what data steward or etl developer will do looking at columns profiling see if things can be joined to get it if it's high but if the similarity ha is high the system knows that it can join or go cross over to another sources of looking at high similarity I want to show you uh actually enterprise data graph for kelley blue book throwing on so in kelley blue book you see we talked about recalls right or sale recalls a sale so we actually look at here this is a graphic of how our data graph for a enterprise graph database is showing its shown in a tree format because this is the best way to so you start a kelley blue book and you click on recalls and you when you click on the oh I'm sorry all right there you are when you click on the relationships that it tells you right since kbv model and recall all their high is going to look at high and you could also go in there seven manual relationships but this is a way what the enterprise data graph gives you it gives you the ability to look at all these sources how it is discover these relationships automatically and this is using these relationships as how analytics are created and so we bring and you saw the manual we we bring that analytics without doing a lot of et al I want to show you kind of a root cause analysis using this so if we start at at the let's say we'll start at parse database and will click enterprise data graph when the part database you can go and say okay what are the complaints that are coming in for part and it tells me to go from go from parts to complaints when you can use these fields and you know ear and make are the most and then if we wanted to go traversed investigation and then we if we wanted to go to verse to recall and and if we wanted to traverse to suppliers doing this analysis if we clicked on every single link you'll show you how we move from one source another this kind of is the way you will do your root cause analysis would take your parts you would look at the complaints from the part and you look at the investigations and you look at which words became we called and you see which suppliers or the ones ones that are causing the recall so the enterprise they give graph you know gives you the power to do root cause type analysis easily and when you actually in in typical sense you would actually create dashboards on parts and then bring in complaints bring any investigations recall suppliers etc and this was kind of give you is a value that we were able to do for our customers another mutant capability that you know really reduce the EPL is because this whole capability of search since we bring the data as this from the sources and run algorithms create enterprise data graph what you actually get is this interface to just search for anything so and I like to search for air because I'm really interested in what's going on with the air bags and when you search for error you see the key value air bags as well as other key key words come out just like google it actually gives you everything that has air in it like lifetime air a limited warranty cold air intake and then air bags is on top because your air bags a word most relevant and appear to most and all of our data sets so just like Google you get the most relevant you know websites or this take to get the most relevant keywords with air bags because air bags of period and complaints component description investigations parts and recalls for example if you wanted if I want to see complaints about air bags I would click on complaints here and it would automatically scoured a what dashboard we're using complaints database and the component description field in this case we went to manufacturers overview you see a trend and this actually did manufacturers overview I believe is a come from complaints database and complaints databases my sequel and I believe it actually did a live query and you can see the trend of what's going on with airbags airbags have issues have been slowly but rising in the industry and you know there was some problems in general motors and they handled in 2014 2015 they'll also did hit a Chrysler is having some issues now when you actually click on the data table you could actually see the data user is looking at the this is the component description that looked at four airbags and these are the data and we are actually you know life cording the database to get this data so this kind of helps your analysts really look at the data as well as look at the trench right and in this manner everything is is live right let's say we just were interested in toyota airbag issues and if we click on to it shows you in a nice way how blue is working right how our baggage fees are slowly but surely arising to it as well the other aspect of mutant is kind of interesting is this whole aspect of data chain how data chain works is that you're able to go from one source system to another solar system when you click on the data chain it actually a lot of these dashboards or pages are based on single sources and we actually go into voice of customer we actually the data tell you what it did is the sense voice of customer is based on Edmonds Edmonds database and it Edmunds database we ought to look at everything about Twitter uniques look at the field called make and still Toyota this way and this all comes from the intelligence of building a enterprise data graph and once you do that it actually brings in that data allows you to see and this is kind of interesting is because it allows you see not only sales but complaints and then complaint as complaint numbers go up sales are going down so complaints are leading indicator to what's that happens sale on there in verse and related is shown here if we go into data chain again and if we go into quality overview it takes the value Toyota and we actually it actually converted it to Toyota at golf Toyota this is a beauty of having a enterprise data graph because it knows similar values golf through intuitive probably mean the same thing and then the recall one of the fusion aspect region is in a single dashboard like this you could actually load bunch of different sources on tear this one came from Oracle this one came from elasticsearch this one came from my sequel these came from multiple databases as you see recalls and sales these came from complaints and sales and then on the bottom you these vary from other as well now we could take this analysis as a farter and say okay i want to i know that we have some hood and toyota camry cruel and sienna and ref for pre insert the most i'm really interested in camry and corolla i want to know what going to different database and i want to know what voices the customers are so once we know there's most complaints in california and then there's texas the flora and but interesting thing is is that camry became family hybrid camry solara as well as can be and corolla this is data chain in its best right being able to identify what users are talking about I have moved from one source of data to another source of data easily without you know really really uh making the users through etl because in the typical sense you would have the etl camry hybrid camry solara Kandra meaning camera or your numbers would not come out correctly finally I what I do want to get get back into the data studios aspect and show you that it how they how we went from voice of customers to recalls right so if we started at at recall and go here and if we go into complaints wait goes from recalls and complaints it's actually looking at columns these columns and it's going to pick the ones that since we use component description this is what it used to join the post and when we go further down go to in either investigations it's going to look at probably a component name or a model in this way when we went to camry so what mutant does is looks at it looks at the columns and it looks at how the linkages are occurring it allows you to go from one source to another source the eat don't there's really the only aspect that you you know why we say we grew reducing Achilles we do not transform are really low oh dat ax to single source all all these queries are live and we are actually moving data back and forth from ours are amusing platform to the systems underlying systems and the search capability allows you to do any type of search that allows you to search for route you're in sometimes easily I think I kind of flipped through it it is about 40 minutes past an hour if you do have questions please put up raise your hand and put questions on the chat window as well as let us know and go back to our final hold on slide so the whole you know premises museum is connecting without doing etl and leaving data as it is so basically connect your data explore and discover your insights thank you for your time this afternoon and trying to open it up to my change is to open it up to questions I think there is a question here hold on go into a break to get back and help me navigate the questions here you there how do you detect how do you detect relationship between sources so how do you detect relationship sources is way detect the relationship is by looking at the unique values that are inside sources so we take the unique values and you create an enterprise data graph and the autonomous correlation algorithm will will search through all the unique values and looking at looking at what the entity name is what the natural value of natural language search says and fuzzy matching says is that is it related if it is related it puts those sources together and say they probably mean the same thing is this manual data modeling yeah the data modeling creating what data you want to bring into the enterprise data brasses is the data you want to bring into the museum platform is manual but however the autonomous correlation is automatic anything else all right thank you guys so much for your time and if you do have questions please feel free to you know ask for a demo and then questions are away and we'll be able to answer them a spurred on timely manner thank you guys so much
