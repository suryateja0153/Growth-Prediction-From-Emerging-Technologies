 Support PCIe GEN3 !! NVMe-IP enables FPGA system to directly connect NVMe SSD without CPU support. Ultimate high speed storage application is now on your hand! Environment & Connection of the demo on Arria 10 SX SoC Samsung SSD 950 Pro for this demo Start Quatus Prime Programming tool Choose evaluation file downloaded from DG web site then program to FPGA device. Start NIOS2 Terminal on NIOS2 Command Shell. nios2-terminal PCIe Gen3 SSD detected and Test Menu is displayed on the console. [0]:Identify Device Shows SSD model and capacity. [1]: Write SSD input start sector address and the number of sector size. Select data pattern. writing... Transferred data size, Execution time and speed are shown. Write = 1538 MB/s !! [2]: Read SSD input start sector address and the number of sector size. Select same data pattern with writing. reading... Transferred data size, Execution time and speed are shown. Read = 2273 MB/sec !!!! By NVMe-IP ultra high-speed IP core with M.2 SSD, you can develop Ultra high-speed & Micro recording system!!
