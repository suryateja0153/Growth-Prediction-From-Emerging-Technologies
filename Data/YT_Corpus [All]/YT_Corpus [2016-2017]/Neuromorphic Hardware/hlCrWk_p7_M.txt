most the time he spends time at as an associate professor in the department in the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue and today he will share with us his passion for cameras everywhere okay thank you very much think about giving me the chance to come here and talk hii was here before I was the room next next door um last year when I was a speaker in the East science in called workshop last year and that was me in a widow I remember another room similar to this and I was captured video was very nice hey that high I told some people i went back and Here I am today I want to share with you some of the progress were made in the last one half years i also want to discuss some ideas it's always good to hear people from different views and we actually building assistant a lot of people to use so you are welcome to be users and also collaborators as you jury and I already discuss some ideas freeze feel free to interrupt if you want to say anything so I I started project almost four years ago when I think about we travel how many of you are called members of any airline or have a big has being a gold member looks like Microsoft doesn't send you to lose weight okay oh that's much better okay okay so so as we go to conferences sometimes I feel that okay it's great to go to different places and then their culture the people and so on but sometimes we encounter problems that is lost baggage delay flight canceled flight over call the trains and so on right so I asked a question can I see the word in my desk without going anywhere of course I don't get the experience of the food the people but if I just want to take a look of the famous architecture maybe that's good enough so that's what was the motivation of the project now I know some of you asked the question does this trivial solve the problem let me give you a story of myself I took sabbatical in Singapore and then after that I went to Singapore again tries for conference and as you something you have been dismayed have been to Singapore know Singapore's very expensive phrase and you can easily spend a few hundred dollars for decent hotel so I was looking for hotel and then find a hotel that looks reasonably nice is a four-star hotel at last a street view so I saw what a good deal so I pulled out hotel but when I arrived the taxi driver couldn't even find a hotel because the road was closed for mrt construction if you come from united state to singapore you know you always land between 1150 p.m. to 1am right because the time difference so it was very late and i find how to find a hotel finally find it and the next day I try to catch your TV sleep the construction started saving a game so I was thinking okay that doesn't seem a very good PCG right I look at the previous example and I made a decision based on this information but the reality is the information was obsolete so this is a picture I took just a few days ago you probably recognize this intersection right it should be just outside here and he tells you it was captured more than a year ago this is my example it's outside my office at the Purdue University is this is the northwestern university and I mean north western avenue and there is a building there for three years the construction started 2013 the building has been rolling and tells us the image was captured six years ago so the problem here is absolutely the data may make us make wrong decisions so suppose I tell my friend I said okay so if you see the parking garage and then my buildings next to a parking garage then my friend would say well I look at the tree view the garage does exist I mean a building doesn't exist I see the garage but building does exist because it's obsolete data so as a researcher I ask the following question is there a problem the problem is absolutely data makers may run decisions so I want to have real kind data and i see i see they are opportunities for research so the question is me the me me to use a video clips as many of them as continuous video online how can we do with the data and what does the thought difference that's real time data versus absolutely i make i already gave you a few examples of after the dlr can cause problems yes please fine how often I Street view images updated if you don't oh so the question is how often is a stream data updated dependent sources of some of places that's just California plus the highway data is streaming video I didn't calculate a friend Ray but many frames per second but i will show you a few examples of the data in new york city that's about one frame per second and for colorado i'm talking about traffic camera right now for Colorado's about was every two minutes so it varies real thing that you shave you ok so you how about trivial sorry I misunderstood coaching are actually different companies have different the update rates some company this is from google they actually have a map showing you how how old the data is West laughs I is not very big city so i guess it's ugly very rarely hdd's was updated Eddie's was because when I started the project that they have was evil before 2009 but then for some reason they updated 2009 some bigger cities are updating more often but I don't have a very precise definition how over the update designs real question ok so that then so we started the idea of a using network camera the idea is following there are many network cameras studied by a company called market market account the estimated about 20 million neighbor camera installed per year and about twenty percent rate increase each year this day never came rod constraint they had 24 hours and we handle in my father we deal with only public data meaning there's no password for obviously legal reasons we don't want to deal with anything about private data and this may reveal a lot of information about the world you can also think about mobile data such as from phone or dash cane and if you lay out connected to a network we can also call them as network camera today you can buy a dash camera with Wi-Fi capability for about four hundred dollars now let me show you a few examples of a hot network camera can show you yes why is real time who's that doing the analysis Oh what sort of analysis our crew is doing addresses but we also make our system available to other people to the nurses so what kind of this is for example you can count people you can count cars you can detect things means the customer of your of your now she said yes so they have to write their own code or something to do these things yes we give you some samples and then you will modify the simple programs to do what you want to do let me show you a few examples of some of the network data this is a captured as you can see it was about one half months ago October seven if you search pinner Kane that you'll find one of the examples here this is the National Zoo in Washington DC and they have fought pinner cameras I don't know who is doing a tracking I don't know it's by computer or a person but then you enter another room you can actually see the Panda so if you imagine that you can do a study of animal behavior without going to zoo that opens up a new paradigm of doing research so you don't know who is doing the tracking I do not know who the linotype but something is happening there that when he moves to a different room the can make a switch is to that moving the cameras no content in egos for different room I think also if I wrote it also changed right I don't know its high back computers or somebody's control it but you can see it if you have a computer right now to a search panda cane national zoo you'll be able to see it so this is an example let me show you another example this example has a lower refresh rate so you see people kind of jumping but you can use this example to study this issue for Romania you can see from the the URL or you can use these to study human behavior actually I'm working with several professors in psychology they want to observe human behavior now intrusively and also cross different culture environment you can imagine you can sit here in United States and observe people behavior in Romania for example a calm as groups when do they come how many at a particular time do they bring their children and can you tell their age group that has significant impact on how design your marketing strategy because maybe in the morning the age group will be different from in the in the evening we actually have talked to a few people in neo Purdue some store owners they say they do see the change of demographics and they want to use that information to improve their marketing strategy this is not exempt I as I mentioned earlier I want to see the world this is Yellowstone if you have been Yellowstone how many of you know who this is first you know the name of that this is the main game at extreme that's old faithful that's all faithful yes this was captured during in October now it may be covered by snow but hosu when there I mean watched and remotely are in February and I see it is however eyes know I still see people sitting there waiting for all facebook I was pretty impressed where as you can see there as these are all kinds of examples where you can potentially use the data without going there let me talk to about the psychology study again um so several professors want to use the data to do a worldwide study the hypothesis is people in different cultures behave differently you can do this study without sending graduate students who 10 different countries of course they want to go but we don't have the funding oh please out Washington State these are captured a few days ago as you can see on oven 28 if you want to see whether particular highways is congested or see well there's a long line there just this morning of Professor send me an email I haven't read the detail yet been a few days ago announced they have 30,000 traffic camera Alabama now as I already mentioned some of it so as you can see this is the example of the same shopping mall a different time you can look at the time it's a bit small but you can look at a time and study maybe how the customers may change this is a volcano eruption in Hawaii it was captured by the National Park camera let me show you did here it's at a 15-minute interval yes this was captured on the right 24th january twenty 4 2014 so you see the volcano eruption of course that that's a very active volcano so it happens very often but nobody was there to roll recording you can still watch that so I think I give you enough examples about those events and also last year we did a study this use the camera in New York City the left side of the figure shows the parade route it's a giving parade and right side shows the location of a traffic camera and we captured the parade II on that day by selecting specific cameras I would a crane using network camera you first you can see the parade without going there second it's even better than you go there because first if you've been to an infrared like this either you need to go very early or the only thing you see is somebody's head if yours is taller an even if i tall enough are you step then there you can only see one place right you cannot physically in multiple places at the same time but here we have 40 vetting goes of seeing a parade they are actually quite a few cameras all around so you can see that i hope that give you enough ideas about the possibility of using our cameras to do all kinds of things this is a traffic quality in Washington DC I was in AC a multimedia in a Australia a few weeks ago and I noticed their taxes also have camera on the side I'm not sure what's the purpose but I noticed that and this is another study by research fellow in australian national university they have a camera look in the forest see how the trees change and it's I using a solid solar power and he's happy to share the data so now you can imagine you can do a study of a forest without going to Australia I'm going to skip that we are not the first project with is actually some people in san luis have been doing this for quite a few years but there are quite a few differences first they give you data second that it has very real friend rate over almost 10 years since 2006 to now like it a hundred thousand eight hundred million images and your fields that i will tell you we can get 800 million images in a day because of rain rate so that's the father can give you so now let me explain introduce the project we are working on it's called came to continuous and SS many cameras yes if how do you how do you get the list of the cameras or publicly available research online so the question is how do we find the camera uh we do a web search with ok we wasted are several different types of strategies the first without project started by scanning the IP address a producer / do network with a permission will produce network security oh they say okay we know how do we go ahead do it so we find like a few dozen cameras that way how do we find basic different printer camera have a specific signature so we send a query if your camera respond in particular format with another camera so we started by doing the then we also skin a few universities IP address we find a few hundred cameras that way why University complained they notice that we are skimming their IP address but that was too slow and the tool basically too slow because the those chase vs is very low then we start working on traffic cameras why do we use traffic cameras because you go to a state you figure out how how does that they have format you get a few hundred or few thousand a ones so that's another strategy then a third strategy is we actually have agreement with a few companies they have the data online and then we get a permission to get data so these are 30 frames per second camera versus you know once okay so question is what's the ratio of a high frame rate was low frame rate uh we actually don't have a process number i would say maybe five to ten percent give us 30 frames per second and i will show show you later slide that depends on where you are talking about if you have a camera in united states you try to get data from using a machine united states you may get 30 frame per second if you have a camera exactly the same camera in Europe you try to get a date how you knew it use a machine us you don't get a 30 frame per second I wish y'all at you in a few slides later designs real question okay so majority cameras we have our updated of what every civil seconds to was every several minutes and we don't have control over that so these are project you're welcome to register as a user when I receive a great for National Science Foundation July the problem is you're really pushing me hard I won't give you a number but he gave me a number how many uses we we want to target before the the green ends so i hope everybody sides out so we can get that number up okay so go to our website and sara is a user our system is not an archive of data in fact we don't retrieve data regularly we retrieve data only how you ask us to do to retrieve data our system is a computing platform for doing in image analysis in a large scale why is a large I show you example here we use a 17 amazon instances we also use microsoft azure but these pretty case we use amazon over 24 hours we grab one image every five seconds from 16,000 kmart worldwide and we get about seven here by the data we are working on getting one feeding images over 24 hours we encounter some limitation of above our poor word because we need to spend more than one's own in Amazon but we are we think we will get there were sweet we are able to grab 400 million images and do some relatively simple analysis we go back on subtraction the key here is not the image analysis itself the key here is being able to do immunizes at least scale yes well socially 17 amazon sensors all these demands oh yes why do the sauce matter I'll because the account act without from amazon restrict to 20 instances p'zone so basically just need to modify the program so we can get from multiple zones um we got it a researcher come from amazon we also got research you come from the world some of the data later you see what come from observer so this is the spec on subtraction program as you can see it's it's relatively simple but you can repress a simple problem by many other things so the perverse is not the image processing itself the purpose is to run interesting as a very large scale we can also do things like moving object detection of human detection so let me explain the architecture of our system obstacle came to continuous and asus mini cameras and basically the following components first a web photo you saw earlier it's the interface with users and then it has a user database we need to know pull the users are hot have done and so on including the program's day right then we have a camera database then they are as I mentioned quite a few cameras we have got seventeen seventy thousand cameras right now in our system and the data go directly from the camera through cloud it doesn't go to our system because our sister would be bottleneck that way the a lot of study here is about resource manager because when when I started a project the progress the soup is so build a realistic environment to study resource manager in a cloud that was the original purpose but I wanted to build a real assistance so that the workload is real and that's why we start the project in the first place so they turn you'll see quite a few slides talking about resource management this shows the distribution of a camera majority are united states simply it's easier to do a web search and we go also goes through department transportation systematically we have purdue university has signed agreement with about twenty states to get the data up with the approval that it has puppy but we don't want to just grab the data because of sovereign states prefer us not to grab the day i found a website they want to grab the data from their other servers so that we don't slow down the website too much the then the rest module he is in West Europe against it because it easier to do a web search we are some of the students are working on Asia and so on so that shows the distribution of the cameras let me give a demonstration of a one possibility of using those camera to do something we call real-time image based navigation this was done by a cool steel and receive a world last year this is a very short video because each group in a competition each group has only seven minutes to present so he spoke really fast you're looking at our mobile application now as you can see it zooms and operates much the same way as our website application will take a look at a few cameras in North America here before jump it over to Europe is a brief glimpse at a camera and Lawson over in Europe you can see the clustering functionality works much the same way as the website application and we'll take a look at a camera on the Mediterranean here before we get to the really interesting part of the mobile application here at the top you can see me typing in two addresses both in New York a few blocks apart what the application is going to do is not only calculate the route between these two addresses but it is also going to show me any cameras in our system between the two addresses and so what this means is I can access the video feature of these cameras and take a live look at locations along my route or I can look at my destination so this might be interesting to me if I like to see if there's traffic perhaps or what the day looks like outside if there are people walking around in this look you can see that there's not much traffic to sunny day and so we would expect the same for the other cameras I could also see for instance if there was a crowd outside of a restaurant I might want to visit or any other sort of interesting data the important thing is that I can take a live look at a destination or place important to me with this application here we're looking oh you may also notice that the friend rate air is about 14 in a second any questions so far yes please sure this came to grabbing the images from the cameras directly or their settings stuff into their own web server somewhere and you're grabbing ok he pens on the state given on a source something we grabbed the data phone camera directly cilan will grab them from layer server so can't you hide this behind the camera database and as a user you don't need to know but if you want to help us add more cameras you do need to know design is your question okay yes I new cameras there for me to be able to be compatible with the camera system do I need any additional software okay so question is if you want to add your camera to our system do you need additional software let us know because we have a layer to handle the heterogeneity of cameras if your camera it unless your camera is something very stringent I don't expect that our system already handled many different kind of cameras some have high frame rates on a low framerate some different brains have different required static different way to grab data for example on some pretty membrane following their access how you can update how you you your quarry has a special it's a brand specific path and we encode out designs of question so if you are unless you have a new brand new camera we don't know if it's a schematic camera we can handle it and we can also grab data from a web server or ftp server as you asked for example our Texas how does not graph on the web server they want us to grab your ftp server because i guess they're ft visa has more pen with crystal camera this what is it now so it basically we vowed to the data to the user oh you're just okay so for the follow mobile this demo for a mobile demo that the day hug goes to the mobile device the referee doesn't go through us yes so so the mobile the mobile app communicate with the camera three and four if you want to do analysis and I as I mentioned earlier in this analysis we go to the Amazon instances that goes to the cloud directly doesn't go through our server because we are very afraid our server becomes a performance bottleneck in fact our server we're pretty sure also we will not be able to handle this this kind of loan because we don't have 17 machines and these are the highest performers machine you do that straight well that story unless your answers to unless one you asked us to story which is seven terrified Peter which Queen this case we we don't story we grab the data we process it with throwing away in this particular case but you can store it so let me go through a few more slides that may answer some of the questions okay so as I mentioned the season was built originally to study the resource management for cloud so I put a lot of emphasis on current resource management and has a resource management problem yesterday Google cameras that's a you want to study camera in your New York and New York those camera have a specific resolutions then you also give us analysis program you may I want to call number people I want to detect a particular car you can give us a program and you tell us quite the frame where you want some of cameras have a very high frame rate some camera have a low frame rate of course for low frame rate we cannot give you more than what the camera give us but some cameras have very high frame rate you can say I don't want to have friend ray even though the camera can give me 30 frames per second I only want one frame per minute you can give that number then we need to determine the car instances what types how many quarts how much memory currently we don't use any special hardware such as GPU but we are working on that then where the camera where the cloud instance should be and how many of them oh these are the location of the Amazon I mean Microsoft Mike also do locations ileana equal we are not equal in many different ways one of the reason is the price for Microsoft is updated the only yesterday it united states is the lowest cost this is the d 14 he has 16 course first 112 gigabyte memory per hour you spend between 1.5 dollar to 1.9 daughter so difference is about twenty-five percent for Amazon the difference much higher for Amazon the difference is up to almost fifty percent so you have a lot of data to analyze the fifties to make difference so you may say well okay it looks like it's cheaper to do date to do the analysis in the United States you remove all the admin United States this is no because this I mentioned quite location matters depends on your desired frame rate if your round trip time but in a camera and the cloud instance is alone let your friend we go drop this case we use motion jpeg this is a major and we are very weary appreciate that it Michael so as you gave us this they have a virtual measured using a sewer what we do is we select google cameras know their location we launched the instances in different parts of the world we made you a round three time and then we major the frame rate we can we can achieve then this figure also shows to type of data the while the mode parts with the kind of yellow we feel is majored then a black square are emulated you by injecting delays using emulator so what we observe here is when the wrong Street high increases the chill of 0 framerate drops for motion jpeg quality what motion jpeg it includes the video by a sequence of independent of jpeg friends why do they do that because easier it doesn't need to do motion detection between friends it's all robust if one franc is corrupted or one Peggy carafe is the damage is only one free but the disadvantage is you need more piece for the data streams a New York cameras support motion jpeg and also h2c for h.264 we observe the friend later than drop once the wrong tree tank is increased however they are more repeating friends still if your round trip tank is too long then it would be for still cannot Kiba so what it does is you will repeat friends on a surface the frame rate doesn't drop but in reality they fix your job so I hid that answer your question about location right sorry it took so long to get here you have to be careful about where you launch your cow instances because that can affect the achievable friend read because this is not bad with because motion today is TCP based once you have run to find know enough your your TC outstanding window well yeah it's waiting for like 90 miles before that shouldn't matter it's to see for but we still see that we actually haven't done enough studies to see why but it doesn't wait for it's not the fully synchronous means it's nuts in the frame and wait for acknowledgement but TCP once it reached the saturation frame at a time right explicitly but h.264 is just a streaming it's like yes but we still see that oh thanks is sending you days still they facing your adjust but we observe we haven't done enough major men yet but we observe in several cases the number repeated friend increase as the wrong tree height increase repeated frame so if you want tell you you get 30 frames per second but you also tell you these two friends are exactly the same so you actually still see the cheater of a motion in duplicates oh we ok the question is do we see those friend or duplicates I think we will see two bouquets we don't know the friends are lost because we are only on the receiving end we have no control the cameras 30 frames per second we have a lot but this is a specific intention is to see whether we should the question here is should we move all the data United States because computer communications right yeah more compute Sharif in the end you're processing the data and that's taking time as well true so you process it faster you can take some delay it's too ok no so the question is can we do a trailer we'll be processing at the day there is no because we see what to not get the data cable if you don't process and I'm now this is Richard this is Major without processing this data least figure it not a career in that constraint so these are probable your your consumption rate is slowing down because you're not processing it now that's good right do not want it yes but this example is we gravitate how we saw it away we don't do anything so this this data is the upper bound this figure is is the highest you can achieve if you don't do any part of course if you do processing use your photo slow down all right does that answer question does that make sense okay so this can be formulated as an optimization problem that you have different cameras in this case you have that says you have two cameras and used to me so you you said that you depending on what analysis somebody wants to do well is the question do you actually know understand that this analysis is going to need so much at this kind of an instance how to be able to start up a vm based on that upfront or is it something that some person or the consumer or the customer was doing in a search for life okay so the question is do we know if you run the program and we need to determine how many virtual machines to lunch who knows that right up it's somewhere in between we don't know in advance but we can launch your program and get a few data points and then we extrapolate each hey that's my favorite tomorrow representing how come tomorrow is you give us a progress to let me go back to this slide so give us a program right then we run your program let's say you want to analyze the data from 100 cameras well launch your program run your program on 10 cameras we'll see whether we can meet the friendly you want if we can maybe a friendly you want and then we major the utilization that's the utilization is eighty percent they will say looks like one how he says is good enough for ten strings or last ten instances does that make sense that if the of course that measurement can change because your program behavior may change your content may change then we'll observe and adapt so maybe later on we find you need 12 they will answer more and reduce the strings and some time later maybe you need only eight will consolidate that's exactly my speech for tomorrow in recover ok I'm going to skip this slide then what's the what's the frame rate you need depends on the study you want to do if you want to study motion you have any high frame rate if you want to study like the weather if what we don't need it very high frame rate so let me walk you through a few slides of the screenshot of our system to give your idea how our system can be useful this was it is an example of Los Angeles because a few years ago I gave a speech in UC away so I to Los Angeles example as I said we don't continuous save the data we gravitate have when you ask us to grab the data so you can go to our season f you login you can go to our system let's say you select by locations you go to Los Angeles and then you select some cameras as you can set up several hundred cameras here a few select some cameras you can also select camera by by recent snapshot we grab that the one friend from each camera every 24 hours we just have a problem that will rotate randomly through the camera and it takes about tidy we make our system very slow we don't want to jam the network so we have approximately one friend a tree I believe is one week now one day so we could have one frame pro camera every so many minutes you can also select by snapshot and then you can specify you can select you can see here how many cameras you have selected how long you want to run your program you may want to run your program for only a few seconds or maybe a few hours or a few days or maybe alone longer you can say what's the interval between friends um if you are user we currently to allow you to get one frame per second that's the highest frame you can get but you are you are working with us you can have a back door you can get higher frame rate probably too once per second because we have a figure how to what's the right answer we simply say that limit you can also specify how many friends you want to keep suppose you are doing some kind of motion detection you may want to say that's a what I want ten friends then we will give you a running window if we get more than 10 friends will travel the oles the eleventh frame we just give a ladies 10 friends so you can save that number and then you can upload your program so I guess sorry takes so long to up here you can upload a program you write or you can use a problem we give you we have written more than a dozen examples these programs are written in Python right now we are planning to extend to other languages but we have not we need more students as always but you can use our existing program to as the same post and modify then basically if you imagine your program would most likely be something like a loop you grab a white friend to some analysis and grab another friend to another analysis the only thing you need to change is to change that waialua for loop into our event driven function we have a paper published this year in global IPO in fighting imaging data gives you the example but once you log in as a user you will see all the examples we give you then we will decide which consents to launch and that's a problem we have in salvia we have some progress but we still have a lot of problems to solve so which kind instance we need to launch how many cores some some progress are more computation enhance some problems needs more memory in fact is the example shows you that this is a very complex relationship and it's not linear relationship let me explain what this figure the shows so that we show the utilization of a processor and the memory and a toot event frame rates on the left side we have a one frame every five seconds on right side we have ten frames per second you can imagine you have a very high frame rate on the right side it's processor intense on the left side is not very low frame rate it's some programs a processor intense for example human detection and some other programs such as motion estimation it's funded by memory so the question here is once you have those four different programs here the image archival simply grab image and save it does not do any processing motion estimation take to address and friends and this estimate how much change has happened moving object detection to emotional estimation and then to a bounding box so it's a little bit more complex then human detection is the most complex because you use the pistol grain of orientation to do the human detection furnace to left side and right side you can see human detection we see in this particular instance using m3 x-large we cannot do motion to human detection a ten frame per second so that is that's your question if your progress too complex computation is that the bottleneck unless side left side if your friend rate is low enough we can do more human interaction and this is per frame utilization so if you are also safe for example you want to do human detection using this particular proximately 30 strings right because you take maybe 40 strings so the utilization processor utilization about our two-point-six percent restraint and then you can process about study something strange that you your you try to become one hundred percent the dial question earlier okay and I'm going to skip this listing recess there is no simple answer it's a very complex problem and we are trying to build an empirical model so we don't have to do this for every type instance i'm going to this slide also shows that if you make a wrong decision choose the wrong instance you may pay more than twice this data shows the price per million images so if the bars are very much uniform that means you pay the same price for different type instances but on the right side if you have 10 frames per second the tourist bar is almost twice higher than the shortest bar that means you pay almost twice the cost we want to do that optimization so we choose the right instance depends on your own ways computation intense or memory intense and some other factors earlier I mentioning our project is called continuous and s's of mini cameras this example is showing we compu over 24 hours and this is our the over 24 hours we actually see the number of people going up and down a different time it releases are very clearly that at night nobody's waiting for bus at the bus stop or even pass through we do this for one friend every 10 seconds and then we do a running average every minute that's how we get a number so if you want to do this kind of analysis over 24 hours you and we are very easily by going to our system as you can see are in the middle it says the duration you if you specify a whole day you can do that por favor combination right now I Michael solve in the Amazon because we get the research credit sometimes your future maybe somebody else need to pay also our system is module enough so we can switch the back end to your machine a tree when we ran out of the research credit we got renewed but we will run out we just simply switch the back into our lab we cannot do very large-scale processes but we can do that they're also related problem is what happens the data you do not save but that's that's a very big question and I don't have very good answer yet in computing big data a few weeks ago I present you some very initial ideas about a problem but i think they are still a lot of problem to solve um so i won't take time here so so Farhad I have talked about is the real time data you get that data how you process the data a lot of cases you have the date hiding advance maybe you save it or you want to pass it again again so save the data you want to process offline not real time data you've also studied how to do these uses by instance you can sync of us finds you can think about use using computer in several different ways on the main you pay per hour is like a hotel room you can sign a long-term contract it's like renting apartment or you can do spy instance by beating the price it's like price night comp you give a price you may get a hotel room you may not however the spiced is different from priceline because if you check into the hotel room they may still kick you out if the market price goes about your bidding price and when that happens whatever you do is lost your intermediate result is lost so how we do is we create checkpoint with reality check point so that we get kick out front of spy instance we can resume later on we can resume from the checkpoints and we find you can vary your bidding strategies if your bidding price is about half of the market on demand price meaning that if the hotel room using energy is a hotel room costs 200 hours you're beating prices are 100 others a very good chance to get it our we find we have about only 5% performance degradation means we don't get it or we can click out but that delays about 5% only but we can save 85 times the cost the reason is the bidding price in the highest price you are willing to pay what cloud may charge you is no more than the opening price so you may say I bid $100 but you make 8870 that's reason you can save up to eighty-five percent of cost but you have only five percent performance degradation so that can save a lot particularly if you have a huge amount of data last saving is significant I think I've told you quite a few interesting problems i would say what we have done is only a very small protein of what can be done i call it the tip of iceberg all the more study we have done on more papers we write the more province we discover and more people we talk to and the more people wants with how to now I talk to people doing as I mentioned earlier doing psychology to in forest research doing in transportation research but let's do many many problems one problem is the metadata currently there is no easy way to get me high data we don't know where the cameras are we don't only a friend rate there's no easy way to get we don't know what bouquet is it indoor outdoor can you see people up still there are a lot of things we need to do organ we are working on some automatic method to to generate metadata another problem is there's simply no standard getting data different brands or cameras have different methods and different states have a little different wave okay giving you a data it also our website for human to see but it's not designed for machines to gather data um really mention camera at the end what we want to do is to use the system to understand the world so obviously are a lot of opportunity for vision research one colleague was doing the machine learning so he asked me to give him some day held as his simple as asking how much do you want he said how much can you give me so I gave him 100 thousand images from New York City at the one frame per second front health traffic camera over four hours so she say well that that's good enough for a while he was trying to see how he can detect the same car front moving across across several different intersections I have talked about resource allocation us as I've mentioned that's original purpose of using a system and privacy always come up who I was in Australia I find this very nice location oh so I took a picture of it it tells you you're being recorded our project use only publicly available data and we are created by Purdue legal department that we are we don't have any privacy concern but privacy is always a question I have done some studies about the legal status about cameras my understanding is they're still need to be worked out I think this morning when i was at airport waiting for the flight I saw several cities decided to give each place person a camera because there's some recent instance oh so what's a privacy issue there if a place has a camera body camera who owns the data I think that still need to be work out and I'm not an expert on that as you started by saying you're just tapping into public feed stray yes so easily bypass on issues we thought we only use puppy data the plane camera well how do I keep going so he doesn't revenue eight years and they are publicly available all right how much you're sure correct but we are looking for cameras we also find some camera they are publicly available but we don't want your system for example we find some cameras we believe they are looking like somebody's living room or something quietly public I don't know that but we found it but we don't want it because we don't want to deal with that oh this is a big project and it's also very good experience for a lot of students many of the undergraduate students this is I think for probably all that is the biggest project leaping workout it's a very big keen on for them to have that experience and I'm also very fortunate to have a phone in support for National Science Foundation and of course Microsoft give us the research credit who use as well that's very very helpful votes to do some study to conclude i hope i have given you the idea that network cameras can be very useful for a lot of studies on wednesday in calc calm vancouver there will be a panel discussion about network cameras & Co computing I'm one of the panelist I think I still many many challenges from the many questions here I can see there are a lot of questions and we have answered only a very small fraction a lot of questions but i hope i have given your idea that we are building something useful it's an open system for people to use you can register as a user and if you want to get a source code we can also work on work out some agreement we have already signed agreement with a few universities are about sharing a source code our legal department will be able to work out these details as i mentioned our system is not the archival data is a computing platform for you to run programs and we do everything for you including allocative in particular locating car resources with this I want to thank you for your attention right to analyze whistle for minor and how do you what is the u.s. maybe eyes we have an API we have an API basically you use your program need to include a few import of few modules and you have to create a derived class of a specific class we create and that will be the object so we handle majority of work in a base class but you have to override a few methods for your perverse quantum is this one frame correctly with the web frame yes correct but you can you can get the past friends so you can say I one of the past 10 friends and then you you can get lastly the last three friends oh you do decide how you want to do and we run running windows that's that you want to keep 10 friends we just keep it 10 ladies friend and that the old one get dropped out but you can specify the number 10 or 12 or whatever when you see this evolving besides ninguna robust mom also i want to do is this up first we want to use this system to do some studies interesting studies I mentioned psychology a civil infrastructure transportation and forests and so on and use this system tube for people to do machine learning because we have huge run they have for them to to use let me talk about machine learning a bit more because seems to be hard having these days for example we know that ok we'll know the precise location of some cameras for example New York City they may eat you give us of coordinates at each intersection and we can map light into for example a bus route so you know a bus will come from one particular intersection into another critic ating succession and then you can use that made high information to train your bus detection program and then and remember this one bus may not be in the same Lane and even in the same Lane the camera angle may be different so it becomes a very rich resource of doing all kinds of studies so we want to we want to provide that info infrastructure and I mentioned that psychology start you want to use this data for people to do observation not intrusive observation but people worldwide does that answer your question um i also i'm also organizer of a low-power image recognition competition so this can also be used as the source of data i have not combine these two Roger year so far apart to file you are still separate but this can be a source of data to use as many of you may know good data is often the foundation of a many interesting research and we are building systems will provide good data does that make sense sure okay other questions oh thank you very much Oh you
