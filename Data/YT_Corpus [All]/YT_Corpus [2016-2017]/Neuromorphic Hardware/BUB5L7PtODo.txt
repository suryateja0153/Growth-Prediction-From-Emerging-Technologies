 phase-change memory is a type of non-volatile random access memory prams exploit the unique behavior of Tor cotton-eyed glass in the older generation of PC and in heat produced by the passage of an electric current through a heating element generally made of tin would be used to either quickly heat and quenched the glass making it amorphous or to hold it in its crystallization temperature range for some time thereby switching it to a crystalline state PCM also has the ability to achieve a number of distinct intermediary states thereby having the ability to hold multiple bits in a single cell but the difficulties in programming cells in this way has prevented these capabilities from being implemented in other technologies with the same capability newer PCM technology has been trending in two different directions one group have been directing a lot of research towards attempting to find viable material alternatives to GE 2 SB 2 teh 5 with mixed success another have developed the use of a geta SB 2 T 3 super lattice to achieve non-thermal phase changes by simply changing the coordination state of their germanium atoms with the laser pulse this new interfacial phase change memory has had many successes and continues to be the site of much active research Leon Chua has argued that all two terminal non-volatile memory devices including PCM should be considered memristors Stan Williams of HP Labs has also argued that PCM should be considered a memory stir however this terminology has been challenged and the potential applicability of memristor theory to any physically realizable device is open to question background in the 1960s Stanford our options key of energy conversion devices first explored the properties of torco denied glasses as a potential memory technology in 1969 Charles II published a dissertation at higher risk eight university that both described and demonstrated the feasibility of a phase change memory device by integrating two cogent I'd film with the diode array a cinematographic study in 1970 established that the phase change memory mechanism into a potent ID glass involves electric field induced crystalline filament growth in the september 1970 issue of electronics Gordon Moore co-founder of Intel published an article on the technology however material quality and power consumption issues prevented commercialization of the technology more recently interest and research have resumed as flash and drum memory technologies are expected to encounter scaling difficulties as chip lithography shrinks the crystalline and amorphous states of Tor cogent ID glass have dramatically different electrical resistivity the amorphous high resistance state represents a binary 0 while the crystalline low resistance state represents a one chore cotton-eyed is the same material used in rewritable optical media in those instances the materials optical properties are manipulated rather than its electrical resistivity as chalk coordinates refractive index also changes with the state of the material although pram has not yet reached the commercialization stage for consumer electronic devices nearly all prototype devices make use of at or koujun IDE alloy of germanium antimony and tellurium called GST the stoichiometry or GE SB T element ratio is 2 to 5 when GST is heated to a high temperature it's true cotton-eyed crystallinity is lost once cooled it is frozen into an amorphous glass like state and its electrical resistance is high by heating the chalk koujun eye to a temperature above its crystallization point but below the melting point it will transform into a crystalline state with a much lower resistance the time to complete this phase is temperature dependent cooler portions of the choc Arjun I'd take longer to crystallize and overheated portions may be remelted a crystallization timescale on the order of 100 nanoseconds is commonly used this is longer than conventional volatile memory devices like modern DRAM which have a switching time on the order of two nanoseconds however a January 2006 Samsung Electronics patent application indicates pram Maya chief switching times as fast as five nanoseconds a more recent advance pioneered by Intel and saint microelectronics allows the material state to be more carefully controlled allowing it to be transformed into one of four distinct States the previous a more fickle crystalline States along with two new partially crystalline ones each of these states has different electrical properties that can be measured during Reed's allowing a single cell to represent two bits doubling memory density pram versus flash PR am switching time and inherent scalability make it most appealing pra M's temperature sensitivity is perhaps its most notable drawback one that may require changes in the production process of manufacturers incorporating the technology flash memory works by modulating charge stored within the gate of a MOS transistor the gate is constructed with a special stack designed to trap charges the presence of charge within the gate shifts the transistors threshold voltage higher or lower corresponding to a 1 to 0 for instance changing the bit state requires removing the accumulated charge which demands a relatively large voltage to suck the electrons off the floating gate this burster voltage is provided by a charge pump which takes some time to build at power general right times for common flash devices are on the order of 0.1 milliseconds about 10,000 times the typical 10 seconds read time for SRA M for example pram can offer much high performance in applications where writing quickly is important both because the memory element can be switched more quickly and also because single bits may be changed to either 1 or 0 without needing to first erase an entire block of cells pra ms high-performance thousands of times faster than conventional hard drives makes it particularly interesting in non-volatile memory rolls that are currently performance limited by memory access timing in addition with flash each burst a voltage across the cell causes degradation as the size of the cells decreases damage from programming grows worse because the voltage necessary to program the device does not scale with the lithography most flat devices are rated for currently only 5000 writes per sector and many flash controllers perform wear leveling to spread rights across many physical sectors pram devices also degrade with use for different reasons than flash but degrade much more slowly a pram device may endure around 100 million write cycles pram lifetime is limited by mechanisms such as degradation due to GST thermal expansion during programming metal migration and other mechanisms still unknown flash part can be programmed before being soldered onto a board or even purchased pre-programmed the contents of a pram however a loss because of the high temperatures needed to solder the device to aboard this is made worse by the recent drive to lead-free manufacturing requiring higher soldiering temperatures the manufacturer using pram parts must provide a mechanism to program the pram in system after it has been soldered in place the special gates used in flash memory leak charge over time causing corruption and loss of data the resistivity of the memory element in pram is more stable at the normal in temperature of 85 degrees Celsius it is projected to retain data for 300 years by carefully modulating the amount of charge stored on the gate flash devices can store multiple bits in each physical cell in effect this doubles the memory density reducing cost pram devices originally stored only a single bit in each cell but Intel's recent advances have removed this problem because flash devices trap electrons to store information they are susceptible to data corruption from radiation making Am unsuitable for many space and military applications pram exhibits higher resistance to radiation pram cells selectors can use various devices diodes bjts and MOSFETs using a diode or a BJT provides the greatest amount of current for a given cell size however the concern with using a diode stems from parasitic currents to neighboring cells as well as a higher voltage requirement resulting in higher power consumption the true cotton-eyed resistance being unnecessarily larger resistance than the diode entails that the operating voltage must exceed 1v by a wide margin to guarantee adequate forward bias current from the diode perhaps the most severe consequence of using a diode selected array in particular for large arrays is the total reverse bias leakage current from the unselected bit lines in transistor selected arrays only the selected bit lines contribute reverse bias leakage current the difference in leakage current is several orders of magnitude a further concern with scaling below 40 nanometers is the effective discrete opens as the PN Junction width scales down thin film based selectors allow to enable memory high memory density utilizing less than 4 F squared cell area by stacking memory layers horizontally or vertically often the isolation capabilities are inferior to the use of transistors the on/off ratio for the selector is not sufficient limiting the ability to operate very large arrays in this architecture Chaco tonight based thresholds which has been demonstrated as a viable selector for high-density PCM arrays 2000 and later in August 2004 nanotubes licensed pram technology for use in MEMS probe storage devices these devices are not solid-state instead a very small placer coated in chocolate has dragged beneath many of electrical probes that can read and write the choco denied Hewlett Packard's micro mover technology can accurately position the platter to 3 nanometers so densities of more than 1 TB i.t per square inch will be possible if the technology can be perfected the basic idea is to reduce the amount of wiring needed on chip instead of wiring every cell the cells are placed closer together and read by current passing through the MEMS probes acting like wires this approach bears much resemblance to IBM's millipede technology Samsung 46.7 nanometers cell in September 2006 Samsung announced a prototype 512 megabytes device using diode switchers the announcement was something of a surprise and it was especially notable for its fairly high density the prototype featured a cell size of only 40 6.7 nanometers smaller than commercial flash devices available at the time although flash devices of higher capacity were available other technologies competing to replace flash in general offered lower densities the only production mram and varan devices are only four megabytes for example the high density of Samsung's prototype pram device suggested it could be a viable flash competitor and not limited to niche roles as other devices have been pram appeared to be particularly attractive as a potential replacement for North flash where device capacity typically lag behind those of NAND flash devices nor flash offers similar densities to Samsung's pram prototype and already offers bit addressability Intel device Samsung's announcement was followed by one from Intel and STMicroelectronics who demonstrated their own pram devices at the 2006 Intel Developer Forum in October they showed a 128 megabytes part that began manufacturer its micro electronics his research lab in a great Italy Intel stated that the devices were strictly proof of concept BAE device pram is also at promising technology in the military and aerospace industries where radiation effects make the use of standard non-volatile memories such as flash and practical pram memory devices have been introduced by BAE Systems referred to as a serum claiming excellent radiation tolerance and latch up immunity in addition BAE claims the right cycle endurance of 108 which will allow it to be a contender for replacing prongs early prm's in space systems multi-level cell in February 2008 Intel and STMicroelectronics revealed the first multi-level pram array prototype the prototype stored two logical bits in each physical cell in effect 256 megabytes of memory stored in a 128 megabytes physical array this means that instead of the normal two states fully amorphous and fully crystalline an additional two distinct intermediate states represent different degrees of partial crystallization allowing for twice as many bits to be stored in the same physical area in June 2011 IBM announced that they had created stable reliable multi bit phase change memory with high performance and stability Intel 19 nanometer zdevice also in February 2008 Intel and stmicroelectronics shipped prototype samples of their four pram product the customers the 19 nanometer z' 128 megabytes product was called Alveston in June 2009 Samsung and mnemonics bv announced a collaborative effort in the development of pram market tailored hardware products in April 2010 mnemonics announced the Omni o line of 128 MB I teen or compatible phase change memories Samsung announced shipment of 512 megabytes phase-change ram in a multi-chip package for use in mobile handsets by fall 2010 aluminum antimony phase change memory devices based on germanium antimony and tellurium present manufacturing challenges since etching and polishing of the material with Chalco genes can change the materials composition materials based on Al an SP amal thermally stable them GE SBJ al 50 s be 50 has three distinct resistance levels offering the potential to store three bits of data in two cells as opposed to two challenges the greatest challenge for phase change memory has been the requirement of high programming current density the contact between the hot phase change region and the adjacent dielectric is another fundamental concern the dielectric may begin to leak current at higher temperature or may lose adhesion when expanding at a different rate from the phase change material phase change memory has high right latency and energy which present challenge in its use although recently many techniques have been proposed to address this issue phase change memory is susceptible to a fundamental trade-off of an intended versus intended phase change this stems primarily from the fact that phase changes a thermally driven process rather than an electronic process thermal conditions that allow for fast crystallization should not be too similar to standby conditions eg room temperature otherwise data retention cannot be sustained with the proper activation energy for crystallization it is possible to have fast crystallization programming conditions while having very slow crystallization at normal conditions probably the biggest challenge for phase change memory is its long-term resistance and threshold voltage drift the resistance of the amorphous state slowly increases according to a power law this severely limits the ability for multi-level operation and could also jeopardize standard to state operation if the threshold voltage increases beyond the design value in April 2010 mnemonics released its Omni o line of parallel and serial interface 128 megabytes nor flash replacement pram chips although then all flash chips they intended to replace operated in the minus 40 to 85 degrees Celsius range the pram chips operated in the 0 to 70 degrees Celsius range indicating a smaller operating window compared to nor flash this is likely due to the use of highly temperature sensitive PN junctions to provide the high currents needed for programming time line January 1955 kolomiets and guru Nova revealed semiconducting
