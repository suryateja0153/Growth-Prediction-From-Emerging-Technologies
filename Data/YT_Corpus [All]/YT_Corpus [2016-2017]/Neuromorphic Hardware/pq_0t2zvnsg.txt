 hello I'm toy side of alterra corporation here on the floor of bill called 2015 in Tampa Florida and today I'm looking at some applications using altair F pjs and SLC's here today with me it's Jim possible of syncopate engineering first of all Jim thank you for being a partner belterra and be with this year Bill com actually could you describe I know you have a various cognitive radio solutions could you kind of give it back on what your company does and what you demonstrated here today sure sure syncopated engineering is a creative solution provider software applications and embedded systems for wireless communication signal processing and data analytics and we're at alterra open sale application developer today what we have here is our RF transceiver which is based on the Alterra cyclone and it is integrated with Red Hawk waveform so you can develop Red Hawk components modular and then get actual live data flowing into your Red Hawk device what is red hawk so Red Hawk is a component-based modular software development environment for waveform developers so you can preserve your code and you can run waveforms over and over again on different applications and so but one of the problems is it's not easy to get data into it it's very offline more of an offline thing so with the RF transceivers you can just pass UDP data or V 249 right into Red Hawk and then continue to do your clam d mod or qpsk p.m. okay and I guess what are you demonstrated here could you kind of walk what we have here today is a qpsk waveform that's coming across UDP and going into into Red Hawk and having just a simple spectral analysis function today Jim could you explain a little bit about your cognitive radio solution your roadmap and how your use utilize opencl sure so a cognitive radio basically is a radio that's uses the software-defined reconfigure ability of an SDR but also senses the environment so at first census the environment figures out what signals are out there does modulation recognition and then can either retune itself or reconfigure itself to communicate in the white space or communicate cooperatively with whatever signals are out there so you could definitely do all that building all those algorithms within Red Hawk and then you could deploy it down onto the FPGA so some of the things that we're going forward with is an hour SDR roadmap is we're taking the transceiver and we're actually building it out into a full-fledged SDR that has a bigger fpga on it both a handheld version and one that works in a PCIe so that way you can add push the processing down into the device and do very little back on most awesome sounds go I like to see that suit I'm doing side of alterra corporation thank you for watching Oh you
