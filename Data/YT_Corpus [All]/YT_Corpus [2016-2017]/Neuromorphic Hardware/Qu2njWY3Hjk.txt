 hey guys fresh hose Philip here and this is a processor this is the Intel Pentium 4 3.0 6 gigahertz processor released way back in 2002 by today's standards this processor is quite old but when you consider the whole time line of processors this is actually pretty modern - welcome to the history of Intel processors before the age of transistors there were vacuum tubes they were developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 vacuum tubes control the flow of electrons in a vacuum in function as amplifiers or switches early computers such as the Atanasoff Barre computer and the ENIAC used vacuum tubes however early computers that used vacuum tubes were huge the ENIAC occupied a whole room vacuum tubes also took a long time to warm up and they produce a lot of excess heat and then came transistors the transistor was invented by John bardy Walter Brattain and William Shockley at Bell Laboratories on December 23 1947 basically a transistor works like a switch it can either allow or block the flow of current billions of transistors work together to form a modern processor transistor based CPUs are much smaller consume less power and are faster and more efficient in November of 1971 Intel founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce created the world's first microprocessor chip the Intel 4004 which was also the first CPU to be made using silicon gate technology however the breakthrough that the computer industry had been waiting for came in the form of the 8080 microprocessor which was 10 times faster than the 8008 which was an 8-bit version of the 4004 the 8080 was clocked at 2 megahertz enabling it to perform hundreds of thousands of calculations per second the 8080 was the basis of the Altair 8800 one of the first billet Yourself pcs Intel's first 16-bit processor was the 8086 which ran at ten megahertz fun fact the x86 instruction set gets its name from the 8086 the 8086 is cheaper successor the 8088 became the first chip used in personal computers the original IBM PC was based on the 8088 up next is the 801 86 however due to its hardware it had compatibility issues with IBM's original pcs and as a result never really found itself in a PC the 801 86 is successor at the 802 86 introduced protected mode which allowed multitasking it ran at 12.5 megahertz and could go through about two point 66 million instructions per second which at its time was pretty damn fast next is the 803 86 being a 32-bit processor it meant that it had twice the data throughput of the 16-bit 802 86 as 386 was the first chip to implement instruction pipelining which allowed the chip to start working on the next instruction before the previous one was completed fun fact Linus Torvalds created Linux on a computer running on an eight-oh 386 the first Intel chip to surpass the 1 million transistor count was the 486 DX it could go through 26 for 9 million instructions per second at 33 megahertz twice than that of the 803 86 was the first CPU to feature a non die 8 kilobyte cache and if you didn't know a cache stores commonly used instructions for faster access times the 486 was also the first processor from Intel that was upgradable before the 486 replacing the processor meant replacing the entire motherboard with the 486 you can just swap out the CPU for a different flavor of the 486 in 1993 Intel released the Pentium processor until named their processor as such as there were legal issues surrounding how they would trademark the numbers 805 86 the original Pentium also known as the p5 ran at 60 megahertz can perform 100 million instructions per second had 3.21 million transistors and a 64-bit data bus Pentium introduced superscalar design which enabled the CPU to execute two instructions per clock cycle some versions also supported symmetric dual processing meaning you could use two Pentiums side-by-side up next is the Pentium Pro when it came to 32-bit operations it was awesome but when he came to 16-bit operations was virtually the same as the previous Pentium processors and it was also very expensive so it never really became a hit among consumers oh the Pentium Pro didn't really blow up its successor the Pentium 2 was a hit it was the first chip to have a hundred megahertz frontside bus or FSB it had 32 kilobytes of l1 cache and 512 kilobytes of l2 cache the Pentium 2 used features from previous Pentium processors like the Pentium pros a dynamic execution technology which allowed the processor to predict incoming instructions the pentium ii used slot 1 which is the interface through which the processor attaches to the motherboard just like the pentium pro socket 8 or the Intel Core i7 6700 case 1151 up next is Intel's Pentium 3 over the span of two years Intel managed to shrink its process twice across three versions of the Pentium 3 Katmai at 250 nanometers copper mine at 180 nanometers and twala teen at 130 nanometers the Twala teen at its time was the fastest and most overclockable chip copper mine and twila teen brought the l2 cache back on the die a feature was missing in the Pentium 2 next in line is Intel's Pentium 4 the Pentium 4 featured the new netburst architecture there are a lot of processors under the Pentium 4 name so to keep this video from lasting an eternity I'll just give out a list of the different marker architectures under Pentium 4 first ones william met at 180 nanometers Northwood at 130 nanometers Prescott at 90 nanometer 's Prescott 2m at 99 o meters setter mill at 65 nanometers the Gallatin Pentium 4 extreme edition at a hundred thirty three nanometers one of the most important features of the netburst architecture was hyper threading a feature that's still being used in today's processors in June of 2006 Intel introduced the core architecture the core architecture brought 64-bit computing low power consumption and multiple cores and a single die the first processors that used the core architecture or codenamed Meryem for mobile computing Conroe for systems and Woodcrest for servers and workstations mainstream processors were branded as pentium dual-core or pentium server and workstation processors as Xeon and desktop and core based processors as core to following its current tick-tock cycle Conroe was succeeded by pen room which featured a 45 nanometer process would be followed by shift to the nephilim microarchitecture which featured an even smaller 32 nanometer process Nehalem was succeeded by the now-familiar Sandy Bridge microarchitecture which boarded a 32 nanometer process Sandy Bridge in turn was succeeded by Ivy Bridge and Ivy Bridge by Hass well here's a timeline from Sandy Bridge to the current microarchitecture so it was Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge has well Broadwell and the current microarchitecture skylake cannon lake sky lakes successor is already slated for early sometime in 2017 with its sporting a ridiculous 10 nanometer process it's kind of ridiculous to think that they can make 10 nanometer transistors when the width of a human hair is only 17 to 100 81 micrometers to give you an overview of how microarchitectures in the tick top cycle differ we first have to understand intel's tick top cycle for every tick until introduces more advanced manufacturing technologies like smaller transistors which leads to better performance and better energy efficiency every tough on the other hand introduces a new microarchitecture anyway guys that's it for this video you guys learn something from this video leave a thumbs up and hit that subscribe button for more videos
