 thank you for joining the ELS webinar series we are happy to share the webinar series for students for more videos kindly visit our website www TLS in via pls india headquartered in chennai with branches spread over pan india of a quality education counseling to fulfill students study abroad dream today we are glad to have dr. guru from university of dayton who currently chairs the ECE department dr. guru has gotten several awards for his excellence in the field of electronics he has more than 150 publications in thin Flint's for electronics photonic energy and sensors dr. guru today we'll talk about the dual degree program in engineering offered by university of dayton one of the top-ranked national universities in USA with no further ado I welcome dr. guru to take it from here thank you so let me give you an overview of our department our department offers a bet accredited electrical engineering and computer engineering degrees a bet is the accreditation body for engineering and technology programs in the US we also offer a mess in electrical engineering and ms in computer engineering as well we have a PhD program in an electrical engineering and computer engineering so we are currently our undergraduate enrollment is about 350 students and 18 faculty including electro-optics faculty in fact electro optics and photonics will become a separate Department starting next year but they will still be tenured in our department they will still continue to be a joint faculty with us so with the graduate program again many of you are probably interested in the graduate program we have about hundred and eighty-seven master students and 67 PhD students so what is unique about our program it primarily the English industry partnership that we have so for example we have a robotics concentration in collaboration with motorman yoshikawa robotics company electrical energy systems is in a collaboration of GE electric power grid systems center which is a research center located in our campus it's a 60 million dollar research facility and electro-optics as i mentioned you know we are connected to electro optics programs many of our faculty are part of it it was a program started by our department and physics department together as I said multidisciplinary program it's a graduate program so we are preparing our students for the graduate the focus area of electro optics through our concentration this is also electro-optics deals with lasers and optima chronics which is a very very hot area right now so there's a lot of industry collaboration in that in that area as well the there are excellent job co-op and graduate school placements our placements are over ninety-five percent last six seven years okay now we do have a well structured co-op program the coop is basically a program that allows students to work in industry you know you can actually get some experience it's a paid experience and foreign students can also be part of the co-op program to one other unique experience at the University of Dayton is the multidisciplinary design experience through industry-funded design projects so these are projects funded by the industry through our Innovation Center so our final year students undergraduate students they work on industry funded projects we are currently running 55 projects there are companies like Emerson G Boing BMW Johnson & Johnson ethicon endo-surgery Honda a lot of big companies and also small companies that participate in this in this program and there are about fifty five projects right now this semester and we typically run about hundred projects each year and this all industry funded they have to pay money to run their projects who are innovation center and students work in a multidisciplinary teams so each team will have an electrical engineering student a computer engineering student in a mechanical engineering student and they they solve industry problems there's also quite a lot of industry funded research projects sony samsung TI cisco l3 ball aerospace boeing are some other companies that are part of it right now we also have a very strong industrial advisory committee for strategic planning of our department this includes general electrics chief technology officer and there are several folks really top folks who are graduates from our program they come back and work with us on strategic planning so here's an overview of our department we have three major areas and one of them is the signals and systems which includes robotics and I mentioned we have collaboration with modem and robotics company so they have invested about a million dollars in our modem and robotics lab and professor of all Ordonez is the one who leads that effort embedded data processing this is directed by Eric bolster and Frank scarpino so they primarily work with their force research labs they actually have a group of folks working there to support unmanned aerial vehicle missions and things like that so it is the focus is on fpgas view programmable gate arrays which are basically you can you can program the functionality of the chips any time it's on the fly and so then that's what they're using reconfigurable computing basically professor k gu Hara Kauai's in a color science expert and so bay by taking camera pictures he actually enhances the pictures and makes them pleasing to the eyes Sony and Cisco and now Samsung is also one of the major supporters for him brass Hadi works with image processing and including biomedical imaging and he has developed a flyer scan CT module which takes CT images computer tomography images and automatically identifies cancerous nodules of the lung he also works with the l3 the infrared camera maker and he you know he's an expert in image restoration bringing out images that are you know basically nice filled he can he can improve the signal to noise ratio and and capture images computer vision lab is a center of excellence funded by the state of ohio and professor with jayna sorry is a higher research scholar professor he has several projects including one by pipeline Research Council so they're actually monitoring the pipeline infrastructure so typically the monitoring is done through small planes and the UAVs so there's a lot of video data that comes into this lab and so they have to analyze it very very quickly and make sure there's no security threats electrical energy systems is a newly evolving area with the GFP center right here in our campus so G has also funded us a new endowed professor called the GE epicenter professor and we we are in the final stages of hiring that world-class faculty and so this is going to evolve very rapidly too so here's the GE epicenter this building is is a headquarters for deviation power business and it houses the a system integration capabilities basically they can design and also build and test complete power systems for the entire airplane so they are actually involved in the triple 7 X power system development I can backup power system development right now it's it's a unique facilities with hardware-in-the-loop capability it opened into 2013 and as I mentioned the G epicenter professor search is currently underway and we are in the final stages sensors and devices is the second area which has a center of excellence for distributed sensing this is also called as a moma radar lab so if you google mama radar lab you can actually see the details it is a it is funded by the state of Ohio prep some I clicks is also a high research scholar professor what we have done is create a unique way radio frequency based tomography lab so we can do imaging we can actually for example 3d printing during the 3d printing we can figure out if there are any defects in the parts and things like that using the radio frequency imaging we have some unique capabilities where it's a playground for radio frequency and microwave testing with the air force research labs we have actually have a very strong radio frequency microwave and electro-optics devices so including myself and Bob pen o Partha Banerjee and retiring and she wins on we do quite a lot of research I still do research I still have an active research group working in the air force research labs dr. MC charter baraboo is creating a new integrated Microsystems lab so the focus is on MEMS and sensors and electronics all of them integrated on single chip so he has partnership with several boundaries so this is an industry focused activities we are creating a center of excellence for micro systems we also have a clean room we can make devices the one on the right right hand Connor this one is a variable capacitor device this is actually my own invention so we can make devices such as these and that the smallest line here is about 5 micrometer and just to give you an idea our hair is about 100 micrometer have a diameter so we can make very tiny devices on 4 inch wafers the center of excellence for thin-film research and surface engineering is something that I had created the University of Dayton collaboration with the faculty who are working in thin films so we have faculty from physics and biology and materials science and engineering and University of Dayton Research Institute part of this center of excellence for thin films so just recently in 2015 we were notified that we are one of the rear that number one hidden gem index winner and electrical and communication engineering this is for undergraduates so it was very nice to to be recognized from this College recruiter magazine they basically survey industries and find out which university produces industry ready graduates so we came up number one among schools that are not well known so everybody knows Stanford and MIT produce excellent graduates but you know the other schools are the ones they were targeting in this case also emerson innovation center opened in our campus in december 2015 so this is a picture of the building just a couple of months ago in fact official opening ceremony is this month end of April so so this is a this loop centerville how is a smart home and this will be a test bed for all the sensors that are developed by emerson and so this is also a unique facility that's available for us computing systems area cetera area which is also basically concealed engineering we do have I already talked about the vision lab embedded systems lab and the two other labs are the high-performance computing lab in fact we just received an award recently from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research we are getting a 787 core supercomputer basically funded through a research instrumentation program neuromorphic computing is imitating the function of brain so this is something we're actually building circuits using memristor technology and professor taaha is leading that effort and i'm also supporting in the fabrication of the memristors okay so the other unique opportunity with university of dayton is the university of dayton china institute this is actually located in suzhou industrial park it is the size of date and about 110 square miles and i would say it's in size of any mid-sized indian city to their arse about there are about four thousand companies there and over a ton of wells fortune 500 companies are there including some Indian companies I know Laxmi wish machine works they have a plan bear in Suzhou and there's other Indian companies too so we are located right in the heart of the industrial park we have a five-story building and we do have horses offered throughout the here so you can actually spend the semester there in fact this summer for the first time you're offering graduate courses there so our students can actually go there and stay there and take classes taught by our faculty so it provides an immersive experience as well as some industry tours and some cultural immersion tours as well so here's our ECE research lab contact information and each of our labs are listed here with the faculty survey any of you are interested in additional information you can you can contact me or you can contact the faculty directly to so I know most of you will have questions you know where are our alumni going to work and they actually go all over the country and so you know all my from Asian origin there there are recent graduates are working in GE Intel comments rockwell collins and many other companies too so there's you know you can go anywhere basically that's and UD also has career fairs where we typically get more than hundred seventy five companies they come and recruited in ue so they you know basically have a Akai affair in the UD arena stadium basically a basketball stadium so they you know it's very well attended by companies and it's a great opportunity for our students to interact with the companies so just a general overview of our university we are a top-tier doctoral level research university and we are actually one of the leading in worse ities in engineering we are a private catholic institution located in ohio the city of baton SL also known as known for its friendliness and as well as innovation and most of you may know that Wright brothers were born here in Dayton so in fact the first flight was actually done here in Dayton more than hundred years ago and so Wright brothers Institute there's a like Madison Air Force Base so there's a lot of Wright State University's also named after the Wright brothers so there's quite a lot of history and Dayton in aviation we are university has about 11,000 368 students right now from 60 plus countries and fifteen to one student to faculty ratio with an average class size of about 27 we do have 80 academic programs in five accredited divisions we have college of arts and sciences which has computer science our computer engineering program is actually a joint program between our department and computer science School of Business Administration also has an Mis program which is of interest to our Indian students management information systems which also has a cybersecurity focus to school of education and health sciences we do have a physiotherapy program and all the way up to doctoral level and of course School of Engineering is a very strong professional school and then school of law is another professional school so here said overview of our the undergraduate programs College of Arts and Sciences as all the sciences and arts related programs and you can see computer science there are two and computer information systems there's electronic media generally some all kinds of programs we also have a pre medicine program to which you know will allow pre-medicine a free dentistry so you can join medical programs after the undergraduate program school of business I talked about it a little bit imagine to information systems may be of interest and the pruner ship program is actually one of the top programs in the country and school of education and health sciences there's exercise physiology and physical physical therapy and so on and teacher education is also a big program here too and School of Engineering has chemical engineering civil engineering Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering mechanical engineering and students can also come in as discover engineering and choose any of the engineering programs we also have an engineering technology program which is not math heavy so it's actually more hands-on it's it's for students you know it's it's not really be engineering level elicited like a technician level program maybe slightly above the technical level then a technician level program these are called as technologists so they have some engineering foundation but a lot of practical hands-on experience so we do have a bachelor's plus masters program which allows our students to take six credits of graduate courses where their undergraduate program and it will double count as for the graduate program to so many of these programs do have the bachelor's master's degree so typical master's degree is about 30 credit hours and some of the programs are 33 credit hours and like computer science is 33 credit hours our programs in engineering or 30 credit hour based so 10 courses if you don't need to do with pieces basically you can take 10 courses and you will get your master's degree typical length is about two years with you can actually try to finish it within a year and a half to we to offer courses in the summer fall and spring so there's a lot of course availability throughout the year the application deadlines for fall term may wanna miss absolute drop-dead deadline because it is for international students it does take a longer time to process the applications so it will be better to apply way before May first if possible spring term is number one again we recommend you to apply way before summer term also you can start in summer term and you know we do process applications throughout the year so you can apply any time when you're you have all your documents ready okay the application requirements you can go online you have to apply online at the WWE DD you apply international there is a for undergraduate students there's an essay requirement a letter of recommendations an official copy of our transcripts and financial documentation to and TOEFL score is I think it's 90 or 84 in the graduate students and you could also have equivalent I iOS score as well I think it's 6.5 version yep 6.5 so for undergraduates the AC trs-80 scores are encouraged these are the common test steps that are taken by us students the scholarship is one of the most affordable private universities the innovative and transparent tuition plan gives full disclosure of car shows where a student who is entering into our program the tuition is exactly the same for all four years so it is a fixed version there's no increases and the university commerce increases through scholarships and more than ninety percent of students receive financial assistance incoming first-year students will automatically be considered for a merit scholarship you're including international students as part of the application review process okay so that's basically what i have and i will open up for a question the answers and i'm sure you may have some questions for me and you know who are welcome also wonderful session next we have the questions so the first question i have over here is that are a suit from surah Fatah granham i'm interested in the aids of nano and micro technology field ok so the mic nano and micro electronics in our department it falls under the sensors and devices and we have the you know nanofabrication facility it's called the nest nano engineering science and technology so we can we have a clean room we can you know basically fabricate any kind of device and circuits we also have all the characterization capabilities including SCM TM and x-ray diffraction measurements and so all kinds of advanced tools for characterization we do have a very strong program research program to in that area there's a lot of sensor development so that's one of our major strengths is the sensors where we are involved in you know various sensor developmentally industry that relies for with air force research labs do I know it does he want to know what type of course is available there are several courses available we have a intro to nanotechnology of the undergraduate level and advanced nanotechnology at the undergraduate level graduate level there's and enter electronics there's advance for the rotates there's microelectronic devices there's a thin films or electronics photonics and sensor scores there's about half a dozen courses in nano and micro electronics okay thanks oh so we are play the next question is then bio technology engineering and you know juvie huh yeah so bioengineering is a is a program we have it at the Masters level so it is it can be taken by any engineering student as long as they have some prerequisites in biology introduction to biology and I think they do have Bridge bridging courses where if you don't have any biology background they have an intro to bio engineering course that they can take so yes there is a pioneering master's degree available in the School of Engineering and our own department we are involved in some biosensors image processing can empower medical applications and also there's a new effort on you know human performance sensing that I'm also involved in we're developing variable sensors on the offer for human performance measurements and enhancement ah the same question from mr. Prakash on your game ahaha discuss a school help would be 86 is that good enough how was your date yeah sure i think it's a it's a good score yes so our average you know sad score is about 1300 i would say in engineering so it definitely has it's a good score so next question and do you have aircraft maintenance engineering for Eugene this is from mr. apology no we have an aerospace stems concentration the mechanical engineering department so it is not nothing to do with aircraft maintenance say this in aerospace engineering concentration basically in the mechanical engineering department there's a garage with level specialization in aerospace engineering we do have some flight simulator actually one of the most advanced flight simulators is available in our mechanical engineering department this is I forgot the name it's a British company so we are the only won one of two universities in the u.s. that has this advanced flight simulator system where you can design your own plane and fly to maybe that's so we don't have a maintenance type of program no thank you so next question we have mr. Chubb pot and the question can you give details about the disco mo engineering yeah discover engineering is basically for students who are not sure which type of pro engineering program that would like to to major in so they join us as discover engineering students and then they go through some seminars given by all the departments and then they can choose you know what type of engineering they would like to get into so by second year everybody has to declare their major so at least the first year they can be a district discover engineering major and they can try to find what suits their interests better okay so next question are from savvy from can you explain them out makinen engineering yes material engineering is is a masters and PhD program and so it is part of chemical and materials engineering department again it's also an interdisciplinary program so we said there are several faculty in our department to who are working in materials engineering so you know the the focus in the materials engineering department is composites fuels in a polymerase and things like that so anything to do with the electronic materials and devices are pretty much done in our department we also have a center of excellence for battery this has become a higher center of excellence so but that actually fought it comes in our department so overall baby yes we do have a main re our university is number two in materials research because of university of dayton research institute we have quite a lot of materials in sharing activities and we do about 90 to 95 million dollars a year in research in materials engineering so we're we're actually number two in the country in materials engineering so very strong thank you so so next question is this is not an academic mud what are though I'm pursuing a a 22 a punishment right standard up in it I'm doing my three years program as possible dick and he's done three years his program is doing so come 38 and he transferred to our school as what he's asking yes it is possible i think you know we do have such programs we have a 2+2 program we have a 3 plus 2 program where they can get their master's degree with us and they can get their undergraduate degree in their home institution so yes let me transfer is definitely possible transfer leukosis is definite and transfer clinic is impossible yeah so based on you know the undergraduate we definitely look for a good score so if the scores are above what we consider as a c.c grade I think they are transferable so anything that's very poor they may have to ask the student to repeat the courses thank you so the next question is that fee structure for undergrad for computer science program cell okay so typical undergraduate tuition is roughly about thirteen hundred dollars per credit hour but then you're only paying for 12 credit hours and you can take up to 18 credit hours so you basically get you know thirty-three percent discount that way but then you also have you will most eligible students will get some form of scholarship and you know I don't know you know depending on the students you know undergraduate are high school performance as well as you know the admission scores and things like that you know they are eligible for scholarships so be so I would say yeah so something equally upon a thirty thousand dollars per year will be the tuition oh now tennis scholarship so if you have about ten thousand dollars in scholarship then it becomes only twenty thousand dollars per year so you're seeing that international students are eligible for getting scholarship yes yes our University process basically for it in a local students as well as international students is the same fee structure so institution is exactly the same for everyone and we also consider international students for scholarships so next to another question from mr. Prakash is that our company's coming into University of drayton for internship program so yes so coops and internships are kind of clumped together internships are not official officially run by the University so majority of the internships are actually you know just between the company and students and university doesn't really follow up but coops are run through our university system so students who are taking co-op are participating in the cooperative education they do have to go through our co-op office and there's a like a review of the students performance by the industry folds given to the coop office too so it is a very formal program the co-op program is formal but the internship is not nice next time you question is that are one of the subject requirements will be during this reason for what for read industry Opie dentistry okay basically in a high school mad mad I guess and sciences physics chemistry and biology I think our Indian students will have all those big words except should not be a problem next question I have as one of the average acd School requirement to get into your college this is some miss apology yeah average i would say about 30 in a city especially in engineering so it is slightly higher than other units so i would say 30 is the average i say a city school thank you sorry next question is does this isn't really gentle between but a few of them asked what is the average cost of undergrad program it gently cause for us to link the cost of computing program yeah so our typical tuition without any scholarship is about thirty thousand dollars per year okay so you can take up to thirty six credit hours in in that cost and so our typical undergraduate program requires 112 25 credits engineering is about hundred and thirty hundred thirty-five engineering is the most you know how did our intense so you can calculate a big Bart fours yeah four times thirty thousand that's about hundred and twenty thousand dollars without any scholarship so so if you do have some scholarship and it will get less I'm just talking about you know the maximum is about hundred twenty thousand dollars for the four-year program nice tuition and then living expenses typically if you're living off campus I think about six hundred five hundred six hundred dollars may be more than sufficient I think if you're rooming with other students if you're staying on campus I'd think about thousand dollars a month will be necessary thank you so I think this is right now because I'm doing this any who's going to the last question do you have a kind of psychogenic in your departments are am a mechanical engineering student we have cycles in the hearth and you I don't think so we do have some biomechanics type of activities but I don't think we have anything psychogenic but we do have some like brain signal analysis type of work in our department the vision lab so they actually are trying to to read the brain waves and figure out you know if there's a way to do not inclusively detect somebody's intentions thank you I'm somebody in the best level and all the stakes I guess so we have not a question which is just come up more than the cost of medical program and what is the minimum score to get in a scholarship to medical programs oh yeah you need us not have a medical program so we only have the pre medicine program so again the sauce is the same as I mentioned you know about thirty thousand dollars per year fusion without any scholarships but if you have scholarships it'll reduce the medicine here is is different you have to have an undergraduate degree before you get into medicine so you know the medic the college the medicine UD actually you know majority of students who go through our pre medicine program they do get medical admissions about seventy percent or so you know go on to to medical schools all over the country but the medical school is very expensive so it's a I'm thinking it at least fifty sixty thousand dollars a year in tuition alone Thanks oh we have another question just come up so can can I join diploma in aviation this is pushing us by imran Almanza yeah there is no diploma but we do have an aerospace engineering concentration so there's you know it's it is part of them in mechanical engineering department so I guess you know if you already have a degree you want to take some you know like a certificate or something like that I'm not sure if there's any cell efficient grants available you need to check on that one there are courses available in aerospace engineer so we have a parent who has a specific question that if in a scholarship for a student participates an international competition of masa and FB are in the if we are in one of the competition is there a scholarship basically sabaka be nice if the participant loss of competition at the book will be eligible for getting some scholarship with the kind of question the student this way things out well I you know I I'm not sure we have any specific scholarships for for students participating in a competition we you know we have to evaluate the students academic transcripts and so you know if the students academics are very strong than that I think that's the main criteria I don't think there's any special consideration for competitions on Vicki is us a couple questions of one question I'll be giving out and it lacks accidents for students with the language values will be callous language yeah so there are conditional admission possible with you know the English requirements are met Julie may actually asked the students to be part of the English Program I Els write something like that art what is yeah intensive English Program it's at the University baton yes that if that is possible ah I think I think something to be done with the questions out in right now if anybody else has any questions from the artists events you've taken so can they be in touch making widening Elsa sure yep I I do have my email mr. damn bear on the first page our second page we have taken contact with our unit thank you sir are so thank you for the session so illness would like to thank everyone for their participation also a recorded copy of the session will be shared for your residence and form or do things about the webinar series is built up website or a list or IM thank you very much have a nice to everybody thank you MC all right take care everyone bye
