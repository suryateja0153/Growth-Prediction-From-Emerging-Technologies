 hello everyone today I'll be talking about as he said accelerating deep learning using FPGAs alterra now Intel will be the focus the traditional Intel legal agreement that we will put up there what I will spend maybe just one slide to talk about the fact that alterra and Intel now the same company joined to enhance that value proposition that the FP j can bring so there's strategic rationale behind that accelerating the fpga innovation from combined R&D improving the fpga performance per watt verse early access and greater optimization of the processing node enhancements right accelerating Moore's law with paralyzation new breakthroughs in the data center and IOT products are harnessing combined FPGA and CPU expertise both discrete and in the same package so that's really the focus of this this merger beyond just saying these few things the idea is that we're trying to produce a next-generation product a superior product continued excellent service and support that Intel is always provided but this extra resources that Intel is providing altera as an FPGA company to to kind of drive that long-term strategy so one of these aspects is very much related to the topic of machine learning so I I'll give a little bit of background I'm not going to go too slow here through machine learning but machine learning is at its essence the ability to extract features from data and to solve some predictive problem so if you're doing image classification we're detection recognition and tagging looking even at network intrusion detection or fraud things like face detection all of these things the aim is the program to automatically learn and recognize those complex patterns and then make intelligent decisions based on that insight that's generated from the learning so for accuracy to do this we've talked and you probably heard some of the talks today about this is the models have to be trained you have to teach them how to do the detection you have to test them to make sure they were correctly have to calibrate them to do the detections and we that's effectively what we call using previous experience
