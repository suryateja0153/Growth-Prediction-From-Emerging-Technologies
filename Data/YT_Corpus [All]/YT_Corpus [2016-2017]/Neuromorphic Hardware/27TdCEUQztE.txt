 welcome everyone it's it's exciting to be here this is certainly not my first participation in this meeting and hopefully for many of you that's true as well I am I'm a computer scientist I know very little about neuroscience and I work predominantly in high-performance computing for me what's been fascinating about this meeting as a scientist is to learn about neuroscience it's it's it's I mean they're just these wonderful aha moments that I get from some of the talks at this meeting but from what I'm paid to do the the value to me of coming to this meeting is the the ideas that it sparks about how we can leverage insights from neural systems as we think about the future of advanced computer systems so let me let me start by just acknowledging that we live in very exciting times so the brain initiative of course you all know about is has the potential to substantially increase their understanding of how brains work that's that's their there as we hear more about their there are large programs around the world now that are committed to exactly this question within the states there's something known as the national strategic computing initiative I actually mentioned this to you guys last year that it was in the works it it actually got announced this summer it's all of government is the language so a multi-agency commitment to advancing computing and in several frontiers and in a very important element of the National City to communicative is that it's includes non-traditional approaches to computing things like quantum computing neuromorphic computing non-traditional non CMOS electronics with attenti with an intent of trying to figure out what we do as a computing community and consider and how we consume computing after the end of Moore's law so so so we've had this this wonderful run of exponential performance improvements for four decades now but that's not good to not connect continue for that much longer within the Department of Energy where I work then in one of the National Laboratories there is an exascale initiative an exascale project is being stood up with a push to to attain performance of 10 to the 18th so the 18th is is exha operations per second on very very large scale machines it's a very daunting challenge the the goal is to get there by the mid-2020s I think that there will be other nations that probably do stunts at this scale prior to that but the do ease goal is to do this in a way that's sustainable and was an entire ecosystem forward in a very constructive way there's a exascale there mentioned is very challenging there was a report done by a number of luminaries in the in the field articulating the top ten challenges in getting to axis scale and and as you'll see from the the list that I've exert exerted from their report many of the challenges are things that brains do extraordinarily well so power is the is the overriding single most most challenging impediment to getting to this scale with our traditional computing approaches and basically this report concluded that they really didn't see a good answer for this problem so so we're likely to at the 10 exascale level sorry at the exascale level the first exascale computers will probably consume order 30 megawatts of power which is really an amazing amount of power that very very few facilities can actually countenance resilience of course is another big issue our traditional computing models are extremely fragile to errors unlike brands so so these machines in part to address power and parts address performance are going to very complex memory hierarchies and questions about how we manage those what the structure should be both physically and and conceptually are things perhaps we can learn from brains and then and then networking of course connecting the the millions or tens of millions of processing units that we'll have in these machines you know somehow the brain does that in an amazing way so so CMOS which is the technology that we build our computing current computing technologies out of largely just can't shrink very much further and ultimately that's the that's what's gonna limit that's what's gonna bring Moore's law to an end and so maybe this will get us to a few exa flops the basic the basic approaches that were used to but I know of no one in the community thinks it'll get us much beyond that so if we're going to continue to strive for further advances in computing performance we're gonna need to be receptive to much more radical changes in the way we think about our advanced computers and the hope certainly my hope is that is that insights from this community from neuroscience from my understanding of brains can provide some ideas that can percolate into more mainstream computing communities in a way that that advance and an enable future existing exponential growth and computing capability so here are just a putt a few possible concepts I broken this into into hardware versus algorithms of course as you know there's already a lot of algorithmic work that's inspired by some at least limited understanding of how neural systems work so the deep learning work of course has been a big success but it's clear from the training requirements in those applications that they're not functioning as effectively as brains but algorithms inspired by neural systems obviously can do machine learning alright we know that well they could also potentially manage these complex memory hierarchies as we as we learn how the brain manages those itself they could monitor the state of a machine to recognize errors or detect errors or are enhanced resilience in various ways and of course looking for you know data analysis those are things we know brains and even even some of our existing algorithms alright inspired by brains already do reasonably well more interesting to me is how insights from neural systems could inspire architecture and in computer hardware so so you know the the the you know the brain as you all know is an extraordinarily power efficient entity you know vastly vastly superior to the way that our existing computers work and so maybe there's something there that we need to understand well there's there's a lot there that we need to understand better and potentially leverage neural inspired devices could potentially provide fast matrix vector multiplication power efficient matrix vector multiplication but probably a very low precision there are algorithms you may hear about at this conference where neural models provide the opportunity to do certain things faster provably faster than you can do in a traditional von neumann model things like like sorting and and we may hear more about that here a somewhat ill-formed idea neurons integrate they integrate inputs and generate outputs maybe just possibly we could we could view our traditional scientific computations instead of being differential equations represent them in the integral equation form and maybe hardware inspired by neurons could could directly integrate those I don't know but I think we need to be open to open to ideas so to me there are several next steps that are that are required here very very importantly to me is we need better theoretical models of neural inspired computing approaches so the complexity models that we have for for traditional computing have been deeply empowering the way we think about algorithms the way we devise algorithms there we implement algorithms I don't think certainly I haven't seen a similarly advanced model of the way we think about neural systems and I think modeling is really important a question that it's of keen interest to me and I'll be listening in the talks this week trying to elucidate insights into this is which neural inspired concepts are the ones that are really important so I don't think you know hemoglobin and glucose are the important things but is it is it spike trains is it a synchrony is it is that the coal mingling of processing and memory is it is it the connectivity structure you know I've heard I various opinions on these questions that I welcome welcome more but as far as best I can tell this this isn't really a resolved question and I think that understanding that will be really important as we as we move to abstract these concepts into more mainstream computing approaches and then of course to enable all this we need we need cross community fertilization and this this meeting is a wonderful exemplar of that kind of cross dialogue but the communities involve computing and neuroscience they have very different scientific objectives different vocabularies different ways of thinking of the world different definitions of what success is and and it'll require a lot of work to break down barriers and actually build these opportunities but I think that the potential is so vast that I I'm I'm very eager to see this move forward so with that I'll turn the podium over to one of my colleagues and we can continue the conversation
