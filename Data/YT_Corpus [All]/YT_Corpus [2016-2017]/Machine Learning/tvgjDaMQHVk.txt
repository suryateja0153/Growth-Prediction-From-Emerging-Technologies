 so what if you want to read a little bit more about the discussion of the differences between machine learning and traditional statistics well I'm gonna give you a couple of articles that you can go get and read one is a blog post by Larry Wasserman he's a very well-known statistician and he wrote a blog post if you search called the rise of the machines it's a very good treatment of the distinction and maybe a little bit of a rallying cry to the statistical community to to embrace machine learning a little bit better there was this very celebrated statistician who sadly passed away uh named leo breiman and he wrote a tremendously well received paper called statistical modeling the two cultures and much of my thinking really derives from this paper it's very accessible it's in the journal statistical science and I would say his approach is quite critical of traditional statistics or at least act suggesting that traditional statistics is lagging behind and he I give you this quote here where he says in this paper I will argue that the focus of the statistical community on data models has led to irrelevant Theory kept statisticians from using more suits suit suitable algorithmic models and prevented statisticians from working on exciting new problems so he he kind of takes his own community to task quite a bit it's a very entertaining article and it's not quite as dry and academic his most scientific papers it's a statistical research papers and I just brought out this this wonderful quote that really stuck with me from dr cox dr cox is another tremendously celebrated statistician his Cox proportional hazards model is easily one of the top five most cited statistical papers and dr. Cox was one of the discussants of the paper and this quote really stuck with me where he said Professor Brian Minh takes data as his starting point I would prefer to start with an issue a question or a scientific hypothesis although I would be surprised if this were a real source of disagreement but I really like this comment because I do think that really does get at a to me I think of the things that I have the most trouble with with machine learning it's when you're having both derive and interrogate the hypothesis with the same set of data I think to me that's the hardest the the hardest pill to swallow and then the final article that you might be interested in looking at was an article by David hand another great statistician and he says classifier technology and the illusion of progress so this is this one's a little bit more critical of the machine learning approach and I'll give you a quote from this it says so that so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illusion in particular simpler methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods to the extent that the difference in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that are generally not are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm so he's basically saying the effort of building a complicated machine learning algorithm is often not worth it the the increase in complexity leads to marginal gains is is one of the points that he's making so it's another interesting paper quite the opposite from say Lee O'Brien's paper so that gives you hopefully enough to go on for the rest of the course we're really going to kind of focus on more traditional analysis under the assumption that you're going to be using and managing data scientists to try and come up with parsnip parsimonious explanations for for your industry or whatever it is you're trying to study so thanks for listening and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture
