 my name is Sofia Escala and I'm a professor in the computer science department at ETH Zurich I lead the learning and adaptive systems group which is part of the Institute for machine learning in the machine learning we develop algorithms for making predictions and decisions based on data so as an example we might be given a collection of images that are labeled say by the objects that they contain and what you'd like to do is you would like to automatically learn a function that map's new images that the algorithm is not seen tour the labels to the objects that are contained on it this is in pretty stark contrast to how we traditionally tell machines what they should do traditionally only program they specify very precise rules that a computer should execute in machine learning instead the teacher completely by giving examples so new medical applications say if you would like to classify medical images whether there is a tumor on the picture or the cells are benign an expert's a pathologist needs to sit down and really manually annotate and it spent a lot of valuable time on this task so in very interesting question is whether you can have learning algorithms that themselves figure out which information would be useful to them in order to make good predictions so that is called active learning for the algorithm itself is control over which information it should request in order to learn a better predictive model similar challenges arise in many other applications for example in recommender systems but also in a ton of automating experimental design in the sciences and engineering one class of problems that we are very interested in in our group are related to what's often referred to as the exploration exploitation dilemma this is something that a lot of us can relate to so if you think about the a always make decisions very uncertain about the outcomes take a simple example why do you'd like to get dinner somewhere you have to pick a restaurant do we go to the restaurant that they liked in the past or do we try something new if you always go with the same choice right and you might miss out on some really good option that they haven't explored on the other end of the Explorer we run the risk of actually going to a restaurant we might not like alright if you think about how little children learn for example right they interact with the environment they don't really know how their own body works right if you watch them how they learn how to eat right or play with the new toy right they need to acquire new skills and that really means they need to collect information to experiment in order to acquire new skills similar challenges arise in a lot of scientific engineering commercial applications or if you think about robots right so robots are coming out of that cozy homes right the factory that everything is very clean and all specified to much more uncertain environments right think about self-driving cars think about robots coming to our for me to help us with everyday activities they must operate on the very complex noisy environments and adapt to them and that means they really need to be able to learn and their they need to acquire similar skills like little children would have to
