 I would say the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence are artificial intelligence is really a larger entity that actually utilizes the outcome of machine learning machine learning to me really is taking the big data this is leveraging your big data and using that to make these models that have an output that can then be consumed and utilized by artificial intelligence so for example machine learning would be classifying users into demographic groups I would be predicting the prices on certain inventory real estate prices and that would have you and AI to me would be more of the line of your optimizing and you're running through and that technique of controlling your pace and your fill and so forth in conjunction with the predictions coming from oisin learning would be to be more of an AI kind of thing ai is more taking a lot of knowledge and assembling them into something that's use to decision and do something on the fly whereas machine learning to me is classifying or predicting something that is utilized downstream so it's an important tool under the hood but typically I would say that it's not used unto itself it really is a suggestion information compression to then yield something that's usable to to an AI or us of an optimization process in general yeah III would like to think that there's some situation in the future where it could be mostly automated I I've been in this industry long enough for any industry and that use it Eliza's the machine learning to say that ideally always kind of want to man in a loop for various reasons but in general most things can go pretty smoothly so we call a set it and forget a kind of approach my predictions for where this all is going is really you know we're trying to unify that the industry is trying to unify screen so that eventually media should be irrelevant it'll be able to be played on your desktop or mobile your TV whatever TV is morphing into its really content so much as where you play it in content really ideally it will be able to say distribute your budget how you want to target the right people one of my hopes for the future is that we move away from a model of a budget and spending that budget to specifically being so good at are getting what you want that the world becomes optimized on the KPI optimizing those clickers or converters you want and if we go above and beyond that that margin is eaten by us and there that would give us greater impetus to pursue what you want save the rest of the inventory for the world where it's actually valuable and not just pursue things for the sake of spending a budget that's one big thing I think is out there I think bringing to bear more and more information at auction time is crucial that moves away from this notion of static segments where you had to have pre characterized users and say there are this demographic bucket or they have this interest to a representation where the user information that you've leaned over time is is so strong and can be conveyed to the auction call and utilize their you now can make runtime decisions relative to everything you knew about a user everything you know about the media and everything you see in the specific ad called that time in order to facilitate doing a great job there so reach no longer becomes a question it's a matter of just how many options do you see and how can we deliver that KPI most effectively so so I didn't forget it would be great but all those things is well relative to how things could go would be fantastic in our arena and enable us to leverage everything we know about
