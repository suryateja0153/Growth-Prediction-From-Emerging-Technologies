 can everyone hear me okay great all right well thanks everyone for coming to our sustainability Meetup today we're gonna be talking about some of the machine learning research projects that we've been working on the past couple months specifically catered towards energy efficiency and customer care real quick I'm gonna introduce my data science team there's been Packer Zero and Mark and they're gonna be coming up here and presenting some of these with me okay so first I'll just go over the quick agenda we're gonna be going over the background about Opower along with what the data science team does then we're gonna talk about some of the load curve archetypes that we've been researching then I'll talk about the small medium business insights that we have and then we'll finish it off with electric vehicle detection so I want to start with a small energy savings experiment that was done a few years ago with the aim to figure out what's the most effective way to get people to save energy so they put these placards on people's front doors the first one said save energy and you'll save more money the next one said save energy and you'll save the planet and the third one said save energy and you'll be a good citizen so which one of these three do you think was the most effective at getting people to save energy very good guess but it's a trick question none of these actually had any impact on energy consumption at all it turns out that the only one that did was a fourth placard that said your neighbors are saving more energy than you are and even if that wasn't true people still were so competitive that they actually saved money when they were given this placard so that's kind of where the idea for power came in and we decided to make a home energy report with the idea that if we were able to compare people's energy to their neighbors and actually inform them about their energy usage then they'd have the highest chance of actually saving energy so here we have a mock-up of our home energy report and you can see the bar chart is comparing your energy usage to your neighbors and your most efficient neighbors the neighbors here are going to be people approximately homes of a similar size within a similar or within a short radius of your house and then along with this we also provide tips on how you can save energy and more information about that so this is our first big project our product the Home Energy Report next is our behavioral demand response so traditional behavior demand response required customers to actually sign up for these devices that would be installed in their homes for say a twenty five dollar rebate and then on the peak days like the hottest day of the year when everyone's using the most energy and you would go to turn your air conditioning up it would block you so that you wouldn't be using as much energy on these peak consumption days however because this requires you signing up to actually get this installed in your house there was very very low adaptability so Opower went for a softer program called the behavioral dishonest behavioral demand response program where you actually will get a text message or an email asking you hey tomorrow is going to be a peak day please limit your usage between the hours of 2:00 and 7:00 and some of these programs will have monetary value so they will give you a rebate if you don't use as much and the adaptability is very high all we need is your email or your tech or your cell phone number and we'll be able to send you these communications and these are actually very very effective without monetary gains I want to say it was between 3 and 5 percent energy reduction and then with the monetary incentive it was a 10 percent reduction in peak energy usage on these peak days and that's really important because for the peak days if you run out of capacity as a utility company you have to start up these peaker plants and those often use fossil fuels and we know those are all bad so that is our second big product how is it deployed in the wild well we send a communication the day before or before the peak day saying please don't use energy between these times and then we also give you your neighbor comparison for the last peak day so that you can see that you could be doing a lot better trying to give you that competitive advantage of edge then on the peak day we're hoping that you turn up your thermostat a little bit so you turn down your air conditioning you don't use as much and then after the peak day we'll send you a follow-up communication saying great job look at you you were one of your efficient neighbors way to go so that's a little bit about old powers too big products now data science at O power here's some of our data science members it's a nice big team we work on a variety of different projects some of which we're going to be presenting today and with the goal to deliver them to improve the experience either for the utility customer or the utility client or their customers a little bit of the workflow we start in the research stage with an idea we take some data and we figure out okay is there any signal with in this data with these models we try a bunch of different models and if there is signal then we will and if we actually can have decent accuracy then we will move it to an initial rollout and a small population either a single client or a small pilot program if that goes well then we will release it for general availability and that includes all of the production ization within that and then after that we will go back to the research and we will consider model improvements and we'll do more accuracy testing and then potentially go through the whole thing again for a v2 so today we're going to be talking about some of the projects that we have in our research stage we have two microphones and well in the clicker we good all right so I'm gonna talk about actually before I begin one thing John neglected to mention is that today is the 60 year anniversary of Justine graduating high school and the only reason I say that is because she didn't want me to say that okay so I'm gonna talk about this is actually something in that we do in production using ami data smart meter data to segment customers understand their behaviors better so I'm gonna start with my own data I live in Redwood City and this is a monthly view of what my electric energy usage looks like this is for each month the average usage in my home and you can see that I use more energy in the winter and actually when I first saw this I was a little surprised because you would think in the summer use more electricity but actually I don't have since it's Redwood City I don't really have air-conditioning don't really need air-conditioning and in the winter that's when we blast up the heat we also have some not great insulation so we use a little too much of the heat in the summer even though it's even though it's gas heat we're still using just more energy in the system in general anyway so this is what my what my profile looks like this doesn't tell you that much about me or really about my behaviors but if we dig into these I have since I have a mi data we can look at that and see what that looks like so what I'm showing here is across the lifetime of my home or when I was there for each hour of the day what is the average energy usage electric energy usage so each hour this is just the average my average usage and so what you can see you can see a few things here first is that we probably wake up on in general around 7:00 so there's a little little spike in the morning someone is usually home during the day so my daughter and our Nana usually in and out of the house during the day and then we come home in the evening we have dinner we watch who or whatever and then we go to sleep okay so this gives you some sort of sense of what my life is like a little weird but it's fine it would be great if we can do this for all utility customers to try and gain some insight into what their behaviors are and then I'll we'll talk about what we can do with that but I want to back up and just show you what data raw data looks like I don't know if everyone's seen this but this is pretty typical of a single households energy usage electric usage for a name from an ami meter for a single day so one day this is one random customer that I chose this is real data so you know maybe there's some pattern here maybe not it looks a little noisy if you take this this customer and take the same plot over five consecutive days this is what it looks like so each line here is a single day of usage and this is five consecutive days again pretty noisy maybe there's some pattern here they seem to use a little bit more in the evening but you know there's a lot of fluctuation and then this is overall time so this is this customers data overall time very noisy really not much that you can discern here however if we take the average overall time then maybe you can get some sense of the pattern you do lose some information but you can see for example that just like me they seem to wake up around 7:00 they get a little spike in the morning where they're having their coffee and then they actually kind of similar to me you know come home in the evening maybe they're around during the day and then they have and they they go down in the evening after they go to sleep okay so let's take this average curve load curve and plot it for all customers that we have so this is just a sampling of a thousand customers and we call this we call this chart the hairball because it looks like a hairball it's very again hard to discern any pattern here and drive any meaning from it so what we did is we took all this data for all the customers and we applied a clustering algorithm to it so we're gonna just throw this data into the clustering algorithm and retrieve from it some number of clusters salient clusters of people that are similar to each other and different from others and so here's what happened when we did that we get out these five different clusters and let me add some the color to it so you can see it more clearly so these are these five different clusters that emerge from this and I wanna emphasize that this is not something that we went searching for five in particular with these particular shapes and in fact let me show you them separately so you can see what each one looks like separately we didn't say let's look for something with like two humps which is probably someone who leaves home for work during the day or something up in the upper right corner where someone is using a lot in the evening this is all naturally emerging from the data and five in particular is we we ran this for different numbers of clusters and this is the one five was like the right balance between explaining the data and simplicity we also gave them kind of funny names steady eddies Twin Peaks etc we so now we have these and each customer now is assigned to one of these clusters so there are some people who are Twin Peaks there's some people who are daytimers etc and we took those assignments and we correlated them with demographic data that we have so we saw for example that daytimers is you might expect tend to skew a little older and have fewer children in the house night owls tend to be younger apartment condo dwellers you would assume that day timers tend to be or may be more likely to be retirees so this gives you some sense of who they are however one thing that is really trouble is a taupe hour for basically the entirety of our existence is that we run all these energy efficiency programs we want to figure out who and they work very well in general every wave that we've ever done we've measured rigorously with randomized control trials and the savings are always between about 1.5 and 3% overall savings but we wanted to figure out who are the people who are most likely to save because that way we can target those people and get higher overall savings and we've never found anything we've looked at all sorts of different demographic categories age income even political leanings and for any given territory utility sometimes there will be some sort of correlation but it never holds across the the full population or across other utilities so there's really been nothing that we found that predicts higher energy savings other than higher energy usage so that's that's basically it if you use more you're more likely to save it's pretty straightforward and that's how we target our programs and we've been unable to find any other subset of the population to target until we had these load curve archetypes so despite the fact that demographics alone does not predict a EE savings and the fact that our local archetypes are correlated to these demographics demographic categories in general the low curve archetypes themselves alone are actually very predictive and there's a strong correlation so on the energy efficiency side our for our home energy reports you see that the daytimers are have a much higher savings rate and this is this pretty significant difference in the savings rate overall on the demand response side the steady Eddie's really stand out as those who really save the least and I think this is what's important to see here is that so if you look at the steady Eddie's what I didn't mention is that the y-axis is percentage use of your overall usage so this is not absolute usage this is percentage of your overall usage which means that if you can be you can use a ton of energy or a little energy it's just about the shape and that's what puts you into this category so you can have very high and very low users that are both steady Eddie's and the difference between these categories is what the shape is and in the case of demand response what that means is do you have the ability to change your electric usage throughout the day or are you willing to or do you have the ability to and steady Eddie's tend to be people who don't they don't have that ability and that is why they are saving at a lower rate it's being may have a huge amount of afternoon usage during that peak period but they just don't have either they're never home or they're always wrong whatever it is they're not they're not changing their behavior whereas the evening papers are really the ones who are able to change their behavior the most and save the most so real quick what let's see I can do this in two ways one is to guess which is the most let's do guessing all right what does everyone think the most common archetype is across the population that we've looked at twin peak any other guesses Eddie's evening peakers correct on the third try evening peekers are the most this by the way does vary by utility and you know geography but across the population we've looked at the the Twin Peaks are actually surprised so that was my first guess initially when we looked at this but those are actually less common evening pickers are more common so how do we actually use this so this is all in production right now it is which means that it's run automatically in any of our products and we do more than just the Home Energy reports are able to have access to this property for each household we have so we can if we want to have a campaign that's sending out certain communications if it's a refrigerator rebate program that a utility is marketing they have the ability through our bi tool to target just people in that particular households with a particular archetype it's one of the many ways that we segment the population and this is now included so you can now our partners can now target by these low shave archetypes and then as I mentioned we're for demand response in particular this has a very strong effect and so we have we have now have the ability to target the demand response programs to the people who are going to save the most so now I want to turn it over to Xero who has done a recent project extending this we basically got asked by one of our partners to do a couple things one is to look to show them what their archetypes look like in particular every utility thinks they're very special and of course they're all very special and they want to see what their archetypes look like and they also wanted to see different seasonal effects and they're they're trying to craft their own time abuse rates and so they wanted to be informed by this so I'll turn it over to Xero to talk about that Mike so my name is zero and I'm pretty new to machine learning and data science I was nice of adjusting to include me into the data science team I mean my work is data science work but I'm actually a implementation engineer working at Opower but I'm really interested in the subject and I'm also very new to the energy industry but I'm very excited to share the progress of my work with you guys tonight and I apologize if you know my slides does not look so fancy as Ben's slides which goes for you know sales presentation but you know it's real work and my real hard time so thanks all right here we go so here yeah so my project is to the load curve archetypes for a specific utility partner of ours and here to start with I plotted three individual customers with their average hourly ami data throughout the day and I said as been mentioned before we actually translated the actual ami read into the percentage throughout the daily percentage use this way we see the usage shift throughout as the day goes by very clearly as you guys can see they are very different individuals with the different patterns as the first guy is probably a average nine-to-fiver as you can see the peaks around the morning oops a more amount the morning time and the night time and during the day is relatively lower and the second person is actually pretty steady as you can see that the difference between the percentage is only one and the third guy for some reason they have some heavy-duty energy used in the morning so as we can see only the three people right here is already really different so how about more so here we got the hairball again that been mentioned before just with more colors because I thought it was prettier so but you know like here we can kind of see the patterns kind of like during the morning time we see kind of a peak and then again the night time the evening time we see a like a lower peak and right here we you kind of see a low curve but in general this is still pretty noisy so how do we understand this better we turn to machine learning and in this specific situation we use clustering and particularly for me I used the k-means algorithm from a psychic learner and you know for case value we actually tested from 2 to 20 and finally we found that 1 K is equal to 5 it brings us the groups with the most distinctive characters so here's what we found we got this very nice 5 curves and you can kind of see oops sorry here we actually got the steady Eddy that been mentioned earlier as the purple curve you can see it's pretty steady throughout the day and also we got this red curve over here which is kind of have the twin peak and especially at night like it's it's a lot higher so this is the night owl so we do see some similarity like with Ben's general curves but what's interesting is this light blue curve we see right here this does not look similar with any of Ben's curves which the energy usage is actually concentrated between you know nighttime and morning time and throughout the day is pretty low so this might worth more investigation and research later on and also we can kind of see on the right I put a percentage of the customer that falls into different groups here interestingly you know for the steady Eddie the group is the biggest because I remember some some of you guys guessed earlier like which one is the most common but apparently for this specific utility a partner the steady Eddie is the most common type which might have something to do with the region they are at maybe there are just more retired people but I'm not gonna say that utility name obviously but you guys can have a guess but you know despite the difference between you know my project with Ben's general research we can still use all this five different types to generate more insight so we can get better population segmentation has been showed you guys earlier so that using that we can target or we can use better target for our energy efficiency programs and also as Ben mentioned that we can have better energy efficiency savings forecast more accurate so now how about when we introduce seasons into the picture you know the data I was using I'm using for this project is from a region I'm giving a lot of details but just without the name the the region that you know this between the change between winter and summer is pretty drastic that's why we decided to introduce season into the cluster generating and this is what we found here we can see between the winter curves and the summer curves there is they're pretty different and the most obvious difference between these two is this peak I kind of disappeared over here but it makes sense like in the summer the temperature probably rise a lot and you know between the nighttime and in the morning like people just don't need to turn on the heat that much as they do in the winter so you know like using when we in tradition in this research we can actually adjust our program targeting strategy so we can get better result so so far I've pretty much covered all the progress I've made in my project and the next step I'm gonna take is to see if for the same customers if winter and summer energy consumption behaviors can correlate for example if in the winter certain people fall into this category which there is a peak between the night and morning time when the summer comes will they fall into this group or this group or both because you know like when the temperature rise they're not going to use as much energy so you will see as my project goes on so the conclusion is that clustering customers based on the ami data brings more brings in more ways for us to identify behavioral groups so that we can you know a target the utility customers better with our energy efficiency programs and be to provide more accurate energy efficiency savings forecast and last you know facts like seasons might be worth looking into so that's it for me today thank you guys I'll see if I can answer if I can't I just look at him yes that's actually another part of my later research are you talking about in general when we do these demand response programs using the general occurs the target the programs yeah so we're that's we show that the past correlation we're now doing the targeting and then we'll measure the effects and that's not in yet yeah it's roughly I mean it's almost not really not too much extra complication beyond as we said we take the percentage and then we do Euclidean distance there's a few other versions of what we have the simple things tend to work about the same as yeah yes I don't so what I do remember is that we have all this written down somewhere and the the ones that I believe stand out are that the day oh man now I forget all right I think it's either day timers or the night owls Nemo but but there's actually only two I think that stand out as either higher or lower and other than that there's kind of a mix and even when the ones that do stand out there's a big mix so I think it might have been the night owls who use more energy but it's not consistent across the population full population there's definitely yeah right right and the reason and so when I mentioned that the savings are higher or lower for each category that's when adjusting for total usage so it's not just capturing the fact that higher users save more it's even even adjusting for that yeah we don't so first of all our way up our works in generals we partner with utilities and they have so we run some of our own programs that they buy from us and then they also use a lot of our software or in this case the segmentation to run their own campaigns and programs so what we've done is we've made this available I think the only thing that we've done internally is I've investigated as targeting our demand response program so far and there may be other stuff that we do but we've given our utility partners the ability to use these low shape clusters as well as other demographic or other pieces of information to segment the population and target their communications and campaigns appropriately so there are so I there is a New Zealand utility that has recently started using them and actually I should forget the program that they were using to target but we gave them the control to target their marketing to whichever archetypes that they found were most likely to yield results I think you had a question too yeah so this is only electricity and the reason is that we have because we're looking at the hourly view we have to use am i smart meters and there basically is I think in the world know where that has smart meters less than a day except for like two places maybe that have hourly or sub hourly smart meters for gas so this is all electric smart meter we could easily do the same thing it doesn't matter what the input is so we can easily easily do the same thing for gas but since you know basically everyone who has smart meters has electric that's that's what we do it for so for this analysis where we just use the raw data the raw energy usage data as input to this clustering analysis but as I mentioned earlier we have we have that other information at least sometimes so for depending on the territory we get third party information that we put into our tools that we have access to and that our utility partners have access to and so they can use that to segment and they do use that like age of homes sometimes they use to target you know retrofit or whatever programs and they use all those properties of households if they're available this is a huge issue that the questions about data yeah sorry the question was about data ownership in general Oh power gets data from utilities I'm mode what do we do with it do we have to share your SMS security and do we have to give it back and stuff like that so we have this is a again a huge issue at AU power because it's kind of central to everything we do what we're showing is the data science part but really everything that ou power does is centered around utility data energy usage data that comes from customers through the utility partners and there are huge privacy issues and legal issues and so every contract that we sign we have you know we have a huge legal team and a huge security team that we make sure we're compliant with and we have security on our site it is on our sides we are able to bring it into our data warehouse and then when if we lose a contract or if the contract ends we have a deletion policy where we'll delete it and you know we go through that process with so many utilities now that is kind of standard and they have trusted us and yeah yeah so the question is do different incentives or different messaging as we saw at the beginning different messaging will affect people in different ways have we looked at the breakdown by archetype the answer that is we strongly believe that there is something there and this is relatively new and we have a very strong UX and behavioural research science research team that we kind of want to work with to figure out is there gonna be different messaging and I think it has to be yes the people who are home during the day should be message to differently to accept to you know participate in different programs differently than people who are not home during the day or you know have different patterns of usage but that's still sort of in in research yeah the next time I want to let's get to the other talk so let's defer more questions till the end and we'll turn it over to Justine my slides okay cool so I'm going to be talking about some of our small medium business insights that we use to classify business types so we have two big products with small medium businesses like I mentioned at the beginning of the talk one of our first products at Opower were the Home Energy reports well for businesses we're doing the business energy report and here we have a lot of the similar modules as our original home energy report and we are comparing these companies to competitors so here we've got OSHA tie it's around the corner it's an Asian restaurant Thai food and we want to compare it to other Asian restaurants with similar hours in the similar local similar location because that is the best comparison so we need to know from the restaurant name what kind of business from the business name what kind of business segment is it so that we can actually compare it to restaurants we don't want to be comparing OSHA Thai to a Walgreens basically so that's one product and then the second is a lot of tips targeted tips based on the industry and the season so I have some examples here from some tips that we gave to a health care center for how it can use less energy in the wintertime by using less heat and so we want to target these companies or target these businesses based on their business type so that we can send them tips and we can compare them to similar businesses so the first project that I'm going to talk about is the business type prediction where the goal is to classify the business as in the business type so we have four hundred and ninety thousand businesses from D&B and those all have ground truth on their business type but so and that's a very small segment of the business population and that's why this is an important problem so on these unseen businesses will we be able to predict the actual business type there are ten business types and all listed here and the way that we approach this problem is we're going to treat the business name as a bag of words representation where we take the business name and then we actually break it down into a feature vector where a 1 in the vector indicates that that word is in the business name so we have a high dimensional sparse feature space and representing the word names the idea here is that businesses with similar words in their names are going to be within the similar business type we tried a lot of different algorithms on this just to see which one worked the best a lot of your main players SVM logistic regression we through naive Bayes in there cuz why not and and it did pretty well so this is the ROC curve for our logistic regression you can see the area under the curve is quite high even amongst all the classes we do very very well with religious organization organizations with a 99 percent or point 99 you can imagine that a lot of those religious organizations are going to have like Church in their name or synagogue or something along those lines and those are all going to be grouped properly and then overall here is how our the different classifiers did before this project we really really wanted to limit false the false positive rate we do not want to be comparing a restaurant to an office or something along those lines so the metric that we really cared about was this one versus all true positive rate at the 1% false positive rate and for this analysis the best one that we had was this random forest here and with 70% this is good enough to continue on and actually start using this and production lysing it part of me mm-hmm yes yes so we are doing the one verse all so predicting how if we can classify it versus all yeah any other questions about this the micro versus macro is a small distinction on the accuracy metrics basically the micro I'm going to say this on the micro is the is evaluated over all or is evaluated per class and then the macro is averaged over all yes it depends it's if the denominator changes whether it's like the number of classes or if it's the number of examples yeah we can talk about that afterwards we could okay and then the next the next big research project that we did for the small medium business insights was predicting their open closed hours so this is really important if we're going to be comparing these businesses to each other we don't want to compare a bar that closes at 11:00 to a bar that closes f-4 because they're gonna have very different energy usage when it makes sense for their use cases so the goal is to predict their open and close business hours we had a data set of 26,000 businesses with that both had a mi data and had ground truth in it I think you just leaned on the light back there thank you and so yes we need a mi data for this and we also need the open our ground truth we got that from factual we're using ami data here because we actually need to know what their usage is per hour that way we can figure out when they're not in business so here we have two business types one that is open during the day one that's open during the night it's pretty easy to tell that they are open at that time and if we could just eyeball all 26,000 of these it would be relatively easy to say okay this one open its open at that time this one's open at that time or closes at that time so we used a relatively straightforward algorithm we started at the the time the minimum average usage for that business in one day and then we took a step forward in a step backward until we reached a certain threshold so in this example it's 25% it was the threshold that we used and therefore we had the predicted open and predicted closed hours that you see there any questions on that algorithm it's just a simple walk so then here's two examples of day and night businesses that we predicted we have the x here of one we predicted them and then we also have this little waste usage here that's the yellow usage either when they're ramping up or ramping down this is a really great area for us to go in and send this company some tips saying hey you're using a lot of energy ramping up for the day or hey you're using a lot ramping down here are some ways that you could actually limit that and so here are the results we tried or we optimized the special percentage using the xnor accuracy what that means is we only said that it was a correct classification if we predicted closed and the actual business was closed or open and the actual business was open and we were able to get 75% accuracy using a threshold of 40 percent so that's 40 percent from your minimum to your maximum usage and over here this is the plot that we used to figure out that threshold because at point four our accuracy is the highest over our two metrics and you can see performance is relatively stable across the different threshold values and then I didn't have room on this slide but this algorithm steadily beats the baseline models of predicting always open or always closed so this does very well 75 percent accuracy means that we can go forth with this project any questions about small-medium business insights before passage mark yeah so the factual data is not available for everyone so that's the problem so we only have 26,000 actual open closed hours through factual there's a lot more companies than that and so we need to have a method like this where we can fill in all the gaps any other questions yes why 75% well that's the dream right but wheels well no I'm saying we were able to get 75% that yes yes well if it was 25% then we would not go forward with the project are you are you asking like was there a threshold that we needed to pass no that was not yes yes yeah exactly so there are a lot of issues when you start getting into like there are challenges when a business goes close during the afternoon say then this simple algorithm breaks down because we are only finding the one part where they're closed we're not looking for multiple closed times so even though it is the 40% that's in the minimum so for example this business right here it looks like it's closed two times a day right maybe between like zero and three and then also between 9 and 18 it looks like it could be closed twice but we're only predicting one open closed so our accuracy is gonna be much lower for this yeah they could be more interesting to sort of see I do have a confusion matrix and I didn't put it in the slides card-index probably raw yeah this if you don't have to cook anything yeah okay what was the name of that okay thank you okay interesting okay I'll take it in the back has you've been holding your hand up for a long time yeah yeah we promise we data scientists don't measure it yeah it definitely works I mean but at this point we've sent out a lot fewer of these business communications than we have for the regular home energy reports so it is kind of a sample size issue yes all right to mark there we go okay thank you my name is Mark like zero I am NOT a data scientist but I'm working with the data science team I'm an implementation engineer also like zero so what my project has been focused on electric vehicle detection so first off why do we want to detect electric vehicles well electric vehicles take a lot of energy and when people get home at night and just plug their car and after work they're putting a strain on the grid at a time that's very bad for the grid to be taking that strain because people are coming home turning on lights turning on radios TVs and whatnot so the utilities are very interested in trying to deflect that usage out too late to later hours overnight in particular so here's though so what they do is that they have electric vehicle rates that people can sign up for where let's see what you can see there where people pay a slightly higher rate during the day in order to get a deeper discount at night when they charge their car so obviously utilities are very interested in this data and finding out where EVs are and so not only to encourage those people individually to sign up for electric vehicle rates we've heard anywhere from a third only a third to half of customers are actually signed up for evie rates that have v's from the utilities but also to prepare sort of on a more global scale for increased locked vehicle adoption if there might be some need for additional transmission in certain areas if there's neighborhoods where people are buying lots of TVs or potentially to install charging stations so so what can we do well the easiest thing to do in the this sort of just a proof-of-concept kind of what we'll call the first pass attempt in our model is to just look at customers we have customer data for for one utility where they have customers on electric vehicle rates and we we have about 15,000 customers in that data set and then to balance that data set off with non-tv customers we just selected an equal number of customers that are on the standard rate for that utility and and just to make it so that it's somewhat coming from the same area we looked at the number of V's per city and then selected only from the top cities for our non-tv customers and as I said we're just going to for simplicity include only the electric vehicle rate data after they've signed up for the e V rate so as you could expect we're gonna see the effects of the pricing on the data so let's just take a look at all evey customers average hourly usage and compare that to Nani V customers so that's what we have here you can see that the electric vehicle rate for this utility kicks in at 11 o'clock and there's a huge signal there as people turn on their their cars to charge they probably have timers so that car so that the vehicle starts charging precisely at 11:00 and then over to over the night more and more cars get fully charged and the usage drops down but we see that very clear signal that is very distinct pattern from the average non TV user one thing you might notice is that not only is the shape very different for evey customers there's also a huge magnitude difference in the total usage and so that was somewhat surprising so what I looked at is just the distribution of total daily usage based on four V's and non V's one thing you'll see and this is due to the electric vehicle itself is that the peak is slightly shifted forward for the evey customers but more the reason that we're seeing this high jump an average is that there's this long tail and it keeps going on I didn't cut off the graph just for clarity of very very high users and that's just because I like people that own electric vehicles are rich and so they use a lot of energy they have big houses and so we're having a demographic shift in the e V versus non TV customers that's causing that that disconnect there and but it's important to note that that although you do have this long tail there are a lot of kV customers that have a total usage that is very comparable to non TV customers so you can't just use total you total daily usage as a signal of somebody to somebody that has an e V that would be I'm blanking on the way to say that correlation not a causation there we go so so that's one thing that we can do we can do a machine learning model and I'll show you the results of that when we're only using the electric vehicle data after they've signed up for their electric vehicle rate but that's kind of cheating because we already know that the price signals have shifted their usage out to us very specific time of day and we're gonna and we're gonna take advantage of that our loom machine learning model is gonna learn that and then we're gonna be able to predict people that have v's because they're signed up for an e V rate so it would be great if we had it sorry if we had a third party data source that said these people own TVs but are not on TV rates we didn't have that readily at hand so what we decided to do was to write that would be great bring it on what we decided to do is look at evey usage for customers before they signed up for their evey rate so the idea is that the assumption there is that people switch to their Eevee rate after they've purchased their Eevee and so they've started to charge their car but they're not paying attention to the time of data they're doing it because they have no reason to that's obviously an imperfect assumption a lot of people are know exactly when they're going to get their Eevee and then will sign up for their Eevee rate to just perfectly coincide with that and we'll always have that behavior so we're going to have some misidentified customers in that case but it's what we can it's the best we can do with the data that we have at the moment so what time period should we use for this sort of look look up window the time prior to when people sign up for an e V rate but are still hopefully still hopefully have an e V so I'll kind of step through forward in time for evey customers as we get closer and closer to their start date for the EB rate so if we look further far enough back and it's really not that far it's only just you know a month before in that in the sort of second month before they sign up we can see a very similar load profile for the EB customers as compared to the non EB customers again with that shift upward because of the total usage as we move forward in time we can start to see that their usage in the evening hours is increasing and also overnight and that we're starting to get this bump here and of course even if people are instant not incentivized to charge their car in the very in the very early evening you know at a very specific time they will still have charted their car charging overnight because it takes a while for a car to charge and they come home and they plug their car in so that's why we're still seeing this signal here it's just not quite as strong as we see it as we move forward in time so now in the turquoise here what you see is them just in the two weeks prior to when they sign up to their evey rate and we're starting to see not only are they charging their car at night but they're already starting to adopt that behavior of plugging their car in at 11 o'clock and then once it gets to the point where they're after they've signed up for the IV rate that signals much clearer yeah yes of course well more and more people are we have certain people we don't know that everybody you know as we move forward closer and closer to that EB rate that EB start date more and more of those customers are on have electric vehicles and so there the total usages is changing yeah so to kind of strike that balance between we think that the customers have an e V at this point versus they've already changed their behavior in anticipation of the e V rate we chose this kind of two week window here between 15 and 30 days prior to when they sign up and just as a sort of further verification what I'm showing here is just again that total daily usage histogram and you can see that the people that are that the distribution after they've signed up and the one in that 15 to 30 day windows has a reasonably similar shape so they're we're not getting we we have seen most of those customers switch over to have an Eevee is what that's telling us okay so we use the logistic regression model and we just looked at this average usage by our the ones the data that I've been showing you so far no additional features at least to start and then when we just looked at the sort of the sort of baseline accuracy where we just have a 50/50 percent threshold we see that our what we call the first pass where we're only using the data after their Eevee start date we get very good identification results almost you know 78% and then we certainly have a decrease but we're still getting a fairly decent match rate for the customers when we only are using that data prior to when they signed up and we can dig down a little bit further and look at our persistent recall curve and our ROC curve again we're certainly losing some precision as we as we have the sound experiment as compared to that first pass model but the if we start to say we want to have for example say an 80% precision we can get you know and close to a 60 percent recall for the sound experiment so that's certainly worth pursuing further and there's a possibility that again you know some of these customers that we're calling v's for in the sound experiment actually don't have an Eevee yet because they don't sign up for the Eevee until they actually have their car so that's that's all I have yes I see what it does because much less this is just very preliminary so we are not we haven't even look at this have this look at the rest of population where that provides we are just giving our we just wanted a very simple experiment it's not that great there's plenty more work when you do marketing to start this project you can look at time serious stuff he's just looking at overall average hourly there's a whole bunch of awesome we can do once we get good enough on just this very simple experiment that are looking at anecdotally I've noticed that numbers have solar PV I don't know I don't know the tariff interaction about whether they're eligible for this in particular this particular population that we haven't done any sort of cross analysis to see if they do have PV s but we have done that in the past and there is a definite correlation between customers that yeah it that is statistically significant yeah so for the bar graph I'm this is the oh sorry that one no sorry the non-tv customers have less usage that's the total daily usage the peak is lower and that's the more usage sorry yeah sound experiment was just kind of the word we use to just talk about the the data set where we just took that data prior to their electric vehicle start date the electric vehicle rates start date and so that was just kind of how we were referring to the two so are you taking this but then once you get more data are using yes so during what we found you is research so these are some recent projects where we are simplicity during the research phase one just enjoyed the beginning once we're ready to replace I'm ready production-wise it goes into production and he is basically retraining all of our models on whatever cadence makes sense of something that's monthly or like something that's based on building yes once a super-eruption we are generally would be wanting these things to take advantage of I mean so it hasn't been just steam has an interesting story so actually one of Oracle's recent acquires what's data raker they actually do the exact that exact analysis to figure out who's got a toddler who doesn't and they have a bunch of security problems basically from people they are uncomfortable that your like what they're in that crowd by the way if you want to so generally if you get solar you have to tell your utility and you get on some sort of great solar rate and we to our utility partners we get all that information let's we get great information for if you get all sorts of stuff including use of energy usage rate information and sometimes demographics some other stuff so that unlike the Eevee where basically you may or may not be on electric vehicle rate if you have knowledge of vehicle I think for solar is pretty much across the board you're gonna have to deal with utility in some way and so they know that information and they pass that along right right yeah so basically if you have solar your utility generally knows about it
