 I think that many people are actually using machine learning already in their everyday lives and may not realize it so for example when you're engaging with the internet you're actually revealing your preferences and your likes and your dislikes and those are being picked up by for example the cookies that are coming on to your computer and they will adapt to your behavior and hope hopefully help you in your progress through through the internet navigation as well if you're trying to find the shortest path between two places that is already using machine learning I think one of the interesting things people are going to be engaging with with machine learning in the near future is health and we're already seeing for example Watson who was originally designed to win the game of Jeopardy your game show but actually now Watson is being used for for health so for example it's looking at scans of body data trying to understand perhaps symptoms of cancer already and an interesting new project looking at why Italians live so long machine learning and human learning are actually quite similar machine learning is about an algorithm or a computer actually engaging with its environment with data and adapting according to the things that it learns it finds that the program fails to make the right predictions and it will rebalance itself in some sense in order to make better predictions next time now I think that's very similar to the way that a human learns a human is actually engaging with its environment and learning from it its failure so machine learning has an aspect of kind of an evolutionary aspect to it which i think is quite new to this area of artificial intelligence people might have heard of AI artificial intelligence I think more people have heard of that maybe than machine learning actually the survey that we did only nine percent of the people that we surveyed actually knew this term machine learning so artificial intelligence actually its original goal was Touring's alan turing's aim to to somehow make a machine have the sort of intelligence that a human might have in particular could you program a computer actually to convince you that it is human if you chatted with it but I think artificial intelligence has evolved since then and actually we're interested in what sort of intelligence a machine a unique sort of intelligence a machine might have but machine learning has a slightly different quality to Anam as perhaps a more specific part of artificial intelligence which is the idea that the program is going to change and evolve in cool according to its interaction so actually by the end the programmer might not know actually how the program is actually written because it has been changing as it's been interacting so there might be you know might be able to look inside see the actual program but not know why necessarily it's decided to to wait its decisions in that particular way so I think there's certainly a lot of connections between artificial intelligence and machine learning the interesting thing about artificial intelligence it's really captured I think the public imagination through film because there have been so many interesting examples of films an ex machina for example and actually I think this has done the whole community a disservice because people are rather freaked out frankly by you know the Pat the terminator sort of story are these things going to take over so that is partly what this whole investigation by the Royal Society is about you know are there things that we should be frightened of or actually are these things which are going to be very powerful for us and we shouldn't be sort of freaked out by all the things we see when we go to the cinema I think machine learning has become such a big deal because of big data we now have access to so much more data that a machine can interact with and so I think the sort of problems where machine learning is going to make great progresses is where it can actually be exposed to a lot of data so one of the big challenges for artificial intelligence was always computer vision and that was one of the things that humans do incredibly well to look at a picture and interpret it and computers found very difficult and it was partly because we were trying to program the thing from the bottom upwards but now we can expose an algorithm to many pictures and it can learn as it's going along so I think that there's sort of the ability for a machine actually to to view its environment and interpret it and read it is one of the places where there'll be a lot of progress but frankly wherever there's data the machine learning will be we will be successful so for example recommendations on the internet navigation you know every time we drive we're giving the Machine new information and that's being used to adapt and change health as well that would be one of the big growth places because a computer can actually read so much data in one go whilst you know a human doctor may not be able to keep track of the or all the the great progress that is happening I think it's really important that the rural society has got this project looking into the impact that machine learning will have on society in the future at the moment only nine percent of people that we surveyed actually know what machine learning is or even heard of it but that is going to change in the near future and I think it's important that society understand the potential of this tool and maybe also address the fears that they will have you know that already films are beginning to fuel those fears and so are they real fears or are they just things invented by Hollywood so I think it's all about transparency we need to tell society what the potential of these things are where it can go and so it's about looking into the future and trying to make some predictions about what might be out there
