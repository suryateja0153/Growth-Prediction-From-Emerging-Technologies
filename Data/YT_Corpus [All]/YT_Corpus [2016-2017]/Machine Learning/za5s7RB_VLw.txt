 what is going on everybody and welcome to the sixth machine learning tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be talking about pickling a little bit about scaling and then we're going to move on into diving into the inner workings of linear regression and of course the other algorithms so pickling really doesn't really have anything to do with regression just simply is a good a good thing to have it at your disposal so you can save yourself a lot of time so first of all what is pickle pickle is just serialization of any Python object so this could be a dictionary or in our case it could be a classifier or a whole host of other things so first of all what we're going to do is we're going to import not in caps we're going to import pickled okay also I noticed oh yeah here for some reason I was like double defining why is the label thing my mortality is showing anyway um yeah just get rid of that if you did that hopefully nobody followed me into that mistake but anyway uh yeah so there's that now what we're going to do is the way the pickle works is like like a file right you open it you save it right and then when you want to use it you open it you read it so we're going to come down basically you know at what point would you want to save the classifier right so like thinking logically when should we save the classifier well should we just say we save it here probably not right I mean you could you could save that classifier but that's an untrained classifier so you're probably gonna save it here right so like what is the purpose of saving a classifier it's to avoid doing the training step because that's a very tedious step right that that's what's going to take the most time in our case it doesn't really take that long because we don't have that much data and we were threading it but you can imagine if you had gigabytes and gigabytes or even terabytes of data that you were doing this on every time you wanted to make a prediction you would not want to have to retrain an algorithm so instead you can save it now of course if you save it you know you might want to retrain it like once a month or something like this but you don't have to retrain it every time you want to use it so what we're going to say here is we're going to say with open and we're going to say a linear regression dot pickle as WB as f so we're going to open this file with the intention to write and we're going to just use temporary variable as F and then we're gonna say pickle dot dum what are we dumping we're going to dump that trained classifier so CLF where are we dumping it F so that dumps the classifier and then to use the classifier all you would actually do is you would say like something like pickle in equals open and then we would open this file open with our B and then we would say CL f equals pickle pickle dot load and we're just going to load pickle in so flips hello what did I do here you a copy this paste okay so now let's go ahead and just run this and see how we do okay so everything works at this point and whether or not you recognize the fact we have actually renamed classifier or redefined classifier here so now what would happen if we did this right now there is no definition of classifier we're not saving it as a pickle we're simply reading a pickle so if i refresh has to reload this what we get is there we go so you get this information here and the pickle is saved in the directory we're working in so that would be if I could find it here open it up right there's your pickle data so in our case the pickle data or the classifier is actually a really really small classifier that's not big model but anyway we save ourselves the time of actually training that classifier also I said it in the introduction video but I'll say it again remember that we live in a time where you can spin up a server for a very short amount of time and you could do that so if you have like a slower computer maybe you're only computer is a relatively slow laptop you've got a I don't know one of these little netbooks or something if you are one of those people you can spin up a GPU cluster you can just spin up a regular server you can spend a very powerful computer and basically rent it for a few dollars an hour on Linode digitalocean or Amazon Web Services and if you do that what you can do is generally what I do if I'm going to use a big server well pretty much all these hosts work the same way you take your data you put it on their server and like you'll set everything up so you'll you'll transfer all your data there you'll set up all the code that you want to run in all that and while you're doing that you're using like the smallest version they have so you're paying like a half a penny an hour to rent that version of a server and once you're ready scale that server up and then you're paying maybe a few dollars an hour maybe even ten dollars an hour if you're crazy scale it up run your operation take your classifier save it to a pickle take your classifier scale back down the server destroy the server or whatever and you're done so just a couple of quick you know pointers because we're not really going to be talking much about that for scale for a while but these algorithms actually you can scale linear regression very well so just keep that in mind so anyways that's really all I have to say about pickling and scaling and now what we're going to actually be doing is writing our own linear regression algorithm to learn how that actually works and all that so very exciting stuff if you have questions comments concerns whatever leaving below otherwise as always thanks for watching thanks for all the support subscriptions and until next time
