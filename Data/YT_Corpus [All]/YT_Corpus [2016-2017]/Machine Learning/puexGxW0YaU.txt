 machine learning in business processes I'd like to add my perspective to a good Harvard Business Review article that's titled companies are reimagining business processes with algorithms I'm excited because it brings together two of my favorite and powerful disciplines business modeling and machine learning modeling the business processes gave us a mechanism to understand how things get done in an organization once we understood how things worked we were able to change those things so they worked better process modeling gave us a notation this notation has three main things boxes that capture the activities that happen lines that indicate the flow of control and decision diamonds to capture the various conditions for branching let's say you're an insurance agent and a customer comes in for an auto quote you'd first gather some information about the customer such as its date of birth address etc and validate that information then you'd gather information about the car such as ear make and model and based on all this you determine the type of insurance to offer him the quote is computed based on a proprietary rating model this rating model would have been painstakingly constructed by understanding different customer segments and using information such as age income location crime rate location cost of living make and model of the car and a whole slew of other factors then the market place became more dynamic and companies needed to quickly adapt and be able to change their processes so they replace these static decision diamonds with rules unlike code changes rules provided an easier way to control the process flow then re-engineering happened and the point of that was to get rid of some process steps altogether or to automate them so that they can happen more efficiently the implementation of reengineering was not done particularly well so we ended up with other problems but the concepts of process simplification still held true in today's environment activities in a process do not necessarily follow fixed sequences and should also be driven by rules so we can get rid of directional flow and model the desired flexibility with rules this has not happened widely yet and many companies are still struggling with inflexible processes while rules are easy to change they're also difficult to maintain by humans especially if they become large we're beginning to replace those human generated rules by machine generated ones this is done by machines that learn these rules automatically from data the advantage of machine generated rules is that it can quickly adapt to changing business environments how does machine learning work let's continue with our Insurance example say we have lots of information about existing customers that include their personal information where they live what type of car they own and how much premium they're paying the insurance premium is a function of all those factors if you feed this data into a machine it could identify patterns in that data and build internal models to represent those patterns then given a new customer it could use its internal representation to compute the premium for that customer as the demographics of the customers change the machine can update its representation to adapt in this example machines can replace both the rating model and the rules that drive the processes and automatically adapt to changes in the environment in the future machine learning will play a critical role in how businesses work
