 my name is Connor Jensen I am the analytics program director and interim lead data scientist for Zurich North America our insurance products cover companies in over 200 countries around the world the analytics is an enormous deal for what we do the cost of goods sold for our products is an unknown we don't know what the risk that our customers is actually going to face our it's all statistics and probability there's a little bit of an arms race in the insurance industry and and there really is around data and analytics and who can use that the best so investing in predictive analytics was really a key strategic initiative for our organization because we realized that the ability to do work and more advanced analytics across the data is going to be the differentiator for insurance companies going forward in the next couple of decades two to three years ago we were doing centrally a strategy project to talk about what is the most important investments for us as a global organization going through the rest of this decade and the investment in advanced analytics was you know one of the key investments that we decided to make we're trying to move to using more and more of the data which as data scales with new devices and new sources of data going the ability to scale the analytics across those larger volumes of data is incredibly important so when we were looking at building out our platforms we really wanted to look for things that could do that distributed learning that could do the or the in-memory processing we need to be able to do those to be able to grow with the data as we are having more and more of it come in so the ability to bring in new sources of data and new features to test against to figure out what the predictors of risk are is immensely important we've been doing analytics for a long time using the traditional enterprise analytics platforms or there's a handful of them out there and those aren't moving as quickly as the field is anymore and so being in open source is really really important to us because we wanted to be able to move at the speed of the fastest part of the market that was absolutely a huge part of our decision-making we didn't want to be captive to just one tool set that the provider decided to give to us we wanted the flexibility to be able to mix and match different types of tools because there's not always one tool that is the perfect tool for every solution so we want it to be more flexible and as we were going open-source we wanted open-source products that fit with our and Python and those things that are moving out there so when we're going to that end user to implement the models and to give that out to them we need to be able to tell the story with the data it's not just here as the end result model and so having tools like h2o flow that would give you here's the story of here's where the data came from here's what we're seeing from a visualization perspective that helps build confidence in the models and helps the end users understand how to use them the chance to use open source really allows you to take a gamble and take bets on new technology without having to go all-in if you're wrong and it's not the right product you haven't lost as much and it allows you to be a lot more nibbles you can try something new try it out see how it works and then if it works and scale it and use it across your organization if it doesn't work you can move on to the next one in a completely different way that doesn't require the same amount of infrastructure investment and time and energy on training that used to happen as we were building out our team and growing the analytics function it was actually a big deal from a recruiting perspective the data science community is moving and changing so quickly and the shortage of data scientists is out there it was really important to be able to have an environment that would attract the right candidates and the right talent to come into our organization I have a dedicated team within my group that manages our interactions with the rest of the business they are unconstant communication with the presidents of our business units and with the c-suite to make sure that what we're doing is actually solving a need of the business faces or problems that the business business is facing because we have to be generating value
