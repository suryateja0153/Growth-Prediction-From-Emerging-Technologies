 breaking the wall to mind machines how deep learning can give birth to general artificial intelligence Dennis casabas google deepmind london on the 9th of november 1989 i was 13 and remember watching it live on TV so i'm going to talk about artificial intelligence specifically what we call a deep mind general artificial intelligence so AI is basically the science of making machines smart and I started my journey toward some AI with games specifically board games including chess so I started to play chess when I was four years old and Captain various England junior teams and that got me on the path to thinking about thinking how is it that our minds can come up with these moves and and win these games of chess so for a very young age I was puzzling over these things and then when I learnt term how to program and got into computers as I got older my love of games and computers naturally combined into designing and making video games so I did this from my teenage years for about a decade and I wrote many sort of number one best-selling games including theme park probably my most well-known game now all the games i wrote had AI as a core gameplay component so for example in theme park the idea of the game was that you designed your own disney world and then thousands of little people came in to your theme park and decided on whether you designed it well and how much they enjoyed it and because the AI was powering the simulation underneath the game that meant that every player playing the game had a unique experience so no two games were the same because the game with the AI adapted to the way that the player played the game then after a decade of working on computer games I'd decided to go back to academia and study neuroscience for my PhD and really this was the final part of the puzzle for me in terms of launching an effort to solve a I I specifically looked at areas in neuroscience like imagination and memory where we are very bad at understanding how that worked in machine learning in AI so I wanted to gain inspiration from how the brain sold some of these hard problems of intelligence to come up with new inspirations for new types of algorithms that we could implement so all these experiences culminated then in 2010 in me co-founding d mind and you can think of deep mind as a Apollo program effort if you like for neuroscience and spy day I when we've done is collect together well over a hundred of the world's best research scientist in this area and put them all together with a whole bunch of very brilliant engineers to try and make as fast advances towards AI as possible so while we're experimenting on artificial intelligence technologies were also experimenting actually with our organization and a new way to do research and science now mission the way we articulated is to try and solve intelligence and then use that technology to make the world a better place and I'm going to talk a little bit at the end about the different ways that I think AI is going to impact the future so how are we going to do this well our sort of more prosaic mission is to try and build the world's first general-purpose learning machine and the two key words here with stress are learning in general so all the algorithms that we're interested in building at deepmind learn automatically from raw experience they're not pre-programmed or handcrafted in any way they learn directly from the raw data and they're also general in the sense that a single set of algorithms or single system can operate out of the box across a wide range of tasks and of course we have an example of such a system it's the human mind but most AI that we see around us a day AI is now a huge sort of buzz word very fashionable but actually most AI around us is not of this kind I'm usually the AI thoughts on pull out for our phones or cars or even for various internet and games things are actually usually bespoke pieces of software that have been handcrafted for one particular task they don't learn or adapt and they're not flexible so we call the type of AI we work on artificial general intelligence to distinguish it from this normal type of AI and I think the difference between general AI and narrow AI becomes very clear when we look at one of the most famous watershed moments in AI research so back in the late 90s ibm's deep blue be Garry Kasparov very famously at chess now the thing was of course this was a very impressive technological feat but actually I came away from that match much more impressed by Garry Kasparov mind than the machine itself because of course deep blue whilst it was amazing at chess can't do anything else whereas gallery of course can speak multiple languages drive cars and all these other things with his mind as well as play chess and I think you can see that in some sense deep blue is not intelligent in the way we would normally regard intelligence because for example deep blue can't even play as much simpler game like tic-tac-toe which is strictly simpler than chess nothing in its programming or its knowledge base would help it play that much simpler game even though it was obviously world champion level at chess it would have to be reprogrammed from the scratch so in some sense this shows there's a bit of a tie toccata me here in terms of what is intelligence so instead of that we view intelligence in the in the framework of what's called reinforcement learning I'm just going to quickly outline that view in with this diagram so the left hand side here we have the agent system and the agent system finds itself in some sort of environment and its trying to achieve a goal in that environment now that environment could be real world or it could be virtual if it's real the agent is likely to be a robot if it's a virtual environment it's likely to be an avatar and the agent interacts with the environment in two ways one is that it gets noisy incomplete observations through its sensory apparatus we normally use vision but we could use other modalities and the job of the agent system is twofold one is to make the best possible model of the environment out there based on these noisy observations and update that in real time and then use that model as a prediction engine to decide what action it should take now that will best get it towards its goal now although this diagram is quite simple it hides a lot of complexity but if we could solve everything behind this diagram we know that would be sufficient for general intelligence and we know that because biological systems including all mammals and humans use some form of reinforcement learning to to learn in the human brain it's the dopamine system that implements a type of reinforcement learning so I'm just going to show you a couple of videos of the system at work but before I do I want to make sure you're clear on what it is you're going to see the second thing we believe in other than reinforcer learning is that a true thinking machine has to be embedded in a sensory motor stream has to be embedded in a sensory motor reality but we use actually games as a testing platform for developing our AR algorithms and if we think it's a kind of perfect platform for that because for many reasons one is as unlimited training data of course you can run these games for as long as you like there's no testing bias because they've been designed by other people not the AI creators you can test millions of agents in parallel and progress is very easy to measure because most games have game scores so what we did was started off with classic 8-bit Atari games from the 80s and here the AI system just gets war pixels as inputs and the goal is to maximize the score and everything else has learned from scratch directly from the pixels on the screen knows nothing else about the game what it's controlling or what it's supposed to be doing and then we have this idea of generality so a single system to play all the different games so normally I'll show you lots of videos here but I only got time to show one but I think it's particularly appropriate for falling walls because actually this game breakout is about breaking down walls so so here the AI controls the pink bat and ball at the bottom of the screen and it's trying to break through this rainbow colored brick wall brick by brick so i'm going to show you the agent getting better progressively over the games at play so this is after hundred games so not very many games and you can see that the the the agent is mostly you know it's not very good yet it's missing the ball but it's starting to get the hang of the idea they should move the back towards the ball now after three hundred games the the agents now about as good as any human can play this so it almost always gets the ball back so we thought this is pretty good but web as if we left it playing for another couple of hundred games and then an unexpected thing happened basically the system discovered the optimal strategy was to dig a hole round the sort of left hand side here and tunnel round to the back of the the wall and send the ball round the back so the funny thing about that was is lastly optimal strategy but although the researchers on that who created that amazing machine learning researchers they're not very good at playing Atari so they actually learnt something from the program they created a better strategy so if you sit in this work this was in the front cover of nature backer earlier this year so you can read the details in there and now we're moving on to 3d games games ago and robot simulations and further in the next few years so here's just a quick video of now a 3d game here the the same system you saw playing the Atari game is now learning to drive a racing car around the track just again just from the pixels only so it has not been told anything about driving or what it's controlling you can see it's driving quite happily as sort of 200 kilometers an hour around the racetrack so now we're moving on to all sorts of new areas neress and they're all inspired and we look to systems neuroscience for clues as to how the brain actually solves these problems so memory attention concepts planning navigation and even things like imagination and as we're here at falling walls I was thinking about our work what sorts of walls does it bring down I think there are at least three actually so firstly i think in science the biggest advances in the future the next few decades are going to come from combining two different fields together a very deep level obviously for us a deep mind we're doing that with by synthesizing machine learning with systems neuroscience the other thing that we do at deep mind is try to blend the best from to talk sorts of cultural organizer asians so so one is take the best form startups the energy and buds that they have and focus and blend it with what's best from academia the long-term thinking and collaborate collaborative nature of academia and try and bring this together to create a new environment that makes scientific research more efficient and more productive and enhancers collaboration and cooperation and then finally I think the third wall we're bringing down is really in the applications of what we're doing with AI and what other people are doing with AI applying it to many many industries where there's a lot of data and I'm especially excited about healthcare in that regard so finally I want to end by thinking about the bigger picture why do I think AI is so important why have I spent my whole career working on it well I think there are two big issues facing us a society today one is information overload we're just deadly used as individuals but also a scientists and business people by the amount of data that's in coming in to us every day and you can see that everywhere from genomics to entertainment and so on now personalization technologies are one way to try and deal with that but they don't work very well because generally speaking they're based on technologies like collaborative filtering which is really about averaging the wisdom of the crowds it's not about tailing it to the individual and the second thing is systems complexity all the all the big systems we would like to master a society climate disease energy macroeconomics even particle physics and now getting so complex even the greatest team of human scientists are finding it difficult to master and comprehend these systems unaided so I think solving intelligence and solving a is potentially a kind of meta solution to all these other problems if we can solve a I we can use it to help a i cyan't it you know help sign human scientists work side by side in complementary way to help them make bigger breakthroughs so I dream about using this kind of general AI to create make a I assisted science possible but of course with as with all powerful to detect technologies and AI is no difference in this regard it must be used ethically and responsibly and deployed responsibly and even though human level AGI is decades away we should start the debate on this now and indeed we're supporting that with various academic institutes and conferences to just to talk about the technical and ethical issues behind this type of technology and there's a neuro scientist and us working on neuroscience by day I I'm very excited about the idea that this journey that we're on trying to distill intelligence into a better understanding of the mysteries of the human mind and comparing that to the human mind will allow us to better understand the deep mysteries of our cells including things like perhaps dreaming creativity and maybe even consciousness thanks
