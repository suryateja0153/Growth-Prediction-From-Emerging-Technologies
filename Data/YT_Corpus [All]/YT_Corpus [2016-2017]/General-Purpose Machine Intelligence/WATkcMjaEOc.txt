 what computer just still has to teach us the game that will not go abstract computer just started as a promising domain of research in artificial intelligence AI more than five decades ago the basic idea was that as a thinking sport it would be a good challenge toward better understanding and potentially simulating human cognition in machines unfortunately it was soon discovered that computers could be made to play chess and certain other games like it using computational methods quite different from how humans are thought to think this spawned a competitive computer just gaming industry and in 1997 the World Chess Champion was defeated by an IBM supercomputer since then computer chess has seen further improvement with programs playing at the strong Grandmaster level even on desktop machines in the field of AI attention has therefore shifted to even more complex games like go in the hope that computational approaches toward them will succeed where chess had apparently failed in this paper I challenge that contention I have reasons to believe that just still have some things to teach us not only about computation and its limits but also about the human mind and how it probably works as such this is not a technical paper but rather one on computational philosophy introduction computer chess can often be traced to Claude Shannon's seminal paper on programming a computer for playing chess in it he describes precisely that but in what by today's standard of computer chess might be considered fundamental though somewhat rudimentary terms Alan Turing is also sometimes credited in this regard given a paper of his in which he proposes a chess-playing program a notable difference between the two papers that might be of interest to just play this is the slightly different Palme unit values attributed to the Queen Brooke Bishop Knight and porn in Turing's case it was ten 53.5 three in one where is Shannon had suggested 95 3 three and one the relative values of the pieces even considering earlier endgame analysis were in the light of scientific analysis over the years have not varied from these by much generally the values applied by Shannon are still the most widely used today early chess programs appeared soon after the work by Shannon and Turing two people also famous for other things in engineering and computer science such as information theory and computability respectively initial success in computer chess was modest for example the program's ostrich in just 3.0 in the 70s played at the 1400 ello point level but by the mid-1990s computers could play at the Grand Master 2500 plus point level this was due not only to increase processing power but also improved computational approaches getting a computer to play good chess is basically about having a good compromise between search and knowledge the number of possible legal positions inches is quite large estimated to be around 10 to the power of 46 it is therefore impossible for contemporary computers to search and examine every position or node and solve the game as in tic-tac-toe and relatively recently though in this case not by actually examining every position checkers which has about five times 10 to the power of 20 possible positions this means that a computer can only look so far ahead ie the depth of the search into the game tree but they having to decide which move to make one method of doing this is using the traditional minimax algorithm this is where knowledge what game playing heuristics come in game playing heuristics can be described as formalization zuv general good practices of play such as do not let your pieces be captured and control more space on the board they can usually be represented in the form of evaluation functions that for example in a given position calculate the amount of material such as piece value on the board or the mobility of the pieces such as a number of squares they control in reality heuristics today are far more sophisticated than these in principle a good combination of heuristics coupled with effective searching that includes clever techniques for skipping unlikely moves and pruning the game tree along with some well-developed opening series gives computers the remarkable ability to play the game very well so well that in 1997 but then well chess champion garry kasparov was defeated by IBM supercomputer deep blue in the six-game match by a score of 2.5 to 3.5 this was actually a rematch since in the previous year Kasparov had defeated if all 22 even though the computer won the first game making it the first computer to beat the reigning World Chess Champion even then deep blue was able to evaluate around 200 million positions per second many orders of magnitude more than any human is conscious of evaluating during Game two of the 1997 march Kasparov was amazed but trouble to tell human like some of the computers moves were interestingly Caspar of himself attributed his defeat in the match not too deep blues calculating ability but its ability to evaluate the deep blue team agreed but Kasparov still had some difficulties accepting this if that is the case he said then they have to explain it to the rest of the world tell us how you accomplished it because it's far beyond anyone's understanding I met something I couldn't explain people turn to religion to explain things like that I have to imagine human interference or I want to see an explanation since then there have been other just programs to have also made curious moves jr. for example currently in its 10th edition significantly factors in positional evaluation one of the best examples of this was the bishops sacrificed by at the time junior 9 on the h 2 square in move town of Game five of the Kasparov d jr match in 2003 the game and the match ended in a draw see figure 1 in 2006 within world chess champion vladimir kramnik lost two to four against the computer program deep fritz this program ran on a computer containing two intel core 2 duo cpu allowing it to calculate around eight million positions per second modern chess programs are therefore arguably becoming more efficient and effective intelligent if you will Monte newborn professor of computer science at McGill University in Montreal said a future man machine matches that the science is done and while acknowledging that the development of just computers had been useful suggested poker and goes as future research directions this is where I would partially disagree gained intelligence to other computationally challenging games such as go in terms of its complexity for example the number of possible positions and poker in terms of its imperfect information ie there is concealed information unlike in chairs are often seen as the logical next step after chess however is this really the main direction in which we in AI should now be heading with regard to games like these the general direction of a sir in a field cannot be ignored because it influences what is considered important work if we have learned anything from chess checkers and the like is that being able to program a computer to play complex games is apparently not going to contribute the kind of knowledge and understanding about the human thinking process that we hope to attain even less so any more insight into the nature of human consciousness this is what appears to be the real question if not for a iris such as then philosophers or near our scientists if a machine can think as in playing chess go poker is it conscious of doing so few people will concede that a machine that can do these things even if better than the best human players is actually conscious so why are many in a are actively pursuing more complex games this is because aside from the challenge and thrill of developing a computer program that is more intelligent than you are in some respect doing so often leads to the development of technologies that can also be of use in other areas within and outside of a I for example investigations into chess for example the use of iterative deepening depth-first search have made contributions to automate its theorem proving ie using a computer program to prove mathematical theorems and also in solving state space search problems research into chess has also had an influence on molecular computing computer music composition machine reading cognitive development in the treatment of psychiatric illness research into other games like going poker could therefore likely make similar contributions it is interesting for example el monte carlo simulations use thereof had promising results the basic idea is about quickly playing through and examining the outcome of randomly generated games from a particular point and selecting the move or action that most often resulted favorably a statistical sampling approach once again not very intelligent but it works returning to the question of the science of chess being done it would appear that a similar level of achievement in more complex games would likely result in the same thing proforce methods will probably also be among the most effective there this is the first reason why I would say that if games are to provide the kind of revolutionary insight into human intelligence that we are hoping to find we should be able to find it in chess where there is already a strong body of literature technical or otherwise without expending more effort into conquering more complex games using the same or analogous techniques however I would not go so far as to say that the key to intelligence should also be found in say checkers and tic tac Tom the game of chess while in some way similar to them is also in significant ways different for example there are more pieces and peace types which provide greater opportunity for creativity in play greater to an extent that matters of course go for example has only one piece type at an estimated 10 to the power of 170 possible legal positions this makes it far more complex than chess but its strategic complexity does not necessarily imply higher levels of creativity take for example the following just ending composition see figure 2 in those days IE 1927 it would have been quite a feat of imagination to see the following just computer programs today would be able to see the solution from the position in figure to within a matter of seconds by analyzing millions of positions in the resulting game tree very quickly subsequently players today would benefit and quickly learn to recognize the pattern in their games therefore a true test of intelligence for a computer would be the ability to arrive at the solution perhaps only a handful of human players could at first glance by looking at only a few positions for example 20 or 30 and creatively imagining the possibilities imagine the potential in combining this kind of computer creativity with a vast computational power at our disposal even today the second reason is the well-established aesthetic aspect of chess as a game that is developed significantly beyond other zero-sum perfect information games people appreciate beauty interest to a level and extent that is arguably equivalent to other art forms aesthetic recognition by a computer may not quite equal aesthetic appreciation but it breaks new ground AI why's that other games are not yet ready for other art forms for example music and art on the other hand do not possess the computational amenability that chest us the reason I say even possible aesthetic recognition is more advanced than playing ability is because it takes us from their raw intelligence and encroaches into the arena of human feelings our ability to recognize or identify beauties in itself often seen as a mysterious quality of conscious beings something that separates us from animals and especially lifeless machines there is a particular kind of Romanticism two chairs not to be confused with a brash style of play in the 19th century that we do not typically attribute to other games this is evident both in history and in pop culture something that sets it apart from games like that gammon checkers poker & Co I am NOT ironically alluding to something mysterious here but I'm trying to make the point that just has evolved in a way that makes it the de facto intelligent board game it was played mainly by aristocracy even until around the 19th century the painting the chess game by Francesco pedda circa 1880 presents a fitting artistic depiction there are likely more books written on choosing books on all other games board or otherwise combined more than this chess unlike other games like it has also been elevated on many occasions in literature and art even worthy of the attention of among the highest supernatural powers Friedrich Moritz August risks dice pila 1831 is a well-known painting on this theme weatherman is playing for his soul against Satan or for temporary reprieve against death just seems at least in the minds of the artistic to offer the most worthy and fair challenge it is no wonder then that Garry Kasparov himself reportedly described deep blue as playing like a court in some situations such an idea possibly stems from the apparent fact that even an all-knowing God would at best be only able to match a computer that could play the game perfectly chess is also known for its many relatively unexplored variants by some estimates there are more than 1,000 spanning from the games obscure origins thousands of years ago into modern variants a good example of the latter is Trudy chess which has been featured prominently in the Star Trek television series since the 60s all of this fiction as it were nonetheless as an influence on those who would judge machines and their intelligence more effective I think than a computer that is one day able to play go on the level of or better than the best human players using sophisticated computational techniques and serious computing power would be a computer that could play strong chess in a way that simply did not require much computing power and also did not appear computational or appeared less computational even upon close inspection an example of the technique that does not appear very computational is the artificial neural network or a and n for short unfortunately these have not been the most successful in chess if the technique is fuzzy enough humans will likely be more willing to accept it as genuine given our own approaches to such games than a clear and precise computational technique I am NOT suggesting that we opt for the more mysterious approach even if we had two equally effective ones to choose from rather that the real challenge lies in convincing humans and not in finding the most challenging game our brains did not evolve to play chess or games like it but we can learn to do so however difficult it is or port it we turn out to be whereas computers are usually programmed to do specific things and to do them as effectively and efficiently as possible the third reason why I think we need not look any further than just is therefore the disillusionment of intelligence questions about intelligence today have slowly but surely become conflated with questions about consciousness a machine that is able to accomplish any task ordinarily requiring human level intelligence today is seen as nothing spectacular as it may have been 50 years ago unless it can also be demonstrated that the Machine knows it is doing so or is aware of itself as we self-evident be are a kind elf we will know it when we see it criterion I would not dismiss this out of hand even though it tends to fall short of the scientific standard who is to say that an objective criterion here is impossible the problem is that such a great Irion is tricky the fact that we do not yet know exactly what makes a stick ie awareness free will etc qualifies as an excuse for humans does not mean it also qualifies for machines of course we cannot have a machine that does something intelligent without anyone being able to explain how it works though computers have lost this challenge before it even begins no computer poker or computer go champion is likely to change this humans should therefore abstain from benchmarking machines against themselves because it is simply holding machines back one of the most valuable lessons the computer chess has already taught us is that there can be an alternative and possibly even more effective way than humans know of performing a task that requires reasoning and intelligence we have already on this battle in AI all that remains is to demonstrate how a computer can simulate consciousness as well and where better than in the zero-sum perfect information game of chess where it is already mastered intelligence this is why a viable option as opposed to starting over with other games if it was thought that it would help in this regard is pursuing other facets of chess for example creativity aesthetics and looking for alternative computational techniques for it that work just as well yet benefit from a kind of machine self-reflection a will to do something if you will it is difficult to argue i simulated consciousness or any other kind of revolutionary a i should work in a game like go or poker but not in chess learning from chess chess was once used as a tool for military strategy the national defense arena today has changed somewhat but there are still significant things we can learn from this game here i will not focus on the benefits we have already obtained from computer chess but elaborate on what it still has to teach us as mentioned in the previous section there are reasons why exploring just further rather than other similar games is still a viable option today however what have we overlooked with regard to jizz in the quest to beat the world champion now that we have succeeded one thing is simply the ability to formulate a plan in the game like a human usually doesn preferably in a way that a human is thought to do the uncanny ability to see beyond a certain depth or a series of forced exchanges into what might or is likely to occur at a much later stage not only is this a challenge for computers many of which I've apparently failed using this approach but also for humans it takes a long time if ever for an amateur player to hone this all important skill as the saying in just goes it is better to have a bad plan on no plan at all learning per se does not appear to be the primary issue there are many machine learning approaches the real question apparently is the ability to imagine or dream if you will of what might be this is also what separates humans from most animals machines similar to animals in this respect lack the ability to recall specific past events episodic memory or to plan for the future perhaps more precisely the lack being self-evident ly conscious as we are of doing so this is why the kind of conscious and deep planning that is typically required by humans in jess's a good test for a lifelike machine but good a machine plan without on any visible level being programmed even using genetic programming techniques to do so this is the real challenge in a I today interest is as good a domain for this as any I do believe that whatever it is that humans are doing in their head when they play the game can be replicated in a machine currently we have settled for a satisfactory alternative approach ie certain knowledge but it is not quite the one we were looking for we need to look deeper not elsewhere as mentioned in the previous section chess is also appreciated aesthetically just compositions for example have been described as it's poetry how is it that a fundamentally mathematical game not quite likes a visual art or literature can have an equivalent aesthetic effect on humans however we look at it certain instances of the game are intricately connected with our aesthetic experience we do not quite feel that way when looking at regular amateur games for example this is something with explore roaring further given the unique amen ability to computation that chess possesses at what point and under what conditions for example do mere moves that win especially become more than the sum of their parts and strike us as brilliant or fascinating a few attempts at computer just composition have been made in the past but they tend to suffer from the same mechanistic disease of computational approaches and leave much of the creative aspect of humans some compasses and players are quick to point out that they do not for example look at the number of squares legal moves these values or perform calculations of any kind and that there is something else about the composition or move combination that they cannot describe and cannot in any case they say be sufficiently described in short it is a combination factors vast and diverse this may be true but it could also be that we are simply not aware of how our brains process the aesthetic response to particular stimuli we are in fact not aware or conscious of many things about ourselves that our brains or brain stems mechanically control and the precise methods and actions employed in doing so for example the mid dolly oblong at a controls breathing heart rate and blood pressure without conscious intervention from us if described in precise detail to us should we then claim that this is not what we really do when we breathe do all those little actions that on their own appear so unlike breathing per se not amount to actually breathing good the same approach that gives computers the ability to dream up a plan in the game also give them the ability to compose beautiful Chas compositions were take a risk with a highly irregular move in a real game that results in what we call a brilliancy of course it would only be fair that all of this come at the price of the computer sometimes completely messing up as we do but it would be a small price to pay given the kind of plasticity achieved a plasticity in reasoning and thought that could be just as applicable in other domains I do not believe we can have it both ways IE computers reasoning as we do yet being perfectly reliable but will not rule it out after all humans are in principle capable of being rational for the most part except for emotional considerations that need not necessarily be a side effect to genuine machine intelligence put simply machines need not suffer from our evolutionary baggage does the current computational paradigm play a role the question here is whether or not a is limited by say the binary system or a general lack of support for parallel ISM and computer programs IE large problems divided into smaller ones in solved concurrently I am not quite sure either way it could be that there is a revolutionary computer or software architecture waiting to be discovered or introduced to us presumably by other intelligent life in the universe but it is difficult to imagine anything computable that could not also be achieved based on the existing paradigm one argument and support of this is that programmers have become complacent given the exponential rise in computing power over the last few decades computer programs are not as clever as they would be at had computers not become so powerful so fast this increase in computational power is commonly known as Moore's Law computer programs can become cleverer in at least two ways fast algorithms can be improved a fitting example being alpha beta pruning over traditional minimax and second new avenues for creative programming for example facial recognition genetic algorithms can be created given increased processing power one of the main arguments against this is simply that we are today no longer wanting for computational resources especially with respect to what humans can already do with comparatively less for example in terms of the firing speed of an errand in chess we can take this negatively ie saying it's as a classic failure that rely too much on computational power and let on in intelligence were positively ie as a well explored domain for intelligence that has taken its computational resources to the limit and is now falling back on cleverer programs that rely less on those resources I for one prefer the latter which is why I would say that the science and jess is not quite done conclusions with the defeat of the World Chess Champion twitches computer over a decade ago and given the strength of desktop chess programs today some feel that it is time to move on to other more complex games it is often hoped that we will be brought closer to true AI by exploring those games chess is seen as either a failure in this regard or as being too simple to begin with I have shown and have argued that just is neither a failure from a computer science and a I perspective nor is it too simple as a game on the contrary just has made its share of contributions to science and is still meaningfully complex and even beautiful to humans the game is also still far from being solved if ever unlike tic-tac-toe in checkers even if it were to be solved in the near future there are creative and aesthetic aspects to it that are largely unexplored and not outside the purview of contemporary science note that this is aside from the various aesthetic designs of just sets that the game has inspired for centuries the seductive greater complexity of games like guys arguably little more than a desire for a new challenge after having beaten the best humans have to offer at chess there are likely to be technological contributions for example new computational techniques in this new pursuit but far less likely anything that resembles the kind of AI he had initially hoped for when computational investigations into chess began around six decades ago this kind of AI if it exists could just as well and can still be found in chess if more complex games are actually meant to serve as a motivation too complacent programmers and computer scientists to find the key to intelligence then we are perhaps unconsciously conceding to the idea the computational power has been more of a curse than a blessing in a I even so the fact that just programs today are playing significantly better than their predecessors on significantly less computing power suggests that we are already on the right track my concern is that a similar thing will occur with more complex games ie finding a very computational approach before making programs cleverer if we start the process again instead of looking deeper into chess where we already have the groundwork covered diverting the attention of especially AI researchers toward other games will also affect the competitive aspect that existed and that drove them to succeed when the focus was primarily on chess perhaps in order to be taken seriously in a I today it is simply a question of moving from the objective alpha a computer being able to beat the world champion to being able to learn improve in and ultimately appreciate the game chess as a domain of research surfaces
