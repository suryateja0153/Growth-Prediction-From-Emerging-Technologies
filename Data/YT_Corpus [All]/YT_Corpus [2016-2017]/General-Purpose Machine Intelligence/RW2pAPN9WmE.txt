 hi everyone I'm Davis this is Jacob and we're your instructors for CS 188 this summer let's meet everyone else who's gonna be teaching no that's us and then we have our five TAS I think four of whom are here so do you guys want to stand up most through say hi so we have Steve Andy over there so hod Aldo and daelin and most of you will be in section with one of them we have one more TA Karthik who couldn't make it today and you'll get to know them really well because we're having discussion sections twice a week in addition to lectures four times a week really fast pace for the summer and we'll talk about that a little bit more readers not really readers because we don't have any written homework in this class Alvin is working as a pseudo ta just helping us keep some stuff organized on the back and make a little new content to help with some new material new materials to help with some new content rather on optimization and deep learning in the later part of the course as I said in the email in the second half the math gets quite a bit harder so he's gonna be making some worksheets and sections to help with anyone who's a little bit more iffy on the prereqs ease into that and Alan is working on a new autograder system which hopefully this summer it will not become totally clear to you why we need a new auto grader because we worked out a lot of kinks in the spring but yeah anyway as that moves forward and development we're going to unroll some of those new features and so you'll probably have some interactions with him when he explains what we're gonna be doing there later on so that's everyone and so this is all being reiterated from the email and Piazza posts that I sent out but as of the last time I checked we had maybe three-quarters of everyone on Piazza do not everyone yet that's the most important thing all announcements in the course are gonna be on Piazza so if you haven't signed up yet please do a couple of people have emailed me saying they weren't able to register because they didn't have a berkeley.edu email yeah I would other people I think have been able to get by without that issue so if you have that problem just let me know there's an easy workaround from my end so that's regardless of whether you have a berkeley edu email we need to get that sorted out by today because there will be more announcements that you don't want to miss if you have any questions for us that's the first place to ask if it's more private doesn't really apply to any other students you can email the staff list see s 188 staff at list of berkeley.edu and if it doesn't make sense to address the whole staff maybe you need to ask your TA about some discussion attendance thing you should be able to find their email on the website or ask them for it but these are the two main channels of communications of course of course technology there's also been a little bit of an introduction to that online EDX is the main hub for all of our course content that's where the projects and homeworks will be hosted your projects will be well I think I had more to say about that in a minute more details and like I said some new autograder ideas in the spring we unrolled two new projects and the autograder did not like some of the things we were doing so we're still working that out and you'll hear plenty more about all of that prerequisites this is important especially important for CS 188 because as I said it's not totally obvious why these prerequisites are so important until right around but we start covering after midterm one the first part of the course is covering some more straightforward algorithms the kind you might have covered in CS 61 be generalized to more artificial intelligence settings later on we're going to be doing optimization with some calculus some difficult probability like what you saw at the end of sitting at 70 and or if you're not a Berkeley student whatever probability course you did take so there's a math diagnostic on EDX that if you haven't looked at that and you didn't take those three courses you should probably take a look and make sure that those are easy problems for you because if they're not will probably be past the point where you can drop the class before it pits really hard that these are difficult concepts that you need to know for this class okay so six programming projects they're all relatively short not projects on the scale of maybe there's sixty one be more open-ended kind of projects but implement encode and algorithm that we covered in lecture that's usually the flavor of these projects and at the summer pace we're not going to have a project this week will actually will project zero bites ungraded we're not going to have a project finals week and it's an eight week semester which means project due every single Friday pretty fast paced and that's interlace with all of the homework assignments homework assignments are going to be on basically a web form interactive on EDX where you just type in the answer to a question and it'll tell you you're right or wrong if you get it wrong you're allowed to try again a few times but to discourage guessing what we're doing is you have a limited number of attempts to answer the question if you run out it's not the end of the world you can go into office hours and talk to a TA and if you can demonstrate that you've put some thought into the question then they'll reset your attempts and you can still get the homework done our goal here is just to make sure that a everyone who tries can get the homework done and learn from it and be people who don't try at all we're trying to encourage you people who would be inclined not to try what to force you to they put it that way two midterms one final what's important about that is that because our homework and projects are structured so that with enough effort you will be able to get a hundred percent we want everyone to cover every bit of the projects because that's the main place where learning happens in this course the exams are the main place where your grade is going to be set apart from the rest of the course and that means that the difficulty level on exams is much higher than in any other context and so you want to be not only thinking about obviously make sure that you're available on the days of the exams the dates I think are on the next slide but also that those weeks we're going double pace this is all you're going to be doing probably because you want to study a lot we're gonna release a lot of materials for you to help you ramp up to that level but it's going to take a lot of effort on your thick scale and oh yeah question okay okay yeah okay so to reiterate in case you can hear that basically which key concepts from those forces rather than everything I would say four CS seventy with the exception of maybe turn off bounds the very last thing usually in CS 70 everything on probability covered in that course super important CS 61 be that you'll know by tomorrow if you remember like Dijkstra an a-star search well enough but it's mainly the math and baked into the fact that CS 70s a prereq high school calculus is listed as a prereq for CS 70 so you should know what a derivative is and you're in good shape if you know what a gradient is but if you don't we're gonna help you out with that because that's not actually prereq yeah as far as more specifically than that I think the math diagnostic test is the closest thing we have to what you're asking for if you're on the fence about I mean this come talk to us afterward and we can help you figure out if you are in good shape to take the close yeah what this slides no guarantees right now I actually haven't given that any thought posted beforehand is that what we were doing before oh then yes yes they will sorry about that sorry that they weren't posted this time I'll post them after lecture and post the ones for tomorrow very soon okay yeah big scale that just means the exact scale is visible on the course policies page on EDX your grade is not going to be decided by a specific curve that we're trying to fit it will be 40% of your greatest projects in homeworks and then the rest of it is based on the exams that breakdown is on there and regardless of how everyone else in the course does you will get the grade that you are discussion participation is 1% extra credit we're not interested in forcing anyone to go to the discussion if it's not helpful to them but if someone does go we want to recognize that and so that will be worth 1% and exceptional participation if a TA says yes this is my most engaged student or if you answer a lot of questions on Piazza come to a lot of ups hours these kinds of things they'll be recognized and they can help you get bumped up if you're really close to a grade margin at the end of the semester academic integrity policy it's the same thing as it always is you know please don't keep no but really because the homeworks and projects are not intended to determine your grade they're just there to help you learn we hope that the incentives aren't really in place to make you want to keep but in case they are we're doing we have various things going on on the back end for your project submissions to attach maybe hard-coding certain answers and all sorts of things you might come up with such that it's probably easiest for you to just do the projects rather than try to get help on them rather you can get help but try to keep and contests that's the last important thing we're gonna be running three contests and the course is based around the game pac-man we'll talk about that a little bit later but it's a two-player version of pac-man where you're playing against someone else you're trying to eat pellets from the other side of the screen before they get yours and the first contest will be a simple version of that game based on the first third of that course and then as we go we're gonna add rules that allow you to utilize the things you've learned in this course and it gets more complicated and strategies become more complex those will be worth little bit of extra credit and a lot of glory so definitely if you have the time you should try to participate in those they're pretty fun these are the exam dates midterm to the date is not quite set yet because we realized that one of those dates the first one that we wanted had a conflict with another CS class but yeah make sure you have 7-eleven 811 open and 728 is most likely the day it's going to end up to be we still don't have the rooms booked and so it's possible that things might shift around a little bit but that's what we're aiming for in 7-eleven 728 11 we might end up with 727 in a worst case situation there will be no make up exam important point yes no makeup exams so yeah let us know as soon as possible if you have conflict with one of the midterms that it's completely Eric unsolvable if you have a conflict with the final time that you can't reconcile it's probably not the right semester to take this class so we're not doing a makeup final and there's not any way to really calculate a fair grade without you taking it fun quick point about a laptops in lecture it's okay it is a little distracting sometimes to students sitting behind you you know if you're shopping on Amazon or watching Netflix person one behind you wants to know what's going on so we ask that you try to sit in the back half of the room if you're going to be on your laptop during lecture so that people who have a tendency to be more distracted by that can choose to sit in the front and get away from that textbook so this is totally optional the Russell and Norvig textbook AI a modern approach 3rd edition is the one that we recommend if you want to go beyond what's taught in the course I can't stress that enough because in a lot of classes this is a source of information for the course itself this textbook here if you're struggling in the course this is not a good reference to consult because the presentation of a lot of the ideas is different and it will probably lead to more confusing yeah so discussions section already said a little bit about this most of you are familiar with what a discussion section is if you've taken any of those free rec classes similar formats a format to those where we'll have lectures where you're introduced to the material for the first time and then twice a week so every other lecture will meet with your TA and a about 30 other students to have a quick review of the concepts one it's a little more interactive easier to ask questions and you'll be given a chance to work on a worksheet with problems where you can check your understanding of these concepts you all registered for a specific section on television but the way that we're doing sections this semester is you don't have to go to the one that you registered for on pelvis if one other section is easier for you to make it to or if you decide that you like one of the TAS teaching style more than the others you're free to go to whichever section you choose for the sake of making those extra credit points easier to compute for the TAS and to help develop relationships between TAS and students we do ask that you find a discussion section and stick to it and we're going to actually do that in an official context in the third week there will just be at the beginning of section a quick signup where you register for whichever one you intend to go to for the rest of the semester it's not binding again because attendance is optional but you're just saying this is the person responsible for deputy my grade if you're not intending to go for that extra credit doesn't really apply to you but if you are that's probably the TA you'll be interacting with the semester in the spring so the semester that just ended we ran discussion sections as normal and then also had a TA do a walk-through video of the solutions to the worksheets the worksheets that we're using for discussion this semester are more or less going to be exactly the same there will be some slight changes but that means that we're going to be using those videos releasing them as tools for you to go over them if you can't make it to section don't finish in section or want to go over it again there's no section today or tomorrow and so they start Wednesday and Thursday I recommend that during this time before you settle on a particular section you try out a few different ones see who's teaching style suits you best and then decide where you're actually going to be at the end of don't have it the exact date on here I don't think I did well the third week and there will be announcements about that you'll know next point is exam practice materials so this is another resource from the spring where it was a different kind of discussion section where materials questions at the level of exam questions actually they were just old exam questions we're given as a worksheet for students to work together on and then go over with a TA we don't have enough staff to run those this summer but we still have the worksheets and we still have walkthrough videos for those as well so we'll be releasing those okay so this is the last big summary of course logistics and then we'll be done with that chunk of the lecturer so let's go through you haven't registered on EDX do that as soon as possible because every deadlines homework project everything is hosted on there and you won't be able to get credit for those if you don't have an EDX account register on Piazza do that today if you haven't already because that's where all course announcements will be project zero Python tutorial if CS 61a is still fresh in your mind this should be very simple finish it in half an hour if you're new to Python then you'll be learning Python very quickly this is due Friday on EDX and it's not worth a grade but this is the way we do a pulse check which means we are we still have a wait list and they're always going to be people registered for the course intending to drop who don't show up for a while we don't want to take attendance in lecture because there are too many people but this is basically how we're gonna make sure everyone is actually engaged with the course and actively participating and also if you have any trouble with the autograder we want to sort that out so this ungraded project rather than a week from now when you have a graded project that would be yeah if you're new to Python you might want a little bit of help going through the tutorials so we're gonna have project 0 office hours just this week Wednesday and Thursday 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. in 5:10 soda there if there hasn't been an announcement on Piazza yet right ok so probably today or tomorrow this will be posted on Piazza if you're new to Python again this is probably a place to want to go to get some help learning about that and instructional account forms we don't use them at all in 188 these are what let you log into the computers and the labs in Corey hall and soda hall but a lot of people like to have them to print stuff so if you want one you can follow the instructions on the Welcome post on Piazza and get one mat diagnostic I already talked about that mark exam dates sections in the second half of the week and the first homework is due next Monday it's not released yet because it's on content from tomorrow and Wednesdays lectures but you will want to look at it this week and just bringing that to your attention we're getting started really quickly if you're wait-listed there are only a few people on the waitlist chances are we've already talked to you but there's there's a good chance that you'll get in waitlist is pretty short at this point but we really don't have much more to say than that we don't control enrollment at all if you're really worried about it you can contact Michael Dimock sassing with any questions and regular office hours start next week that schedule will be posted and how many of you are not so yeah the point here is just like we know this is a very diverse class we know there are people who don't attend come into the CS background there understand how Berklee works there is no curve for this class we wanted room to get a hundred percent so like please please please come to office hours come to section we're gonna help you thanks Jacob any questions about course of distance there general yes can you was it okay the question was can we use cheat sheets on the exam yeah we will we'll post more information about specifics for the exams like that as we get nearer to that but we will allow GT comes in yeah it's just EDX no other EDX in Piazza is everything as of now no this is we're recording right now we won't have this camera so this is just for the first week maybe screen recording and we're going to make sure everything works so the office our schedule will be uploaded later this week and that will start next week we aren't doing anything like or aren't planning on it at this point but I mean between all of the staff we're gonna have 14 hours office hours a week and so there will be plenty of time for you to get help online yeah so the autograder I'll say more about this a bit later when we actually have a project with graded tests but just so that the auto greater we release to you you can test with it locally and then submit to our server and the intention is that you get the exact same grade on the server that you got locally so you know before you submit what you're going to get there are we do run some secret tests that are simpler than the ones that you run locally just to make it so that you can't look at the auto grader see what tests it's going to run and then just design it to specifically work for those but yeah you'll you will never make something that works for the public tests that doesn't work for the private tests without trying most likely over by 10:00 p.m. like any latest yeah normal final sniffles during the fall and spring semesters the last we might depends on when it's booked but I wouldn't count on it being earlier than that okay I'm gonna move on for right now if you have any more logistics questions Piazza email Jacob and I will also be around after lecture today if you need to talk to us about anything and now we're gonna move on to actual artificial intelligence so today let's talk about what is artificial intelligence what can they I do and what is this course the place where you may be most familiar with seeing AI before is sci-fi so let's look at a couple places where you might have seen artificial intelligence before who are these guys ai-ya-ya wake up so what does c-3po do yeah he's a translator and what is r2d2 do pilot yeah so this is an early example popular science fiction AI and they were helpful to humans they basically perform functions to help you fill out a pretty charitable view early on and then we get this who's this terminator right yeah so now we start to see this idea that AI can rise up and take over the world and destroy all humans kind of scary and then moving forward from there we see in the matrix well it's not just robots that can get us even AI software can be scary and well going in a weird order this is ex machina the humans that can emulate human or sorry AI they can emulate human emotions and trick us into falling for them basically other than appearance indistinguishable from human behavior and who's that GLaDOS yeah from Portal kind of hard to see but the robot that releases a deadly neurotoxin and destroys all the researchers she knows how to do science better than any of them and they're stopping her so these and a lot of other sci-fi movies games books are probably where you've engaged most most with artificial intelligence before question is this view of artificial intelligence how realistic is it well more recently there has been some serious thought put into the question of can AI key and existential threat an Elon Musk tech entrepreneur behind SpaceX and Tesla probably heard of him he's one of the big leaders of this movement this is an important thing for us to be thinking about right now ai if we're not careful it could spell the end of humanity and so that was a couple years ago a little bit after that two months after that starting at Stanford there were some serious academic studies about looking forward the future of AI could it actually spell doom or maybe less dramatically some kind of bad outcome for the human race and following some more thought about that and the results of that study and a lot of other thinking about this Elon Musk actually put his money where his mouth was and said well donated rather 10 million dollars to a fund to act to start researching with qualified academics and people with expertise in the field how we can actually prevent any of these horrible outcomes from happening a little bit later toward the end of that year so this is just December 2015 pretty recent a billion dollars to open the eye and if you haven't heard of open AI it's a nonprofit that works actually pretty closely with some of the researchers at Berkeley to advance the AI frontier but without any corporate interests leading where it goes so that we are more likely to avoid any of these doomsday scenarios if you're interested in philosophy behind the AI these are two book good books to consult we're not really going to address it much passed today but this first book the second Machine Age is talking about the nearer term effects of AI the idea is we had an agricultural revolution a long time ago that completely changed the way the human race worked and then jumped forward a long time machine revolution the first Industrial Revolution was now machines are starting to handle manual labor for us this is the idea behind the second machine ages we're now getting to a point where computers handle intellectual labor for Humanity the second book super intelligence by Nick Bostrom that's dangerous strategies it talks about the idea of an intelligence explosion where as soon as we get AI that is smart at the level of a human then that AI can start working on AI itself and we get an intelligence explosion basically exponential growth and the ability of what these artificial intelligences are capable of doing and if we're not careful in specifying in the beginning how we want them to behave what we want them to accomplish and what we don't want them to do then once we hit that point it's kind of out of our control so we need to be thinking about it sir that's the idea so why take this class well if you ask me in 2002 I would have been a young child and not very helpful but Peter abby'll says in 2002 the main reasons you'd want to take this class are to learn about AI of course maybe to continue to learn about AI there and a PhD but not going to maximize your job opportunities more recently probably as you are aware that's changed quite a bit still hopefully you're interested in AI for its own sake it's an interesting topic but now a lot of jobs have started to emerge it's something useful to know even if you want to go into industry so to put some numbers behind it these are by year the last few years the number of new artificial intelligence startups that have been funded and you can see in 2010 there are two and it's been growing faster than linearly since then now in 2014 we're up to 16 it's pretty dramatic and the total amount of money that has been invested in these it's grown looks almost exponential there in the last few years but it's blowing up something I don't have numbers for but that is also pretty relevant is more and more positions at places like Facebook Google the companies that students from Berkeley and these other universities often want to go work for you're going to be working on their search algorithms and all these things that are based almost entirely on ideas that we're going to cover in this class and so AI has become an actual relevant real-world skill so this cycle of innovation this is generic to all innovation you can think about anywhere where you're hiring engineers if you improve your product and you get more funding then you can hire more engineers and better engineers and then it just keeps snowballing like that well with AI this is even more dramatic because not only can you hire more engineers and get more resources the success in the market is its own resource and to be more concrete about that I'll show some examples Google is the classic example they're search algorithms way back in 2000 were their search results were the ones people wanted to see more than anything else already performing better than any of the competition so more people used it and then if ever you type in something and then you click on something that's not the first result well Google learns from that it says oh these top results I returned we're not the correct thing next time someone types in whatever they were searching for that time then I'll add some importance to it they clicked on and so this data is feeding forward and making their algorithm even more successful Tesla autopilot similar thing when it first rolled out it was a feature that people could use in their Tesla's and of course they said this is not totally safe yet you still have to be sitting at the wheel and ready to correct it if something goes wrong and so that people did that if ever Tesla autopilot did something that was not the correct move while driving driver takes over does something with the wheel Tesla learns and that data is again sent back to the algorithm and it knows for the future in similar situations to that how it should behave or at least it has a better idea Facebook M something that is I haven't used it myself but the idea is it's actually a personal assistant inside Facebook Messenger and when it was first released it's actually a human you can query the person say I want to get dinner with my friend tonight and then it'll get your location look at what's open around you and suggest a place to go hey maybe you check out the sandwich place and then over time the AI is watching this happen and learning based on the people's reactions to these suggestions what kinds of suggestions are good and so yeah over time performance just gets better and better so what is AI this is kind of a contentious question and we're gonna look at four different ideas people have of what it could be so the first one is making machines that think like people so this field is more like cognitive science neuroscience and we probably have people in this room who are coming from those backgrounds because there's a lot of intersection between what we're gonna do here and this idea so this is studying how the brain works how human cognition works and trying to emulate that in software act like people so what's a good example of something in this field in your benchmark you've heard of for how an AI can act like people yeah chatbox chat pods yes yeah so the Turing test which I'm sure you've heard of is assuming that this is how we wanted to find a AI making machines that act like people the Turing test says panic and artificial intelligence converse with a human and act convincingly like a human so that the person is convinced they are this isn't exactly what we've come to realize we want because well when you force yourself to act like a human not only do you start doing the things that humans are successful at like understanding images and understanding what other people are saying humans aren't perfect when you start intentionally forwarding yourself in order to look more like a human like for example if you're trying to act like a person and someone tries to ask you to multiply a thousand thirty seven and twenty eight a computer can just tell you instantly that's a very easy problem for a computer but if you're acting like a person you have to think about it and probably get it wrong and so this isn't really quite the definition you want think rationally this is kind of a tradition that goes way back to Aristotle the idea that all knowledge and all action can be rationally justified by logic and so at some points in AI history this has been the main way of thinking about it and we'll talk about that we'll touch on that shortly but the problem there is that there's so much uncertainty in the world around us that to really truly understand everything with certainty is just beyond the reach of humans and computers and so what we're really looking for for successful systems that actually help us do anything useful is act rationally so what do I mean by rational that's a pretty iffy idea at the moment you probably have notions of what that word means we're going to use a concrete definition here that may or may not be the same as what you've used it to mean for so rational means maximally achieving predefined goals so you have some utility function basically over all possible outcomes which ones are better and then you do with what information you have whatever will most likely give you the most preferable outcomes we're gonna talk about that rationality and utility and a little more detail later on but for now you want to know that this is the tagline of this course is maximize your expected utility a better name for it would be computational rationality once we have that definition everything we're gonna be doing can kind of be framed in this way and so yeah this is good you'll get to know this robot pretty well isn't a lot of the slides maximize your expected utility well so the question now is where do we start to actually achieve this we said that the human brain human cognition is not perfect and so thinking acting like humans is not going to be the most desirable route but it's definitely a proof of concept for pseudo rational thought and so what can we learn from the brain that's the first place to be they're not perfect like I said and it's hard to really understand from scanning the brain and taking it apart what it's doing it's very difficult to reverse-engineer there's this good quote brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight what do I mean by that well when people were first trying to figure out how to make flying machines what example did they have from nature birds and birds flap their wings to fly and so that was kind of the first technological route people were trying to take and they weren't having a lot of success what ended up working was a new model of fly that was more totally different from by a biological play so it turned out that while they had some things to learn from the biological proof concept of play they didn't really have success until they stepped back and thought about what does it really mean to fly rather than being stuck in how it's been done successfully and biology before so two things that we have learned from the brain and how humans think about things are memory and simulation so memory is taking information about the world around you and then use it to make decisions now and don't just forget what you just learned you know when you're making a decision ten minutes from now remember all of the data that you've taken in previously and then simulation is rather than looking back look forward based on your model of how the world works from what you've learned so far think forward think about what is likely to happen as a result of different actions and then choose whichever one is going to be best okay so now we're gonna look at a short history of AI we have a video but they hate Mooji everyone see that oh yeah with me tonight is proposed along the reasoning director of the research laboratory of electronics at MIT dr. we did not or what really worries me today is what's going to have to do with the machine anything and what industry specifically did tell me oh very hard years ago in a sort of a very perfect they are the perfect and I don't really know I think things to come back and for five years or security well if you're confused after money think I feel where does really beginning to understand the capabilities of the company I've gotten forms on faces point with I think I may be that many playing checkers to get the computer it there are plenty pretty well well most computer scientists saw it as a mere number cruncher a small group thought the digital computer had a much grander destiny being the general-purpose machine it could be programmed to do things which in humans require intelligence by games like checkers and chess and soul of bringing teasers the field became known as artificial intelligence machines releasing even a scientist I didn't find the best of machines can will think I don't mean the machines will behave like that I don't think for very long time we're going to have a physical problem the same thing that the robot and I don't think my daughter will ever matter to do but I think we'll be doing the things that men do willing say they're thinking I'm convinced that machine cannon will they hadn't reckoned with ambiguity when they set out to use computers to translate languages $500,000 simple calculator not suppressible electronic brain known translates into English one of the first non numerical applications of computers it was typed as the solution to the key would okay so what did we see there well that was pretty early on and like I said humans originally computers originally thought to be number crunchers and it was around that time that they started to do things originally thought to require human intelligence so that era the early days McCulloch and Pitt's boolean circuit model of the brain and Turing Computing Machinery and intelligence just kind of the first Inklings of this idea that computers would be able to surpass just answering numerical questions and then in 1952 70 that videos from they started to have some successes with various problems that computers had never been used to solve before so as we saw in there playing checkers logic theory and doing geometry things that are actually pretty difficult for humans actually we have computers doing them now in the in this era and 1956 this meeting at Dartmouth was when the phrase artificial intelligence was adopted and 1965 came Robinson's complete algorithm for logical reasoning so what that means will be more clear when I look here so knowledge based approaches and this is kind of what I was talking about before where all knowledge and all rational thought can be contained can be worked with logically so say you have a knowledge base which is a set of just things that you know to be true if you're a robot that's supposed to walk somewhere and accomplish something then you know you can't step forward if there's a wall in front of you and so say your reasoning this way well if you see that there's no wall in front of you and you need to be over there take a step forward maybe you just stepped off a foot and the idea is there are all sorts of exceptions and you can keep adding things like well okay also look down and make sure you're not going to follow up something and make sure nothing's gonna run in front of you and being be there in the future that's not there now all sorts of exceptions and you'll keep going over and over that and again and you'll get mired down by that and that's what ended up happening in this period 1988 to 1993 things that we're working well it's a machine translation and things like that hit a wall because there are just so many exceptions to everything that to encode all of them the computer is not a feasible way to solve these problems and then there's been a resurgence since 1990 with statistical approaches we're now instead of knowing anything with certainty we just deal with probabilities what's the probability that there's something in front of you that this step will be successful and then it's a much more successful way of dealing with these problems now the question is where are we now so we have a quiz not really a quiz but the question is which of the following can be done at present so first question play a decent game of table tennis yes or no I hear some yeses yeah yeah this is something that has been done you may have seen the video we're not gonna play it right now but it's a robot arm that plays pretty well tracks the ball hits it to the other side it's an impressive robot play a decent game of Jeopardy yes as you may have seen IBM's Watson who won against Ken Jennings and did very well very impressive what about drive safely along a curving Mountain good yeah this has turned out to be an environment that is pretty tractable for self-driving cars driving safely on curving Mountain Road what about driving safely along Telegraph Avenue hey so knows can anyone drive safely across the Telegraph that Telegraph Avenue is the question yeah so here we run into a lot of there are people running from all directions can't follow where cars are going because most of them are going against traffic it makes no sense yeah that's a bit beyond the scope of where we are now but we're getting there you know these are things like what I was saying a Tesla autopilot and D car where as they get more and more data and learn how to handle these situations it's starting to become more achievable what about buying a week's worth of groceries on the internet yeah okay I see a lot of yes yes this is actually a pretty easy problem for AI what about buying a week's worth of groceries at Berkeley Bowl I see some nose yeah it's similar situation at Berkeley Bowl you have to meander through crowds of people look for exactly what you want make sure you don't drop anything while you're grabbing anything there's a lot more to consider and a lot more uncertainty again an interface for picking out what you need on the Internet is a much more controlled environment than actually physically being at the store so that not quite what about discover and prove a new mathematical theorem it's pretty mixed yes I know well that's kind of the answer here so that's a sounds about right and maybe this should be split into two bullet points but prove a new mathematical theorem yes in fact we'll see an example later where this has been done successfully by an AI in a case that a human was not able to prove the theorem discover a new one we still haven't really made AI that is able to discern what kinds of mathematical theorems are interesting to us and so if you tell it to search for mathematical theorems that it can prove it might tell you two plus two is four that was exciting let's learn a new one two plus three five I can prove it and it'll go on and on if you tell it to prove something that no one's proved before because people already know that it'll tell you okay a billion nine plus 37 okay so it's it's that's not really something that's been accomplished by AI so much yet about converse successfully with another person for an hour yeah well I don't know maybe it depends on how you define successfully but for that long we haven't quite had an AI who could hold up for like realistic sounding conversation and in a couple bullet points we'll see what happens when AI starts talking too much it will perform a surgical operation yes mostly SS okay so most of you would be comfortable under the knife of robot no human operation whatsoever it's just safer than a human okay fair point well where we are right now with this is another question mark one because it is true that a lot of surgeries are done by robots but the software that's going on behind the scenes in these cases for the most part is tele op where there's a human operating the robotics from some other place like yeah you're operating a robotic arm from a controller somewhere else for some LASIK surgeries I think there have been successes with the vision systems in AI being more precise than human surgeons but for the most part that's still something that's a work in progress we're gonna put away the dishes and fold the laundry yes yeah okay okay yeah and this is actually will see a video later something that's being worked on here at Berkeley and that is those problems are solved so that's pretty good what about real-time spoken English yeah yeah and that's a good point it's the so we have speech-to-text then translation from chinese to english and then text back to speech three steps here and all of these are problems that are in pretty good shape it can be done well if you're a native Chinese speaker you will notice that the translations are not exactly the most natural way of doing it but for the most part the ideas can come through like a lot of research I've seen has also worked between English and French and a lot of the early translation research is between English and Russian I don't know if you have yeah yeah things like but one of the it's generally courtesy translation to the more similar kind of our friend yeah so we have to check there it can be done pretty well sort of Jacob is skeptical what about right and intentionally funny movie no yeah probably not so much but it can write a movie and it is funny so I don't know if any of you heard about this this was just a couple weeks ago and I named Benjamin wrote a script for a movie basically it was given a ton of different screenplays for AI artificial sci-fi that's the word sci-fi movies and said and told write me a sci-fi movie called Sun spring and this is what we ended up with it's a really quite exciting we're gonna watch just a couple minutes of it all the stage directions and everything are actually written in by the AI so when you see him pull things from his mouth that's actually in the script in the future with mass young people to begin what you were sent to me Wow so yeah we don't have time to watch the whole thing but I think Benjamin's trying to communicate something Benjamin has no idea what's going on but yeah so you might not be able to read that but when it's scanning his face the stage directions he picks up a light screen and fights the security force of the particles of a transmission on his face and then his eyes from his mouth that's what that was about in case you were a little confused that's what was going on so intentionally funny probably not I recommend watching the rest of that by the way the rest of it it's funny too there's actually a song Benjamin wrote a song for the soundtrack plays later so yeah that transitions us into different areas of modern AI natural language so this is where you've seen speech technology technologies like Siri probably the one that's most familiar but automatic speech recognition and so yeah we can just watch a couple seconds of this these sources tell NBC attend that person isn't confident appears to be a strong suspect they have more information to give me morning putting five of these tech notice under use the condom NBC 10 music so it's doing pretty well the things that it's not quite getting our names like McConnell instead of Nakano and that's more or less mostly a function of it's just doing what it thinks is most likely upon is not a common name there were there was one issue where instead of goodbye like waving goodbye it said goodbyes like Best Buy but I mean if you were to read back this transcript inaudible English it is pretty much exactly almost exactly getting the point text to speech synthesis that's like when Sperrys series speaks back to you and dialogue system when you put speech recognition and text-to-speech and actually like what Benjamin was doing coming up with things to say based on questions or whatever else altogether and you get something like Siri language processing technologies so this would be like Watson talked about question answering and machine translation we also talked about and web search Google text classification spam filtering these are all fairly familiar ideas because we use them day to day all these translation search built spam filtering all these things another one that both daelin and Jacob have been working on is visual question-answering which is you have a picture of something and the question about it like does this family have a child and it's a car with a car seat in the back it should be able to say yes this family has a child and that ties into this other area of modern era which is vision so we're going to look at a couple of demos of modern vision systems one of this you may have seen before who's worked on by our old California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger he's yeah what is that yeah this is the one object recognition we can jump forward a little bit there you go looking at what's in front of them classifying ages so for those of you who know this movie you know why we're not really gonna watch any more than that in the 80s or maybe 91 actually family remember this was science fiction but actually this has become something with real progress sort of basically the same thing frog Fox Dalmatian the camera that's doing this this is what's gonna be ruling us frog again frog and Fox classify two things at once it's pretty impressive so anyway that is object tracking a new thing face recognition like on Facebook when you post a picture and it suggests who to tag in the picture and some other problems like seam segmentation where when you look at an image when we look at an image we are automatically without thinking about it picking apart what is in that image when I look in front of me I see that there's a floor here and there are people sitting here and it's segmented into a bunch of different parts and when a computer sees an image all it's getting is a list of pixel values or an array of pixel values so there's actual processing going on in our brains to get from there is some Brown here and some white here and then here I get a whole bunch of different colors people's clothes and stuff and so getting software that actually does this it says these are different sections of this image something else is going on that's another AI problem in classification which is basically like facial recognition but more generally we're not just looking at the faces of your friends but all of the things that could be in front of you like that's a jacket that's an iPad this is a marker we want our computers to be able to tell us okay so logic I mentioned before excuse me wrong screen robotics can skip that that's the most exciting one in my sorry so robotics is part mechanical engineering of course because you need to have arms or engines or anything that can actually move in the real world and part AI so that's the hardware and the software really two parts of the problem and when we're working on just the AI part we tend to work in simulations and that's what a lot of the projects here are going to be sort of the algorithms that we're working on to solve pac-man could be used in simulations and actual robotics problems without much tweaking but reality is quite a bit harder so we're gonna see some videos of some robotics in action so this one you probably familiar with it's come up a couple times already today Google car and there sees a person in front of it notes to stop navigating through a tollbooth through the woods in the dark missing a deer all sorts of stuff doing pretty well and so that's a problem that combines a lot of these different ideas and then we also have something that might be a little more what you immediately think of when I say robotics which is cute little dogs playing soccer so this is a competition Sonne program a bunch of robots play against each other and see how they do I don't know what's going on yeah pretty good and what's interesting is we're gonna look at a lot of algorithms for learning not just communicating to a computer what we wanted to do but giving it the tools to figure it out for itself and sometimes when you do that your robots will end up learning behavior that you yourself might not have even thought so that's pretty yeah I mentioned before we had a video of a robot that was going to do some laundry this is Brett the Berkeley robot for the elimination of tedious tasks sped up a little bit 200 times and yeah but it is kind of exciting because Brett is not given any instructions for how to pick up a towel or how to fold it up it's just learning based on us giving it rewards when it does what we want basically how to do the laundry and then something a little more humanoid is pet man since renamed Atlas I think yeah trying to do humanoid motions walking oh good spike suppose doing some push-ups Boston Dynamics yeah so robotics yes and in this class a lot of the problems we're gonna do in the earlier parts of the course are kind of motivated in a certain sense by robotics it'll be easier to see when you are done creating these algorithms that can solve pac-man but then just as easily port to another environment like really any game you throw at it if you formulate it in the right way your algorithms will be able to solve it but that said we are not really going to be dealing with the mechanical aspects of it everything will be in software in this class oh sorry I wasn't showing the slide yeah just quick note about logic like I mentioned in 1933 this was proposed not really that important to this class what that was about but basically proposed by human in 1933 remain to conjecture because no human was able to come up with a proof for it until 1996 when an automated theorem prover was able to come up with this one which is actually pretty concise and clean proof so that was kind of a breakthrough in AI when I was able to solve something that humans could not and this method of AI is being becoming less and less popular we're not going to talk too much about any of these things except constraint satisfaction we will have one lecture in constraint satisfaction is something like if I have a hundred courses that are being taught on campus and I have 50 lecture halls and they need to each have this much time how can I assign them all to LexA timeslots without anything conflicting or any constraints being violated and so that's an interesting problem that we'll talk about later this week this is something that you might have heard about well it wasn't so recent but chess engines pretty big deal there's a class's moment in May of 1997 deep blue versus Kasparov and so this was the first match in the game of chess won against the world champion and Kasparov and himself described the way the deep blue was playing as intelligent and creative so back then this was being done with like a head I don't remember the number but some hundreds of millions of dollars supercomputer that was computing 200 million board positions per second and coming up with moves that 99.9% of the time humans understood why so without explicitly encoding what kinds of moves to make rather just looking ahead at all the possible moves it could choose and picking the ones that lead to good futures not really the way that humans think about it it was able to do human light moves most of the time and for that point 1 percent of the time who really knows what it was thinking but it's still won so maybe they were smart it was smarter than us so it is kind of an open question this approach to solving this game is pretty different from the way humans do it humans tend to look ahead only a few moves and just have a much more intuitive understanding of what kinds of moves are good in chess whereas a computer approaches the problem by basically considering every possible future scenario and just taking whatever move leads to the most favorable ones in 1996 Kasparov beats deep blue and says I could feel I could smell a new kind of intelligence across the table probably a good smell you might want that in your car new intelligence scent but then 1997 deep blue wins against pass Prague and Kasparov says deep blue hasn't proven anything so I don't know what that says about AI but it seems to say a lot about humanity this is much more recent and this you've probably heard about for the for a long time basically since the blue beat Kasparov the go has been kind of considered the frontier for AI gameplay the reason it's difficult is in chess typically there are about 35 different moves you can make and and go there 250 what that means is if you're going to be using a strategy that involves looking forward across every possible branch of this game's future and go with the same amount of computing power you're not going to be able to get nearly as far into the future and so in order to do well here you need to have some way of determining which branches are even worth considering in 2016 so I think that was in March right yeah ok I'm pretty sure that was in March I should probably have known that but very recent alphago a an algorithm from google's deepmind team beat lee sedol who was the second is one the second most international go championships there are still people who say ah he's not the world champion who cares that's yeah the point is as of just last year AI researchers thought that being able to beat a world champion at go was still a decade away as an achievement and this new algorithm that used some ideas in deep learning that basically expanded in ways basically improve the test algorithms and their in the way they work themselves and added to them a way of considering only some possible futures and saying those other ones aren't even worth looking at so reactions from the NGO community similar to deep blue where it's just exciting because it's intelligent behavior that is has not been seen before and maybe a little bit more classy response by resettle that robots will never understand the beauty of the game but still really grasping for something for Humanity to hold on to so it's not as though it's not exempting them strictly based on what you it builds its own representations and ideas of what is good and go and goes based on that when we cover deep learning there'll be maybe a little more it's a little more complicated it's actually something I think we'll cover later this week what yeah yeah what we're actually going to cover the algorithms that blue is using later this week and that'll be more to say so just real quickly reactions for me at community like I said we thought this was a decade away it just happened everyone who is scared about AI they don't think deep mind is gonna take over the world without Foucault but now they're saying look we can jump forward a lot faster than we thought we could maybe we really do need to be thinking about this decision-making which is just some more applications of AI scheduling route planning medical diagnosis etc these are all things that you probably interact with fairly regularly that are handled by AI systems and we'll look at this framework quite a bit more tomorrow but a rational agent that's formalized by this model the agent interacts with the environments from percept it sees things hears things it knows it's what position it's at and then it has some way of going from what it gets from it sensors actuators so the robotics part that we're not and the part that we're focusing on the functions basically that take us from sensors to actuators and the example problem we're gonna use is pac-man we'll see a lot of pac-man if you don't know how the game works eat all the dots without getting eaten by the ghosts it's pretty simple you'll come to understand it pretty quickly and it's going to be split into two main parts this making decisions that's more about the simulation aspects of it like I said with deep blue imagine future trajectories for this chess game take moves that take us down good paths we're going to do search just tomorrow which is if I'm trying to solve a maze or something like that imagine what's going to happen if I go this way and etc and then in the second part of the course where a lot of the math comes in that's where we're going to be dealing with probability and data and reasoning under uncertainty and that's going to be a lot of learn a lot about what's around me and then based on what I've seen before take an action that will lead to increasing my expected utility okay and that's all for today thank you
