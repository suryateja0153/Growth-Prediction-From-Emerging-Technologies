 you are watching ColdFusion TV hi welcome to another ColdFusion video for the first time in history we're seeing the successful development and demonstration of general purpose AI its name is alphago and it was made by google's deepmind division the alphago AI algorithm beat a human at the world's hardest game this is a historic moment in computer science and artificial intelligence so what exactly is google deepmind where did it come from and what can the company's artificial intelligence actually do in this video we'll find out a computer program beat a human brain of the ancient Chinese war game of go the final school for one at triumph or artificial intelligence equipped with human intuition victory of a program over a human in the ancient board game go has sparked intrigue and in some cases concern it shows that a machine has approximated human intuition and outsmarted the best human brain in the game it's something that scientists hadn't expected to happen for at least another decade and it's a giant leap for artificial intelligence showing that machines can learn on their own I think maybe the game ended because it looks like we still captain no I think you resign well I think you're right this was the moment a computer called alphago beat a master of the ancient Chinese game go it's not the first time a Grand Master's been humbled by a machine but what makes alphago different is that it's the first demonstration that machines can truly learn and think in a human way alphago's victory shocked experts in the artificial intelligence community many thought such an event was at least a decade away so firstly a few questions why is this important and what's all the fuss alphago shows that machines can really learn how so well instead of using brute force to calculate all the moves that could make like previous a is alphago used reinforcement learning and neural networks to mimic the learning process of a human brain keep in mind that the ancient Chinese game go has many more possible moves than chess as there are atoms in the entire universe so there's no way of just calculating every possible move on the board that's practically impossible for this reason go is the holy grail of AI and learning to do such a task from scratch is a huge feat further to this deepmind's creators say that the algorithm can learn many more things without alteration or guidance in other words the AI is general-purpose we always used to talk about what if we could eventually crack go and have a program that could be the world champion then we must have invented some generic general-purpose algorithm so maybe we're on the cusp of all of them if you ask a great go player why they play the particular move sometimes they'll just tell you it felt right so you can the one way to think of it is that go is a much more intuitive game whereas chess is a much more logic based game so what is deep mind google deepmind is a british artificial intelligence company that was founded in September of 2010 as deepmind technologies was renamed when it was acquired by Google in 2014 for 500 million dollars interestingly enough this was just after Facebook had just finished negotiations with them in 25 and another fun fact Elon Musk is actually an investor in the company just to keep an eye on them of course deep mine received the company of the Year award by the Cambridge computer laboratory in 2014 so where did deep mind come from deep mind was first to start up co-founded by demis hassabis in 2010 Dennis was a child genius of sorts and went from being a chess prodigy and reaching master level at age 13 on to becoming the lead programmer of Lionhead Studios for groundbreaking games such as black and white after this he went on to start his own gaming studio before leaving to complete some extra studies at the University College of London this is where he would meet the future co-founders of deep mind in 2010 so what is the goal of deepmind technologies according to their website their goal is to solve intelligence they are trying to achieve this by combining the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms or in other words they want to formalize intelligence find out what it is and how it works the endgame is not just to implement this into machines but also understand the human brain demos explains further quote attempting to distill intelligence into an algorithmic construct may prove to be the best path to understanding some of the enduring mysteries of our minds end quote the key here is that this machine is general-purpose this is very important but more on this later okay so how does this all work the AI from deep mind uses a technique called deep reinforcement learning which makes it very different from other AIS such as IBM's Watson or the primitives theory or Google now the AIS just mentioned were only developed for a predefined purpose and only function within their scope deep mind claims that their system is not pre-programmed and it learns from experience using only raw pixels as data input so the way we start off training alphago is by showing it a hundred thousand games that strong amateurs are played that we've downloaded from the internet and we first initially get alphago to mimic the human player but of course ultimately we would like alphago to be stronger than human amateurs and compete with the top professionals so the way we do that is after we take that first version that's learn to mimic human play we then allow it to play itself 30 million times on our servers and using reinforcement learning it the system learns to improve itself incrementally through avoiding its errors and increasing and improving its win rate against older versions of itself and after all these games then you end up with a new version that can beat the old version the original version around 1897 technically the reinforcement that deepmind uses is model free meaning that it doesn't need a structure or set of rules to learn according to MIT s take on the Google algorithm the neural network in theory should be able to access an external memory in a manner that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain in a way it almost seems like our brains design might be the most efficient way for the creation of local intelligence who would have guessed so that's all good what about this general-purpose term what does that actually mean well because the machine learns from bore experience and data it can perform well across a wide variety of tasks straight out of the box okay so that's enough talk let's watch the system in action learning how to play break out and remember the machine didn't have any foreknowledge as to what task it was going to complete it had to figure out how to do everything only from its own experience is the machine before training so this is literally the first time the machine has ever seen this data stream and it's controlling the green rocket here and it's and you can see it's losing its three lives immediately so it's basically terrible at the game as you would expect now after training this is like overnight we leave it playing the game overnight on a normal computer computer so for about eight hours you come back in the morning and now it's superhuman level so now the machine can play space invaders better than any human can it smuggled the world the game world so while it knows where the space foam Raiders will be ahead of time so as the space invaders speed up when you get less of them on the screen it does as far as short is a kind of predictive shot of where the final Space Invader will be in a few seconds but the cool thing is after understanding how to play a few games it will be able to transfer this knowledge and understanding across more games at the moment deep mind is currently playing games from the 1970s and 80s but work is currently being done on more complex 3d games such as doom which appeared in the early 90s so what could general-purpose AI be useful we'd love to use these types of algorithms for things like healthcare and science and improve the speed of breakthroughs in those areas by helping human experts achieve more in a number of interviews Denis has talked about applications and healthcare smartphone assistance and robotics as possible applications for general AI some other applications of such AI include online customer service computer vision finance general computer science and news publishing and writing general purpose AI actually could be huge it can be thought of as another emerging science much like Newtonian physics laid the groundwork for technology such as rockets a science founded in general purpose digital neural networks that use reinforcement learning could lay the groundwork for unimaginable things in the near future ok so almost at the end of the video but there's one pressing question should we be worried in the thousands of years of meaningful civilization our modern existence right now is an anomaly we've overcome the limits of nature with technology that helps us facilitate such a lifestyle but artificial intelligence is different the reason being AI is the first thing humans have created that tends to function in a way that we can't predict so should we worry my belief is that the fear of the unknown is mostly what drives the hysteria that arises from AI anxiety there's not enough time in this video to go through all the theories of how things could turn out but it's an interesting topic within itself the website wait but why has a fairly interesting and comprehensive look at AI we don't have time to explore it all but the article does raise an interesting point though it's about how humans have an inner bill to perceive exponential change for a long time people aren't going to take AI seriously and it would seem like progress is very slow but then suddenly it could overtake our wildest expectations one of the methods that AI could use to achieve this outcome is by giving itself an ability for self improvement thus following the law of accelerating returns Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have both shown their reservations towards AI but others like Paul Ellen co-founder of Microsoft have different views if you can forget about the movie Terminator for a second there is a possibility that AI could be man's greatest aide fixing fundamental problems on our planet and allowing us to have technology and infrastructure that could have otherwise taken us centuries if we try to figure it out ourselves but on the other hand there is a possibility that AI could be malicious and would outwit us but at this stage we really just don't know yet and again this is a story for another day so at the moment I'm not worried but cautiously optimistic as for deep mind one of their conditions after Google's acquisition was that they establish an AI Ethics Board and I think most of us would agree that that's a prudent decision all in all we may be at a historic point a critical point in artificial intelligence the future could see deep neural Learning and general purpose AI in our smartphones and computers some say that we might even have to start thinking of a whole new economy reason being AI could take over a lot of information intensive specialized jobs leaving only jobs that are creative or emotional in nature something that a I might never achieve I honestly can't say where all of this will lead with any certainty but then again I don't think anyone can if you take a look at the macro picture in all of this after many decades of trying to build smarter computers and algorithms it turns out that the best blueprint was in our heads the whole time the human brain so naturally our minds are capable of so much it just depends on how we use it so that's the end of the video thanks for watching guys
