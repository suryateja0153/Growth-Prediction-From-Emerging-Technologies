 okay so this is the integrative seminal research series organized by the department of information and computation technologies and my name is hector Geffner as Albert said someday one of the organizers and today's my pleasure to introduce myself okay okay so and to make the story short about the introduction I arrived to Barcelona and to I Crean to the Pompeu Fabra at the end of 2001 okay that makes me one of the first generation actually I created first first column probably one of the oldest guys okay in the department as as well before coming to Barcelona I was a professor in Caracas in a similar university and before that I was researches in the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in New York and before that I did a PhD at UCLA under the supervision of Judea pearl that is very well known as the father of of Bayesian networks okay so I'll try to give sort of a relatively general talk okay that will touch some of the things that we do in the group so I'll start first with a group okay so I'm a proud card-carrying member of this group is the AI group as you see we have many people okay so many good people again we don't have that many women okay that's okay so maybe I can't quickly introduce or get people here that you often see and not the name so Corky's collaborator okay it's a declare professor then we have Jonathan we have Philippos we have the mere or some we have um the students are some missing students as well then Gallagher descends and Dmitry are UPF fellows victor is a professor and as of sir Gabbar is a professor but not in our department okay he has chosen to endanger his soul working in the Department of Economics okay nobody's perfect as so here is one the last year of a fellow okay some of you may have been at the talk I gave a few months ago in the CCB so part of the talk okay will be common but will be new I'll try to make some new jokes though that would you can count that one okay okay so one of the one of the things okay everybody is the RIA is very much in the news okay in the last few years and one of the things that brings a I do the news are some development some applications and so on I'll also some fears okay for instance this is an article in The Guardian okay Elan musk okay warning that artificial intelligence is our biggest existential threat so we have a few others okay like Bill Gates in a Washington Post okay I don't understand why some people are not concerned okay and even a physicist okay Stephen Hawking saying that artificial intelligent a what he gets too clever us as humans will be like ants okay so many fears so the question is is is this field justify has AI been solved or something close to that and in order to allocate this fear okay so I'll show you a couple of videos or and then we can relax and uh enjoy the talk so this is this one if it works okay sorry it doesn't so how does it work okay okay so this one is from the DARPA challenge of 2015 this means this is last year okay so the task is what robot to get inside the house and you see that it's not their problem is so simple thinking about it the funnel found a handle okay and and this reflects a little bit against some of the challenges okay Karen challenges in the eye and robotics okay you can you may think that this is an accident okay and so on but actually was not the only accident in okay here a few more okay very quickly so we get to see the same one okay but actually the task is now so easy okay so one of the nice things about artificial intelligence is that you start valued even the most stupid things okay so in a sense the computational perspective is very generous on the human condition even the most stupid things are very challenging okay for artificial intelligence as opposed to some of the things that in principle do not require appear to require some intelligence so basically the plan for the talk is so I'll tell some general themes like so what is the eye a little bit of the history so why is now in the media and again so a lot of this is because of some the success of some machine learning technique so I'll talk a little bit about that and then I'll focus on some of the things that we do in the group I will not be talking about everything that is done in the group there are many things that many research lines see in the group salmon which I'm not involved at all actually and there isn't a strong machine learning processor as well so I'll talk just about planning part that is related to this idea of general intelligence and so if we have time then I'll talk some philosophy and uses and risk okay because there are certain even the robots maybe not taking over the world yet okay there are actually some dangers are gonna have to do for instance about losing jobs and and things like that so the job that I want to make about this video section two jokes okay because this is one about opening the door another sort of challenge in 2015 where the first time is Amazon okay started the so-called Amazon picking challenge and the Amazon picking challenge is to have robots at camping things from shelves as you know Amazon uses robots but uses robots to move shelves okay why to move shelves to operators because it cannot retrieve the items so rather than retrieving the item it retrieves the Shelf that contains the item and brings the whole shelf to the operator that is hidden somewhere okay so to take home lessons for this first part if the robots actually takeover okay the world so for the time being you can be safe if you close the door okay the ads first thing and noticing what's happening with the Amazon picking challenge if the robots actually get into the house and they ask you for the keys all you have to do is they are on the Shelf okay and you will be pretty safe as well so let's get going so artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science okay and it studies intelligent behavior from a very particular protect perspective okay so the computational point of view so it uses a very peculiar type of telescope okay understanding a behavior from the point of view of artificial intelligence is to be able to generate the behavior by in a computer sometimes in the computer you need also some sort of body like sensors and actuators okay like if you want a robot okay to do some cooking not in the market yet okay so these activity X may be solving the puzzle recognizing an object and we may much okay understanding a story a joke again you doing the dishes okay many many things okay so understanding means I can get a computer to do it and this is very challenging not only on things that in principle require intelligence okay okay so they brand a actually we say that the father of artificial intelligence is Alan Turing okay is one of the greatest scientists again the 20th century and definitely one of the heroes in the better science artificial intelligence okay tooling was the first guy who developed a universal programming computer okay so anything that a computer now can do okay was possible to be done in in the machine okay that tooling and vision okay this is a 2d machine okay just in paper an infinite tape okay a head that can move to the left and right depending on what's on the tape and a controller State okay decamp the machine that can be in several controller states that's a Turing machine anything that can be computed okay but a computer now could be computed by a pencil and paper okay with the machine that Turing device in 1936 actually the color machines will you faster but still all the analysis of complexity about different type of problems are still okay use the tool in machine so we say that a problem is np-hard np-complete okay we'll come to that later is basically by analyzing to the machine it's not actually the current computers another thing that is worth emphasizing okay about this work by Turing is that often you hear about applied research basic research and so on but nobody will question the fact that computers are useful okay okay so you carry them in your pockets okay to talk to people you can buy tickets to do to the concert whatever okay but the goal of tooling was not practical at all okay so these problems could not be further from the mind of children at that time children devised this machine okay that is the blue paint okay from the computers that we have today by trying to tackle a very abstract mathematical problem that was posed at the beginning of the 20th century by a mathematician okay David Hilbert hilber wanted to know at the beginning of 20th century whether he was possible to mechanize proves in predicate logic okay what I call first-order logic or predicate logic and at that time there were no computers there were no way to make a nice okay the process so to liam basically came up with this idea of these universal computers okay just to have a theory of what it means and make a nice process to solve this problem and actually the way that we solve these sort of conjecture or these problem posed by Hilbert is I show that that's impossible okay children show that proven theories in predicate logic is an undecidable problem in it there is no tuning machine okay that can solve the problem in finite time means there is no computer now on a hundred years that will solve this problem in finite time either this an undecidable problem will see the whole support differential between problems that are polynomial and non polynomial we still use okay the idea of the Turing machine as well to the associate father of artificial intelligence are published in 1950 okay four years before he committed suicide one of the first AI papers were that's where the idea of the Turing test okay came and the name of the movie located name of the movie okay that some of you may have seen recently the imitation game comes actually from the 2d test and as little to do good what goes on in the movie that is about the Krypton okay it goes from there from the Nazis at that time okay this was in early 50s okay by the end of the 50s is that the discipline of artificial intelligence okay takes some shape okay some of the founders okay are here somewhere well now like Claude Shannon okay McCarthy Minsky okay that passed away not long ago and basically the beginnings of this Logan II in it was something if somebody will claim that machines cannot do X so the task is to disprove the skeptics by writing a program that does X okay so that was in some sense the idea from a methodological point that was not too good but in some sense was the computer and programmable computer was a new toy that was a natural thing to do at that time actually my first contact with the I came with this book 1963 ok I I don't know what I was okay I've been born by then actually okay but in the early 80s when I was with my bachelor's and found this book in bookshelf okay with many papers about programs that play chess checkers prove theorems in logic and geometry and and things like that okay so uh if you look at the first decades okay so up to the 80s and even up to the 90s okay first you see that they I sort of split into slightly different areas that once in a while they'll converge and diverge again okay like planning a reason in learning okay language processing vision of robotics okay do up to the 80s I would say there was a lot of progress in and programs that have very specialized abilities they so collects with systems if you want a system can make diagnoses of infectious diseases or things like that so you could write the program by interviewing experts and actually it's programs did pretty well in comparison with the best experts okay in sort of finding what what is the hidden deceased okay to express the patterns of symptoms however those programs are tried to do let's say story understanding you know trying to understand a joke and things basically were not robust told many dissertations were written at that time but mainly the progress were used as demos okay so if you run the few examples that they author have so you get some interesting resolved but if you had a new example again you a scenario okay basic this program just broke down okay by even the end of the night isn't even today so there are no programs with the normal abilities of a five-year-old child in the motor visual or linguistic even in some of these early disease beginning to change okay and these are shows relation with why we hear so much of AI in in the news okay some applications some some interest of the largest corporations okay Apple Google Facebook IBM and so on so we listen about cars that come drive I'm the serve so I interacting with mobile phone okay by voice okay even there is a very nice movie about that about the guy that gets in love with the operating system okay office phone I would say that amount all the AI movies I think for me at least that's probably one of the best okay and actually to say something true that okay for one reason or the other people are very happy about interacting with machines and less happy about interacting with people okay so there is a problem there okay but it's a symptom okay also face recognition okay number of other things maybe in the last couple of years so then a couple of breakthroughs again I came from this company deep mind I was acquired by Google is a program that learns to play Atari Atari video games just by looking basically at the pixel information in the screen and just the score and actually more recent in the last few months okay a program that finally achieved top world level in the game of go okay this is just in the last few months okay for those don't remember so a program that beat Kasparov okay so the world champion was in 97 so it's basically 20 years since that level mothers were achieving the game of chess and in the game of go something in common about these different applications is that one way or the other they tend to use some machine learning technique so let me go relatively quickly over what this machine basic machine learning techniques are let's say that we want a program to recognize digits okay from 0 to 9 okay so people write these digits in different way and you want a program we'll take an image okay of one of these digits and we'll output okay one of the 10 symbols okay from 0 to 9 so you're in some sense classifying images okay into 10 classes ok corresponding to each one of the digits okay it says that if you want this function and you want to write a program that hand okay that program is going to be mmm very brittle and not robust okay it's going to work from some draws is not going to work for many others so the best technique for this and for many other problems okay that was a bit found by people near is that you don't want to write the program for this by hand okay the best approach ok country for this is to learn is function from label examples what it means label examples is I give you many of these pairs so I give you an image and I tell you okay this is actually this image contains actually a six I give you this image and I say this actually contains a two I give you this image and see this image contains actually a seven and so on so what you get is a set of label examples or the inputs and they intended output and the idea is that you're supposed to learn this function f okay from these examples so the form of this function from is a parametric function so all what you are learning is not so much the form of the function but the parameters of this function often by casting the problem as a problem minimizing error and then applying some algorithm like gradient descent okay in too many ways these arrow squares and and so on actually one common function that is used is the so-called neural networks okay where in some sense the parameter is okay our inspire or guide function inspired by the working of the real okay neural nets even though this is just a metaphor actually for those of you that these seems to be strange so we are all familiar with this idea one way or the other so the most common way which is idea pieces in regression you have a plane with a bunch of points okay you see that in the newspaper all the time and you're supposed to pass a line okay just to see some trend in some data so the question how you draw the line so in some sense what you're learning is a linear function that minimizes the square the square root of respect to all the points okay that you have in the in that plane so in that case you learn the parameters of a linear function in most cases emotional and okay you deal with nonlinear functions that have the same expressive limitation and in many other cases okay you either mix this idea of supervised learning what you're given inputs and outputs with ideas from unsupervised learning what you learn okay without an output or you learn from ring from reinforcements and from penalties as we'll see in a second actually when you read things like these okay so that the Google brain okay can find cuts in videos and things like that so in some sense okay these sort of techniques normally the ones that account for these results normally the type of neural networks or the neural network techniques uses call in this case as deep learning normally phrase deep learning rephrase to relatively all algorithms okay the algorithms that people have developed in there in the 80s okay like back propagation that is ways to tune these weights okay and supervised learning okay bad with more data okay with more layers of hidden weights and well of course with more CPU of power okay in some other cases so gain for instance this is also from thing a couple of years ago okay so this is about the deep mind that learns how to play Atari games I will talk a little bit more about this Atari games later on because something we have done work on and in this case so nobody is teaching okay how to move let's say the paddle in this case or the way that this program learns is not by supervised learning all the information that he has is just a pixel structure and a score so it's a form of unsupervised learning but it's learning indirectly okay from penalties and rewards okay so now so a machine learning methods okay there are these days all over again so if you really want them to go to the industry and get the job okay it's not a bad idea okay to get into that okay and to put words like deep learning and big data and things like that but of course all these machine learning techniques also have some limitations okay he from the point of view of general intelligence that is in some sense one of the originals and still sort of one of the current goals in artificial intelligence so intelligence normally says share with every two Reese implies or problems thinking and so on so even though the machine learning techniques okay so I have producing impressive applications so the idea that all the Reese okay again for knowledge is to associate responses with inputs or stimuli okay it looks like insufficient in a sense okay this looks a psychology up to the 50s what it was called behaviorism okay so in principle actually most of the human learning and probably also in many animals as well it's about how the physical and social worlds work and to use this knowledge for various purposes purpose like for instant generating behavior okay let's say behavior for achievement goals so you use a model a predictive model of the physical world in order to get the behavior without requiring okay so much training so many many examples and to have at the same time much more flexibility okay if you change the game if something happens again you still can reason about what's going on and you have to do it many many times in order to decide what to do or other things that these models of the physical and social was can be uses also for interpreting the behavior of others for sensing the world for communicating with others and things like that so many of these thoughts actually not easy at all to be able to capture okay by jazz stimulus responses okay and and that in some sense make you sort of systems that may be flexible certain inputs okay but have so the more limited functionality if the goal changes of the problem okay all the experience that you have that you have all these reactions that you learn in principle ok cannot be used so you have to run it from scratch again so just to illustrate a little bit ok some of the things that we do in AI group related to planning so I'd like to illustrate what planning is about from the point of view of autonomous behavior ok so basically if you want to program okay do you want to program an agent Robert ok to be autonomous in a certain cell so you don't have to tell it direct ok the agent so you can do it basically in three ways either you can program the behavior by hand ok this correspond to hardwiring the behavior it's thought that nature does that ok for many elements and many circumstances and even for us in many cases as well second approaches okay he learned okay so it's very flexible okay you learn from the experience become like experience and you see I mean how to behave in in terms of the results that you got now there is a third approach okay that actually is relatively well known hopefully the situation will change in the near future of this is what we are strong with is that you don't specify the behavior by hand okay you don't have why it not you have to learn it but you derive it effectively automatically okay from a model of the world so basically have a model allows me to make predictions how can I use this model that allow me to make predictions in order to derive the control to derive what to do okay so let me just go very quickly over an example again so of course does that take my class have seen this example many times it does familiar with the AI basic textbook okay I'm taking this example from textbook by historicism Peter Norbeck so here is the problem that you have there is an agent this guy here these guys wants to get to the gold okay but in order to get to the goal he has to avoid meeting this dangerous monster okay called the goombas and he has to avoid falling in one of these pits okay the problem will be trivial okay but the issue is the guy does not know what the gold is that's not the where they won't possess does not owe anything okay but it knows how the world works so it knows that if it's here and it moves the ride is going to be in this cell and it also knows it has some sensors so it even though it does not know what all these things are so there are some sensors that give partial information about the true state of the system so if you're a distance one from the wound boost okay you're gonna send some bad smell okay so you so let's say you move here and use sensor but smell so conclusion is that it must be Homebush here or here not here because you were here and there were no bumpers here something with the pits all these speeds if you are so a distance okay you can detect some okay that says okay there is a pit at distance 1 so and this is the bridge so I move here and the conclusion is there has to be a pit either here or here okay so now so you can take this problem and approach this problem in these three different ways so one homework that you can give to students is give me a controller for this guy in this particular world okay just program the controller by hand second approach is use some sort of learning algorithm okay that every time that the guy dies in a pit or with the wound boosts and so on without achieving the goal of getting to the goal it gets penalized okay and the idea is how to optimize the ward third approach is given that I know how the sensors work okay how the actions work in the world okay figure out okay given the goal that you want to get to the goals what to do after the solution to his problem so you start here let's say you move right you see okay you send something so this is not safe this is not safe so the best thing that you can do is to go back you go back okay you move here again you see a signal so whom poster principal could be here or here okay and but you were here before so you didn't sense any smell so this cell has contains no won't push nope it's so you can move safely here but you have to integrate the information from the sensors okay in order to to get finally to the goal so it's a very simple problem you can talk in different ways actually they are not very good machine learning algorithms even to tackle something as simple as this one okay and of course it's not too interest interesting from a point of view of AI to have a controller written by hand because you have a control written by hand for this particular problem that is not going to work for another problem what I want to have is something that is generic okay that can handle variables can access the change values of variables sensors and so on and I plug this problem in the input and I get a controller in the output no matter what the problem is about so to see some of the computational challenges in these again soil focus only on the simplest type of planning setting in the simplest form of planning setting what you have is a set of variables okay with a set of possible values you have a set of actions the actions okay can change the values of some of the variables okay for simplicity assume that there monistic aliso you know if you apply this section which variables going to change and have and you want to find a sequence of actions that is going to map some initial values of these variables that you know into some goal values by the way it is extremely simple model and this problem here it's very hard to fit into this other model okay why because in this problem there is incomplete information so the initial state features a number of things that you do not know you don't know where the wound Puss is where the pits are even where the thing you're looking for is okay so this is a much simplified setting but it's still pretty generic okay the idea I'm planning is to come up with this box when you put problems of this form in this sort of variables what are the initial values what are the goal values that you want okay in the decide situation and what actions you have available how they change the values of the variable and AD in these cases come up with an open loop control just a sequence of action because there is no feedback in this model okay so it's a very simple type of model so people in the I call this a classical by vanilla planet because it's the most simple type of model okay of course there are many rich or modest model involving complete information about the state where you are okay needed for dealing with the problem had before stochastic action sensors okay mostly as powers as they are called partially observable Markov decision processes and I'm not going to get into that but basically there are many ways to make these type of more and much more interesting and challenging however even this stupid very simple model is already computationally intractable meaning that if you try to solve problems with a few variables okay even under 20 variables and you are not careful okay if things are not going to be solved you're not going to get the behavior things will explode an example of this okay so I have this box I want to build this generate box and I want to be able to input problems okay I don't care what the problems are as long as I can model them as a set of variables actions that change the value of variables and an initial situation that you start and a final situation I want to reach in this case the variables will be the location of blocks and the actions basic allow you to change blocks from one place to the other well it turns out that finding a plan okay so the behavior that achieves the goal From Religion situation is finding a path in the graph okay however what is the problem okay that the size of the graph is exponential in the number of variables okay so this is sometimes not so easy to grasp or people don't care about scalability but it is a crucial problem as the key source of insight as we will see as well for instance for 20 blocks okay this graph will contain more than 10 to the 24 nodes okay so bunch of zeros so and this looks like an a stupid problem okay just solving a blocks problem what you have to go from one configuration to the other but just an stacking and stacking blocks so the question is how can you find paths that connect a given node to a target node okay in such huge graphs okay so no time of the universe that will be sufficient okay to explore as many nodes as the ones that we have here okay related to this okay there is another idea that related to Turing inside okay so tuning what it show is that there are certain perfectly well-defined problems that cannot be solved in finite time these are non decidable problems okay starting from the 80s again so 50 years okay almost 50 years after Turing original papers people also use okay she's to establish another boundary between the province that in principle can be solve efficiently in polynomial time versus dose that cannot be soft apparently in polynomial time there are people in computer sighs normally they call this promise NP have you heard about np-complete problems and so on and the NP is not that is not polynomial but it is polynomial in a non deterministic non physical Turing machine that you cannot actually implement okay so people discovered and actually one of the open problems okay if you solve this problem okay you get the Turing Award I'm probably more than that is whether this frontier between the problems that can be so efficient Lee and those that apparently cannot be solved okay that are np-hard okay so they are actually the nice align there or not so this is the question of P okay whether it's equal not to NP something that is not and so but everybody a bit of science would think that the two things are different that one class is polynomial promise with polynomial time solutions the other problem that require exponential time sometimes even double exponential time as as well so these sort of exponential time problems include all the planning problems what in order to consider the feature so the number of possible features to look at grows exponentially with the horizon okay so basically choose in actions getting a behavior from mothers or your prediction so the problem of using a predictive model to get behavior is computationally intractable so the point is even if you have good predictions it doesn't mean that you can figure out what to do the problem figure out what to do remains computationally high and this is what the working planning is aim for okay dealing with this computational challenge where in some sense evaluating the future by consider all the possibilities like solving a huge mental maze so the question is how planners do this these days okay I'm just talking about the simplest type of planners this vanilla where everything is deterministic actions change variables in a way that you know and so on I'm sure this another question for those interested in how the brain works okay is how brains achieve anything like this of course you can say that the brains don't have to deal with these huge mental mazes but is really having purposes okay so there is no reason in principle that if you get AI systems to consider and to select efficiently course of action by considering futures okay this cannot give some insight into what the mind is doing actually I will say that computational limits not computers themselves or many people in Congress eyes that used a computer to run their algorithms okay that's one use okay but the most interesting news is to understand the computational limits to see okay how you can tackle this problem because if you don't exploit automatically the structure of problems okay you cannot deal with them and we don't know how the brain works that is pretty robust and it doesn't break due to the number of variables okay so that is a basic computational challenge okay so if you look at this challenge from the point of view you can get some insight into how the brain is actually one of the solutions that people have found for this problem should be solution so it came from a blog in a group it is the following very simple idea okay even though of finding a path in this huge mazes okay is something is still intractable in the worst case what you can get is estimates so I am in the Indies in this state and I can do three actions I can take block a sorry Block C and put it on a I can take block a and put it on the table I can take what block a and put it on top of C okay so the same idea applies when you have 50 blocks doesn't matter the point is it's very easy to compute estimates of the distance to go okay so I can compute in polynomial time no polynomial time I can compute automatically no matter what the problem is about one is expressed in terms of variables actions that change the value of what it was and so on no I don't care what domain it is okay I can in a domain independent way in a generic way I can get in low polynomial times numbers that gave me some sense of direction to the search so if you go this way it looks you're gonna be a distance three okay from when you want to go if you go like this okay it looks then you're gonna be at distance - these are just estimates they don't have to be accurate okay to get completely accurate estimates will be as hard as solving the problem itself okay well here again you get three in this case the estimates are so good that if in each case you move okay you take the action that takes you closer to the goal according to these holistic estimates okay you just solve the problem with no search at all actually some of the methods used to get these estimates allow you also to in a part note to tell you which are the nodes that are even worth evaluating so here I can say these two guys are not even worth evaluating I know they're not gonna be good okay so basically you get not just by evaluated all the possible things that you can do in a state but if you want something has a relation let's say though the ways that people play chess okay people don't consider the possible moves okay they get very very much immediately which are the moves okay that makes sense to evaluate and to consider in a more detailed way so by looking at the computational problem and at the computational challenge so you get techniques like this one okay getting these up rises automatically in a domain independent way that are not only computational effective okay but at the same time okay have some cognitive appeal okay in case we might want to talk more about that later okay so more generally in in in the eye and within the group will not only consider this type of mathematical models okay but we can see the variety of Mahler's so some of them others that we consider for instance our constraint satisfaction and such where the task is to find a value assignment to a set of valuables that satisfies a set of constraints in the case of sat the variables are a boolean and the constraints are clauses the generalization of this is called constraints satisfaction okay there are many any problems okay that can be mapped as sad or constraint satisfaction problems okay many other problems for Easton involve reasoning with probabilities okay so Bayesian networks is a graphical language for expressing probablistic knowledge on top of graphs and the task there is how to find a posterior probability there were some variables given some observations third problem is actually a variation of the one we talked about what happens if you are doing planning with incomplete information and you get feedback okay if there is uncertainty it makes sense to sense the environment so the program I mentioned before this little game won't boost okay you need to sense the environment you know to figure out what to do next in those cases the idea is how to get any strategy just not just a sequence of actions because what you do is going to depend on what you observe and of course there are mothers that involve not just one actors but maniac to listen Lee called a multi agent problems that bring a number of subtlety that way and that relates also to ideas in game theory and so on what is okay in all these cases what people in the I and why we try to develop at these boxes okay so we're trying to develop programs that will take any instance of these problems or the planning problem of a planet with feedback of a Bayesian network and at the same time compute approximate solutions you cannot guarantee you're gonna get optimal solutions you're not gonna guarantee that you're gonna solve all the problems because all these problems are computationally intractable okay they are sometimes the algorithms when they are complete sometimes our exponential sometimes our double exponential but the point is to push this sort of combinatorial explosion as far as possible some of the moments are actually particularly expressive okay some planning models this one's called Hamdi peace okay relatively as some people call them AI complete that means if you could have okay a solver that will take any compact representation of a partially observable probabilistic problem in the input and to tell you what to do in the output okay you will be a long way to having a generic and a general in villages okay but these are sort of very intractable problems where the key issue is how to do cost-effective inference in order to a scale okay it's not just you have an algorithm that is complete and correct nobody cares okay okay of course you care again but that's not the challenge okay the challenge is to be able to scale up actually the methodology you know these serious these days in the eye as opposed to what I mentioned before were people the demos okay up to the eighties is based on bench master competition because in the worst case all these models are computationally hopeless okay but in practice okay many many problems okay can be actually solve so sad for instance is a problem is np-complete meaning that in the worst case any algorithm will take exponential time okay but on the other hand if you feed a problem too sad involving 100,000 variables and 100,000 closes okay it's likely it's going to work very well okay define these worst-case behavior so you want in some sense the worst case behavior to be exhibited only in the worst case instances okay there are normally not normal gains since that one is dealing with now many of these cases their competition so it's relatively easy to enter in any of these things okay you have a very good idea about how to exploit the structure for any of these models so the best way okay to go run you enter into the competitions you do well in the competition you win the competition and then people pay attention okay to the technique that you have they cannot avoid okay doing that something otherwise it often often happens in inside actually among the relatively new competition is this general video game competition that has started in 2015 the idea of this competition you should bid one of these boxes and the people are organizing the competition they get this box they fill it with video games that you have not seen and they basic score the different solvers according to how well they do in the video games same thing with the planning competition and so on you submit your boxes okay they feed it with different sort of problems you have no idea what the problem is about just the mathematical structure okay and and all these solutions are evaluated in these in this way actually some of the benefits of this genetic approach this genetic algorithms is subtle you may get new problems okay and you can take from yourself one of these genetic algorithms and use it okay so I'll show just results from one of these algorithms also on the Atari video games so basically these setting okay was so this interface and these setting okay not their algorithms but the simulation setting was done by people in Alberta a couple of years ago three years ago okay actually it's the setting that the people in deep man use when they published in nature paper about how to learn how to do these things in deep reinforcement learning and so on okay we took some algorithms okay that we develop in the past okay with a couple of former students of the group near and mikkel I would say so these looks again the mathematical structure of the problem looks that is one has very well fit to the genetic algorithms that we have so let's try it and let's see what we get okay and actually it's a very simple paper okay to write because it's taking an algorithm of the Shelf just adapting it to the interface and at the end you get another can play any of these games that is the algebra you develop for something that's completely different okay you see it can relatively discover that it's a good strategy okay once you get past the block to knock all the things on on top the same algorithm for instance is used in actually so the same algorithm okay again was not developed for any of these cities it's completely general it is another game and actually in this by the way this algorithm of ours just tends to do much better than the items of deep mind okay even though there is it's fair to say that is the two things are computing slightly different things so in these famous sort of paper and results that they have they they learn a reactive controller we don't do a reactive controller we use this simulator to simulate a little bit into the future but again so the number of possibilities is huge and to select the action to do actually in this in these domains they do pretty bad ok because in general Monte Carlo methods will not do well in this type of offset I'm not gonna get tired with the more examples of these but some of the applications of these genetic algorithms that we are looking into ok right now are in video games in robotics and it's lonely ok we want to get into this you have to do with dialogue ok against that is a goal-directed activities okay in some sense is planning when you complete information the case of dialogue is also a multi agent problem ok what do you have to model not only your beliefs about the world but also believes about the other guy believes us as well ok so I'm doing in terms of time so I think I'm doing very well what did I do with this lies I lost them ok now thank you ok we're medium help me where is what is this presentation ok here here ok you can ask questions okay in the meantime if no let's see ok quickly quickly quickly ok so it's time to wrap up so of course I didn't get into AI to play Italian ok I wanted to get to the mysteries of the universe ok our place in the universe ok so where we are where we are going and of course one of the appeals in the eye is to use the computational perspective to tackle some interesting issues actually questions like can a machine think I always going to make fun of this question I said we have make a big progress in the 50s the question was can machines think now ok 60 years later so the question is can people think ok so a big progress there ok second question can in Sene be 100% rational okay okay the only guys who will say probably yes okay I even think that people are hundred percent rational who economies okay okay in computer science we know that's impossible you cannot be be a 100 rational even in in a logic as simple as propositional logic because all these models are computationally intractable okay so if you understand okay the limits of computation all these questions I have a very trivial answer by the way one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence is also one of the founders of what's called the school of bounded rationality in economics and the guy actually got a Nobel Prize in Economics before founding okay with other people the eyes every Simon okay and he was very well aware of that problem another one that I like against so can a machine have free will okay so the question like to pose actually that's a chess playing program okay I have free will of course the answer from everyone will be of course it does not okay it's just limited to choose one of the moves from a fixed repertoire okay by applying some evaluation function okay good that would change the chess playing program and now allow you allow this guy to play many other things even to play life and still works the same way many options okay looks ahead into the future and decides what to do okay that's now this program has have free will or it doesn't in principle and the tendency will be okay it is no free will because from the outside if I know how the program works in principle I could predict okay which action is was going to take okay now the question I'm going to going to answer here is just to post some question is whether there is another sort of free will worth having or that you may have email the materialistic world okay but okay I'll keep the others okay reach into some of the mystery okay I mentioned at the beginning about the fears of artificial intelligence so Gator people talked about the singularity okay that soon machines okay will be more intelligent than people and then there's gonna be an exponential explosion because they're going to be even if better machines and so on okay so my point of view is that that's nonsense okay that's nonsense okay whether you take this story to be a topic or this topic okay it's is like some people said is overpopulation in Mars it's not in the foreseeable future however there are some other problems that are in the near future and one of this is automation against automation is a big problem okay and it's a big question is about how society okay who's this is going to to deal with automation where the in principle some jobs are gaming end up going and I'm may not come back as normally has happen in the in the past okay now of course you can take an optimistic view and say okay so how come in a society so if you want to work less there is not less work to do that's going to be a negative effect it looks that that would be a positive effects okay let's what's your bad as things are now okay it's not good to be without a job okay so I so in principle is down there actually so I would say that many of the problems raised by the to mention and artificial intelligence in some sense has to do with this as well okay I have to do with with society okay so we are scientists but before being scientists okay we are citizens okay and of course okay they we want that all these technological developments benefits society at large and and it's clear that the interests of society and the interests of corporations are not always perfectly aligned okay to say at least okay so the question is what we as citizens when we are not clicking likes and things in and in the Facebook so actually I think I have these say I couldn't avoid bringing when one thing from a wrote also wrote and Spanish says I don't know if this is readable at all so a stammerer Sarah Jane Doe Magnus intelligent the calm embrace no estamos llegando Magnus intelligent the calm embrace para hombres estupidos como Martinez oh here my bad translation English were building machines that are like intelligent like people for people that are stupid like machines ok so uh I think it's very acute and we can talk about this - okay just to wrap up I think so what we have seen in the press ok two things one is about fears of artificial intelligence about applications normally having to do with the use of data and and machine learning ok so the idea that this is the arrival of artificial intelligence ok that's still a long way to go ok to get something resembling ok the generality and flexibility of human intelligence is like if you just if you claim on top of a tree or gate doesn't mean that that's like you are closer to the moon ok so the moon is still a long way to go there are many things that machine learning techniques are not intended to do and normal that they don't do is about taking action ok by evaluating the possible futures that's the critical notion for us humans and of course it's also quitting for any notion of general intelligence about this by the way ok I it's good to mention that this company did mine Forrester has shown that they can get very good reactive chess and go players ok meaning without looking into the future so that what they have done is that they traditional chess-playing programs they look into the future ok so see this is what I do what the other will respond what I responded with the guy then they go several levels and then take back chain okay the value of the different outcomes and then they do what appears to be best given the possible responses of the other guy okay normally progress behind it so now machine learning so in the case of going in the case of chairs something we have shown that you can get pretty good chess-playing programs and even go playing programs okay that's right harder okay but just learning such a value function that you don't have to look in the future just one step you do one step and your evaluation function is so good okay that in principle okay you don't need to look further okay so in some sense this casts doubts about so what is the importance of of looking into the future if these programs and this company or is showing that you can do pretty well by learning techniques okay in some sense learning reactions that just look one step into the future now one thing about these is that they learn these valued functions okay for a very specific games using many many examples so these programs that I do this okay they don't have any flexibility okay this program at chess plays chess can not play any other type of situation the same thing about the learning that went into the go program only place go okay so the idea that you need to look into the future okay its validity of generality if you're something general it's very hard to learn the value function and we'll spend all the possible situations that may arise okay something else still AI is I would say far from the capacities of a four-year-old child I heard there are in its journey it's now hitting AI center somebody said about deep learning and all these news that this is not the end he said this is not the beginning of the end of artificial intelligence it says this is not even the beginning of the beginning maybe I will not go that far that is there are many things okay to be done of course in spite of that you can do pretty well in many different type of needs just one last thing okay so many mediate okay a risk and possibilities but this requires informed and concerned citizens against so if you know if one of these all let me know okay okay thank you okay I'm Jorgen I said I introduced myself and I also take the questions okay so easy ones first or SEO thank you for the very entertaining talk and I have a question regarding the general solutions I wonder one once you have a problem usually you have to model it and usually you have to develop in features to represent your your model and features that are humanly developed say so how how do you use a generic solution in that case when a problem may change and has not the same structure or the same domain that the previous problem so for example if you play a game maybe there are some characteristics and make them uniform to reuse the same features but how how you apply general solutions to different problems totally different problems good question so respect to the world features ok so in this type of knowledge normally when talks about variables variables that keep track of the state of a system normally you are trying to control some system ok some environment interactive environment there are variables and in some sense a code the state of this system so what we needed these variables that encoded through state again as some people call them Markovian state so that in some sense when you reach a state doesn't matter how you get there so for the future it all matters of the state where you are in so in a sense these variables are slightly different from what people call features in machine learning algorithms that if you run the same algorithm ok by changing the features and you have to do a lot of engineering so that lets say the classifier works correctly so here in principle so the users are slightly different now machine learning and this type of model-based approach are connected in the way that in many cases these models that we use ok to take decisions they can be learn and they should be learned from data so ideally ok I want to be able to build these models ok just by an stream of inputs that only contain actions and observations so I have a robot and I want a robot who wants to learn okay how to use his arms to pick up a ball let's say starting from scratch so the optimal thing that you could do okay the ultimate challenge is just to learn the - let the robot build a model okay by just looking at streams of actions and observation so it does different things it observes different things so it can infer the state space of the problem himself that he would take from given and ones that you build the model then you can use this model not only to solve that particular problem can be reused okay so so many other type of problems not even changing the girl's initial conditions and so on so what I'm saying is this there's no so much in a split actually there is a whole branch of what is called reinforcement learning that is called model-based reinforcement learning where the idea is not to get reactions but to learn the models themselves so in some sense in model-based reinforcement learning the reinforcement learning problem is mapped okay actually into a planning problem okay so the two things are so even though I split them here they are more connected that when they appear in many other cases if you had an industry I have a problem you have logistics and you have DHL and you want to deal with packages on it so it's easy to model directly by hand okay but you don't have to encode the solution you just encode the dynamics of the problem you encode the sensors you encode all these other things mmm good Luka I love them really still the general problem solving kind shoulder kind of paradigm and this partner a certain point died at least as a point of reference and it only recently came back to life essentially one of the reason why he died has to do at least in the ideology though I cannot talk about the technicalities from somebody weird the ideas that were presented particular by Jerry folder at a certain point which was the following Jerry Fodor was this philosopher he's this fellow who on the one hand he put clearly what I look only the science in the field of artificial intelligence the idea that that he had was that essentially cognition is a computational discipline not a biological discipline for reason that he could argue but at the same time that what really general problem-solving what wants to do is impossible in principle the reason why it is impossible in principle is essentially because we solve lots of problems because we somewhat know how to evaluate the relevance of a piece of information on the fly but there is no theory about relevance period okay so on the one hand he said colony science is very you know very much a computational science on the other hand he said the kind of thing we want to solve with the general solace just really in principle go beyond what we can do so the very first part of the question is how much do you think this theory makes sense in your opinion because you are very much into the same kind of dilemma but then there is a second facet which is some and that's where the question becomes a little more disorganized but and it's better and more interested in and the best way to phrase it is the following I can think so we are these kind of beings who are really good at solving problems period so I would imagine that that there are many hints that artificial intelligence can take from human behavior not because we are you know the greatest or not because we are the optimist all problem soldiers we certainly are not but because we just have the best around essentially and so I can imagine very many cases in which basic ideas of artificial intelligence science in general have influenced a lot cognitive science starting from the difference between memory and programs I mean many many of these kind of things do you think of any idea that we can provide that could influence the way you work or in better but wait can you give me an example which any of the kind of problem-solving the humans actually do has been factored in in the way you work to improve a way an algorithm works or a kind of solution problem works and I was you know yeah questions first about the jury photos that criticism and and so on so I will say that these type of criticism okay for the program of course do they have any influence okay at all okay in in AI or anything okay this happens of those with armature philosophers okay so you're in the trenches okay dealing with the algorithm with these things and this is a very generic sort of philosophical argument so the question is there are too many relevant sins so how how okay so it's related to what I'm saying so given that he have hundreds of variables and only few of them are relevant okay so how do you do how do you don't explode with the number of variables that's precisely the computational issue okay and they and the point that the novelty respect to what happen let's say in the early 60s actually as Lucas said one of the face AI programs okay at all was called the general problem solver actually one of the others was ever Simon that I mentioned before and idea was very similar you feed problems in the input okay and you get solutions in the output what was the problem with the general problem solver is that be computationally it doesn't work okay yeah and I would say and a lot of the work done in the 60s and 70s up to eight dissing a I was also very introspective so people were trying to use insights or observations okay from psychology and so on Simon in particular was sort of participate but these type of introspective based AI in the 90s got a very bad reputation so these days they were hard to publish in any I conference if your justification is this is the way that people do it okay so what you have to show is that your method actually works and the way that it actually works works much better than other methods around is to see it works with many many variables and see whether your solver will break or not okay so they sell in some sense the jury photos is not an impediment okay is part of the challenge okay and there are many ideas that being developed okay for addressing this challenge okay that is part of the computational complexity how not to have solvers that will break merrily because the problem vault many variables okay there are problems that inherently hard I don't care about those okay so those in that sense I is so there is a notion that from a computational point of view some problems you now be able to solve this is this in fact np-hard so it's it's of course things that eventually will break but the questions when did it break do they break when you have 20 variables or they break when you have 1 million or 100 million so it makes some difference and these in some sense is what is being an issue this is about the first part second part it's about exchanges between let's say psychology neuroscience and the eye okay so what there are some insights coming let's say from psychology and so on that we can use computationally so let me just briefly mention about the other way as you mentioned things like Bayesian networks reinforcement learning some of these ideas so are having some impact okay in some areas and neuroscience and cognitive the other way so it's not a good bridge to computation so we're problems are computationally for instance let's take the theory of mind okay so the theory of mind is something in psychology is very much sort of in in fashion for the last okay ten years or more and is about the ability of people okay to deal with other people okay as different than objects so there's a lot of objects and there's a lot of people and there are many things and many abilities they have to have to do with people so psychologists give a lot of importance to the theory of mind and actually when kids okay very small kid so they are very good about dealing with the beliefs of other kids are body there are reactions and things like that about stories okay that involve multiple agents and so on but from a computational point of view when you look at this theory of mine ideas you see G that looks like magic okay so so this and looks to me okay or to take another idea that to me I'm sort of impressed how lightly is taken in and let's say neuroscience Mill Road neurons okay so mineral neurons okay some people ascribe them sort of things that are impossible to compute and they are going to be completely won whenever that's crazy that empathy is based on me remember that's a very complex thing so in a sense that is I would say that there is a big distance okay okay have to do with computations so we focus on computation it's a very a very restricted game so even those of us whose real interest is the human mind we are sufficiently entertained okay but just paying attention so k2d restrictions while sort of not being able okay to assimilate or to use insights coming let's say from the behavioral science so that's why they for in the Bayesian networks that were there all over okay when Judea purple is the book in eighty eight if you look at the cover of the book ok Bayesian networks there it's actually it's a picture of the cut okay it's basic showed that the guy has not something like a Bayesian network in the head so I made fun of Julia at that time was my advisor and say against you got a true believer in Bayesian networks that you think we have him in the heads but so years later okay you have many people Roberta okay George and some of the people who actually use it the whole theory of Bayesian networks to understand how babies okay so learn about causal relations and so on so I would say that the computational perspective is very crucial and very interesting source of insight and I'm not sure that people who are not working with these sort of understand okay the importance of that why by the way why Bayesian networks were developed ok probability theory existed for centuries okay so at least two centuries but Juliet developed Bayesian networks in some sense to make the computation of probably destructible so the first Bayesian networks were trees and rather than having exponential time inferences polynomial is actually linear in the number of variables so many of these insights came by just trying to comply with certain computation restriction so I think even for understanding the mind but that's pure speculation it's good to pay attention to that and then such what makes it hard the other exchange okay if this long answer okay I'm people are getting hungry and angry okay any other question I promise to be short and quick okay so I'll take this moment of hesitation to thank you for being here and until next time
