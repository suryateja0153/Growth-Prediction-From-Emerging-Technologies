 most people have some understanding of the concept of virtual reality it's when you put yourself in a computer simulated environment often by putting on some very silly looking headset however very few people know about a similar emerging technology called augmented reality now unlike virtual reality which places you in a completely artificial setting or when in reality is when a digital layer is superimposed on something that you're actually looking at you've probably seen it in action without even realizing a typical example might be when you're watching a game on TV and the host comments on a play or a scene now there are lots of really practical uses for augmented reality using mobile devices for example use an augmented reality app on your mobile device to get more information about your surroundings try seeing what a piece of furniture might look like in your bedroom or when a reality even lets you try on new clothes without the need for a changing room and of course there are many educational uses for augmented reality imagine using it in a museum we're a society that's saturated with media and interaction and most museums have static displays that struggle to maintain interest especially the interest of younger visitors now consider how augmented reality can add a totally new dimension to artifacts on display your device recognizes the image on the wall and can supplement it with a video of the artists talking about their work or you can tap on some links and browse examples of some of the artists other pieces the possibilities really are endless let's see it in action Here I am pointing an iPad at a typical museum display this displays about rail Wallenberg and how we save Jews during the Holocaust now watch as the device recognizes the image and automatically begins to play a short documentary clip how much more effective is it where you can actually hear interviews with people at Wallenberg saved ISIL Wow but I lost the whole family our family was a very big family everybody everybody died everybody now here's a display about the fallen leaves exhibit in a Berlin Museum watches the device registers the image and plays a video showing what it's like to walk through the exhibit augmented reality apps can be programmed to register and act upon any image even printed images in the book here's an example of a book that discusses media literacy and shows an image of a groundbreaking political ad from the 1960s how much more effective does this discussion become when you can actually see the ad playing as an overlay right on your printed page all women reality can add new dimensions to our view of the world around us and in doing so it has the potential to transform our learning experiences you
