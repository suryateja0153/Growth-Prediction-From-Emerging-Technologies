 we build we build rebuilds we built we built Google's in augments of academia arm and we Lachman reality on augmented the augmented reality sandbox just your average sandbox it's an Xbox Kinect camera that is facing down at the sandbox and if you were to manipulate the sand with your hands or with tools the Xbox can detect that depth and it sends that message to the computer that we built and then sends it back out to the projector all projected that we were able to commandeer from the principal's office to reject a live topographic map onto the sand right from the start we sort of started planning that was the first stage I personally felt that time was against us we had about a month and a half or so and he spends a lot of time just designing and designing and designing and designing and designing we went through a number of designs for our mount we did a lot of designing and planning eventually the finished product wasn't even one of the designs we had started with so pretty cool to see the evolution of design the next big stage was building the computer and that was really fun we were kind of focused on getting the computer together finding all the necessary parts I felt like it was a really good opportunity because it gave me that chance to really experience what building a computers like because I'd never done it before we had to find the right projector make sure the angle was correct make sure that the projector didn't hit any walls we had to make sure that the projector actually projected on the back of the send when you had a mountain so we had to kind of manage all these things while keeping it relatively easy to build another one of the bigger stages was actually getting the software to work downloading Linux making sure everything worked properly we had an Xbox one Kinect first we had to find out what type of adapter we had to use then we bought the adapter then figured out it doesn't work on that computer so we then we got an Xbox 360 Kinect then realized we also need an adapter for that one we bought the adapter we needed more power through so we had to buy a PCIe USB 3 card and then it finally worked after we had got the computer built we moved into designing the actual sand table so more the engineering part of the project building the sandbox was pretty fun because we actually gotten to go into the scene shop which I had never actually been in there that much and actually getting to use the tools in there was pretty fun I surprisingly remember how to use a wood saw it was pretty exciting to see a design that actually turned into a finished product it wound up that we were able to get it finished in about a month and a half it fit together pretty well at the very end it was really exciting knowing Harbor than presenting something that we built together as a team once we showed up there and we got that thing running it was just mind-blowing because I actually hadn't seen it in operation beforehand because we had finished it at 3 o'clock the day before that was pretty exciting um I had a lot of fun there it was very gratifying to see people's reactions it was just such an amazing experience that exceeded my expectations you were able to come together create this amazing thing and you know hundreds of people coming over to us and saying oh my god this is you know never seen something like this or oh my god is that actually real water when you know it's just augmented people seem to really enjoy what we had built um I did too we built the sandbox a physical sandbox by utilizing augmented reality open source technology from UC Davis we've done more than that we built a tool for geography teachers to show real-time changes in topography and changes in erosion I was the speaker for and representative for our group in the ignite sessions when the unite sessions is basically a sales pitch to get people to come over to your booth it was more so just the level of expectation that you know if I mess up here it could negatively impact my group here you see the first generation of what will hopefully be many more to come from and over hi thank you really exciting to see be seeing people come over and have fun playing in the sandbox coming over over and over just to see it in play and manipulates what we had builds it was really cool that we could just make a plan and have it fail in several ways because of issues and then still managed to continue working on the project and actually make it a success I think it was cool because it really kind of just combined the various disciplines and their strengths I enjoyed working with everybody I thought we worked awesome together we were able to you know create this really cool piece of technology in such a short amount of time it worked well as a team we learned a lot we got to experience new things that some some people here haven't working with other people getting their opinions seeing their viewpoint not only does it make the process easier but it just makes it more enjoyable in my opinion when we came together on this project it really took everyone to know how when it came to computers when it came to actual physical engineering and so it's probably one of the most enjoyable experiences doing a project in my high school career and it was a pretty good success I hope we can do more in the coming years walking in this semester I had no idea that I would be building an augmented reality sandbox something that I hadn't even heard of a month and a half ago like everyone else I can take away the pride that I actually built a augmented reality sandbox which is one of the few in the United States I get rather recommend seeing so many people with different skills come together to have a common cause I think it's something really special it really goes to show what an incredible group of people can do when they come together and ahead for a common goal if you work hard keep your mind at it you can do it when it comes down to a give us a month and we'll show you something amazing you you
