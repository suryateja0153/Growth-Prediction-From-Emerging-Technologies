 I'm Cory Mac from LaForge optical and what we do here at the fort optical is design and manufacture prescription eyewear with some augmenting reality features built into them so what we have here are the some alphas some prototypes of what the Alpha models will look like and then this is where we got started back in 2013 our very first prototype so a lot of stuff has changed things have shrunken down considerably and then back here is our fifth or sixth iteration of our sort of optical prototype so if you were to put this on you're able to see how the optics work so it's been a lot of work to basically get rid of all these lines within the lens but now all that's invisible all you can really see is the ISO sort of mirror and the and the ones that are gonna be ready for production near the end of the year so let's take a look at the mr. DJ style here so basically what we have in each one of the temples here are some electronics over here is inside of this is your motherboard basically and your batteries back here and when you use our smartphone app called social flow you're actually able to take some of the data from your phone and it will float out in front of you I'm gonna say float in front of you it's not float out in front of you here like it's not in the way it's actually frames whatever you're looking at so it's not made to be distracting there's also some touch pads that are integrated into this so you can scroll and a couple buttons so volume up volume down for the betta old version there's a button to activate the camera and then a activates some sort of voice control so we're still looking at serious in the new announcement Google now and some others trying to integrate some of those features in the future and then of course if you're left-handed you can just mirror the controls in your settings this is basically the sort of I guess scheme of how this works is is very similar to a SmartWatch except for you don't have to look down and you know your finger doesn't most of screen so you charge it there's a USB type-c port that's at the end of the temple back here and you just plug that into any place that takes USB and that's how you charge it so the battery life is about 18 hours under normal use and the it takes about 30 minutes to charge so it's not going to be super inconvenient something else a lot of people want to say how do you get that battery life to be 18 hours that's because most of the time the screens gonna be off so we're starting with notifications music and a couple other things and then we'll be getting into navigation and then opening it up to third query developers as we think that that's where most of creativity is gonna live what we do is regardless of if you have a prescription or not the price is the same which is probably shocking to most people we don't charge for eyewear it's kind of like just charging someone because they have a disability but of you go on our website and you upload your prescription if you have one and then we just make them bill to order if you don't have a prescription we just need to get a measurement for your eyes to make sure you don't get any nausea or headaches or anything like that going on so we try to make it super simple
