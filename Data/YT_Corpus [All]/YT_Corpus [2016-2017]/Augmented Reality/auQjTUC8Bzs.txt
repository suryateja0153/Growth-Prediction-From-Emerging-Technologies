 hello this is a very quick look at the UH McGann personal planetarium the universe to go this is quite an interesting unit at first it might look like a VR headset but in actual fact this is an augmented reality headset and instead of putting the phone on the front as you normally would or you actually do is put the phone in the top and if I remove this front panel you can see that you can see straight through so the phone actually reflects off that plastic panel and whatever you're looking at in the night sky the phone screen overlays information so it gives you information about stars and planets and things your phones held in place via this padding and you can remove sections of padding to make sure your phone fits I'm going to be using an LG g3 and as you can see that's probably the largest phone you want to put in this free reference it's about 15 centimeters across excluding any foam on the inside which you probably want just to keep your your phone from getting damaged and you see here it's about 8 centimeters so about 15 by 8 if you throw a bigger than that it's definitely not going to fit into this so you take this foam section out and you can pop out little bits to get two phones into this because the LG g3 is quite a big phone I only need to take out the main middle section and then pop that back in and that just acts as a buffer and holds the phone in place so worth noting that a phone the size of the LG g3 is actually quite a tight fitting so it can be quite tricky to get out when you are putting it in you do need to remember to start the app this app is free to download and it has two modes you've got a free to use mode which is available to all users and there's a planetarium mode which is only available if you've purchased the headset to use the app with the headset you're gonna have to carry out a calibration this can be done a couple of times if you mess it up the first time for some reason and it's okay is follows very clear instructions and but I found that no matter how often I did the calibration it often wouldn't line up with the Stars look so as you can see I wasn't ready for the calibration process first time around but second time around I was fine it involves just follow the on-screen instructions and you then have to place it in the headset move your head around tilt it left to right things like that and eventually the app will fire up and you are ready for a bit of stargazing now the idea is that you put this at the sky at something that you're interested in learning more about and the app will tell you what is in the night sky and give you more information now you can't hear this unfortunate I forgot to record the sound it was giving information verbally as I was looking around the night sky and for the larger objects that we know more about you can also zoom in and get a really good a commentary of detailed information so just point out that these are left and right images you'd actually see one image when you looked at this on the phone itself the Mars one in particular is quite interesting because you can descend to the planet and actually have a little look around so the movement you seen here is me just turning around I'm stood on the spot just turning around have a look around you can see some of the stitching in the photos but it doesn't detract from the actual experience of having a little look around or stood on Mars the app menu system works very well you start to take the phone out you simply tilt your head or down and then right to select as you can see there's loads of great modes I really like the mythology motifs that gives you the background as to why sand constellations and configurations are called what they are gives you the stories behind it so as an education tool this is really really cool filming listen uses really tricky because of course it is pitch black when you are using this ideally so you can do a bit of stargazing so if I just enhance the video you'll see that what we're using here is a holding area top rather than using the straps and that's because the straps are very good but also you quite often want to take it down and check things with the naked eye you might want to grab a pair of binoculars or have a lot kuroh telescope or just pass them on to whoever you're stargazing with the app itself is brilliant it's got loads of really interesting information especially if you're into stargazing the units that you put your phone in is okay but it is a bit of a squeeze to get your phone in and out if you do have something large like the LG g3 doesn't always line up with the night sky but when it does it really does a great job of giving you loads of information I hope you found this short of useful thanks for watching
