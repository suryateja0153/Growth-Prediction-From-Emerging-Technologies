 today we are showcasing for attendees an augmented reality interactive pool table developed in just a couple weeks using NX Pease IDOT MX development system for the set up we integrated a 1 megapixel sensor to track the objects on the table and a 1080p projector to overlay the augmented reality image back on to the table on the monitors above the table we are showing a few of the inside steps being used for image recognition top left is the raw RGB image followed by HSV conversion after passing the image to a number of the graphical filters the bottom left black & white image shows only the objects the system is interested in tracking and finally the bottom right image acknowledges and displays the tracking of each ball in color as well as the cue stick we have two fun modes running this week the first is our shot making prediction in this mode the item X displays the anticipated angles and ball to ball interactions while you are taking your shot the second demo is a fluid demonstration making waves through the table based on the ball location and speed as we continue to develop the showcase we plan to integrate ball pocket detection using sensors and btle Bluetooth with our hexie wear platform we will also continue to improve the tracking system with more cameras for a 3d view and we will be experimenting with infrared sensors even 70 gigahertz radar the visual effects will be augmented with additional graphic overlays menus gameplay virtual obstacles trick shot tutor and scoring systems
