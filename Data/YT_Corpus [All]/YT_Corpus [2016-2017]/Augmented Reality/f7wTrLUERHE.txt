 it's been a bit of a long time since I've done anything 3d printing related so when this company reached out to me I thought I would give this a look this item is called the structure sensor from a company called occipital and effectively what this does it attaches to a tablet as you may be able to see they're made for the iPad and it'll work with the iPad Mini with Retina display the iPad air and the fourth-generation iPad I think it'll also work with the iPad air 2 you just have to have a different attachment for each of those and effectively what it does is it attaches to your iPad and X as a 3d scanner but first let's go ahead and unbox it and take a look at it and we'll get it hooked up to the iPad and see what it does but here at the top you have a little bit of a getting started user manual kind of thing here's a cable to attach it it's lightning connector to this connector that I'm not familiar with but I would assume that this goes into the actual sensor there's a power brick for it has a little barrel connector on the end and it mentions there does 7.5 volts at 1.5 amps there's a couple little bags in here with a bunch of screws and a teeny tiny screwdriver I'm guessing you're supposed to fix this to the actual connector you'll use and finally this is the actual sensor itself there you go this is a I've really actually like this killer it's kind of a neon blue on the back it mentioned structure sensor and it is a class one laser product so this is going to be doing laser scanning of basically whatever you point it at in an effort to turn it into 3d models that you can print out on a 3d printer now as you can probably guess this is not going to be able to attach to anything the way it is you have to actually have a bracket to attach it so they sent along this bracket as well this is the structure sensor bracket for an iPad air which I do have here and inside of this box which has a neat little magnetic seal on it you have this little bracket and if I had to guess I would say that this actually slides in like this you put four screws in the back of it to hold it in place so it doesn't fall out then you slide it over your tablet and kind of clip it into place like this alright that went together fairly painlessly that's all said and done you simply attach it to your iPad basically you end up fitting it over the camera but then you clip it into place and you've got a nice solid stable 3d scanner you do have access to your power button here it's got a little button attachment and the volume rockers and the mute switch are still all accessible and if you want to go ahead you can connect the lightning cable to their connector we'll push this in right here there's just a little bit of an insert and divot there push it right in it's just long enough almost exactly long enough to fit here on the iPad air and it's all connected up taking a quick look at the getting started guide over on the occipital structure website it mentions that once you've done this you shouldn't actually have to plug the power connector into it I'm going to keep reading just to see if there's anything else to it but at this point I should be able to just install the app from the App Store and get started and actually I just happen to notice when I plug this in it says the app is not installed do you want to install it that's very cool so I'm going to go into the App Store and they pulled up a bunch of potential apps for it but according to the site this is the one I'm going to need it's called structure so I'm going to say git there we go it is installing the app for me and it says it would like access to the camera so we're gonna go ahead and allow that and it is seeing things in fact you may not be able to see that because the angle but it's actually seeing me there you go so this doesn't require any sort of external power source it looks like it mentions how far away it is from things so yeah I'm gonna take a little time I'm gonna try this out and get used to it to try to scan some things with it and I'll be back with you in just a second okay and it is actually it's months and months later I just have not taken the time to finish this review up so I'm going to do that today as you can see raiven sold a bunch of different apps that work with this sensor of course you've got the original structure app that I was looking at before we have IR depth and depth and color you can see just how far away things are by where we move I'm on this really weird little shoulder-mounted rig which should make this a little easier to do over here in the corner you can see the firmware version the serial number in the battery level that app not terribly useful you have the calibrator over here which you can use to actually as it would say calibrate the sensor i've already done all this before now these are the ones that are a little bit more interesting scanner I haven't gotten it to work quite right I haven't spent a huge amount of time with it but I just haven't got it to work quite right but just as sort of a quick example you point it at an object and you can kind of see that gets surrounded it's sort of highlighting the whole area that it's going to scan so the camera is actually going to be scanned with that and will even turn on the high resolution color option so if I hit the Scan button now you can see it's building out the object that it's actually scanning based upon the whole movement of the 3d scanner sensor if we move around we can get more pieces of it says we're too close to it and yeah like I said I haven't had a huge amount of luck with this so far so I'm going to move on that is kind of the whole point of this thing is to do something like that here's just what the result was of it it didn't get much of anything but I didn't spend a lot of time doing it so it's very cool that that is an option that you could do that and then make like 3d models you could print out but the things that I've been doing with it I found a little more interesting are things like room capture and the room capture app basically does this you see I'm standing here in my office if I hit the Scan button it flushes things out with a green framework as it were and then as you move around it scans the room look at that so you know we'll just look up a little bit we'll go toward the window we'll go down toward the floor don't mind the mess there's a lot of it and then we get the walls and you know I'm taking this very very quickly you could actually spend a lot of time and really build out your space using this not exactly sure what this is going to be a hundred percent useful for but we'll hit done and there you go there's just a very very quick oh look this is a 3d moveable space that I just created with the 3d scanner sensor there's an x-ray view where you can see all of the points that it created there's a top-down view if you've done the entire thing you can move around it like this there's hole filling which tries to fill it out with the parts that are missing so like all these little white specks it tries to fill in and it kind of actually did a pretty decent job there it left a big section here because that's so far away it couldn't really capture it but there's other parts that it filled in quite nicely so that's a really cool option I just again not really sure what its going to be hugely useful for because most of this kind of thing other than getting you the depth information most of this can be done with a panorama on Android probably on iOS as well but either way it's it's a cool feature there's a fetch option which is an augmented reality game so basically you say scan see it's picking up this area here on the floor we're going to make a little smaller we hit scan and it's scanning the floor problem again is that where it's trying to track it maybe it's just I don't have enough light in here make it a little bit brighter in here and see if that helps Harry scan and then scan and it is scanning the area but having trouble but when it does sort of work you can see it does it a little bit of an augmented reality game it's just I didn't get a good scan on this so you can move the guy around to pick up the balls in space and you see it looks like he's moving around on the floor so that's kind of cool again not a hundred percent perfect but it's a neat option thing that I found the most cool about this is this star ops game play the mission briefing and then skip it it goes through this whole video that we just don't need to watch and now that it's done there's a start mission button and you can see we are in a room and there's a bunch of stuff going on in the background then the audio I'm going to leave all that out but then as we move around I'm walking around the room it says walk onto the red pressure switch oK we've walked onto it now it says pick up a block gives me a grab button so as I get close enough to it and get my little reticle over it I can hit grab pick it up and move it over to something else and actually walk over to it and release it and you see it opens the door over there now I can walk over to the way that door is or I can hit the warp button to take me there and then warp again and then warp again and I played a little bit of this last night there's not a huge amount to it but it all involves you moving around in your environment and doing things so for example I'm going to pick up this Cup I'm going to interact with the environment over we get some coffee in my cup there we go I've got coffee mmm gonna drink the coffee and then oh no there's liquid plutonium let's get a little liquid Buitoni oh no what do we do it's pink and goopy let's put it into this machine lalalalalala I'll just pour it in and that did something and you see it's all steaming and all doing something now so you can actually pick up the gun and shoot things this is just based upon augmented reality and interacting with the world using that that's so cool there's more stuff you can do to it I just haven't made it terribly far yet but that is honestly one of the most fun parts of using this so far and that's probably about as deep as I want to go with this I haven't spent a huge amount of time testing it to see how the battery life is to see how well it works just going to be real honest with you it has not really been a need for me it's a really neat option but it's kind of an expensive one I remember correctly the last time I looked at it it was $300 and it primarily worked with iOS devices because you had to have this bracket since that time I've checked again and it looks like they've made it available on Android as well but you do have to buy a separate breakout cable for it they'll go to micro USB and you have to figure out a way to mount it yourself so it's not going to be the best option for Android guys for iOS if you pick up the one that has the specific bracket that you want for your device it's going to get the job done it's really just going to depend on your NEADS there for me this is not necessarily a need and I am gonna have to send it back to the company but you know what I think that's going to wrap things up for me for today as always thank you guys so much for watching hopefully you enjoy it a little bit of this video and we will see you given the next one
