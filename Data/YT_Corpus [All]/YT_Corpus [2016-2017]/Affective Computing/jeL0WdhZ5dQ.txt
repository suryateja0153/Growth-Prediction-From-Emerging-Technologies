 hello everyone I'm Jana machine ski I'm from a kalonian University in Krakow from faculty of game technologies and I would like to tell you about the very big project I'm trying to establish now it's called cone interfaces and it says actual in program that it is about modeling user and player activities with multi-model interfaces in spatial contexts so that's true mainly but I don't have time exactly to tell you today about all details about methods and evaluations and modeling and things like that but I would like to tell you about my inspiration and why I'm interested in this and in this area so it's gonna be our little speed run because there is a lot of the material to code to cover so sorry for my english but i have a lot of images to show you so buckle up and let's go we are in pretty formal situation here so I suppose I should address you in very formal way but I suppose that we are all gamers here so I won't do that i would use example from another universe so here it comes and why I'm interested in cognitive faces because we are all we all humans and and raccoons and other humanoids we use tools now we are used we are to using beings and using tools it's something that defines us in a sort of way we are very close to our our tools our gear our equipment and and so on that it becomes the part of our identity you know like have you seen the guardians of the galaxy so it's like like with raccoon yes he's hissin one with his gun and and and and without a gun a rocket raccoon is just a fluffy little animal that looks nice intendent everyone says oh when they see see see them but with his gun he becomes a machine of total destruction so when she gets his gun he changes his identity he becomes his true self yes then very destructive one indeed so this is part of his identity and we can read this like as a metaphor of general a usage of different different tools and different devices without devices without tools we become a I don't know some kind of conscience animals with with with use of tools where we are becoming something much more interesting and tools are also things that sort of create our reality create reality we live in in the medium 10 minutes okay in the media a kind of kind of way you know we are this bio cognitive systems with where we can connect and bad some media devices and and and expand our reality but not in the matrix way it's not the way that I'm interested I'm not talking about the virtual reality I'm talking about a real reality the communication reality which witch is which is pretty real you know the communication is something that that we experience every day and what is more we are constantly being monitored being scanned by various devices in around us so I wanted to show you a some footage for some footage from one of my favorite digital art project which is called unnamed stone sculpture where the body of the dancer is mapped into cloud of points in 3d space and then when she becomes data and her her dance improvisation becomes data she's being changed into in 3d 3d environment she's being changed into water other sorts of liquids various points it's it's really great project is is wreaking in processing which is my favorite programming language but I won't be showing you that you can a take name of this project and you can check this on youtube or or female and it's older ok so I'm one I want to talk about embodiment embodiment it's something that something very important in our investigations so we all have our bodies yes some some kinds of our bodies and actually they look much more like that but we also have our body images you know and it's not exactly the same as assume a as you know so we imagine us in a different ways that we exactly are so actually I'm pretty fat and in my everyday our life I don't perceive myself as a fat until it gets me to kind of you know problems I broke a chair or something like that or the lift doesn't doesn't go I have my body image now which is constructed and it is constructed with a with angry with some kind of sensors which are not classical senses and one of this is a sense of agency that i am the agent of things that i do and the other is sense of ownership and we can lose temporarily the senses in the very situation like you know when i got sense of ownership of my body you know i'm moving this hand yes I mean I mean to do that and but if I fall off the stairs I lose my sense of ownership of my body temporarily no I can do anything I'm just falling down the stairs so it's very very important important relation that we have between our minds and our bodies so this is a thing that we want to study in the media context next thing our experiences can be exactly reduced out to our body only I know it sounds a bit weird but if I show you this a disturbing image okay I choose soft kerwin I could show you some hardcore operation of the dentist operation and you will feel like oh my god i have heartache just by looking for it you know you can feel bad just by looking for on somebody else body being being modified or being distracted you know so so our sense our sense the sensual experiences aren't related only into our body so we have this body image we have something that's called body schema body schema is something that is a description of our a ability to move or our our endeavors in the cybernetic in the cybernetic way so we can describe ourselves as some kind of working system and if I I don't now take this a take this thing and know exactly what is it but I can make it a part of my body schema when I I engage with it I can make I know my car a part of my body schema when I hit a something with my car and I say oh that hurt no I I feel bad about it I I feel my boundaries boundaries of my body our boundaries of my car when I'm driving it so we have something called body schema it can be a investigated in various ways but I don't have exactly time to talk about it we have all this system of perceptual feedback so we have some kind of high-order intentions which can become motor commands of our body movements and there there is of course a feedback every time I move my hand and I know that I moved my hand and what is important here and were the of the fun starts here comes the interface when I'm engaging with some kind of interface it becomes part of my proprioceptive feedback it becomes a part of feedback and information information i get from as a result of my movement this is important this is important for for me so why it is important while it is interesting in for video game study we can talk in the case of video games that we have something like em extended embodiment our body image in action on the screen of our of our computer and it engages into the distances ownership and agency it is extended from my body the body of my avatar in very in very a particular way I wanted to show you something so let's skip it let's keep no yes no let's keep it I thought I could talk faster but I can't actually so let's let's let's go further there is a possible description of a body definition of a body like a system of possible actions is actually actually a quote from Marlo Ponte so when we take this definition and I ask you what the game mechanics are they are also the system of possible action game mechanics is something that game allows you to do to overcome the obstacles that designers providers so we have relation between this embodiment this body schema and game mechanics and this becomes a basis of our research because for us it is very very interesting why in Assassin's Creed when you perform a leap of faith why is it satisfying you why in physical way it's it's great feeling you know they like jump from tall buildings in a sauce is great now it's all the fun you feel like like like you're fine why do you feel like you're flying in Assassin's Creed it's ridiculous but it is because of extended agency into into game system and we want to investigate investigate that why this P actions these primitive actions can become something that our bodies a response response to a score of course we have a lot of a areas to cover here things like control schemes like in Assassin's Creed you know to preform the leap of faith you just have to put this pull the stick forward and press X and your men you jump in and in why table table tennis you have to make all the swings and all you get in return is just bouncing the ball around the table so the feedback here is is quite different how it how it interferes with our motoric patterns which we have you know the usage of the phone now when I have the phone I have this this this sometimes involuntary a move I I checked my phone I feel it vibrates even when it lies on the table and things like that why this this this control how this control schemes interfere with motoric pattern this is things we want to study and things we are interested us and yeah we can of course when we conduct these studies week and a check we can get from them things like game design patterns you know interesting thing I would happily at all your tell you about it but uses another big big topic GUI design patterns and an immersion patterns for game design because the I teach students to create games so I'm very interested in in various various metals the total prototype the total to create to create to create games so we have some works that cover that I encourage you to check this book curious ritual gasps pol interaction in digital every day where we have a lot of images of people using everyday devices and how this usage change changes the patterns of of the earth of their behaviors it's very very pretty pretty book problems yes we have a lot of problems so there is a dermatological problems there are financial problems of course and and things like that but I think it's very important study and maybe some some time from and now I may be able to present you the actual results of our project which is actually in in conduction we are actually making these investigations right now on the various devices for now we are specially interested in mobile devices and in spatial spatial context so everything with gal collation and and things like that is our area main area of interest ok so thank you for now if you want to contact me this is my email address and this is my faculty of games technology which is in Polish technology gear I encourage you to contact me if you have any questions or you want to become beaten part of this study or something like that thank you very much
