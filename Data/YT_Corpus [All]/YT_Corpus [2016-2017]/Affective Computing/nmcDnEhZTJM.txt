 [Music] this video describes EQ radio a new technology from Professor Catawbas group at MIT that can recognize people's emotions using wireless signals was there a moment in your life when you looked at someone's face but you could not figure out how they feel what if your wireless router can tell people's emotions even if they don't show them on their faces this is exactly what our technology does this is our device the device transmits a wireless signal which reflects off a person's body and comes back it captures these reflections and analyzes them to infer the person's emotions specifically our algorithms zoom in on the wireless reflections to extract the minut variations due to breathing and heartbeat we then further analyze these reflections to extract the breathing signal and the heartbeat signal we then zoom in more on these signals to obtain individual heartbeats and breathing cycles and feed these s features into a machine learning algorithm to recognize a person's emotions the device can automatically know if the present is excited angry sad or happy our device can recognize motions with an accuracy of 87% why lying purely on wireless signals we envision that EQ radio can be used in many applications it can recognize a person's emotions while he is watching a movie and provide movie makers with better tools to evaluate user experience it can also allow smart environments to detect emotional states like depression and inform us to improve our emotional well-being it can even enable these environments to react to our moods and adjust lighting or music accordingly [Music] to learn more about this research please check out our website [Music]
