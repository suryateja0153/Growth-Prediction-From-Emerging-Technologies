 unless you are a functional psychopath and there are believe me functions like a person for whom the brain is wired differently in general if there is negative and positive emotion impinging on a neural circuitry the negative will win out this whole notion of philosophers that's just the kind of preservers right all the time and by the way if you compare and that's that's a conclusion will come to here is that when you compare emotion was this cognition emotion was as rational you start seeing that the rational brain is simply a slave to the emotional brain it's simply cannot survive the onslaught from the emotional system that if you want to be decisive you want to be confident moving forward you know after your face will afraid of conflict that you really want to harness the power of emotion in shaping a decision you don't want to become a Vulcan under such contexts and here are some of the factors that I'll get into what we have found in a research if you start with price and religious imports in other words they're talking about money salary the price of the option you tend to become a welcome if that is the first attribute you're looking at and that's why I don't say is when i was in sales before i fell sales people that even if you're working for a price leader like dell for example where you major process price never start the conversation with your customer with price because you're going to make that individual about okay the other factor we've seen is that if you do become analytical if you adopt the benjamin franklin technique you know Benjamin Franklin was the founding fathers of our nation I mean what did he say he said that if you're making a facebook para pancake what'd he do well you kind of look at all the positives and lists on all the negatives of the various options and choose that option with the greatest number of positives or the least number of negatives if you do that you look more welcome the other thing that they found is that if you are fearful of committing a mistake you become older that is your fearful of committing a type 1 those of you who are familiar with statistics you know about the errors of the type 1 error was as type 2 error right type 1 error is being fearful of committing a mistake where is just a type 2 error as being being fearful of losing out on an opportunity many of you here especially the innovation space will traditionally be this type two individuals you're fearful of losing out on an opportunity rather than fearful of making a mistake if you're fearful of losing an opportunity you don't see this vulcanism showing up the best of course you see this emotional clear kind of decisive decisions being made is when you are hopeful of a favorable option there is no fear element involved at all and the last wagon is a very reason that we have identified is the lack of sleep especially deep sleep if you don't get enough of the deep sleep component I mean sleep as different cycles right it's for the light to see if the REM sleep and so on and one of them is a deep sleep cycle if you don't get enough of the deep sleep cycle you'll also end up becoming about you won't be able to make very decisive decision so think about the next time you're traveling then I say to Hong Kong and Singapore and so on and then you're going ending up with negotiations and making decisions in general you will end up making bad decisions
