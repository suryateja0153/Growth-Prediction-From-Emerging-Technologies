 so the technology goes actually by the by various names some are like emotional robots affective computing human-centered computing but behind all of these is in fact a very simple thing relatively simple and that is automatic human behavior analysis and understanding and more specifically human facial behavior analysis so human face such is really fascinating it is serving our primary goal of identifying other members of our species it also serves as the main information for judging other people's age or gender or things like beauty or even personality but more importantly human face is a constant flow of expressions the reason is that actually we are reacting and emoting on external stimuli all the time so in fact this flow of expressions is the only observable window that you could use to judge the inner state of human beings such as emotions intentions attitudes or moods and it is exactly because of this reason that the field got quite a lot of attention in the past 20 years in fact if you think if we could recognize who the person is and what is the interpretation of people's behavior we will be able to use this information for a very wide variety of applications some of these applications are illustrated here and about some of those I will be speaking so when it comes about the state of the art we can recognize human faces relatively easily this is something which we called salts problem especially when we talk about frontal view faces so we can recognize and verify somebody with a very high accuracy and have seen some of these systems for example on airports which could recognize you just based on your face and we can do that in the presence of for example occlusions or in a presence of very large changes in illumination so this problem at least as far as frontal view phase is concerned is considered solved similarly when we talk about facial expressions well the same hold so we can actually consider the problem solve as far as the frontal view faces are concerned so you can actually see on these videos that I included here that we can track the faces relatively accurately in various conditions we can judge different facial expressions such as smiles or I bro thrones or eyebrow raises we can even estimate the intensity of those expressions and we can reason about higher level behaviors such as for example interest even in the cases when we have actually observations done outdoors however when it comes to unconstrained recording conditions so we're very large changes in the head pose in expression in the whole morphology of the face can you cure we can actually not deal with these kind of things and this is still a challenge in the field so these are typical videos which are uploaded in social media such as Facebook and YouTube and this is in fact our current goal we want to be able to automatically analyze these kind of videos fully right so some of the challenges you have is for example in extreme sports you will have a very large morphological changes in facial expressions and the down left down right video is a typical video which is uploaded in youtube and this is the reaction of people while watching two girls and a cup which is a very very disgusting video so as you can see people are observed occluding their face even at one point one of the guys just walks away and so on so these kind of videos are really the videos we want to be able to analyze automatically yeah a lot of motions you see this guy here which is like jumping all the time yeah this is the kind of interferon and in order to handle this kind of problems we need to solve a number of things so one of these is to annotate a lot of data in the wild what does it mean so collect all these kind of videos and images that you have on internet Facebook and YouTube and so on and then manually annotated this this kind of data and then based on that build better face models those are the models it will actually take into account large changes in the head pose as well as large changes in expression at the same time ok and then personalize that too and do it in an online incremental manner so that you can actually make these changes as you observe a person right and finally you have also to deal with the better inference models and these inference models should be such that you can deal with context why with context context is something which is quite difficult problem so this is who the person is this is what the person is doing where the person is why the person is showing something and what exactly this person is showing and then how so all these contextual questions need to be understood why because for example it really depends who you who you observe some people smile a lot and some don't so what is the maximum smile of somebody so very small smiles could be like absolute extreme for some people and very small smiles for other people or for example if I am doing now my eyebrow raise it means that I believe I'm emphasizes something so I believe this is important whatever i'm talking currently about but if you have the same expression when somebody sees somebody else it could be just a surprise to see that person on that place it's very important this context goes through these different layers in its exceptionally important problem to be integrated into the inference models so in all these problems we made some progress but they are still absolutely not considered so nonetheless the technology as available nowadays can still be used in very wide variety of applications one of those is the market analysis where we use facial behavior reactions behavioral reactions on different products and adverts in order to judge the successfulness of those products and adverts so this technology is commercialized by a company called realize and we are currently working with them on a project which is called siva and its sentiment analysis in the world and what we want to do is extend this analysis also to verbal feedback so what people really say about these products and adverts that they watch and can we use that to make this judgment about successfulness future successful and about products and advert and a side of that we want to build an application for a handsome enough social skills such as the negotiation scale so we want to actually judge whether people are interested in each other what is the sentiment they show towards each other whether they are agreeable tower to each other or disagreeable and how they handle in case they disagree how they handle this situation and and this is probably what is the most interests is interesting for this meeting one of our main focuses of attention at this point is the automatic analogies for facial behavior in medical purposes so we currently developed a method for automatic analysis of pain and intensity of pain from facial expressions and you can use this in various ways one of the ways is in physiotherapy so these recordings that the recording that you watch here is actually a data from physiotherapy of people suffering from shoulder pain so the pain that we have here is the tooth pain so it's not a chronic by chronic pain is expressed differently this is a tooth pain so what is the patient asked is to lift the arm which is hurting and we record the expression and how this acute pain actually is expressed and based on that we develop the models for automatic monitoring of the pain from facial expressions and the intensity of pain and another very important project on which we are working is the project on autistic kids and here what is important is that we want to build this technology into a robot which will he have a camera observing the kids and this technology running behind and we would try to help the kids understand their own expressions and teach them the expressions as typically developing people show them the reason why the robots are so important is that autistic kids you have a problem of Gestalt which is they cannot analyze the face as a whole they analyze the face as a set of parts so inhuman therapist when they try to show whatever expression the leakage of this spontaneous expression is obvious and normal because they're usually typically developing people so they cannot express and express exactly in the same time exactly in the same way each time so they usually have like the emphasis of a certain part of expression which totally and makes autistic kids confused because they see the expression as a set of parts not a whole so that's why the robots are really really good in this case because they can always consistently show the expression in exactly the same way and another application because somebody mentioned Watson here is actually with IBM we are currently in negotiation in building a very large project with IBM in which we will have IBM see IBM Watson see which would mean that actually when they give an answer with the Watson system to a kid or a person we would then try to judge whether this answer was accepted well so for example whether the answer make the kid confuse or whether the additional information is needed and we can do that based on the facial judgment a small part of this would be development of an online tool for meeting analysis where we will summarize the meeting and agree agree on how much people agree with each other within the meeting or how much enthusiasm and engagement they show within the meeting we want to summarize that based on the facial feedback what you see here is the complex analyses in political debates which we will use for this kind of online meeting analysis system and these political debates are far from Greek political debate so here actually there is a lot of extra red / people and we believe that actually in different cultures the way people show the conflict and disagreement is very very different and we should take this into account so it's quite a large project to this with IBM and so to conclude and once the technology is advanced a little bit more so that we can really use it in the wall as I suggested we would be able to use it for really really a lot of applications one of these is for example stress analysis in job interviews or therapeutic interviews where you have an intern thing is of course couple relationship therapist all for example addictive patients therapist where stress is very tail telling about what they are intending to do and it could also be used in in vehicle environments where we would like to decrease the stress in order to increase the safety of the driver and the passengers or increase the stress for entertainment purposes in case the user finds this kind of exceptionally stressful situations funny fun in any case that concludes my presentation so thank you very much for your attention you
