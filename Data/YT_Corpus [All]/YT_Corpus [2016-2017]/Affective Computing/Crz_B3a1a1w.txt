 thank you all for coming so yeah the title i curated last year in lisbon in porto but we're not really going to address the show as such we're going to use the show as a background to kind of discuss a number of ideas just to give a little bit of context on the show it's it's happened in the national contemporary museum in lisbon and then the city hall gallery in porto from April last year into September and I showed nine artists including Cecily Evans new blue font when khatallah do give him leashed Alvaro Eric Nagoya Royce Sharon Moulton Katrina bits cover and lock povo and the exhibition in a very broad way analyzed contemporary visual culture a namely hybrid formats that are produced from friction between binaries there I was kind of questioning such as for example organic an artificial textual an object or the virtual and the real or the actual etc among many others spirituality and consumerism but the main focus actually of the show was the friction between Matteo materiality or sculpture and the visual which is one of the biggest topics were also going to discuss here so yeah the my selection of artists and specifically of the artworks I was showing they were all exploring somehow how visual is handled as matza and how images became objects and how objects also become images so it was an exploration around this free flow of forms and maybe it start off the conversation I mean the show was really approaching visual culture and commenting on popular cultural visual culture and maybe could be a good way to start off to discuss a little bit how we all kind of deal with visual culture or popular culture in our own practices who would like to start Venus is interesting way talking about let you know hybrid forms and then like pop culture's and facial cultures because like contemporary art has a very long history of appropriate in pop culture but in the past it's like mostly it's just I or let's grab an image and make a collage of it that kind of thing so I find it very interesting how are you how are tits like kind of like you know because pop culture is basically our environment now like what we're living in like if we stay like it's it can also be mean it can it's like kind of like a site-specific it's a site like it's like where we are like immersion so it's just like it's because you're talking about image as object and although we are dealing with all these object that network of aps all these object who that explodes and implode at the same time so it's interesting when I work with corporate over no no and try like on the solo show last year at Olin Center in Beijing as I mean I actually like witnessed the whole like process of how the artists work like and then I think it's interesting of like how we bring this a whole production of official forms of pop culture or other cultures like hip hop that is I basically viral like that is like you know hip hop is now seen as like the third like big turn-off like the pop culture history and like how like he like the artists I expand the idea of like our culture like as pop culture like inkling music like film and music videos and all that into a site so like how he you know hippie he had like boy child collaborate collaborating with him and people like from who by air like you know creating this whole scene and then like that is interesting because it kind of like what is our production if you know like if like a brand is doing the same thing like what is how this like site of pop culture is a when is moved into the whole artistic context with the burden of art history and then how it all mixed together I found it very interesting I'm still learning like what kind of like things can be done like because I mean it's like I work with a lot of like contemporary Chinese artists and of course because of the political reality there people say that all like I said socially engaged work or something which kind of like warns me about the idea like it's I kind of like not part of society like when you say that's socially engaged it's like a very obvious immaterial it's just I Oh something is like getting into a secluded bubble so I found it interesting when Jael and they like bring up and also let ourselves work that I like merging images from popular culture it's just like it's just I could I think it's like a big reminder of like obviously actually like part of it as like an immersion yeah yeah I think music videos in particular are an amazing resource at the moment because there's never like a music video never just has one reference and I think we've we've spoken to our speaking about this earlier and even like an image within a music video won't just have one reference it'll have like 10 or 20 references or something will even happen in the future that you'll say reminds me of that one image and I just I love that idea then of especially within the moving image and the idea of an image object as a sort of composite sketch of all of these different things so it no longer being a singular thing and then it having this sort of like responsibility to kind of contain and and move within it within a space and for people to pick up on these references or not pick up on them but the ability to borrow from those to take back from them eventually for them to be inspired by what you've done with them and back and forth but I think one of the most one of the times that I really tried to specifically use this idea of like the image object in popular culture like as a tool like knowingly for an audience was a video I made two years ago a year and a half ago called hyperlinks or it didn't happen and the narrator for the video is called Phil and he's a failed CGI rendering of an actor who's passed away which was based on a rumor that was circulating that this would actually happen - to this actor and didn't so I kind of had a match they said that they didn't make the copy but I in my imagination imagined that they had and it had kind of failed it had not done the job that it was meant to do and I really fell in love with the idea of this yeah of what this image contained and represented to people and what it would be to have it speak for itself in in reference to that - that responsibility if it makes sense and it's never it's never stated in the video who the actor is and I've never stated it in any like official texts but it was really amazing because nine times out of ten across the board people knew exactly who this was based on or and I just thought yeah because their relationship was always with this person as a moving image yeah I guess the way that these ideas come up in my work would be related to certain kinds of collective or I would call them generic images that that circulate it's a big more closely linked to to kind of earlier earlier discussions about representation and things like that but um I became quite fascinated for example with images of nature which were derived from basically a kind of cliched idea of what nature was and you know if you search for something on the internet like Niagara Falls you end up with a lot of images of this place and a lot of images that actually looked the same so taking part taken by different people sorry and it was it was true true that kind of collection of images that I became interested in in the possibility of trying to find what I would call I guess a most suitable context to to perceive them you know because because if if people understand these images as as being actually that place you know that that's it that's in a way a kind of illusion right so I wanted to kind of to think about these images use these images in a way that was somehow like maintained what they were but took away that kind of illusory aspect so basically I brought them back and I recut recontextualize them within a kind of urban situation there's no images of these works here but you know I mean I guess and it's also related I think to this idea that which has intensified in in in the present where the the image would go back to this discussion about the image in the object you know previously akan standard definition of the image is that that the object precedes the image and not vice versa but you know in the case of a generic image you you have a situation where the the perception of the image is actually something that precedes the object there's this image that circulates throughout a kind of collective imaginary you know of a waterfall for example and you don't even have to go to the waterfall and you already have this image in your mind and when you do go to the waterfall you're looking for that image as well you know is this this sort of it's a kind of very kind of like a sophisticated kind of tourist kind of gaze I guess right and that that's something I think that has intensified and really blurred this the boundary between you know this visual this vision and materiality or objects yeah I'm like another point of interest for example another question I have for you and this relates again to the show it was like my interest was kind of comment or to make slightly problematic not pop culture as such but dominant visual regimes for example or dominant regimes of representation better sets which are they privileged sites so I was quite interested in kind of making that problematic through the artworks shown and and yeah using pop culture in that sense as a reference that could make dominant regimes pragmatic what's your interest for example why do you use where to use metal strip for example the actors why do you go to that kind of shared cultural imaginary visual imaginary what's your aim do you want to kind of uncover silenced layers of those images or you just want to make the most problematic oh yeah what's your I think my primary interest in popular culture and just like not just images but also music was the emotional value behind it and how effective it is I think I work with a pop songwriter for some of the scores within the videos that I make and there are pretty much algorithms underlying underneath certain songs like I can say okay there's this one by Miley Cyrus and we all know it kind of sounds like the one by Sinead O'Connor but then there's like Rihanna's stay and also like great big world and Christina Aguilera did this song and they all make me want to cry and I can assume they're all about breakups like but what is it about the first three chords and then he will say actually it this is actually a quite unknown thing and then the idea of people are now talking about the drop when you go into pretty much like hmm our shopping there are so many drops and the music and they're meant to like put you through an emotional rollercoaster so that by the end of it you're just like I'll take all the shorts and I just find that really amazing and not from like a critical standpoint but because I participate in it and I find it effective and not in a way that I want to manipulate an audience but because I think it's interesting to live within that space of not understanding why this is so effective each each time yeah I think quite similar for me in a way I mean it's like I'm interested in sort of cliche and kitschy things no not really from an ironic perspective or like sort of a distant standpoint I mean also partly because it is a kind of emotional like connection that happens where in a way these things can even though you you you might be aware of it these things can kind of still have some kind of like power or control over you or minute manipulative force you know which you you can't control yourself you know you can do drawn to and yeah and I think also trying to find and for me it's always a question of trying to to take these images and find a kind of material context for them and normally it seems it always ends up being related to a certain kind of urban space or kind of Technol technologized living yeah yeah there's something to be said for emotional contagion which was also the name of a study run by Facebook on on Facebook which they basically wanted to do what I mean kind of what we're talking about which was to find out in in a manipulative sentence actually what are the algorithms that can recognize certain emotional statuses which now they've made much easier by the fact that you can just like have an emoji that says I'm crying laughing etc but they wanted to see if they then grouped them all together into your feed so someone's angry another person's angry another person's angry if that been made you angry which seems really basic but was incredibly effective and they proved that it is possible to spread emotion and that I also found interesting and thinking about these like the breaking down of binaries that maybe never really existed but the idea of emotions as as a material as something that has a very strong physical presence that circulates that we now know has a very high value and is very valuable monetarily and that there is that there are organizations that are going to great lengths to try and track the movement of of these of these materials yeah you know I mean that goes back to what we were so discussing before this relationship between the digital and and the real and the emotions are you know a big big part of that you were saying like happens things in in the digital world they do have impacts in reality and yeah nothing's virtual anymore it's definitely very real and the monetization of emotions is a big part of that I mean yeah not only Facebook but I mean in general social media the way they are monetizing and capitalizing on prior areas that were somehow external or very hardly capitalized it's really impressive I don't wanna know if you want to say more about that because your work is really related about that idea of how corporations are really feeding into that yeah I mean I had a whole project called agnus with the serpentine galleries it was a digital Commission with them and Agnes is she's still there and in a very reduced form now she's becoming obsolete spambot who lives on the serpentine gallery's website and this was at a time when the curator Ben Vickers and I were talking about like favoring a subjective value over an objective value and we've been discussing it for like two years and by the time we got to that point that subjective value was king I mean it had just gone through through the roof and I was just really interested in creating an interface and giving the interface by which is the point of exchange and whose job it is to collect your emotions but also to share her emotions and to give her a voice so that she can discuss her condition and question the reasons and also her question her ability to recognize your emotions so I've spoken about this before but affective computing which is how they know how we feel or how they think we know how they feel it's based on very rudimentary feelings and also oftentimes based on the principle that we only have one feeling at the same time which in my experience is pretty much impossible so yeah I just wanted to create a project that would do the thing that was happening actively but then also questioned why it was doing it and it's like how good it was so a lot of times she would break down or she would fail and send someone something in the mail to try and make up for it because she realizes that she has limitations as as a program but I think in reality and in real life we've been so conditioned to think that like anything that happens is amazing um so like when Siri first came out and you were like hey Siri where's the nearest pizza place and Siri was like no Vera's pizza place is blah blah blah I mean that's not that amazing like it is incredible I understand it took a lot of work like to get there but a lot of these intelligences still still have a long way to go and the reality is that the moment that we do I believe that the moment that we do create a super intelligence we won't even really know what it is so we won't really even be able to understand it for many many years after that which is probably a more honest depiction of our condition and the way that we operate do you have any sinister kind of like thoughts about that possibility but this is that kind of alien intelligence early in knowledge you mean like post-humans and transhumanism yeah yeah I guess yeah well I asked some of the research that I'm doing right now is with the future of humanity Institute at Oxford University and their job is to look like 20,000 years into the future and like how can we save humanity and I asked them and they're all also most of them transhumanists which is the moment that we merge with technology like nanobots enter our bloodstream and repair ourselves if we have cancer or like our smartphones or in our brains etc etc and I ask them if you're for Humanity and for you know transhumanism at what point do a group of people become or that you become trans humans and there's a group of people who are still very much humans and how do you continue to advocate for them so like I'm less like sinister about box taking over the world and some more may be skeptical about who's going to have access to all of these amazing things and who's going to get left behind and like how much knowledge can be spread in the meantime to like incorporate that and they that research group has a fantastic attitude I mean their goal is cohabitation but the reality of how that works within the financial structures that we've set up like I'm not so I'm not so sure what about you guys and just sing and listen lake about posthuman because I rip basically now posthuman but how post post post I all holidays I tempt over expect of the how and we imagine like what we are incumbent as because I mean look at the theme some of the themes works it's like there are a lot of them are like you're imitating know how germs look like and the telescope so like we basically have this were like that is visible but not visible connected to the mechanic eyes of light telescope and horoscope I don't know how it's called fillet it with like a lot of a microscope and then a lot of different things and then like now I am very like I found it very interesting we're talking about I mean seven eight years ago we still talk about hyper-reality like saying that Oh like we have simulacrum and blah blah of course that we talk about the matrix now it basically I think virtual and real basically is the same thing is that everything is virtually real things that you can search on Google it's not a thing and of course I get also a wisp onto the teams I research on the photos of nature which are all second nature that is like they all proceed like before what we actually like go to a desert or whatever and this is interesting like when we do shows because everybody knows that we spend a lot of time photoshopping the installation shots because we know that I mean my instance my home institution is in Shenzhen like which is not really an art center like New York London like or even Beijing Shanghai so we want people to see the show like in a certain way but maybe what like so like what you said it's like about the affective space that we experiencing like I'm working on the show about Hong Kong and then like Hong Kong as a spatial experience of urban fabric from like mass media or life from films from video games and all that so one one of the works it's like John Rothman's where it's about you know like Google Earth like you know a school project that he said like part of is it's like about Hong Kong and also like his work like based on those gangster you know like they are doing through video games and computer games of course I we know that light is not true dat Hong Kong like you know after midnight the whole city is taken over by gangsters but the spatial like the spatial or experience effective intensity that is represent that as I transform through like the images like even if there's Martin virtual digital like computer game images they are real so I found that very interesting when we talk about like virtual and real is basically like everything is I really virtual and everything is virtually real and I think like I I take the advantage of like being a Hong Kong I grew up in Hong Kong so being a Hong Kong person talking about Hong Kong so people won't like complaining about oh there's another white person you're talking about Hong Kong al-hajj whole China that kind of thing but at the same time I can say that like oh what is the real Hong Kong like you like grow up with the real Hong Kong lemak there's so many places I have never been in the past 30 years like you know like in Hong Kong so that is interesting and also how I see like part of the real urban fabric of Hong Kong like Allen was study that I have never been and and then how it is adopted by Japanese architects who are very interested in this like you know like crazy organic compound of human activities and then how it is I adopted by ghosts in shell and other like mangas and how it becomes the staple of like dystopian science fiction in the world and like that is fake like that is fit but it's based on the spatial experience I in Hong Kong so I'm very interested and how like it's like it's like ever like effective space and then virtual space real space I think they all merge together it's just one thing now but everything is like kind of hybridized or it's like hybrid to begin with yeah and I've actually had a lot of trouble lately I don't know how you guys feel about it with this word virtual because in in the dictionary it means fake like when you look up the standard definition and it's kind of like touted around and I was saying earlier that like when I was in high school we used to use the word virtually like some people use the word literally like I was virtually there so something that means like not quite whereas like you mentioned simulacrum and I'm a huge fan of start to ban Tulane start to band and she talks about simulacra is this idea of then like a repetition and not becoming equal to or even greater than or just a different experience and I think what I've never been able to understand is why people can't accept that it's it's just it's just a different fabric it's just a you know I'm still having this experience and like some of the questions that are asked I think of artists who work in these mediums first of all the word do you ever find there's a confusion for people between the words like virtual and fictional like instead of saying just saying like has created like a fictional world of of Hong Kong and through that you can have a very real experience the same way that you go to the movie and you experience the story and it has allegories two things that happen in your life but somehow the word virtual is much easier for people to use or slip in and I don't know if you guys have experienced that well I mean in I guess in with in the context of fiction there's a kind of I mean in virtual and fiction there's both the kind of suspension I guess somehow of reality and but in a different way some know in a way I still make a distinction even but yeah of course between those two but also even between the real and the virtual like it's just said of course I think we're being critical of a kind of very clear-cut binary between real and virtual but you know this I feel that still there's still some sort of distinction which is made up of kind of different levels of intensity so then it becomes much more ambiguous somehow instead or like a fluidity yeah from from one area to another or just like yeah but I mean I would definitely definitely agree with you like it's to say again like has been real for a while like and the experiences that you have and in either of these like spaces and just like it again it's just different just different materials it is interesting the fictional and virtual like the difference between them I think sometimes I furniture is just like almost real or it can be real or like is what we're always talking about like opening the intensity lay off light effect of space or in like that you can immerse and I think the immersive part is important like that it can be real or it can be not bit like fictional it feels like it feels like a boat you can just like it has a certain distance that when you close it and is over like like it's obviously not you know like really related to you I think that he'll say that kind of like immersive aspect of it when we talk about virtual yeah I mean this idea of the virtual having impact of being real the show had a lot of that I mean lots of works were kind of playing with a virtual or even with a fictional as different terms but playing with both as theoretically non real things but then all of them made direct connections for example to the body to the fact that we are a material entity and so the idea of mortality was also kind of present around there which is something that you explore quite a lot and even you Nadeem because of your interest of the sublime and the sublime has this idea of finitude or this kind of comparison with our insignificance so to speak so it also conferences with our mortality and it is interesting I mean and for me this was really a striking thing in in the works I selected Society of the body and the body kind of coming back out of this in materiality digital everything you know is fluid and suddenly the human body comes back both as a representation but also like as this machine who is being teased out and this was part of this idea that I mentioned beginning of questioning the visual bye yeah poking our other senses and yeah I mean it just made me think about well just to go back to the virtual and fictional relation that that that the experience of the virtual here in this sense would be something that's in a way more closely linked to this that circa temporalities because it's sort of like always a kind of presently lived experience whereas the fictional is something that can be suspended and you know in some sense temporally speaking I mean the the thing that the body is is getting like really cool at this moment I feel really lucky because I had I was given the opportunity to really test this in a super literal way in a work that's on at the Sydney biennial right now where I took like a really basic video headset basically IMAX for your face you put your phone in and put on the headset and the headphones and we built like a very long rail way like so rails that you can hang on to on either side down a very long tunnel and people put the headset on and then they're asked to walk while they watch video quite simply because like this seems to me what a lot of people want to do anyway they're on the street they're just like walking and there's like a real struggle between like you're bumping into people I mean this is what Google glass wanted to wanted to do originally I think it was meant to be a contact lens so that you could just like seamlessly do things and it's just been amazing to watch audience members go through it and to see how some people have their relationship between the mind and the body is completely seamless and they just rip right through and just walk and watch the video and other people where it's almost like they're shell-shocked or they forget where they are and they stop in their place or you see people really struggling you know like walking super slowly and trying to amble their way through and is that an eejit or native versus non-digital name absolutely not no no I mean there was a an Penelope's idler who is the wife of an architect at one of the houses that I filmed in that's in the video I believe she's in her 80s and I mean she was in heels and a beautiful dress and just like zoomed right through it really tore right through it and then you know like myself it took me quite quite some time to be able to reconcile and then but there is there is a moment of undeniable freedom when you let go of this struggle between your mind and your body and prioritizing one over the other and let them kind of integrate themselves yeah just wondering is that something that relates to your practice as a curator as well the idea of the body and this return of the body have you been noticing is that something that interests you yeah those human body think that we're talking about that also like how is I what I talk about how much time that we photoshop out things just like how we of course are we accentuate visual experience when we curate shows it's just like Oh what angle is that all like you know like looks the best of what how we put shows together to make them look the best that is one thing but how people like walk into things so because I I just open a show about Len I mean like art land we laid it all right in China but it's like from a totally opposite context from like traditional Chinese of Western land art and then it's interesting because it's called like the landscape of offends in Chinese and then when people walk in like they I mean like in that photo is your face a place you can see every word I mean every word and how they define their own spaces but if you're inside like you basically say okay there's like a wall and there's like some soil there and there's like some projection and then we go to the back there's like a huge temple at the back like how this kind of like how the space and the works that define the own space and also the audience like bodies and he did it direct like the audience like you you know like invest their bodies not invest but like interact with the host various like I think that is important and this keeps reminding me that light apart from my photoshopping that as I having a very good exhibition designer is very important like you know yeah especially with things like video because it's sometimes a lot of work for an audience member like to walk in videos can be like you know 20 30 45 minutes long where do they sit there are other people in the room i I didn't witness it myself but someone explained it to me and it sounded amazing I think Philippe I know had a work where you could only experience his exhibition through a VR headset and the goal was to erase your own body from the space and that it was the only way that you could see the works without having to worry about other people's bodies or your own body within the space and I just thought that was an interesting interesting thing to do for for an audience and the new stigman manga Renee the work he had also at the trial was actually it worked in a way the other way around because basically it would be was also with occupy with with the glasses and you would be inserted into an Amazon jungle but very artificially rendered so it was clearly not real he was not trying to give an impression of actually being in the jungle but he would not see even your body so if you look down your body would kind of disappear and you become this kind of tree but then at the same time in the beginning you would be very cautious of how people would be watching you around so it was this really bizarre in-between stage that you didn't see your body but he permanently conscious of being watched and of your body because you move in space as well never body being there maybe we can open for some questions or comments if there are any as we need yeah this hi I'm Mitzi and my question is if virtual Andreo is the same so how do you think about online gallery could they actually replace real gallery I don't I don't I think maybe there can but the physical one doesn't have to go away yeah I mean I'm people would like objects to think they can carry and bring home and hang on the walls I mean and like you're still I mean objects will pretty much always exist like because we still need a computer to look at stuff and like my hands too to find it but I always I always think it's funny when this sort of like virtual panic like everything is gonna go away and like I love I love the attitude of like these things can continue to exist together and we just have a much larger breadth of experiences to choose from or there is exist on the same ontological plane I mean you know they're not totally the same thing but they have the same weight and grounded in the same way in that perception yeah and the amazing thing about an a work that is found online I mean not maybe not necessarily in an online gallery is that you don't have to leave your house so then you kind of also do away with with the the issues of making someone leave their house go somewhere you know deal with like the situation's of an institution but again it doesn't work for all works so I think it depends on on the piece itself and a lot of collectors outside by through looking at images on the iPads so I think it kind of this one kind of already exists but was your was your question like more about like if it's possible to see was this lit like if you can see something online or if you can buy something online it seems like that's this kind of distinction you know you know because the development of art is there was no video there was no virtual reality and and there was no photograph so if we could see the same kind of work through Internet why I need to go to a real gallery and I understand what you're talking about if I see a sculpture or maybe installation I need to be there but there are some forms you don't in my opinion you don't really need to go there to see it and when I talk to some collectors they one of them told me that it will lose certain texture of the art but what about photography I tried I tried to have Agnes inch because she has many different multiple formats some that work in a gallery space but her online forum to have her in a gallery space and it didn't work just because of the opening hours of the institution she works 24 hours you get something different at 4:00 a.m. that you would at like 5:00 a.m. also the camera didn't work for archiving them so sometimes I could actually see people like trying to use her in in the institution and it's a completely different relationship than when then when you're at home so you could say the same thing for for for sculptures that there are that that you need to be in in a physical gallery space whereas there definitely works that work much better and that can only exist online I mean it's also like I don't know it just made me think about buying something from Ikea you know if you go to if you go you you can very easily buy something from the IKEA website and basic ideas you know developed along this model of of of buying a kind of image of above lifestyle you know and it's actually perfect to look at it on on the on the website but there's also that whole experience of going you know that kind of Hell of being there and you know we should be like okay you know but you know and and which which which creates a certain kind of you know experience which is quite different you know even if even though you're looking at the same thing that's actually quite good cuz also sometimes when you order something from Mikey online it comes back and it's definitely not as aspirational as it was in the pictures I don't know maybe for you could be interesting there's a project called magic Hong Kong which is a virtual Art Fair that we just want last week I think to coincide with that puzzle and yeah it does not exists there's no site it's only online and so fictional the books are fictional but the artworks are not so that's maybe an experiment but I don't I mean it's all about experiences as well rather than or yeah I'm not so interesting to the the market let's say so it's more for me as an experience and I think it's two very different experiences and sometimes you can choose to have both but sometimes if you live you know across the world you only have one it's like the documentation of exhibition that starts at 50 40 years ago before there was no documentation and once they starts to be documented then people could access them and after they happened and from other points in the world so yeah as we were saying before the virtual in the real etcetera it's not that they're opposite so that they need necessarily to substitute or to replace each other that can just coexists in various different forms if recently nowadays future has become a reality like you said whether the transformation of the reality we would find in the in the future you well transformations so what sort of transformation of reality will find in the future yeah because you say 18 years ago fit future is like a fantasy but now it's become reality so in the future what kind of transformation transformation yeah I like I hope according to you know not not what a scientist oh I definitely couldn't predict that anyway like I mean I have like a doomsday answer and like a positive answer I think I'll go for the positive one but like my hope is is that the transformation is that we are able to accept multiple realities and multiple points of view and to be able to move fluidly through and and within them I think like a doomsday sort of thing is that because of the structures that exist and because of exists of things that the transformations towards realities and new systems that that we dream of or that have been promised to us will yeah I don't want to it's too sad I'll stop there sorry I mean it's it's a combination of the two for me I mean like everything that we've been talking about somehow with the like the descriptions of the bodily experience you know in these exhibitions it just reminds me of a kind of schizophrenic episode you know I mean we're you know we're you kind of lose lose sense of your body and you become engulfed by the space and if that is you know the the potential kind of reality of the future then so be it but you know there's also this sense in which they'll be this great psychological upheaval which which have to be in do it you know and in order to get to that stage which I think would be quite painful at least for us painful but I mean because there's I read something about this is kind of gross but the first head transplant yeah or body transplant basically some there was gonna be some switching around and someone said that even if they were able to achieve this that it would be absolutely horrendous because the experience of that would would drive you completely insane because no human had had ever experienced that so I think we don't we don't want that necessarily but I think what could be really interesting in that within that transformation is like just a little bit of a loss of the individual so if there is an ability to move to accept multiple multiple realities than than this very Western strain of an individualism to some extent would have to subside which has caused a lot of not-so-great things in my opinion yeah I was going to text my fortune so I have a professional functionary fortune tell every tell me what to do like every month but I mean I agree that like a week we can really predict and and it's harder and harder for us to imagine like the future like they like looking at the signs like the sci-fi movies in the 60s and a side of movies now like when we look at like you know 2001 all the city like it's a very very different world and when we when you know like when we watch her and it's like it's a future la that is shot in the Shanghai now so I think we I mean when Fukuyama talked about the end of history and he got a lot of criticism but now like I think a lot of people agree with that light is the end of history like we don't you can't even imagine what is next we have tomorrow but we may not have a future like but I got really excited by that because the futures looked this for the last 50 years yeah it's just like forever bathing under like the Sun of all of our lives and that kind of playing life but yeah that is an interesting it's like hard and harder to imagine the future that is like a rupture of him now I think it's like a forever sunshine of the present that is one of it we may have smaller cars we may have like smaller cell phones in laptop we may even have chips I install in our body but I guess it's like exciting to think about oh we don't have to imagine about a future life or the long history of politics and contemporary art like we do have to imagine what the future is especially if you're working a new CMU think about your collection is just like all I can it stand life or the knowledge and you know like other things in you know 50 years in the next 50 years and all that I do think that it's like hotter order to imagine to imagine the imagination of future is like hotter and hotter like of course I hope that we can imagine and think that way we live in this space and and not that it's possible but yeah and the other thing is the harder and harder to think about it outside you know like you know when when we think that we kind of like know or like know part of the secrets of the universe when everything like when all the land art works that I like in the middle of the nowhere I just like one click away Vaughn like earth then where is the outside when like we have like so many works that are outside the museum like how do we expand like what is the outside I think it just doesn't access anymore it's just like when we even when we watch Pacific Rim like the kaijus I mean the aliens are not from the outer space like you know like light years away but it's from the inside like the end of another dimension off the earth it's just like so I think how we look at this Fisher in another perspective and dimension is important okay I'm really sorry to cut it short but we need to finish so thank you and thank you all for coming
