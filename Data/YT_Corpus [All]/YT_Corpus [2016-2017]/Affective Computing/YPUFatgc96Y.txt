 three words three words are handed to me like a gift a gift that I can choose to open or not jesus loves you these words one voice in the kitchen in my home he's not in England the country of my father I listened Jesus does these words don't mean rudely except me i wept i worked hard two years or one I could not stop crying I did not know why but they touched me very deeply am sorry I know this is a testimony that is not very academic but it is what it is I understand the words of jesus loves you may not work for everyone after all not everyone embraced Jesus or his word in his nighttime so why should we today I understand that representations of God or complex diverse paradoxical paradoxical and even logical and as i say this i think of monty pythons the night of crime yes documents and I kromagg war Brian who was mistaken for a massage finger by many this man is not perfect indeed his mother declared that isn't really naughty ball away anyway I digress Ryan isn't overwhelmed by the adoration of those who follow him for seemingly no reason when the mass is chasing he tries to dot them at every opportunity when he drops his shoe his father was lifted up in the area claiming as a sort of holy symbol and when they gather in a courtyard bride who was now cornered and in despair and desperately to quell the adoration that surrounds him and Lance's my balcony overlooking the courtyard please please please listen I got one or two things to say and the crowd stain tell us turns both of them and bryan said look you've got it all wrong you don't need to follow me you don't need a little anybody you've got to think for yourself you're all individuals and the crowd sound yes we're all individuals and Ryan said you're all different and the crowd says yes we are all different and one man in the crowd said I'm not and the crowd says Shh the crowd was saying Shh when one person appears to deviate from the chorus by saying that he is not difficult this seems health is so much about some of how some of us encounter not only communities of faith but other group assemblies to whom or what do we say Shh whatever group with which we align what perspective to wish away through our apathy our difference our cultural preferences that I even said our biases and political affiliations it's true I earn a degree from the University of California Berkeley studies which qualifies we took a genius and my hair is 0 specialization is an african-american picture of the culture and I am currently an associate professor Drecker distinction studies a better University but I'll not be really worth of you especially I enjoy my work my identity is not rooted in four title in my phone relationship with God I can be putting myself myself I'm not cold to be a minus functionary I'm not cool to leave my brain I mean my my mother my brain at the door when I encounter god I cannot Joe the captain a Bible argue with God and God in handle it I can share my doubts and skepticism with God I don't have to have it all together I also don't have to think of others and not be consumed by myself so I thought I was had to think of others and not be consumed by myself my relationship with God is as simple as it is complicated my interactions with God are frustrated complexity and fulfilling its missing my failing is at Crystal as it is shaped by the reverse communities and environments with whom I interact the concept of a strong black woman who endures all things was rested to the needs of all people who is what's on your verses character in their eyes are watching god the woman conquer world presents many black women with ways or me that can call many of us supportively in my sex and practice or water to you we often call to show resiliency in the midst of trials that were commendable and important and in no time essential could discourage will shut down the ability of many of us to engage with the breath d complexity of emotions and weaknesses strengths and experience that come with being human to find your eyes to rest the practice of care communicare or what I call God care to know what is our work and what is not our work to learn when to say no and yet had to be in touch with our feelings or ability or state of being that if we do not observe and nurture can cause it to deny our ability to embrace our fears our sadness or anger and yes even our joy commotion racial matters can be hard on a body might experience confronting discriminators of any kind enrolled one sense of well-being so what I think got the connection between racing and reconciliation and justice and forgiveness I reminded that we must want to know others to diminish our humanity in my scholarship in writing I try to my examples of those who cultivate them item and practice of agency buying aging with their vulnerabilities embracing their knees even as they can both judge injustice one of my heroes in this regard is sergeant plan the young african-american was stopped by a policeman in a seemingly routine traffic stop she demanded that she be treated with respect and that she articulate her right on her own terms Sandra bland was arrested and Diana Lisa the police officer who was a replica recipe was charged for perjury nature Sandra bland is dead and yet sorry speaks she talked about in her visual log Sarge's speaks about her joys and struggles she embraced her complex human experiences and she could still ask hard questions of herself and those who condone racial justice and racial disparities in America in 100 local entrepreneur conference is who disparage the black lives matter movement by varying such critics to show her a time in American history when all lies have matters I need to Center enhancer on her presence even though she is not with us physically show how its run in American history when more lies have acted discrimination is real but I refuse to give others the powers of requirement I often say to my students that I don't do double consciousness the great African American Thinker activism academic wbd voice coined the term double consciousness it is 1903 classic the sort of lack of what he maintains that it is a peculiar sensation is double consciousness this says are always looking at once opening eyes and others of measuring one's soul by the type of a word that looks on in a music content and pity whatever feels an American Negro two souls two goats to unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one doc body whose dog in strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder for me personally makes no sense for me to place my work in the hands of those who cannot erase all of me especially since I can bring all of myself to God and know that I loved and cherished and accepted by God Christians are not words deny the girls of the world nor are they ought to deny their contribution to the name of the world when he kristijan not mr. likes often is worth of weapons to main undermine and even destroy those with whom we disagree the history of Christianity is one of examples of those who've used the name of Jesus to exploit still form and abuse many people to deny this truth would be to deny the existence of other people's sacred stories and histories I first have experienced great injustice in my life but many people the weather who have accounted a baptized mid- and show me love their words and actions lower reconciliation does not deny the pin in the world and neither should we learn reconciliation and reconciliation is not passive but cause us to listen learn from and to align with the disenfranchised was jesus said that least of these no reconciliation and reconciliation causes to consider how to pleasure others Louisville reconciliation requires humility and for us to prevent our prices and it means recognizing reconciliation requires us to be mindful that we use our privileges for the betterment of all we do not live in a vacuum as Martin Luther King says is letter from a Birmingham jail we are caught in its inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly and as the acclaimed african-american water Tony Horton acknowledges in paradise love is not easy as she says love is divine only and difficult always if you think it is easy you are full if you think it is not sure you're blind it is a learned application without reason or motive except that it is God you have to practice God you have to think God carefully not even this dr. Martin Luther King jr. testifies that he had decided to stick with love for hate is too great a burden to bear to this I say amen amen so thanks to the veritas forum and thanks to all the organizers for inviting me here today to what I expect to be a very engaging and fruitful discussion actually especially humbling to think about these issues and have this conversation during the week that we honor and celebrate the legacy of Reverend dr. Martin Luther King Jr who I believe is a really powerful model for how they can productively exchange ideas about reconciliation faith and the fight for racial equality and social justice so we're asked today to think about how our academic pursuits our academic and research interest meld with our faith so I was trained and the sociologist I got my soup PhD in sociology from the University of California Berkeley with the concentration on gender and feminist issues which I approached from an intersectional lens meaning I think about gender in relationship to raise sexuality class and other forms of social difference so what are you decided to go to graduate school and decided to embark on my career as an academic I was motivated by three key factors one I want to be able to think critically about the world around me secondly I wanted to make sense of myself I wanted to give social relevance to the personal and intellectual communities that are retired to my identity and those around me and then I wanted to change the world I wanted to engage in social justice so as a sociologist my work is to think deeply and questions many of the taking for granted assumptions about how the world works for example right now I'm working on a book that looks at me d pageants in Nigeria and on the face we can't seem to be a pretty irrelevant site for asking any type of profound question but in my work I think about and talk about and write about how many peasants and larger debate about aesthetics and about beauty draw on water issues of globalization gender and national identity through my work I remain interested in understanding difference and inequality and the values of community of community that we create blur and sometimes transcend for example through gender race immigration and national nationalism my academic work formalized many of the questions I had growing up about different inequality and power it allowed me to think about to think about both the similarities and consistency between my own experiences at the larger social world the questions I asked how I asked them how I go about answering them are very much informed by who I am and my identity is a black woman of my journey intricate parents I'm also motivated about a bite of engaging in social justice and I think about my teaching about such emotionally and politically charged topics like racism and the socially consoled junction of gender as my own modest contribution to that differ by asking students think about social structures that prop up in a body they can realize that they too can take a prop take part and dismantling that that those same structures that we all socially construct I hope that conversations in my classroom that we can have a deeper engagement and that through the course material students learn and understand the world around them in ways that directly translate into social action and trouble the status quo so when I was asked an inviting today to to think about reconciliation to think about social justice and to think about faith I'll be honest I I cost I very rarely talked about my faith in my religion in public and I think my religion is very kind of private thing I think especially given kind of the social context in which we live in in which there's a lot of Islamophobia I was honestly felt vulnerable putting myself out um and I've always kind of thought about my face and academic pursuits as it has largely separate I think in my training as an academic that was very much encouraged there's a sort of assumption that in our research we're supposed to in some way kind of distance ourselves from that pursuit but I've always approached my research and approached my intellectual interest through my own personal questions of my own identity so I was raised Muslim by Nigerian immigrant parents who came to the u.s. in the 1980s being boring and largely raised in the US my sense of what it means to be Muslim it's very much shaped by growing up in America and growing up in the diversity area community where I was raised well amazingly along with my four siblings largely a missing a mother and though her although she herself came from a fairly strict Muslim family I wouldn't say that I was raised very religiously we were enrolled on something classes to learn how to read the Quran in Arabic but we never completed the course I was never aged to fade black yearly fares except are given year when my mom insisted that we all pray together as a family so my images are bringing was inconsistent at best and although I've always identified as Muslim it wasn't until I got to college where I started to become more interested and learning about my own fate spurred by the many you know typical questions that college students ask themselves Who am I where do I belong I'm sure questions that if you recall should your grappling with today so as I continue to learn to think about my fave I realize that many of the pathways that animate my research address and living life such as critical thought thinking about identity and social justice remain relevant to my fate in college I discover the cop the concept of insead which is part of Islamic document that emphasizes personal struggle an event independent reasoning and deep thought as a feminist two things intersectional II about global links between race sexuality gender and class my religious identity and fade serve as another network where my son in the mind of my identity that informed the types of questions I asked and the gaps the gap I see as I analyze the social world I understand that my fate property I also come to my face partly through the prism of social justice compassion and peace in calling attention to the many and justices in our world from proof police from the brutality targeting black men black men and women the marginalization of students of color on college campuses anti-muslim rhetoric xenophobic threats against undocumented immigrants and the many other important issues tied to marginalized communities I see a larger communal struggle that's tied to my research ties my teaching and also ties you might think so thank you and dr. Canion dr. Mallia say we shall transition in asking of our presenters a few questions which are gonna sleep or to the subject here so I'm going to start with you now I dr. cloud you can you tell me how your research and your personal experiences have informed what you believe about the human nature whether before you know fundamentally good or evil or wood and how does this line or conflict with your worldview hehe me now black horizon um okay so one of the hard things about this question in which is very dense illogical I'm not feel to the number of identity but I also maybe the literature part of me have issue with seeing human nature as one conceptual theory we are very diverse we have any aspect to our human nature so so I I also resist bonner isn't the sort of good and evil sort of abstract terms because I think what it does is it undermines the complexity of our humanity now does that not mean that I think that many of us are capable of producing relationships that how can make much goodness to the world and kind of do I believe that we have a potential to be destructive in our actions and we use words yes I do think you are capable and that the possibilities in that regard are endless for me personally one of the reasons why it's hard for me to even as I'm trying to understand who I am or ongoing basis is that on a typical day I could have a particular batch of you about my cell phone issue and by having an interaction of somebody else that can be refined challenged privatized by their interaction so for me a sexual ethos of what it means for me to be pretty human in the world that I didn't is to be teachable to i have a deer held steady prayer is I pray that I will never be a teachable and I really miss that a lot on Jesus's ability to acknowledge some of the most marginalized despise peoples that he interact with him and uphold them as examples of faith to use two references individuals in a way that would be honoring and all he often did is currently and challenged their religious leaders of the day even his own disciples his own followers and I'm also remind that there's a lot of ways in which I'm astounded how many people but more did Jesus with questions and challenges so not that I might be able to do that with me tonight I'm saying but one of the things that I as a leader I find him really quite remarkable and they said that he doesn't stop people from questing him and he never sizes people when they talk to him so I me as I'm learning what it means to be human I take a lot of inspiration from those biblical narratives I mess up a lot I certain say that I'm perfect although i do see two muscles regulator on the cheese with family i I think there are various factors that influence who we are and our behaviors and part of i think the thrill and the challenges of embracing one of my humanity even though i think that i wear them to wonder is that what impossible in my lifetime because i thought that when I discover things about who I have other layers come up but the journey is one that can't be both choice and painful some of those discoveries it means that for me it's hard for me just to see any four people in a complete your magic light because I do you think we're very complicated in a potential what I was like I said to be both to be her at all to be affirmed to recognize each other's value it's not easy I I do think it's important in that process to not deny what we can learn from others and I really it was a Dominican the student for the Dominican Republic my class last semester that I say was the real conscious conscious of our class and she covered a culture that doesn't think so much in the IRA in the weave and sometimes you don't realize how much your part with a particular drug Dorian discourse until you interact with somebody else and for me the way even though I come my parents are to make a descent this we I I saw this little added by me and how they're very interconnected and the wicked knobs are essentially stick it has various components various diversity in that as SDI but living in that tension has become a really important part 1by formation I i find the narratives of my life plural I guess not anyer it can be both it can be circular and you even with that circularity there was like revelations that have that I wasn't aware of but I do feel that was of reconciliation and I take this from one of this view that it doesn't practice cheap race or cheap for peace I think that there's got to be a call for 40 to deal with many charges and sacrifices when you think of those who confronts injustice on a daily basis and that's not something that I would say is everyone should do but i do feel personally as a Christian that I feel more to ask other questions those kinds of hard questions I don't feel according what if Mike's to tell that is outside of that this is how you should live in this is what you should do it's a little bit line house anymore have you have any women in a situation where somebody has sent something about a family member and part of your impulse is saying no you know that's not your job but you will all pick your own family as I other peoples have experienced it I feel that I have my call is to to challenge those of us who sailor where Christine's how are you loving others how are you tuning of injustice how are you more elite the way of Jesus and we have to really hold each other accountable in that report I no problem doing that thank you for the affair wall pose the same question to can be in again repeated of the missing boy audience here how is your research in your personal experiences formed what you believe about in the nature you know people good evil or they knows how does this hopefully could be a world view yes I want to pick up a lot of what dr. they said in terms of thinking about the questions it's pretty much respect as a flawed question because again I resist this idea of a binary that people were either fundamentally interconnect you're good or fundamentally in their creative nature evil so the way that I can think about it is that people are kind of limited there's kind of possibilities and then there's invitation so kind of a combination of the larger social forces that are relevant in our society but then interacting with people's personal choices and people's personal agency that Emmett forums the way that people live their lives so again I'm where I am thinking about people is going to get it maybe your energy signature being being good or evil in it that's definitely the assoc obviously me so I think that it's more thinking about you know what are the instances the condition the circumstances we apply that will have a possibility to change the world or have the possibility to think about these questions or holistic perspective versus you know what are the ways that people feel constrained or limited and to not even think about these questions or feeling constrained legends I think that I go in the flesh sort of lot in a way because I don't really think about it as you said in my kind of my merry way good versus evil because I think there are districts of both they can explain our human society because apart from me because I'm perfect you know I mean the reality is and then I'm gonna throw this out at you men call this a bit I kind of engage with this noted undermine the seriousness of what we're talking about but I do think we have to give in a room one another to also give up we talked about so for dinner actually give each other the space to grow to to discover us make mistakes and I think what those of us who are academics we're so immersed in this stuff I mean his remarks I think my students are you to disregard has big there reminds me oh this is where I mean not to say that I've arrived I mean I am joking about the original like way I am joking about seriously but I did think humility for me is really key and this whole notion of teacher build I just in a short time that I had a conversation candy of no much on her and at those seeds I think will continue as I engage so I think that's important the relational in the ability to move in different circles I think is really key different regions and and in get your different body systems and I do think for the sociologist perspective we know that there are some people who live in so called ghettoes because of infrastructures that have been sent up to keep it there okay but my order dinner other kinds of ghettos that people create themselves while they are engaging with people who looks like air or share certain values and already wanting to engage others house side of that in a way and what it does as I think it definitely exposes us to know any the body with them but to stick with certain categorizations right so I want to ask that bring us to to today in probably the last few months we have had a lot going on and head bother we have talked about the a justices of the past at the current but I want you to respond each one of you about it justices like what we have seen Charles don't know I would be so in Oregon the energy in our community college in other places so what does what wrote is a complain and when is it appropriate what is the root of forgiveness when it is that is forgiveness appropri and how do they took AMC see the likes of the progress of the bedroom so instead hitter so I wanted to talk I guess more about anger because I think that we think about your we think about it as being a very frustrating emotions and emotion that doesn't feel very useful at times but I think that you'll be productive so argyl oracle feminist black feminist talks about the uses of power abuses of power usage of loud anger and power in fact and that when you're able to recognize your anger we're able to use that productively to name the social justice and to be able to name what would I need to contract so i think that instead of thinking about anger is being purely limiting or thinking about it uncontrollable emotion there's a lot of power and peacefulness behind that and then also thinking about to regress think about getting ingram forgiveness instead of that kind of tension what i was thinking you out is that it's more attention between fear and fearlessness especially a thinking about a vulnerable and any impressed because i think there's a certain level of fear involved you're trying to count out up when you trying to counteract social justice putting yourself out there using your voice in that way a calling or action that same time lips feel that fearlessness in that saying that in using my voice in naming injustice I'm use guiding their ship kind of fearlessness around that and being able to to speak out we see injustice so that was not the way that I was seeing that and that question especially in line of thinking about affordability thinking about my friend and thinking about social justice absolutely i think i think i am very productive it can also be destructive in self-destructive if you internalize it I think I'm any sphere release but you need to Craig morsel safe spaces for there to be released I think if you time anger with a particular expectation of how an individual people respond to that what you do is you give power to those who you want to convince that your anger I think you need to be mindful that because i saw this recently at march where somebody was very angry about a racial injustice and wanted stroke members of an establishment to embrace the record and that was not happening and one of the things I did was wasn't so much to fix that anger or even to sit down but to recognizing it more to the egg and i went off that person and i was able to you know just sense to just just affirmed I Hugh you know I hear you I see and that person I think I was so interesting to see that person not again I say diminish or denied his anger but there was something about that acknowledgement that was really naughty affirming but how to calm him yeah anissa that I think that's important and I think i'ma go for me as a Christian I think nanga is also another emotion that God created so for me it's great for me to give my energy thought and to what sagging in another Christian communities is that Chris bloggers who ended up over to America and so they didn't think suppressive took that for real answer to kind of create a persona of Christianity that the noise that emotion in certain circles and so the major really important that I'm very real with God and I mentioned in my mouth using introduction that to be able jovan with note you know there came a point when he had to restaurant I think for me that was really that's what if one of everything crazy I have to say but leaving that emotion lamenting as a number of scholars and other leaders are about as emotional prophetic levitation so can they come together how do you real well injustice and also forgiveness is not a one-time deal in regards of you know just anger doesn't have one particular kind of expression the main forgiveness is is key and if you're a member of organized dealing with injustice forgiveness is somehow too costly deal I mean in in Charleston which other beloved trust and I there was a lot of criticism about those forgave the young man killed 9 and Charleston and I remember one of the gray and your God if you don't know her you won't know more about a Reverend Traci Blackmon was really one of the guardian lights in this here several rocks much movement she made a comment that you know at the end of the day it's not for us to regulate when and how people forgive this may be a part of some members process yes I think just to piggyback off that really quickly to think about so the point that you raised about the Charleston I'm thinking about how faith could be away in from a channeling then and anger and gets to the point if they were talking about how and you're not just internalizing it but making meaning out of it yeah and how forgiveness and also be a part of that it's not easy at all I were able to say that and it's not for us to put these people's behaviors in how they forgive and what they what they forgive but from a very so much point of view what I'm learning a lot arrived in this forgiveness is good for my home for me because when I live in a second unforgiveness it is actually so destructive in it really trust me off from so much the life experience from others but this man I'm all right there there are errors of my life I quantities you to forgive that I'm others I want to transition as very quickly before we invite our audience to ask any questions I want to ask you maybe 30 seconds you're more telling us how to deal with this from the inside and out asian I found in forgiveness but I'm wondering what resources can you tell us if you want to resources as a Christian you you are telling us to be more anger to go on but can you tell the audience what recesses do you see your faith then support you especially when there's so much economic differences in and so much inequality especially african-american community Anna I actually think that when I give my god that's not and more and i pray that was what is saying i'm going to stay there the next question is what why do we support to love an action love it you can't be in some I feel like how I contribu how it was going to do just as I want to be I want to be guided by wood that personally so prayer is key I think it's going to be really important in private Christians to be really moist about their their resistance to certain issues so if you give you in black mass movement Lee means up into you if you have a resistance towards that well in things up until the creases that what we tell anybody else I mean I love you you know I total is is really to ask to give that to God the simple you know I have a visor and then ask you a question what do you respond there are practical things other practical things to do in Flint Michigan you have communities predominant african-americans poor people who are not given dignity to drink water clean water in their communities now you have a church there that's quite a portable commission president & muslim quarter who is who is the same distributed 30,000 builders of water to Flint Michigan when that kind of practical response so not only time you know an approach from their heart will favor us a big practical but it gives us one way that then we should cook with this oh I was on my think as I mentioned briefly my remarks I definitely approach my faith through the lens of social justice at the lenses social responsibility so if you read the Quran it says that one of the ways which you show your closest to God is by showing social justice by being just so I think that gypsum is lost one resource i sees and thinking about how your face higher religious belief more gives your bronze virtual sense is linked to a broad idea with social responsibility and civic engagement so how would I your way of looking at the words world your world view is shaped by how you get back in something and correctly and I think I technologists as a when I thanked her for porn so much to me as a professor at Berkeley and I support you but I do to thank you it is impossible i do think i'm going to be involved in every single person in this room has privileges what do you do with those privileges i mean i think there comes a point where we have to be aware of what are the resources that we have and I and then to whom do we just share those resources with if it's only with people who look like us or there's a problem there and I think we need to really be challenged to think about how these are images for the greater good so in the interest of time I will post there with a presenters but i want to invite the audience we have a microphone here if you have a question to our presenters intercambio powder ah would you please come over i asked that question and hours in ogden to respond thank you we have about 20 minutes so what does forgiveness actively look like for you and then what is it also actively like to get something unforgivable like if you're not willing to forget it so what can you forgive him what can you forgive what's forgivable listen good so that's I think so complex dependent in the sense that personally I feel like thinking generally about forgivable what's not forgivable that's very much shaped by the context in which it happened right so i think that there's a shirt kind of power being able to to get to that place and what you're saying you're kind of let it go in some ways but i think that i don't think that's an expectation that we should have everyone to be able to get to that stage because it involves a lot of lots of i want to say in some ways sacrifice being able to say I can forgive you so do you want her to spawn 22 yeah I think forgiveness I agree with chemie don't despair context I keep on coming back to it it's not easy I've known in my lower leg and everything edge to this forgiveness so one is that I have allowed myself to not rush into Kipnis puts a limit attention of the pain that I'm feeling I think it's really important at ease for me to do that the other is just to give an example where I was assaulted by a white male when I was an undergraduate in a pub in England and one of the things that was hard to leave during that time was I was the only black person surrounded by four white my white friends and to talk about the police came said they could do nothing about it and I mean we were all stunned by how this happened but when when I wanted to tell I come from Eastern plugin and background day you mess with somebody then there were repercussions so I had a dear friend there there's a maybe a Christopher out of the ring movies and there's a peaceful night and one of the things that anyone wants to make a lot more than please talk to me I know every bakes him anyway so when my friend found out I had been assaulted he wants to know who it was and he said my brother is a 6 6 foot 6 drags right nothing back gorgeous black head and strong and he called my work early he said right you know it's happened to Claudia get a room together most of the south and you know I won't like go to poverty but I also do context to be that for a dozen black men to travel from London to walk which was very much and the opportunity for them to get arrested and jailed be great and so I chose not to have them come up what ended up happening was I saw that white man of a stairwell and he spooked and I just thought well you know you're lucky you know for real but I didn't say anything it took big years to heal from that experience years I took the year to see the respective that my friends were afraid they didn't know what to do they were stunned I could forgiveness deepened I was able to appreciate the nuances of the story but why can't say is this forgiveness does not mean forgetting even in the Bible there's no such thing as we forget that's our war and I think these stories of the members of them are very insightful and learning how how being algebra two god cards others I have I gotta say I'm too many wonderful brothers who are one man who would have really bad for me in major ways and if I didn't forgive it would have shut me off from these incredible men in my life but that looks like they're free of devices that come with being a white male it's sorta but they are very you know so as we contemplate a bow forgiveness if you have a question would you please come to the microphone I'm sure somebody else has a question so give me a moment okay ah so if you have a question haha but I want to kind of read the ring guess what you say that forgiving is unburdening yourself it is allowing you to be free but I'm also hearing that is also process you can sub vector can just drop it some donuts painful is painful hi this is mainly from kami Islam has been poisoned pretty much by radical Islamic terrorists and so the question for you is how do you purge your religion from the hatred and for the Christians it would be how do you approach Christy the hatred of Westboro Baptist Church and I think one of the major things we need to do is name that Islamic terrorism and Isis al Qaeda the Taliban Boka Haram almost all Islamic terrorists are Muhammad's and the House of Saud for 200 years has been aligned with Wahhabism the difference between what autism and other Muslims is that they have declared toepfer or a plastic all non bahamas and so they think to this all right to murder unbelievers and anyone or havas so the question is how can you get some mohave imam to declare a fatwah against killing innocent civilians and how can you get them to declare that they go to hell instead of heaven and how you define heaven as a place where you pet puppies rather than rape women yeah I don't know precisely process how that happened like talks a little bit about my thoughts about what I think I do because I think that one please kind of business discussion about what to me even name like how do we we call about Muslim people said should we call it a cult you know that it's not really divorce it from this box it's not that people say it's not strong and I think you're pointing to that the way that we understand kind of radical Islam it's tied to particular time and moment there's a history behind why radical Islam and and why terrorism globally is happening in this particular comment it's not in isolation it's not just because of religious conviction its particular politics geography exception right so I think that a lot of people could have pipple about whether should we call it radical Islam should we not all about color medical um I think that the same way in which the same ways in which you have if you have a fringe group in any community doing something that the overwhelming majority of people without faith say this doesn't represent me doesn't represent my religion that same way in which people take that on its face and say listen one loop bridge group doesn't speak for this whole 1.5 million people around the world I think that same kind of understanding should be extended to Muslims are important so I think that if you have a small community it opens we grow for all the religion and I think that a lot of people will say that o Muslims aren't speaking on to say that terrorism is wrong about that just is this is extremism but I admire responses like people were sick have been every single time there's a ferris tap people are saying it's not my religion and it made an awesome militia and then secondly the most so all the different terrorist groups names the number one targets are other Muslims right so more Muslims have died in the hands of Islamic fundamentalist then other people rock'n'roll so I think that also recognized that there is a Pacific contestation happening but it's not happening in a vacuum is happening during a particular historical moment that there's meetings attached to this is very important things soever the eye there's a couple triggers for me also is who we identify have terrorists thoughts and who identifies with ambition and bond and I think it is very raised in terms of who we see as a threat and so I think that I have a critical engagement who is isolated as being if you like the essentialist representatives of these terms we need to proper ties I mean it's because it's not easy essentially but it becomes very inclusive or home so I'm very much against the Maccabiah that is so in many ways has been closed so primitive especially in mainstream media and with that i would say cuz you know Ashley as a Christian I know that partly there are many Christians sort of our apathy times our our wedding is to deal with the hard questions to see our nativity me about seeing our neighbor as ourselves to live our either publish fundamental aspects of Chris's bang it doesn't surprise me that it's a journal block people for real father-in-law wanting to engage a lot number was not wanting to engage those issues and to stand alongside those two are despised by those who have a power to take who gets catalyzed and in what way which is why did it's really important that we do step out on our there's a lot of people of our comfort zone it's a lot of people will say that Christian and they justify what they're doing but it has actually nothing to do with how Jesus lived or what he said and how who did it and magic I there's a woman a Palestinian American Muslim her name is endurance a strong i don't know if i'm pronouncing for last name correctly but one of the things i said earlier is I feel Jesus often took the most unlikely for people to teach that his followers and disciples about the love wisdom of God for me her one of her comments was if you're not careful the newspaper was what happened hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who are doing the oppressing and I've ever given me supposed to think because they have in certain times in my life where I've had to not be engaging us from our decks because it fit I didn't when I was happening in spite of myself who I think God when he arrest my spirit then that I was quite really certain outlets I was beginning to reduce people to a stock figure which is quite frightening to admit that but I think it's important I think if I'm winning in a neighborhood Spain I can be that real with God and save you no more this is happening and I could sense through prayer that I need to do not engage with that particular outline because it was having a particular slot and I'm telling you the fruit of that has been my ability to engage with people who I was beginning to be suspicious or or distance for myself if this is not attractive stuff admit but I think I think it's important to be honest about the ways in which we can embrace your perspectives the are not honoring of others there's always going to be extremes I make in any circle and I don't think you can avoid my time I actually don't believe anything those extremes I mean it's interesting you know for some advice should come from you know countries where you have grown up with Muslims are you go to school with them they're part of your community and now the rhetoric is the other way around it is very hard to balance that sometimes but because we have just about 10 minutes left make it brief maybe national honors question before era back he talked about not being cheap forms of greatest war chief forms of peace and maybe it's because my Asian background but I still miss fine I'm really difficult to talk about race because it kind of lost the boat yeah and I'm kind of wondering what does the person look like contact us what does grace looks like in the context of race race and what is real like you're having these difficult discussions what is bracelet of mine I think for me place looks like being able to appreciate that in many ways we are all a working progress and that progress is not like I said linear but i'm learning to and this is where I by no from Jesus because I i think the disciples didn't get it was the time I think there were motley crew I think there were real nests they were honest and you know they could heal see Jesus he like 4,000 the morning cast out demons with somebody in the day and then 5,000 people came home to get food and this is what we do now and I was a maggot juice on this one more time shall we I was founded his patience and ability that when they decide connoisseur argue about who is the greatest and they do so even though you know Jesus was right there but they're talking about themselves he was the greatest and when Jesus was but he doesn't interrupt them when they're having this discussion and this debate and when they actually end up when he actually asked them their their response his silence and why would then be rented it's because it becomes a teachable and I find his response ashes quite tender in that regard so greatest for me is literally giving people the space to a child wanting to let go of two active things people what they don't could fall to your viewpoint when you want them to conform to your viewpoint grace to me is recognizing that you're also a working progress and how God does of your own hotness I don't send to my ownership or central coordination I mean to so I think honestly scripture especially language existed ministry to see that's very tidy reconciliation I've yet to one a time when Jesus went to sort is home to eat and so we didn't kick off and so I think the notion of peace and I've got a piece with the girl that's a passport understanding so i can find myself warm up in a situation of conflict but have peace in it if I don't feel like I have to fix people or to have them arrive at a kind of peace that's contrived you know I kind of caught on the holier-than-thou beats kind of pieces like how's like that means nothing to me okay so so he looks very different from different people I learn more to quite nice with silence because I think you can have each internal Wars within yourself and create composure piece reflects so we've learned a lot from you perspective can be from claudia from the audience this article about justice for illness is space and patting ourselves loving from the heart arose in practical ways but i want us to maybe in one sentence two sentences as VA I want to know from you you know we are talking about racial injustice about other forms of imbalances in our society so is their home is there hope between Muslims and Christians Oh majority of minorities is therefore very definitely info and one way that I like like think about it idea was that so all of the time do you think about the people talk about face or they talk about a hobby people use the term tolerance which I personally really despise because when you use word tolerance it kind of inspired that oh I'm gonna tell me I'll tell me you and I to learn about you I don't need to be covered ground without Holly as you're different but I always kind of centralized I do respect because that when you when you a 24 respect is that not only do you see a recognized servants you appreciate it and in that meditation you grow to even if recent further right and I in terms of all why didn't we think that there are species for hope if you look around how many in our world today there's so many different social movements Black Watch entire state your name you see all of these ways which people are speaking up and saying this is not right you know this is wrong so I think there are those spaces for hope and thinking about you change even though it was difficult if you don't it won't be easy given that it'll be messy hi still people do you see I don't I definitely see hope because I didn't talk about this room and not see them at my enemy which were lucky I'm default when i leave it there for and I see an african-american family waiting for other family members and there is such love there I see in hope in family reunions that happen to one of those Trina honor by african-american human memories of the african-american community I see home in my own church where we have a sensitivity to recent immigrants and and part of them in their journey and not see them as their enemy I see home when people are able to put together supplies for kids who don't have the money to parents or other money to purchase those gears those things for supplies and they're not thinking I paid my taxes and therefore why should I be investing money into these kids are icy hole in the ability to be able to love in the midst of adversity I certainly see hope in many of the prophetic words of Martin Luther King Jr who can solo was as broad as me but was used I think when it might be a Muslim many many people but this was not on one man that we still bear the fruit of I see hope that we have in Kenny dr.
