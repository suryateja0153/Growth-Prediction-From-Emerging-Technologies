 thanks very much down i'm gonna be talking to me about you trip the attention of gonnigan I don't like so but I think it's much bigger than that especially if you think about those local detention as haven't always existed there's a much bigger scope but now it's particularly important so what it is potentially thana me why doesn't matter now the wrong is that gaining the attention economy ruins lots or has the potential to there's a lot of discussion around the impact that this might see you have the balcony for your lives and I think one of the important things to consider is distracting marketing to main advantage of marketing with youth nowadays posting for our psychological systems in ways we can attack this negative so if we look at there's a very important vote that you may occur this is jeff acaba canoes to prefer facebook can you love to start zone cloud company analytics I just said the best minds of my generation are thinking about that like people who like maps which is very much true in many ways to cook over the money is and this is what money is a distraction marketing and the danger but this is that doesn't necessarily mean you're like free article came out on medium just recently by tristan harris who left google and is now working on a project time well spent as each player in the attention economy events more and more focused of tactics to keep you hooked persuasiveness goes up NHS he goes down and there are always systems that are going to look into our site qualitative community manipulate us which is why this site timeless fancy has to tips about how you can avoid you manipulated by the visual books that commonly used to try to fill you with which is resulted in many ways of the buzz beautification of the world or listicles short articles where things that hook into our easy attention reports as things are being promoted more MORE professor Victor Franklin who was a neurologist and Holocaust survivor said that between stimulus and response there's a space in that space lies our freedom and the power to choose our response attention is a major component of if you believe it exists free will and the less control we have over that attention we know the interests are greatly lessened what we have over whatever small amounts of freedom we do now and so this is why I think it's so important when we consider our attention economy and more and more and my distraction marketing has potentially dangerous impact on human life so I don't think it's an understatement to say the free will is about shaping attentional networks and their responses to external cues that we receive this is a diagram of some networks child HD and many of these are present in the ways that we r we manipulated by on my marketing in this economy where content value is so bored so again I don't think it's an understanding to say that the attention economy is the battleground for self-determination and as we go forward into the future I think we're going to have a lot of different influences that will fight for attention and we're going to have to cite as users we want to assign value and you want to allocate our attention to as the best attention investors we've got to make our allocations wisely so the attention economy is used by markers nowadays like myself to get overworked but ultimately it's much bigger than just social media attention has always flows since first Homo sapiens evolved better our simulators history we have what we spend attention used it and is always being a scarce resource a scarce commodity we have the allocate effective so this is not something new but a lot of people seem to be claiming online that it is you may have heard professor assignment Nobel laureate economist he was quoted in 1971 talk became a paper that a wealth of information creates a poverty and attention and to allocate that attention effectively but is it really knew that our poverty and attention is suddenly getting created by this world of attention I don't think it's a particularly novel phenomenon the word attention economy was first used by like a bulldog physicist turn social scientist in the early 90s and lay eggs as well he wrote that the new currency of our new economy will be attention reviews attention instead of life now that's old prediction indeed a lot of writing with a sort of push back on by number economists because what will be substitute currency which is essentially a place will differ value for attention I think this is a ridiculous notion which is anyone who knows about a Bitcoin concurrency is that it's fungible $1 always one dollar is always one dollar it's always equivalent across attention you put our view is fungible based on a time-based appear one attention second is always attention second but the problem is there's so many more sub components of attention as the quality the components involved a very complex system working up top you could be paying certain amounts of it your focus could be distracted to a certain degree so it's not fungible but even more than that it's contextual my attention may not be worth as much as saying capitalism has dictated that the CEO of a large corporation and so that contextual information means that attention is a commodity it certainly is a scarce commodity but it will never be a currency so this is where i had a park strongly from gold hopper spinning and this was certain i see summed up by snow boys of futurist used to go home and still his blog writing across the web is post the false question at attention economics or he wasn't really disputing attention to economic value he was focusing on this concept talk about which was first popularized by Allen anhydrous off lord of the settings or in some ways are the original futurists in their book information or information society that work but avoid that with the philosopher diva room several centuries ago a wrote that the number of folks will grow continually in one can predict their the time will come when it will be almost technical to learn anything from folks as from the direct sending the entire universe so attention poverty is not a new concept we've been worried about it for a very long time and it's more that now the attention economy is coming in to relief because we can finally start measuring we have the tools to start looking at attention at a much greater level if you haven't seen magically scratching the video for the elephant appears in the child Palmer is an adulterer this is one of their on their website right now this is a platter or gym full of kids with a giant way of looking at LACMA the reality is technology is funded by can go very heavily another other investors it exists and they're going beyond typical augmented reality strategy instead of putting a screen in front of the face they have projectors that project onto the eyeball from a head-mounted tool and what this does is by high roller days instead of trying to project something through the screen no matter where you're looking at as you shift they're able to keep the 3d image perfectly positioned within your view so the important part of this is they can measure your gates and that data is going to be huge for marketers for people who are measuring and tracking attention online entering what was interested in the attention economy moving very quickly through my presentation but the internet is a massive multiplayer attention experiments so this is the recent at eight conference I think it's all facebook runs you can see all of them here with their oculus rift headset solid journalists testing these new systems the most exciting part of this is that we're going to start doing data although oculus rift doesn't have at this point I'm and now to be our will eventually start to rely on eye tracking and the eye is the closest window to human attention that we have we provide on various multi-tools babies there and one quest analytics is an attention economist measuring the traffic onto their website at this point in time but as we start to get closer to the neural background that's underlying what's going on we invest and spend attention we're going to get more and more reliable data to make it a much more reliable to commodity anyone who's ever use Google Adwords or facebook ads or footer ads or McGuinness has used some kind of targeting system or you try to compete in an option based system against other marketers to say this is how much this group attention is worth to me but your lack of massive amounts of contextual information if you could target in an individual basis and this is what a lot of heart going to say or they want linkedin is I just wanted to CEO I think the CEO are the weepies of decision makers I want to pay for them attention and if you could do that specifically target people down to the individual knowing that it's them on their device and the kind of quality of attention they're giving you marketers will be available a whole lot more than just dollars will cook and if you're a personal injury lawyer top you've got better to go that's one of the more expensive options out there on the left there will be a lot of dollars per class so what is it worth a whole lot of life right now we create a lot of things via our online investments of attention there was this 2012 paper by Eric's Erik Brynjolfsson and jun bo from MIT and they looked into what in the u.s. is the estimated total all the three labor we spend on the internet and they're very rough estimation was about a hundred building and that's in the US alone if you start to consider all the countries across the planet this is probably greater than the GDP of every single country combined so there's a lot of value that were just not accountable and that's based on all this attention that we're spending freedom that were investing between different sources and then we're spending between one another and I think the big risk of resources were not getting any actual value out of it man me is the user get nothing for our attention to invest everyone talks about content monetization if you follow the medium rule gives you a number of different media groups collapse recently that's going to be an ongoing battle into the future to decide how we pay journalists and storytellers but overall trying to figure out as automation and job loss continue to progress into the future and we have fewer and fewer things that humans can actually do the last vestige of value that the corpus we only has is attention that's the only you need to think that computer probably can't and even when we to create a off human attention will be unique in that it is cute and so that's the last vestige of Valley we could possibly monetize and are probably going to have to figure out how to monetize if we're going to redistribute wealth in another way that's similar to capitalism besides just going for a full on guaranteed basic minimum income which hopefully is part of our future as well in mind so what's going to happen with the attention economy now we are getting better and better data of a cow we spend our attention in order to tail data about that so we started off with clicks you could going through the back or just say it was a dos-ram key entry or something like that but clicks are the earliest piece of data that we're starting again on how attention is spent and how it flows which is extremely limited but it's so interesting to the point that some companies Facebook in particular are trying to measure how much income over an individual backbone and charged appetizers for that although that is debatable in terms of its value the one problem with cursor location is it doesn't necessarily reflect how we were actually spending your attention some of you may have heard the phenomenon banner blindness which occurs where users are so familiar with side our top bear bars that they'll become completely unaware this is where you can hover over them universally as a result if your anniversary keeps your hairs are off to the side of the screen while you breathe we moved into touch which is definitely a significantly more interesting data set but in many ways less informative because fingers are so big and the mobile screen is so small so it's another data set that we're using now try to figure out how people interact with our applications and web devices the next horizon which were very close to his games or eye tracking depending on which you want to use and this is where that software like magic leap will come in as you have lasers watching the ice surface to try it project images directly onto the I that'll give us information about whether someone's actively attempting to your piece of content and how much attention they're focusing on it since this is the closest we can get to the brain without starting getting into some of the neural firing date and then after that one of the others become first i predict effect effective computing is the ability of the computer to recognize your emotional state however feeling and some of that's going to be simply an expression data but a lot of that's going to be a biometric information as we start to measure keep flow patterns throughout your body a different data that we have probably he just be most accessible but it's wet as well would be another mechanism to start measuring that and then as we passed that the start getting into direct neural measurements you've probably seen this forgetting the name but it's essentially a simple EEG machine you've been used to control games you can put them on you can measure your meditation the impact of that although with these kinds of a simple you it is questionable that they also have games or you try to control the helicopter using your mind weights that your brain waves and etc so as we start moving further forward to or brain computer interfaces we're going to get direct neural data that allows us to understand how we spend attention and their quality of it so now what is the future of the attention economy look like this is a very very rough picture of what our attention looks like right now with the current models for both by dancing in their 2007 for you signs and review the neuroscience so working memory is where you store several seconds to maybe if you're luckier than that of data that's used to make any active decision so the working memory is whatever makes it in there is your active attention it's hijacked most directly if I bottom-up salience filters and these would be things like built-in instinctive things that are like the attribute's and sudden loud sound of lights against a dark background will hijack our attention system almost immediately certain colors that needs different backgrounds are more likely to hijack your attention system which is where the time will spend that to get earlier talks about never look at the icons on your phone hide them all because the colors of its hijacked your attention instead just actively search for tools and you can control your attention Homer naturally so the bottom of sandals filters are external signals that can be used to hijack our intern psychology and get closer to the brain then there's also the top-down sensitivity control and you want to look at this as your free will your consciousness or ability to control the way the best attention and this is the singles that are built ins you pathways whatever for brain control you have going on that dictates that you spend your attention and this is to the best of our estimation you competitive selection is sort of the selection process the team's top down sensitivity control and tries to filter what's going on to make some investments from the top so at the end of the day this which we have little control over is going to filter your executive control to determine what goes into attention what external signals will always hi jack always have the potential the hijacker executive control because they have more direct access to working memories and the neural representations to go in there working balance so I want to break it down into in terms of competitive selection of gaming there's probably not much thinking here without rewiring your brain directly so we don't focus on the future of that what some changes in technology will provide us more access to executive control more ability to control yourself and then the bottom-up settings because there's more ability to control your external environments to determine what's been give you access or you will give access to your attention so in terms of top-down sensitivity first the logic personal psychological profiling is going to be a big one we've got early cypress psychology research to starting revealed people if you've ever used Facebook you may notice that sometimes you see some people more than others or you may be part of the edge great formula that puts together who you're going to see and what that does then use the whole bunch of filters are primarily it uses an affinity school all your previous interactions determine who you see so if you do not like on your grandmother's post you are effectively mutant area into the future each time you don't click you're moving her to a greater degree so what that does is that controls what's going to come in but more so than that that will tell you what you're terrible so as we start to fortify myself psychologically using this data that social networks are already improving the moments we will be able to understand that our psychology more so you can make better top-down decisions and control the way we interact with the attention demanders have been effective computing as our computer starts to recognize our emotional states if you start serving us information in ways it will allow us to make better decisions if you know that you were in a emotionally compromised to state that will alter decision pattern if you want to make your computer could specifically create locks or systems that you prevention for making decisions than my army also mindfulness education it's surprising how much quantitative data there good research it exists of meditation and its value to increase your ilya have talked down executive control over your attention estate so i think as we work this into hopefully high school when the other education will give the new generations the ability to have more control over their attention nootropics and drug delivery you probably read as a movie about the smart drug but he takes the mix em super intelligent tuesday but those kinds of drugs we do not have any idea viable new products at this point in time and part of the problem is we need to literally orally or even by injection it's very difficult because you're working against the blood-brain barrier you have to drop through so what we need to do is develop better more targeted drug delivery and better drugs start allowing us to manipulate what's going on in the brain that not everyone may be okay with that but some people are certainly going to be using this and maybe that you are constantly using a cocktail of drugs that modulate your narrow stated time in order to allow you to control your attention to the greatest degree and lastly bring your interfaces we already have cyborgs out there who have implants that are hooking into their optical nerves to allow them to see for the first time we have people who have implants the moment here because of taking auditory signals and then feeding them into the auditory nerves so we are already working on break through your interfaces but this is going to be something that everyone has accessible to them at some point in time and once that becomes reality there's going to be some ability because external electrical signals change how your brain works and counter your logical connections with one another you're going to be actively modulating with your grand you are as a person so that attentional control is going to human ability to determine we're going to go in here the end we want your brain to room but I think even more interesting thing is the bottom of stairs how do we control the environment around us we need customizable environments augmented reality will be a big part of that it will turn out certain signals from your visual world will help with attention control but also if you're just talking about the web we use simple conant systems that should be replicable in whatever way we want them to do we should have HTML code that we can review into whatever kind of filter people actually you can see the world of the way that we do and there are browsers out there now we'll do something that for you but the web is encoded well enough to allow everyone to control their environment if I'm color boy I should be able to see the web colors that are usually indistinct for me and not have to rely on someone's knowledge of web accessibility order to see the page so in a long run more customizable and as we head into VR world as companies drop therefore in two-dimensional pages or three-dimensional environments where you read them it's going to be even more important for people to have more control over that since that's so much of a more immersive experience and you may have seen the things where people take the objects Kristen are going through the so I'm pushes them from behind just a simple headphone and visual system that blocks out of their other visual inputs totally disrupts your brain that allows you to be influenced by external signals in much more significant ways next we open source content stream algorithms your facebook regiment is determined what you liked and when you want to see it clear recently introduced an algorithm to serve you specific information LinkedIn is how has had one for a long time they don't talk about you don't know what companies have decided you care about and you probably don't think that you care about the Vanity Fair control over that is going to be tremendously in the long run because all they're dictating is bias clicks so if you're clicking or interacting erroneously on something you may have just popped or affinity with that edge within the system such that you see if these in the future and these more edges that you interact with just simply don't give out the content but just because you're consuming and visually doesn't mean you're not interesting you need the ability to control that so you can dictate how you will spend your attention that is part of your relationship process relationship formation process presumably you want to be investing it in a way that's going to deliver value to your life and ensure that you live a life with hashtag time well spent and last thing I think this is where sort of earlier discussion on financial taxes going to health social media a lot we are going to do content monetization that allows us to tell right now it's ad clicks that cell is the ability to get more impressions and that's why BuzzFeed's it isn't so quickly they are able to hijack the internal bomb salience up filters very nicely using powerful imagery and other six things like that but if we as users take back the ability to control that then we can step in and tell the world what we actually want to see so there's the team out there right Charles the leader in mid change technology he has an alcohol your network and what they're working on is a system whereby using blockchain technology when someone shares content they become the creator and then the first pure later of that content gives 10 senses of the Creator but then gets fifty percent of all subsequent shares there by allocating value to the curators and that value gets subdivided each time an additional share happens giving the initial share or even greater share of overall value you're talking about a direct technology it gives value back to curators ensures creators make money and kind of the need for distraction advertising making meet current advertising Cleo's we essentially destroying some aspects of capitalist society but that will be something that there will be launched within the next couple of months to year for whatever they called it previously dak dak cave and rebranded it to your network and i think is a tremendous thing site because once we start painting a tiny amount and wasn't mean money for the attention we spent and the content that we value will create a whole new sub economy that can start pushing back against distraction advertising which will force advertisers to start figuring out get to us in a way we value which fighting all the paint's remind us is in the long run we get paid for all the attributes soon but that is probably not in the near future
