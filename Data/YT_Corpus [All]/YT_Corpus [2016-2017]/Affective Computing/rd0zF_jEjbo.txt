 hey I was going buddy it's going well what about you doing fine what are you enough to it well I've actually really been thinking out the dollar how much just one dollar cost exactly when dollar know how much does it cost four quarters no once again not what I meant how is the dollar value in terms of other currencies oh so you're talking about the exchange rate well that depends on the exchange rate of dollars to whatever currency you referring to okay all right wait what's an exchange rate I'm glad you asked I actually took a micro economics course recently an exchange rate is pretty much the value of price of one currency in terms of another currency that's pretty straightforward yes there are also these quotations for exchange rates a direct quotation means that you use the foreign currency as the counter in the domestic as the base and one the one you convert to whereas for indirect the domestic is the base and the four is the canada i think i like the indirect better yeah it's used but it's the most use exchange rate it makes more sense I see so there must be some sort of market for our currency there's we as Americans simply come to acquire the dollar in our ways but foreigners me the dollar too right uh yeah they do do you know what that is well I'm assuming that when foreigners by American goods our companies only accept a payment in dollars you're right that's strange it's not like I took a matter of course true anyway so that was mean that we need foreign currencies to buy boring things sort of like a demand and supply for the dollar that's weird to think of I know right I mean how many things do you own that are American produced not much exactly that's because the American dollar is strong enough that we can purchase products from other countries at a much lower price what do you mean what I mean is throughout American history the exchange rate is had a huge effect on the lives of an American's and people all across the globe as well Americans courtesy has always been known as for its strength and safety for investors America as a whole is also known to be a consumption economy this means that most of America's economy is based on people's abilities to consume and part of that is due to the dollar appreciation and depreciation right yep so the dollar has mostly increased in value while other currencies have in comparison decrease for long period of time dollar appreciation and depreciation for other currencies thus causing the dollar to be stronger essentially but for the Dodgers you're super strong putting that in the global market mean that American exports will have a hard time competing with the exports from other countries and that Americans will lose jobs as a result it actually would the strength looks beneficial to American consumers right off the bat but in hindsight it could do more bad than good for American industry yeah I get that so what's your room or the China is devaluing its currency I'm assuming that they're doing it to get ahead of the American exports and increase the cause of import so that they can grow its economy faster that seems to be about right China's managed flood policy allows it to manipulate its own currency to be more flexible than lower market price and how exactly does that work okay imagine we're back in the 2000s and I'm going to the store to buy a guitar let's imagine hi how's it going it's going uh I'm here to a body guitar do you have any good ones in stock yeah we have this one how much is that american-made guitar over there oh it's four hundred dollars four hundred that's that's a bit out of my price range you have anything for like cheaper yes we have this Chinese one that's pretty cool and it's 200 why is it so much cheaper in the American make a toast well the dollar is a lot stronger than the gone so US consumers can afford this way more than they comport dollars pretty much all you're saying is like the american dollars stronger so we can afford more wand with that yeah interesting very cool well yeah 200 sounds good I'll take it alright cool here's my very real us two hundred dollar currency Wow thank you sir oh yeah so great ha but what's with all like these strange symbols all over this guitar well its communist cuz there's mean and trying out a while ago and it's kind of what gives you character I like it and I support that when you get to the store there are two types of guitars the American a guitar and a chinese-made guitar at this time the Chinese one is much lower than the US dollar so that's price of a guitar from China is much cheaper so like everybody else you'll probably by the Chinese one yeah but as the use pass more and more people continue to buy Chinese guitars and lo and behold the Chinese economy begins to grow their young becomes stronger success so as the price gap begins to grow smaller between the two guitars more people begin to go back to bind american-made guitars well there are other policies and occurrences we can even strengthening the Chinese economy in the background the results to listen wait I think I got it the loss in exports by the Chinese economy causes its rate of growth to shrink yeah and to come back what seems to be a faltering of the Chinese powerful guitar Empire the Chinese government decides to manipulate its currency to bring exports and growth back up is this exact situation although on a much grander scale which many believe is happening right now in the global economy well what about the imports in both countries well yours import should be rising during this time because prices of Chinese guitars another product going to be cheaper so people are going to want those more while imports in China are going to be much lower because they can domestically make these products at a much cheaper price got it well you think that whether it's intentional or not China's actions are really ruffling the feathers of economist around the world oh yeah definitely you
