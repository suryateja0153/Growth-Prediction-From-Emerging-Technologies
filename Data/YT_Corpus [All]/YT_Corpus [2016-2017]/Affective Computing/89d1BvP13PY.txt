 third paper for today conceptions of design methods and colin is going to present this thank you for sticking around this paper i'm currently a pretty university this paper was collect data collected when i was at indiana university working with eric and others so i do want to acknowledge even though they're not on the author lists some of the people that helped me in producing some of this work so today i'm going to focus on user experience practice and looking specifically at design methods as one angle into that space so in the chi community we've had a history at least in the last decade or so of studying ux design practice on its own terms and really understanding what is happening with people on the ground so work by elizabeth goodman Ron will carry Eric and others one of the angles that has started to take hold in terms of talking about this practice is the nature of design methods and so this is drawing not only on old work from John Christians from 1970 but also a more recent resurgence of interest in design methods in the codification of those methods what we're seeing in this process is a general lack of focus on praxis there are some some examples of people engaging with this space but there's a lot of work that's left to be done here that we're building on in this paper so the contributions of this paper are twofold and I want to sort of scituate this upfront so first providing an account of how practitioners use methods in their everyday practice including the methods that they would say or essential part of their process and also contextualizing the method use of practitioners within specific UX practice domains and exploring the ways that they make situated judgments when they select and use methods so ideally these contribution ship shift our focus away from a formalized objective description of methods that can often be common in HCI literature especially Chi and curated collections of methods like headington martin and others towards a more adaptive appropriated use of methods in the wild so this is the general structure for the talk first of all situates design methods within HCI research in New York's practice which already started a little bit then share some details of the interview study that we conducted then I will talk more specifically about two different strands of first the methods that are used by practitioners and then also the methods that practitioners desire of people entering the profession and then I'll wrap it all up to sort of talk in more depth about appropriation and recontextualization of those methods in practice so John Chris Jones the same as an early touchstone for the early the design methods movement and then late 1960s and early 1970s and this later edition of the book that was originally released in 1970 provides an early account of the range of methods that designers use and how these methods can be seen to support creative production what we've seen though in the session in the last five to ten years is a resurgence of interest in design methods probably in parallel with the design thinking movement popularized by the Stanford d.school and I do and others to this codification of methods so moving beyond sort of this abstract depiction of the method space to reference books that follow this very typical format a description of the method relevant sources and recommendations for application within a larger design process Jones original goal was to break open what he referred to as the black box of design and the goal was to understand all the stuff that was happening in this complex performance that we know is designing and make it a glass box so that it could be opened a description and evaluation and this goal of transparent access to design cognition was I think started out on very good terms but was quickly discarded when they realized that it was actually much more difficult than that and they weren't going to be able to fully understand the cognitive and affective and cognitive processes that are involved in designing so instead of doing that this sort of open up riddles second generation of design methods that focused primarily on argumentation and negotiation that's inherent in design activity so our modern conceptual design meth that those books on the previous slide drawn are a mechanism by which designers orchestrate and negotiate their own design activity including the intentional selection and organization of information that leads to design insights and decisions this is the designer as to use Jones words a self-organizing system within this space we can view design activity in a lot of different respects and I'm drawing on some previous work here presented at dis in 2014 when you look at the design activity you can take on different perspectives depending on what your primary areas of interest are so if we look at a complex design performance if you look at it from an academic perspective say somebody could performing something like contextual inquiry as an academic we could say okay well here the here are the general steps of doing contextual inquiry as they're set out in in several texts and it the way that it was actually done is a little bit less rigorous than what was originally prescribed that's a can take out academic perspective you could also take a practice perspective and look at that same activity and say it is much more complex than just a list of steps and in fact the authentic practice is much richer than the original prescriptive method and so there's a reduced complexity so we can communicate things more easily instead of talking about all the tacit knowledge and various steps that go into something you can call it a simple term that will have some meaning to other people so within this space there has been a fair amount of work I've done over the last decade or so looking at how we can characterize what's happening in terms of design methods in that design activity so we'll work at all have done work to understand that methods aren't really what he calls recipes these aren't prescriptions that take us from step a 2 A to Z they're really more ingredients and in the process of dealing with those ingredients much like a chef we produce meals but meals are not a sum total of their recipe and so it's sort of uh pending what we understand about the prescriptive nature of design it's and placing the focus back on the appropriation in use stole Sherman and colleagues have also done a decent amount of work in this space with their tools and use framework and design early tools design early tools are almost an exact proxy for what we discusses design methods in this paper basically there any tools that allow you to get work done and execute on your vision I've also done some work on this space specifically looking at how user experience designers conceive of and develop their competence over time both in a formal educational capacity and also once they get down to the practice so a little bit about the study that we did as I mentioned there were several people involved in the data collection process we start out with a stratified sample so we're looking at representing a pretty wide swath of user experience practice and in order to do that we identified several characteristic types of practice and then use those to structure a sample we then did interviews over Skype or in person about an hour in length with notes and then incomplete transcriptions of certain portions of the interviews and then finally I conducted a thematic analysis to understand what some of the themes that were developing specifically around the methods that they used or expected practitioners to know how to use so don't expect you to be able to read this it is in the paper about the color bar show you the the clustering of those strata that were mentioned in the last slide and so we had four primary practice context that we were addressing consultancies client facing agencies large companies and small companies and there's a little bit more detail in the paper on exactly what each of those constituted so we have an N of 13 practitioners and a pretty wide range of experience educational background etc most of them identified directly as as UX designers or user experience designers in some form of their job title although there are some other instances there as well especially on the consulting side we didn't want to constrain what these participants might feel as a is a legitimate method so we didn't want them to just repeat the things out of you know their 100 universal methods of design book or something so we gave them actually quite a large a definition of what we meant by design methods and we read this verbatim at the beginning of each interview and so you can see here that this is an intentionally inclusive framing of design methods talking about everything from everyday methods techniques and tools to whiteboard pen and paper to formal axiomatic and algorithmic methods so we're trying to cover a lot of ground to really talk about the nature of design methods as a tool and not necessarily as a specific codified thing that's in a book somewhere we ask these practitioners a number of questions about their their background their use of experience the ways that they work within teams in their organization and then we drill down a little bit more deeply to understand the ways that they use methods looking at what are the methods they use on an everyday basis what are some company practices and or is there any adaptation or codification of methods within their company that has shaped the way that they do their work and then finally we asked them if they were hiring a junior designer within their firm what methods would that junior designer need to know so breathe breeze through the findings pretty quickly and there they're going to be split right down the middle by those those two characteristics so on the Left we have the methods that the existing existing practitioners said that they used on the right you have the methods that they thought new practitioners should know how to use in the paper these are in these complicated charts and in fact they're very difficult to read and in producing this presentation I realized that there was probably a better way to show this information so you'll get some information here in the slide deck that isn't in the paper these are the five categories or themes that came out of the emergency medic analysis and so these are general clusters of themes that we saw across both of these questions that we asked the practitioners and I'll go through each one of them in a relatively surface level of detail because of time so for approach this is really essentially the mindset that you take into a situation on the the methods that the practitioner is used this was more a proxy for what are the structures within their organizations DC stuff like a Jalan strategic design when we asked them about practitioners though they were talking about these much more effective and conative processes so confidence empathy that kind of thing and there was some interesting sort of set up to this on the part of the participants there was this attitude that there were structures within the organization but there's also a motivation of the designer to work against those in certain cases when when they need to when dealing with methods that are desired though Bruno says here that you know the ability to empathize with your co-workers that's actually one of the most important skills talking and really listening to what people have to say so for communication this is essentially dealing with face-to-face communication or technologically mediated mediated communication and the one in the middle is shared on both sides between both questions and so somebody being articulate seemed to be really important and then for for newer employees things like business skills were more important once they were on the ground persuasion was actually how they got work done and Diane exemplifies that that persuasion element here talking about you know when some business unit comes in and ask for advice one of the things they have to do is a sort of a line what can we do for them and what problem are we trying to solve in the first place so this quote describes some white boarding as a method to actually drill in on a problem frame that was appropriate so for analysis this is going to look the most like what you would typically think of as design methods and we we saw a lot of them here but it's sort of interesting to see how few methods were prescribed for incoming practitioners broad knowledge was much more important from several of our participants than a lot of the typical ones that you might expect and in fact Hugh talks about this about being a generalist and the value of being a generalist at least in his work context understanding lots of different kinds of things and understanding how they fit together so in user research this was the the smallest group by far in terms of responses and the participants were much more interested in moving beyond the core skill of doing that thing to why you do it in the process of doing so here Bruno talks about you have to be able to interview people that's just basic when you move on from research so what are you going to do tell me how you come up with your personas not only the end result but how you got there so representation is the final category and representation really is goes in parallel with communication and so this is the the documentation or the the physical or digital artifacts you leave behind or work through to create a final solution for the client and sketching was shared across both of these and seemed to be sketching and whiteboarding seem to be quite important to participants in terms of everyday communication of their work within their organizational environments and Hugh talks about this sketching as a core skill of prototyping to shift the way of thinking from from deliverables in the final project to lots of process steps along the way so I'll move on to the discussion quickly so one of the participants Prakash exemplifies the theme that ran through the participant responses explaining that competence in UX practices less about the methods themselves and more about how the designer thinks about the methods as tools to answer the right questions so this is a form of instrumental judgment which emphasizes not only a mechanical understanding of the method but also the knowledge of when it's appropriate to be used in what way and how you know when you receive something of value out of that process and you can see this is where the title the paper comes from it's more of a mindset than the method I think a lot of that mindset is trying to do the right thing for the user in business so you adapt your method based off of that so it's just about knowing when to use what method and the methods themselves you can probably describe in a page when but when it gets to actually they're actually getting the right Val you out of them it's having that right mindset what are the right questions we need to ask some participants even described one method that framed their entire approach to practice with codified methods being combined and repurposed in this broader method and so this mindset of use and the accompanying set of instrumental knowledge indicates this heightened role of adaptation and appropriation of methods these designers are moving beyond a holistic use of off-the-shelf methods and treating the use of methods as an addict bricolage rather than a performance of a codified set of steps what we saw with a number of our participants was a very pragmatic approach to adaptation in use where they within their design activity talked more about their methods as cores and these cores became so abstracted that the link with the originating method was often lost with little ability to recall our list methods in a mechanical way a lot of these methods arose through descriptions of project work rather than when we asked them to list methods themselves so that's so the combining of the existing methods illustrates that formal barriers between the originating methods were left almost non-existent and often inaccessible to the designer responsible for creating the method in use that's why perhaps that Ganesh concluded that his desire for starting UX practitioners was more skill than method not that the methods themselves were useless knowledge but rather that the pragmatic Center for their method is the flexible performance in a situated design context not the method objectively defined itself so future work I think expands in two directions one is building on the history of research and scholarship on praxis and HCI understanding more deeply building on Elizabeth Goodman's work and others on the documentation of method you since it's you and also working with the larger design community to continue theorizing about what is the nature of design practice and how is it learned and executed the other important area here I think is educating HCI practitioners though we have a history in a lot of educational settings of teaching the methods and then hoping that that mechanical understanding translates to that appropriation quality that I talked about earlier however I think they're better ways to scaffold some of this indeterminacy that comes with meth abuse so how can we think about in building that instrumental judgment a little bit more explicitly in the education process and what is the role of those software competencies so how can you build empathy collaboration some of those other things in so that understanding this appropriation becomes very much a part of how you go about your life as a practitioner like to thank the the lab that this work came out of National Science Foundation and I'd be happy to answer any questions ok the we have we have time for one or two questions I Dan buzzer from the University of the West of England my background is in arts design in industry and and in education in interaction design and I'm involved in education my feeling is that design is far more generative and that's the value that it brings to HCI research but a lot of what you're pointing towards makes a view of it is very convergent rather than divergent that these are discrete things that you can put in place towards a sort of rationalist solution and it is that how you you see the use for your situation so I think in this in this project we were specifically trying to demystify and expand on what happens in HCI practice we know i think as designers that methods have this generative quality to them and so we're trying to expand up
