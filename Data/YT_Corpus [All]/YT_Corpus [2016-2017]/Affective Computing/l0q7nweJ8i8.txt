 For trainee health and community professionals, having access to meaningful work experiences is critical. And yet making real-life training available involves the challenges of high cost, limited opportunities, with the alternatives likely to be restricted to theoretical classroom-based methods. But Anne Furness, her Curtin research team and software developer Learnbrite have created what they describe as a ”serious game” known as Virtual Home Visit. Their innovation is a game-based learning system that allows students or trainee care workers, to simulate a home visit for an older adult that aims to provide support to allow them to remain at home. The Virtual Home Visit allows the learner to chat with avatars to understand the social setting. Identify and classify falls risks and hazards, and then formulate a specific management plan. This is a learning experience that can be delivered via the internet on a desktop or mobile device, or via a Virtual Reality platform. The immersion and gamification element increasing engagement. But this is serious business. Developed by Curtin education experts with a strong grounding in learning methods and validated by research demonstrating real improvements in outcomes. This effective learning solution is ready for trainers to license and adapt to their needs.
