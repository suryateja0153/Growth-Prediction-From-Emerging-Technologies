 hi I'm Judy Cole the executive vice president and CEO of the MIT Alumni Association and I'm delighted to welcome you to this web production of the MIT Alumni Association we are exceptionally fortunate to have our ALC faculty keynote speaker here today rosalind w pica is the founder and director of the effective computing research group at the MIT Media Lab co-founder of Affectiva which delivers technology to help measure and communicate emotion and co-founder and chief scientist of empathic ah improving lives with clinical quality wearable sensor sensors and analytics professor Picard is the author of over 200 peer-reviewed scientific articles in multi-dimensional signal module in computer vision pattern recognition machine learning and human-computer interaction she is known internationally for her book affective computing which helped launch a new field by that name she was a founding member of the I Triple E Technical Committee on wearable information systems in the days when they decided that the name wearable computing or WC for short might not provide the best action she she is a graduate with highest honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology and holds master and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT she is an active inventor and her group's inventions have been twice named to top 10 lists including the New York Times Magazine best ideas of 2006 for the social cue reader used in to autism and 2011 popular science top 10 inventions for a mirror that monitors vital signs professor Picard lives in Newton with her husband plan also animai T along e CS and Sloan is he okay and the three teenage sons years ago professor Picard and her students at MIT began to design build and test both wearable and other sensors for recognizing emotion they design studies gather gather data and develop signal processing and machine learning techniques to see what could be reliably extracted in this talk professor picker will highlight several of the most surprising findings during this adventure these include new insights about the true smile of happiness discovering that regular cameras and your smartphone even in your handbag can sense your bio signals finding electrical signals on the wrist that give insight into deep brain activity and learning surprising implications of wearable sensing for autism anxiety depression sleep memory consolidation epilepsy and more professor Rosen thanks good morning it's such a pleasure to be here with my fellow MIT alums I'm gonna start with an example of us doing an experiment to elicit what we believe to be the most common emotion when people use technology anybody want to guess what that is frustration yes T all right let's show you what this is like oh by the way when you when your goal is to elicit frustration you don't want to tell people that that's your goal you want to give them something else to do so here they are filling out they believe they're filling out an online form and they're gonna give us some feedback about the experience hi I'm sorry you seem to be having difficulties getting through this form would you mind looking at the cam and share your thoughts on how to improve the form when when we by the way all of our human subjects experiments go through the MIT Committee on humans as experimental subjects first crews we assure them that we're doing nothing worse than that people experience in everyday life so you can see this as a situation that is unpleasant and indeed everybody expressed quite a bit of frustration this was just a sample event now in the course of this we we started with this belief and I wrote about this in my book effective computing that the way to tell if people are truly happy is to tell if they're just smiling with their mouth which is fake right like cheese in front of the camera versus if they're smiling with their mouth and with their eyes these of course all have numbers like MIT buildings action unit 12 for the lip corner poll and actually nat64 the cheek rays so if you see a 6 and a 12 then that's supposed to mean you're truly happy right well that's what's the you know the great psychologist Paul Ekman and others have said that's what the TV show lied to me is based on his work but when and in my tea fashion we get real data and start to look at what people really do in natural life we find some surprises for example this is six and 12 6 and 12 6 and 12 hmm and I'm not talking about the buildings there but the facial action units we find that 90% of people actually showed this quote-unquote true smile of happiness during frustration so an MIT faction style we go in and we dissect this a little bit it's not enough to just take these peak moments that supposedly mean happiness and when people look at this they think he's really happy but we I won't go through the math here but I know you're all capable of it do the machine learning to build the models and understand not just those peak moments but the dynamic trajectories that lead up to them and it's more complicated than the speed but the speed is a big part of it typically when people smile with true happiness it builds more slowly when they smile with frustration then it's kind of a quick knee-jerk type of response and while the humans and machines are about the same at recognizing the truly delighted smiles the ones that look like delight but are actually frustration people are a little bit worse than machines at right now at doing that so that was a bit of a surprise too now machines that doesn't mean machines are better than us at recognizing facial expressions we've still got about 10,000 different things happening on the face and computers are getting good at a couple dozen of them right now let me give you an example of where we first went online to try to crowdsource this problem because our machine learning was based on a small number of people and we needed a lot more you all right we we saw those top two graphs are actually smile at people who are smiling a little bit before the punch line and the bottom are people who are seeing it for the first time and they smile once they realize you know but it's the clicker this ability to get people to log in online and turn on their cameras and have the computer watch them watching something was something we weren't sure people would do but turns out they will and we also see not only smiling but a huge arrange a huge array of natural facial expressions when people opt in turn on their cameras and watch things in particular we learned later you know all the theory was based on tracking faces with the mouth going up equally on both sides as soon as we start doing political debates and some other things I won't talk about we started to realize the theory needed a smirk detector and a symmetric skeptical rule facial expression so we built that also we learned - we started working with people on the autism spectrum and with hundreds of examples in the lab and we could get accurate enough to publish papers but we couldn't really get it accurate enough without millions of dollars of money which we didn't have to work on in real life and so we tried to find another route and that meant starting a company so this grew into a one first spin-out I was involved in Affectiva and here's Dan Macduff's PhD where he did some work both at MIT and at Affectiva separate times to help scale this so that we could get not hundreds of examples or thousands but tens of thousands and now actually a Factiva has has over a million facial videos and billions of motion points and that has allowed the accuracy to go up so high that we now have more than 24 facial expressions that are more than 90% accurate and the now a Factiva has has just announced they're making this not only free in a demo version that you all can download for free on your smartphones right now from if we're either Android or iOS but also for small businesses under million dollars they'll let them continue to use it free to build out gaming education medical a whole bunch of different applications that can be improved by the ability to understand if your customer is showing smiles skepticism frowns confusion interest all kinds of things that we professors in particular one to sometimes read of audiences although I remember asking some of my MIT colleagues you know do you like to lead the facial expressions of your students and they're like facial expressions of my students so we still could use a little help on that sometimes now I mentioned autism actually everything I'm talking about today grew out of some projects we've been doing to help people on the autism spectrum the first was reading faces and one day one of the women who I was working with who was non-speaking she typed to talk a very smart woman when we were online I used to used to say and we'd Skype she would type and I would use the audio channel and when we had bad bandwidth and lost the connection then one of us became seriously handicapped and it was not her even though when you would look at her in real life you might wonder if if she could communicate at all when when we were communicating one day she expressed to me Roz you have it wrong our biggest problem is not reading other people's faces or reading the minds of others or understanding other people's emotions our biggest problem is your not understanding us and at first I took that kind of personally like okay I know I have room to improve recognizing motion she goes yeah but it's not just you it's everybody's misunderstanding us and what do you mean we're misunderstanding you she said well we're experiencing enormous stress and anxiety and you're missing it what do you mean and I started to realize as we took our emotion measurement technology out into the wild and and measured things we could measure the stress and anxiety and we could see that a person might look very calm and chill on the outside in fact detached from the world but inwardly they're so hyper activated that they're shutting down to cut out stimuli in a protective intelligent way also a kid might be laying on the floor looking like lazy bun teachers like you know get back in your desk and the kid is about to explode and might erupt in a injurious to himself or others episode but if he he applies his deep pressure to his body on the floor maybe he can calm down enough that he can reintegrate with the classroom so we realized we were often judging people by what we saw on the outside like here this kid looks dressed probably is but I can show you cases where the kid looks super hyper activated and he's so under aroused he needs 20 minutes on the trampoline before he can focus so sometimes what we see on the outside and what's going on in the inside we're so different that we needed to figure out if we could fix that and observe more something that previously had been unobserved so we took sensors that were known for over a hundred years to measure conductance on the palm of the hand simple notion you get stressed you get your palms sweat the conductance goes up but it turns out to be a lot more interesting than that and but we started with this notion that it was sort of simple sweat simple arousal on the palms we at MIT decided you know we kind of need to wash our hands so if you're gonna wear it all day you got to go to alternate locations so we built versions that could do that we also built versions that could log the data 24/7 and I happen to be wearing two of them right now that have grown out of this that were commercialized by an Pataca full disclosure I'm a co-founder and a shareholder and a volunteer consultant but they are this is the embrace which I'll say a little bit more about and the II for now what does this do why do we build this well first we built this for research because we realized that we needed to help people we need to figure out what was going on inside them autonomically this is we didn't just want physical activity which is what was in all the fitness bands at the time then we needed temperature to control for heat and sweating we also want to get heart rate and heart rate variability which we can get from the blood volume pulse from a photo post these mcgrath the dual LED sensor the skin conductance which I'm gonna say some more about why it's so interesting from the two main signals that stream off of this device right now to my my mobile we get the electrodermal activity which corresponds to the sympathetic nervous system fight-or-flight response goes up with fear and anxiety and the blood volume pulse which when you hold stow you get a nice periodic signal from which we can extract the heart rate when it's very clean the heart rate variability dicrotic notch gets some systolic diastolic information other interesting stuff from that these two signals help us pull out key information about the two main branches of the autonomic nervous system the fight-or-flight the skin is purely innervated by the sympathetic nervous system and the rest or digest the vagal tone we extract from the high frequency component of the heart rate variability after we extract the beat and enter beat intervals from the heart rate and that gives us this sort of stepping on the brake so your heart is kind of pre revved right now you've got the brake on you've got your vagal vagus break slowing your heart rate a big scary thing comes in here hopefully that doesn't happen break withdraws and although some of you could probably just remember big scary things that happen in ten to fifty and the biggest break would withdraw and your heart rate shoots up or something exciting and new happens and the skin conductance cuts up here is actual skin conductance data from an MIT student 24 hours a day seven days a week this is the first state I ever saw where we were finally able to log the skin conductance outside the lab and see what it looked like in real life here around campus and so we see seven days this is 24 hours we see it going up hugely with lab activity huge activation with MIT studying and as you would expect with MIT homeworks and problem sets and MIT labs to the embarrassment of we MIT professors this yellow is the low point everyday classroom activity when now also surprising is this blue labeled data here called sleep most MIT students are asleep between about you know 2:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. and this one's a reasonably regular sleeper because I can draw a vertical rectangle to include all of their sleep here and surprisingly look at this the biggest peak of the day is often during sleep in fact it's usually during sleep when when there is a peak during sleep and if you zoom in on these sort of black fuzzy things their high frequency skin conductance responses at first we thought oh my gosh you know when I first saw them all myself you know was I having nightmares and didn't realize it or was i sweating during sleep you know what is this it turns out that they're happening during non-rem sleep they're definitely cyclic with the sleep stages and they do not seem to have any correspondence with dreaming that we know of experts on dreaming like Bob Stickgold tell us you can actually dream during REM and non-rem sleep but these appear we think right now to be more related to memory consolidation in our studies and may relate to hippocampal function so we're doing more research on this and it's turning out to be quite interesting your physiology during sleep is quite different than your physiology room awake so this may have more to do with learning and memory consolidation and other interesting functions of the brain and it is still disappointing not to see it during classroom activity all right so one day it was it was like week before finals and in December and one of my undergrad researchers on my urops comes to me and says professor picard could I please borrow one of these sensors my little brother has autism he's non-speaking and I want to see what's stressing him out can I take it home over over winter break and I said sure in fact don't just take one take two because back then when we hand-built them they broke all the time and I said do you need a soldering iron he said no I have a soldering iron yes Scotty MIT student has soldering iron so he goes home I login I see the data online for his little brother I see he's wearing it on both wrists at the same time the two signals look pretty normal kids pretty chill next day same thing pretty low pretty chill next day pretty low pretty chill I'm you know cutting Ani I go to the next day and my jaw drops one of his wrist signals went so high that I thought the sensor must be broken we have stressed people out every way imaginable here at MIT and I've never seen it go that high we've done Boston driver stress experiments we have the best paper of the decade for Boston driver stress you know and we measured really intense stuff and nothing was as high as as this and the other weird thing is it was only happening on one side huh like how do you get stress on one side of your body and not the other so maybe the other one was broken too so I start digging through the data trying to figure out what's going on I'm an electrical engineer I should be able to figure this out and I'll skip all the debugging here but a long story short I wound up doing something I've never done before I called the student at home on vacation hi how's your Christmas - oh brother how's it going sorry to bug you on vacation hey I can't figure out what happened on this date and this time and do you have any idea and he says I don't know I'll check the diary diary MIT students a diary okay on vacation now as though as a mom of three teenage boys now I'm even more marveling at the fact that that like a teenage boy would write down the exact moment I need so I'm I'm like you know okay what are the odds he's he's got this he comes back he has the exact date and time and he says that was right before he had a grand mal seizure now I don't know about you at the time I knew nothing about seizures except some false stuff I was told as a kid quickly started doing research next thing I know I'm on the phone with dr. Joe Madsen father of another Europe who's he happens to be chief of Neurosurgery children's it is so awesome being here at MIT where we are the best connections and people return your calls they're so wonderful hi dr. Madsen my name is Rosalyn Picard is it possible that somebody could have a huge sympathetic nervous system surge I didn't want to tell them on just one side I figured he'd hang up on me but I said 20 minutes for a seizure because that's what it looked like in our data at that time and he says probably not but you know we sometimes have patients who have the hair stand on in on one arm before a seizure on one arm yes and he starts to and so I've just up I showed him the data we talked at length and long story short we made a whole bunch more devices got them safety certified enrolled 90 families in a study they all were children who had continuous seizures that were not being successfully treated by medications they were all candidates for brain surgery Joe was monitoring them around the clock video EEG gold standard for epilepsy ECG and now EDA electrodermal activity we found that 100% of the children and his study had a huge more than two standard deviations above the pre seizure period sympathetic nervous system surged with their seizure not 20 minutes before like we wished but when you have the gold standard exactly when the brain is starting to fire it was coinciding with that so we're not able to get prediction with this right now in most people although it looks like we might and some but we're able to get detection furthermore we could build and actually in pata canal has improved on this significantly but at the time my MIT PhD student means are Poe published a 94 percent accurate convulsive seizure detection by combining these skin conductance data with that accelerometer data at the bottom so you'll see at the bottom these accelerometer Peaks so the state of the art at the time for seizure detection outside the epilepsy Monitoring Unit is just measuring convulsive movements well that could look like brushing your teeth or strumming the guitar or banging on a computer if you're frustrated so we have now coupled the these two signals and there's even more we can do to get a more sensitive and specific seizure detective by the way remember how the MIT students sleep was the biggest peak of the day this is this boys sleep so these are huge compared to this most of the emotions stuff I'm used to doing signal processing on is down here in the ground cover compared to these like redwood trees poking out here so this was a huge signal so we knew we had to do something about this we also found this response occurring with 86% of partial seizures these are seizure complex partial seizures these are seizures that can make you unconscious but they don't have any convulsive movements associated with them by the way there's also a lot of other kinds of seizures some it could be having one right now with no convulsions no loss of consciousness but just unusual sensory experiences like like imagining that you're hearing phone's going off or something now when fortunately most epilepsy is not deadly you may hear people you know hitting their head having an accident drowning those are not included in these numbers here what's included and these numbers here sue debts sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is deaths that happen in a person who has an epilepsy diagnosis and usually they're just found alone deceased in bed in the morning very tragic as you can imagine you know or on the floor in the kitchen and nobody knows what happens nobody was there but in some cases they were found after a while they happen to be wearing an ambulatory EEG monitor and usually these events are occurring after a grand mal seizure and there's some other things we've learned about them that are that are quite surprising I bring this up to you because if you're like me you'd never heard of this before and yet it's the number two cost of years of potential life lost after stroke and it's taking more lives every year in the u.s. and probably even more beyond then house fires sudden infant death syndrome and in the UK they said then aides also so what do they find if you happen to be wearing an EEG when this tragedy happens well each of these is an electrode channel from an EEG on your scalp and it's sort of hyper activated during the seizure the seizure is kind of like a little brush fire that can spread and take over the whole brain or it can stay localized then the brain waves we'd like to see go back to normal but here they're all below 10 microvolt so they're flattened so this is called post ekdal meaning after the seizure generalized because it's across all EG channels suppression obviously here after the seizure that was found in all the monitored cases of SUDEP so we don't want to see that that's bad it looks like your brain has shut down now we expect if your brain has shut down everything else is shutting down but it turns out your heart's still going and just your breathing seems to have shut down when we looked at those huge Peaks we were getting and we said what are these is the person just convulsing a lot and getting sweaty or you know what is this turned out it had nothing to do with them convulsing or how long they were convulsing but it does show high correlation with how long these brainwaves are shutting down after a seizure now think about how weird this is and by the way this is published in Neurology on top medical journals and it's been replicated now with an adult group and the graph continues up now we don't we don't know exactly why a signal on the wrist is going to get bigger if your brain looks like it's shutting down this seems the little backwards and bizarre right because this is triggered by stuff deep in the brain then I learned something very surprising that I didn't didn't know when they measure your brain waves with an EEG on the outside they're only picking up the activity of your brain near the surface of the scalp the emotion centers of your brain are much deeper and in particular some very important emotion centers that can trigger thus stopping breathing and can trigger the responses that we're measuring are much deeper so ironically trying to read your brainwaves with a brainwave reader an EEG on your scalp is saying nothing's going on while this is saying there's a lot of brain activity going on how bizarre is that I am so glad I had tenure when I when I first suggested we're getting you know this correlate of brain activity on the wrist that we're not getting on the head right pretty pretty freaky now fortunately others have done the deep no pun intended work here of going into the brain craniotomy don't sign up for this unless you have to drill the holes in your skull go in and stimulate these regions I'll both read them out and activate them and when they stimulate the right amygdala or your left amygdala these are core regions involved in the threat the anxiety the fight-or-flight response fear something we all experience a lot of at MIT when they stimulate that right amygdala you get a right skin conductance response same side of the body and when they stay at the left you get a left one if that little boy had had a seizure in his right amygdala it could explain why he had a whopper of a response on one side and not the other and some other regions of the brain it turns out that are localized - moreover it's now been shown if you go in and directly stimulate this in a repeated high frequency way it will turn off a person's breathing in fact it will one of you could be sitting there reading your email typing on the computer consenting to this craniotomy they go in and they stimulate your amygdala you would show no signs of distress you would stop breathing and you would not start again until they say touched you and you went you know or they ask you a question and you breathe to answer it now we know that seizures are like these little electrical fires they can they're not usually deadly fortunately but they still kill more people every year in the US and house fires and we now also know that people when they die of this in this period of time suit up after a seizure they're usually alone if they're attended they're more likely to start breathing again somebody's there the first thing you do you touch the person you say their name they take that breath so we realized that we need to get somebody there don't leave people alone if they have these if you have even one grand mal seizure year you're at heightened risk of sudo so while I'm working at MIT on effect we decided we needed to take a bit of effort to get this out of the lab to help people who have this condition did a whole lot more work lots and lots 20 different designs versions and thanks to the incredibly hard work of an Pataca this has now been commercialized as embrace and it's winning design prizes and as available for under $200 which is an enormous engineering feat it's also the case it can run not only senses the kind of stuff we're sensing here clinical quality data but we are able to run onboard machine learning very sophisticated using expects to MIT member companies very sophisticated latest electronics and manufacturing processes to enable us to do the real-time analysis and communication so that somebody can get an alert we also don't want it to be a stigmatizing medical device even though we're applying for FDA we want to look cool so we have we're offering all kinds of cool stuff it's funny all that consumer stuff it's easy right we do sweet did sleep and steps and all that long before all those other companies did it so we're embedding all of that in here too so it's just a really smart way to tell time and to record all of that health stuff even if you don't have a medical condition but if you want to privately run an app that detects something like what I just talked about then you can do that because we're under FDA right now I can't make medical claims about this particular device right now but you can enroll in a clinical trial where you can use it for convulsive seizure detection right now and meanwhile regular people like me can buy it and wear it and get all kinds of cool other information the other morning and my email I got this which I've excerpted from one of our beta testers and family of another MIT community member we got another alert this morning ran to her room she was face down with a seizure or not breathing we repositioned her and she is now pink and sleeping wearing embrace thank you umm my my first thought was ish you know after is she okay and mom reassuring me she's okay was don't trust any technology right we all know like as well we are working to make it as accurate and you know everything as possible we all know that no device is perfect battery the Bluetooth you know like we could list them and we do we share a long list of things that could go wrong so I sort of live in worry of it not doing the right thing but we also know she said don't worry we also we know all that stuff it's still better than what we have she in fact she added recently she was mailing a doctor and telling him this story of her the other morning it goes off again while she's in the shower shampooing you know and she you know usually you would wait to finish your shower to check on your child but this time she ran out and sure enough her daughter was blue again and she got there in time and her daughter's fine so we are you know we recognize now that sometimes accidental findings just when we do our homework and go through the data are there and can make profound changes in people's lives now I mentioned I was really glad I had tenure when we started seeing something that looked correlated with deep brain activity on the wrist and I was like huh I'm talking to a bunch of doctors saying isn't this bizarre like can anybody explain this and the doctor when doctor raises her stand she goes Roz it's easy what do you mean it's easy it's medicine one one that was some 101 I took engineering I never had Patterson 101 what do you mean and she said when we were all and knit together in the womb we all had three tissue types one of them the ectoderm knit together our brain our spinal cord our neural tissue with this largest organ on our body the skin from the moment we were formed therefore it is no surprise that some activation in different regions of the brain can map differentially to interesting dermatomes different patterns on the skin I wish I'd known that before but anyhow if you're interested I will give a URL at the end where you can get a lot more information about this I've just published a paper going into a lot more detail on mappings that we are starting to look at between different regions of the brain including hippocampus very important in dementia memory Alzheimer's and a whole bunch of other conditions besides epilepsy and pain studies also with the cingulate and other regions and also in leading into my last topic here mood and depression things that we have been thinking about for a long time and are now really focusing on for the for the future I'll I'll start the story with what when the former directors of the Media Lab used to say to me when I was building a bunch of the wearables and effects sensing and he would say to me Roz when are you gonna build me the mood ring that tells me my wife's mood before I go home now we all know the mood ring was just a stupid temperature sensor that's trivial right we have temperature in both of these you know but hey at MIT we don't want to do trivial stuff we want to do hard stuff and I wanted to I want to do this right and I want to do it for the right reasons too and so we've been looking hard at what what do you really need like you know do you I mean seriously if you if you just know your spouse's mood that could also raise their expectations yeah you've honey you better show up with chocolates and flowers and you know five days a week and this could start to get to be a lot but we started digging to see like what's the what's the real good that we could do here and forgive me I'm going to show you some depressing numbers in this next slide but I know you can handle it there's actually a very serious challenge related to mood and this is I know we all know people many people in this room I'm sure have suffered from major depression it is the leading cause of disability for our college students and for many other people and in fact these numbers are really important because they well you'll see why but they're not a blip they're a 15-year span that the CDC has reported on so white men and white women have shown the largest increase recently in 45 to 64 age range 59 and 80% increase in suicides this one I just shake my head and and get speechless what a I mean anyone suicide is a tragedy but to think that our little girls are taking their lives and we hear about this at top universities like MIT and Stanford and and Harvard tends to keep theirs hush we're working with the leading suicide expert at Harvard I asked them how they handle it and don't talk about it at least at MIT were very open and we want to look at the data and we're trying to do a whole lot about it too but this is a worldwide problem and in fact the World Health Organization's recent huge report on this says it's going to be one every 20 seconds by 2020 and here's the number I hope we can do something to change this ability and lives lost from depression well it will be the number one health burden it will be greater than cancer accidents war and stroke by 2030 the rate at which things are increasing worldwide now I never heard people talking about this before we started asking some questions here at MIT but clearly there's a lot of big reports on it the reason is it seems to be something we think the mental health community will do something about doctors will do something about and that's great but I went and talked to some of the leading mental health researchers who were here in Boston they're incredibly bright and they're wonderful and I said to one you know ahead of long list of things at Harvard med school you know you guys you know how to do the cognitive behavioral therapy the brain imaging the biochemistry the you know you know how to like do each piece of it optimally and optimize putting it together if we just get people to you sooner can you help them can you fix this you know you must know how to fix this right and he says we don't know how to fix it and my heart sank and I thought wow maybe this is a problem that needs engineers it doesn't just need medical people it needs engineers it really does and I I hope to you know convince you it really does and we are my students have gotten very excited about this and they have started you know led a number of studies let me just give you a sample of the kind of things we're doing in partnership with the medical school at Harvard okay not trying to go it alone here we are bringing the best of engineering signal processing data collection machine learning and our ability to just put it all together mathematically and measure from people sleep and wake physical activity light exposure autonomic stress texting behavior phone call behavior your social network dynamics your geolocation dynamics your patterns of movement so far we're doing this only for college students we'd love to expand to other universities besides MIT and go beyond the students have been awesome about signing up and contributing data long-term right now has only been 30 days a person we really want to scale it because we need to get the seasons of change of life not just the original 30 day snapshot that we did and we would like to not only recognize the current mood or emotion and whether it's if persons doing well or not but we would like to do something that's sort of the equivalent of weather forecasting and we would like to be able to predict it now 150 years ago people laughed at people who said they were going to forecast the weather high you know there's no way you can predict if it's gonna rain or snow this weekend and you know and people were laughed at but some crazy scientists went off and they started gathering lots of data at lots of different cities and sharing information and putting it together and building mathematical and lo and behold today we all check the weather forecast and okay it's not perfect right you know sometimes they say inches with snow in Boston and my kids are mad because we get none but we we could do much better right we can get people out of a city before a major hurricane hits we can predict the big storms and we can improve the outcome because we can do that why aren't we trying to do that with health why aren't we trying to do that with mental health now let's take all those high dimensional complex parameters and roll them up into one in this vertical axis and this is well-being and at the top you're doing great and your company you've just hired they've just hired you or mit has just admitted you as a student and your well-being is super and hopefully it's a good match and you come in and you get even better still time is here in the horizontal axis and as time goes on and you encounter more and more major stressors almost everybody takes a dip but if you're resilient hopefully you pop back up unfortunately not just at MIT at most universities and also I'm hearing at some of the very best work places in the world where their CEO is telling me our number one problem is depression you know some quarter to a third and some higher rates are taking this red path a very common problem now you get down that path a certain distance and hopefully before you get down that path but usually you're quite a bit down that path you get help you get mental health help and that's where the medical system kicks in and they try to push you back up that that red hill to the blue line what we would like to do and I think it might be possible although it is a little crazy like weather forecasting is could we predict back there when you look like everything's fine if you're on the red line or the blue line actually let me change that since Marty was just talking about the tea if you're on the red path or the blue path okay could we tell if you're on the red path or the blue path before you get in trouble if we could tell which path you're on before you get in trouble it's not only like saying there's gonna be a big hurricane or a big storm but we might be able to change the weather right this isn't just the opportunity to forecast the weather this is the opportunity to change the weather and this isn't just the weather outside this is the weather inside this is what is causing that number one disease burden by the year 2030 could we the brains in this room the brains of MIT alums current MIT faculty students lots of departments and partnership with medical people could we not just recognize this but prevent this recognized forecasts do the huge data analytics that allows us to identify and prevent this is this crazy let me give you just one quick story cuz I at the end here there was a colleague who was doing a big depression trial 20 people who were wait-listed for the depression trial they weren't yet getting the treatment also happened had bad sleep he gave them six weeks of sleep therapy by the end of the six weeks 18 of those 20 no longer qualified for the Prussian trial just fixing their sleep fixed their depression we see at MIT the good sleepers and the bad sleepers were good as highly regular sleep and bad is really irregular sleep when we control for the total duration of sleep on average the highly irregular sleepers have significantly lower mental health significantly more sadness less alertness and much higher stress now which way does causality go here we still have a lot of work to do to show that other studies digging into that or suggesting the sleep influence on mood is greater than the mood influence on sleep although we do know there's a little bit of both I'm gonna wrap up here so we have a few more minutes for questions I've taken you on a journey here of some of our surprises trying to build technology that helps people communicate emotion it started this particular journey I told you about started with people on the autism spectrum telling me they weren't being understood properly we started to take technology that used to require being wired and in the lab built it in ways where we could go out and get data outside the lab and start to just learn from what was going on outside the lab but inside of people from there we ran into surprising findings things not happening it wasn't just general arousal and sweat it turns out that you can get a skin conductance response without any sweat turns out it can be different in different places turns out that if you go in and map it to different regions of the brain you can find patterns there that are much more specific when we built a sensor into this Domo sweat band that could measure skin conductance around the clock we found asymmetric activation that signaled a seizure with the help of empathic eye we've turned that into a device that can very sophisticated run machine learning issue alerts while also collecting all kinds of other fun health activity sleep data for all of the rest of us so we can use the most sophisticated electronics to learn about our health or to issue private alerts if we need we're now continuing to work with brain scientists to learn more about these mappings and particularly the ones that relate to mood and depression these are core regions of the brain involved in some of the hardest to treat kinds of depression and we're asking now can we move beyond the detection to the forecasting and not just forecasting but there's some really cool machine learning we can do that doesn't just predict but that also helps us identify which variables need to change so that it's not just about you reading in the newspaper GE I should be getting seven hours of sleep or I should be getting more regular sleep but you could figure out like what applies to you we find some people have something that works for them that's different than what works for somebody else so why should it be a one-size-fits-all recommendation why can't eat of us if we're willing to share some of our data in a hopefully very respected way from our wearables and our smartphones why can't we learn what's optimal for us I think we can so I will be happy to take questions now I'm gonna leave you with the URL where you can get more publications oh and also in Pataca was just nominated for the serendipity award Alexander Fleming for this finding so I wanted to sort of shamelessly ask you if you would be willing to click twice to vote on that if you want while well I'm taking questions thank you so much thank you hi I'm Amelia laughs alum we have epilepsy in my family it runs for my brother myself I have a different kind of seizure and another causing but are you were saying that now you can detect it well when the child is going to have a seizure and you said that if someone has been touch or talked he merely react right what if the device does the sound like if the mom doesn't come out of the shower or yeah so right now if there's nobody there so first what the device does when it detects an event that it's programmed to detect is it vibrates that alone may stimulate some people it goes to the person's phone which hopefully is within Bluetooth range and powered on and on the network Wi-Fi or other and it activates this alert which calls people you've designated to call and they get calls they get text so as you can imagine there are several places in that process where the signal might not get through if nobody comes the outcome is the same as it usually is where the person is unattended in most cases they're still okay you know this is still a low risk of death but unfortunately it does still taking more lives every year than house fires and you don't build a house without a smoke detector right so this is sort of trying to add in the smoke detector it's not perfect but because we kind of feel when it's gonna happen and sometimes we can stop it no like you go to sleep right away but sometimes cannot yeah we're not claiming to do anything invasive to stop it right now there are companies like neuro pace that make implanted brain stimulators that might in some cases with very localized seizures I think they're getting like about 25-30 percent effectiveness and some folks there with that but got a car like a boys legs in your name like wake up yeah yeah so we this is coming out with an API soon we're gonna be able to customize a lot more stuff right now we've just been you know nose down to get out especially devices for IndieGoGo supporters who bought it some more than two years ago so we're kind of slow getting it out it turned out to be a lot more workers expect yes on this side and I've spent a lot of years in the pharmaceutical industry and over time we have decreased as an industry our investment in mental health in part because of the difficulty of measuring the impact of therapeutic interventions and placebo effects so in addition to the prevention and the sleep interventions are you working with companies or entities on using this to kind of improve our ability to measure the effect of other kinds of interventions yes yes we are involved with a lot of companies on the measurement and they all have sort of different goals we're part of kind of for clinical trials right now in the depression area as well as this more of my red blue path diagram most of the work companies want to fund is on the right side of that where there's a clear diagnosis and sort of clear outcomes we're a bit renegade here at MIT because we want to work on the left side of that graph we want to work where there's no diagnosis yet where the person looks fine and and they say they're fine we're even noticing some people reporting that they're perfectly happy for three days in a row before their roommate drags them off to MIT Medical and they wind up in McLean Hospital and really in bad shape so we're recognizing that a lot of these current you know measures are just not you know they're they're not right but we are having trouble getting companies to fund the left side we have a couple who are doing it who are recognizing hey this is our this is most of our workforce right who's on that left side and we their well-being measures I skipped over that vertical axis is very complex there's lots of candidate ways to do it our approach tends to be not to just rely on one way but to measure a lot of ways and handle the complexity we can handle multi-dimensional measures I was told I should shift from the left to the right I think we can handle that so over here next and then we'll come back to the left yes so a really quick question on the red and blue path you mentioned the happier people who had regular sleep and the less happy people had irregular sleep does the quantity of sleep impact that at all or is it just regularity like if you get two hours regularly are you a beard you need seven hours regularly I I think we ought to be able to answer that in an individualized way in the future let me say for the group data that we have right now most MIT students were getting sort of six and a half to eight hours of sleep so we don't have real extremes on a regular basis so those are kind of outliers so I can't I can't really say there but when we sorted it based on like if they were kind of averaging less than six and a half versus averaging more than seven half that wasn't the biggest factor the biggest factor was the regularity of their sleep not the duration yes over here now sorry thank you for the very interesting presentation I'm very excited and Reid reminds me what Stephen Hawking says was one of the highest threats from human kind which is human aggression and I think that you know I think we are closer to an evidence-based a path hopefully with what you just said I just wanted to comment two things the first one is in the mental health industry everything is evidence-based practice there for example something called multi-systemic therapy which shows there's some economic models that for every dollar invested there you get four dollars of savings and I can see the value of teason on mental health however my question is there are 42 million Americans with sleep apnea that give you an 80 to 84 million dollars potential revenue by the way my question is have you analyzed how can you peer your technology for something so simple and common like sleep apnea for example people are often asking us about the really well-known things like sleep apnea diabetes heart disease we have because we built a researcher device we have a lot of researchers in those areas who are now using this device to collect that data for studies there right now I don't have results on apnea we were not seeing the big sympathetic surges with it that we would expect to see however there's some heart rate variability related stuff that looks interesting there there are some very interesting findings coming out related to the diabetes and heart disease and also related to the other one I'm often asked about it when somebody appears to be brain dead and they you know can we help with that and there was just a paper published out at Brigham Women's Hospital 'no neurology ICU there showing that this data actually was significantly predictive of whether people were gonna survive or not so that was extremely interesting to the none of these things are like a silver bullet for everything right this is a piece of a complex system and it's a piece that has been missing that we haven't been able to get that objective evidence for in the past and now we can so we are helping provide more of that very important evidence-based measurement which will show us it's useful in some places and not in others yeah I was told I can take one more question so I think this microphone gets to pick yes hi before is my question because it's gonna sound a little negative I don't mean to be negative you asked the question why aren't we doing more forecasting with health and I'm interested in your thoughts about the potential for abuse of this information for example predicting facial expressions to sell us more things I'm already pretty creeped out by Google following everything I've ever clicked and this or the second perhaps use of this would be the TSA seeing some kind of facial expression that's perhaps due to a disability and then pulling people out so there's this whole other side for it and what are your thoughts about how to deal with that yeah thank you for asking that when I first heard my book effective computing I usually when you write a book starting a new area you talk only about the positives I included a chapter addressing exactly these things from the beginning I was excited when we started Affectiva that you know even when you're struggling startup and people you know want to give you money you know you sort of are told you have to take whatever you can get but we turned away some of these kinds of things where people wanted to sense your emotion without your consent and to this day they still are staunchly opt-in clarify you know what's happening what's going on with your data you know and that continues to be our ethic also with the wearables we make it easy to take it off control your do you know we're trying to do all we can now that doesn't prevent other people from abusing it there's still I still have some real worries there you know I will I saw lots of hands go up I will hang out during I think there's a 30 minute break after this I will hang out and join you guys and feel free to come up to me we can talk more about this I also have a whole bunch of papers online that URL that address some of the ethics the concerns it's complicated right it's not as simple as we just do the right thing we got to try to get other people do the right thing which brings me to the next thing which is we are all the public now right as well as MIT and so the more that we leave here and talk to people about this and talk about like good values versus not I think that shapes what people do much more than rules and regulations rules and regulations are important do you think we need them but ultimately people disobey trolls and regular mote a culture that shows respect for human feelings so if you take away anything today about effective computing it's that when we started it it was to show respect for human feelings and let's do all we can to make sure that technology continues to honor human beings and show respect for human feelings thank you thanks again for joining us for more information on future MIT Alumni Association productions please visit our website
