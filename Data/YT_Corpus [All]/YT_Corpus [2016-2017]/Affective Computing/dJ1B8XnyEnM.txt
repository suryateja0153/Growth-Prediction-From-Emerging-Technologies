 alright guys we're going to talk about some very interesting topics it has absolutely huge potential but there's also wherever there's high potential there's also significant risk so we're going to talk about both these subjects and frankly when it comes down to is what makes us different there are we all sort of think we're all different in some way or another but what makes us different well I want to pick a human being to talk about first this is Albert Einstein actually in case any of you noticed although he's in beach clothes on the beach ok um he weighed about 150 pounds and what's interesting about this is what was he made of he was made of 97 pounds roughly of oxygen 27 pounds of carbon 14 pounds of hydrogen 4 pounds of nitrogen and a whole bunch of other smaller things but the fact was if you reduced into his atoms he was that now what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you something pretty amazing 150 pound Great Dane reduces to the exact same numbers it isn't what we're made of that makes us different it's how it's organized mammals are all the same stuff by mass because oxygen is heavy it is the single biggest part of our bodies but on the other hand by a number of atoms hydrogen is the biggest one and you can see from that hydrogen the green and the blue we're mostly water is what it comes down to but the fact is almost all mammals are exactly the same thing land mammals are the same thing ok so it isn't what we're made of that makes us different it's how they're organized it's what it's attached to what what things are bonded to what how they pass around energy for example and this is all information we are all big piles of big data is what it comes down to that's what makes us different is the way we're organized we have approximately a hundred trillion cells in our bodies and each one of those things has three billion base pairs in it so you can immediately realize we're talking about huge amounts of information inside our body and then we've got epigenomes we've got microbiomes we've got a Munich ohms we've got virals communica we got a whole bunch of different proteins inside our bodies that make that are different and they are all in huge numbers and furthermore they change over time the number of cells in our body obviously grows as we mature when you're a little baby you don't have a hundred trillion cells but when you are an adult you have a hundred trillion cells our genome is pretty stable it does change a little bit over time but it is pretty stable but all these other things are changing and in some cases they're inheritable epigenomes are inheritable as well so medicine is becoming big data effectively and doctors are becoming data scientists effectively it's all code it's just quatrain area instead of binary now historically we have over the last few millennia been steering evolution if you look at what corn looked like 2,000 years ago it doesn't look like corn today we have been selectively breeding so we have been in fact already modifying the genome some okay but we've been doing it by selectively mating things two other things frankly it pets just think about dogs dogs all look the same 2,000 years ago now there are so many different breeds from Great Danes to chihuahuas so it's changed a lot because we've been interbreeding things and making things happen in the last couple of decades we've been reading genomes for the first time actually understanding the information content in our body craig Venter sequenced the first human genome I don't know how you know this but James Watson was that genome and in fact they found three fatal diseases in his genome and yet wasn't dead okay so there was a lot more information in there than just those fatal diseases we are seeing defects we're seeing predispositions like bracha one for example which predisposes a woman to cancer we're identifying mutations that have happened that a cancer we're detecting pathogens and why they are methicillin-resistant for example and we're identifying susceptibilities we're doing a lot of things with genetics right now that are very helpful that we're now able to sort of open this book and read it but we're moving on now and what this session about is tonight is about writing genomes as opposed to just reading them writing the code of life is enormous ly powerful it is a really big deal I'm not sure you guys saw it but craig Venter recently created a synthetic organism that was completely new he just reduced the genome to the minimum bare minimum and created an organism there are roughly four ways that I have read about to do it zinc finger Talon CRISPR mega nucleus Hayes's there are a number of ways to do this and there probably will be more as time goes on but we're going to hear tonight from the panel about some of these techniques what they're good at and what they're not good at and things of that sort and to will it be accurate is one of the big issues right off the bat this is a case right here where a CRISPR experiment was aiming and let's see if I can do it here at that green area right there but it also hit all those red areas so when we start executing out grabbing a whole of a particular part of our genome we have three and point 1 billion base pairs in our genome and there's going to be a lot of other potential matches unless that match is very carefully done so one of the big big issues that I see is where are we going with this are we going to produce designer babies are we going to produce manufacturing workers that have forearms instead of two to make products better okay we can have gene drives things that basically take over a genome of a wild animal and basically it can cause a whole species to go extinct at some point the law of unforeseen consequences is the most important law we all live on right now so where are we going to be doing this where is this place going to have impact in the human germ line where we are changing babies or fetal DNA or even the very beginnings of sperm and ovum x' mutations during life like cancer for example or aging or neurodegenerative diseases of food related products like plants animals insects vectors bacterial and viral organisms micro biomes and pathogens of one sort or another and then as I mentioned craig venter synthetic organisms as well so the purpose of tonight's panel is to talk about the power of this technology and that's what we're going to do so with that I'm going to move on and I'm going to actually ask ask Riley to come up one of the first people in our group who's going to talk about his company desktop genetics thank you I'm really happy to be here I think this is a great opportunity to talk to a group of people who are possibly using chrisberg other genome editing technologies in their work as well as people who have read about them it has been all over the media and I think it's a great opportunity to bring these two worlds together which is sort of a theme I'm going to touch on a bit later but just by way of an introduction my name is Riley I before desktop genetics I used to work at Genentech as a bio process engineer and before that I worked in biological engineering at Dartmouth and along with two of my classmates in graduate school we started the company in 2012 we have two major revenue lines the first is our destron cloud software at destron comm if you work in a lab sign up today it's free to use otherwise we if you want us to do the CRISPR for you you can talk to us and our network of partners in our advanced genomic services group and ultimately what we're trying to do here is between our software and the larger network of suppliers and partners we work with to be able to support you all the way through the genome editing process so that you can literally do desktop Gen X you can sit down at your laptop and create a custom cell or organism and be able to apply it to solve some and we have 14 employees we have over 200 2600 users we've done thousands of experiments and we have quite a good success rate so far with those which we're really proud of I'm going to give you by way of a background the CRISPR talk just for those of you who aren't too familiar with it I'm going to go through it pretty quickly though so I can get into some other more interesting lessons that we've learned and some of the sort of stories from the trenches about being an entrepreneur in this space CRISPR is an RNA guided nucleus effectively you can think of it as finding replace or for those of you who like me write code something like said or awk for the genome and what you're going to be doing is taking an RNA component it's got a variable region that you use to program this nucleus enzyme that goes in and cuts the genome at a specific spot this is the easy part but what's really interesting is what the cell does after there are a myriad of DNA repair pathways that are then engaged and depending on how this is done you can get various types of outcomes and those are actually what gives you the editing event that you want so CRISPR is precise cutting but you still have to have the pasting functionality to why do you want to do this you can go and you can fix genetic diseases as we said recently they published a paper where they went in and they were able to rip the HIV virus pro genome out of cd4 positive cells in vivo which is really well not in patients and test tubes which is a you know miles away as you all know but it's still incredibly promising we haven't seen anything quite like this actually in 40 years of biotech they're also able to engineer pigs as factories for replacement organisms and they're even able now to program the immune system to go in and target cancers more efficiently so there's some really great things that people are doing here it's also really really hyped up right now I am IT tech reviews calling is the biggest biotech discovery of the century what you see is that the number of plasmas being requested to publications has had this massive hockey stick since about 2012 when this really broke and we see thousands and thousands of experiments happening all the time I think you'd have to read something like 60 papers a week now for the rest of your life just to catch up and stay on top of the crisper research that's coming out it's pretty remarkable and so I kind of want to talk about why it's so popular a little bit well one you can do quite a lot with it it's very versatile it's got a lot of the same advantages of both RNA I and other genome editing techniques but there's a little bit more joy and we're going to come to that in a bit but if you are working in the life sciences it is a great tool it does work and you should definitely be checking it out the OTO software also is up there briefly rather than say too much about I want to focus on why is this necessary why do you need software in this space and I think the best analogy I can give you is that if you've got something like a warp drive you still need a navigation computer to go with it right or you can you know skip off a black hole or go through a sonic and just like a han Solo quote along these lines well it's the same in genome editing you need a navigation computer for the genome to know where you're cutting and what the impact is going to be and that's really why the computer and the machine learning algorithms behind it become quite important so what have we learned so far well first is that CRISPR does work with some caveats what we found in our analytics is that human error is actually the greatest source of a failed experiment and also that you really have to take into account the subsequent repair pathways that are being engaged it's complex stuff and we really do need computers to do it the other thing though that people haven't touched on so much is CRISPR is popular in large part because it's very cheap to do academic scientists have to make every dollar count and so when a company like a gene is giving away the CRISPR vectors at cost that's a large part of why you're seeing the 40,000 labs pick it up in a single year and I think this is an important angle to keep in mind one thing we also have learned in this space now Mars and entrepreneurs that tools and services of which CRISPR is it's actually quite a dirty word to a lot of investors mostly because they don't think it's scales but I think there's a much bigger story here about the enormous amount of capital required we've now seen two CRISPR therapeutic companies file for IPOs within two years roughly of being founded which is incredibly quick by most standards and so you have to think about you know there's a sort of a much richer story here I think to discuss the other thing that's still an open question is is crisper a medicine or and how personalized is it going to need to get is this actually more like gene surgery where each patient actually needs a customized there because after all everyone here has a quite unique genome you know we don't know that yet but if we do have to get that personal I think we're going to really need to rethink regulatory pricing approval distribution it really challenges a lot of tenants of our healthcare model and the other big thing here we see is that actually in bioinformatics at least the data curation is actually the far bigger problem than anything else that we're seeing right now it's a real mess out there so if there are any bioinformaticians in the audience I'm sure you can commiserate and with that other things they don't teach you in business school recruiting is actually much harder than raising capital at the moment much harder by about a factor of 10 every incubator skips this step and they shouldn't and there's this thing I call the cult of the pitch everyone likes to have a pitch session they should really be having you pitched it to prospective talent rather than investors because that would actually get you a lot further there's actually a lot of major lack of cross-pollination between biotech and software IT is generally an afterthought for most biotech companies there are some exceptions and they do some really incredible stuff the SAS model also we've learned is not a good fit for biotech biotech is an eighteen-month paper-based procurement cycle SAS model expects you to be able to you know load in your credit card details and be done with it and these two things just don't fit together at all we've lastly seen patent pooling everyone likes to ask about CRISPR IP it's just in one more instance of a much bigger problem here unlike other industries biotech doesn't form patent pools they don't cross licensed as readily though they have eventually gotten there once many much blood has been spilt litigating and I think that there's another big opportunity in this space as well and then lastly I think what we've learned is that the cost structure of biotech and the cost structure of a software company are completely different biotech is largely capex driven whereas labor and brains is the really the big cost that you will have in software and so with that I think there's a lot of cool points to talk about I'd be happy to follow up with any of you thank you just to take off where Riley's more start where Riley left off so there are many applications for genome editing and I'm going to try and move from the research space that Riley talked about to the therapeutic space and so but would start with some of the principles that he talked about being able to target a specific gene and then then make a modification in that gene is a permanent modification and that's I think one of the key things is we start to talk about changing medical paradigms from chronic treatments to therapeutic cures and I think that's one of the things I'm going to try and emphasize as we go through this this talk so I'm going to talk a little bit about Sangamo and what we've done they asked me to give a sense of this but then I'm going to jump into how and where can genome editing being used in disease settings where we hope to be able to move past even the most advanced of gene therapy efforts to permanent cures so I'm going to skip over this thing these slides will be available the highlighted area is really what I wanted to talk about focusing on curative outcomes and then being able to do that through genome editing strategies Ted's introductory talk talked about different modalities different ways to target genes did we turn just about crispers I'm going to talk about in earlier platforms zinc finger nucleases so this is a way in which every one of us actually most every organism on the planet has evolved to control gene expression we have about three billion base pairs in us those break themselves down to about 30,000 genes to go back to a tech metaphor 2,000 of those genes actually encode the operating system of our genome and those are zinc finger proteins so a big percentage of our genome encodes zinc finger proteins they're highly evolutionarily conserved and each one binds three base pairs of DNA what evolution did is mutate the small parts of these proteins in order to target or bind to three different base pairs of DNA and then linked these together in a way that they can bind to more and more complex or single sites within complex genomes and that's what we've been able to do much like scientists brought antibodies into the laboratory and engineered those into monoclonal antibodies to target specific epitopes or specific protein sequences we've engineered zinc fingers to target precisely the nucleic acid sequence we want and then we can use that to bring to that site in the genome what we would call a functional domain and now to bring that to the genome editing space what we're able to do is bring to a specific site in the genome driven by the ability to target or design zinc fingers that go to exactly the site we want and provoke a double-stranded break and that's really that one of the key takeaway terms here is a double-stranded break we want to break the DNA at a specific site and once we've done that we can drive multiple solutions to that break but the two principle ones are one we can cause that break to actually lose DNA and get stuck back together through a normal process that actually knocks out or stops the expression of that gene and so that's a targeted knockout we can also use that double-stranded break because we know it's precisely in the genome where it occurs to use the process a natural process called homologous recombination to insert large sequences or even small sequences but sequences at that specific site and this allows us to do targeted addition but the key thing here is not just the outcomes that we can achieve but these outcomes are permanent they're permanent to that gene and so if you do this inside a cell if you do this inside the nucleus the so called endogenous genome in that cell that modification is within that genome and just like every other gene in that genome it's carried through if those cells divide and into all of the future cells so it's a permanent modification and that allows us to begin to think about targeting diseases where we know that there is a disease associated with a gene we can permanently change that sequence or disrupt that sequence we can actually change the clinical outcome for that patient forever two minutes Wow okay so these are the kinds of things that we think about in terms of of therapeutic outcomes and and then they asked me to talk a little bit about the company and I've just a couple of slides so how do you finance a company with these kinds of ambitions there's diluted and non diluted capital grant funding corporate partnerships that we've done equity financing is over the last 20 years combination of those this is a quick sense of if you want to deliver or make these cures permanent on an in vivo basis you use things like was that ex vivo or interview Oh in vivo okay yeah well these are somewhat backwards sorry so this is using this in the context of permanent modifications and stem cells versus existing strategies known as lentiviruses we can also do this with a AV which is another way of getting genes into cells but those can be washed out and the right-hand side of this is meant to tell you about the permanence of doing a genome editing piece versus a washout and that's what's summarized here and then back to to what we're doing so Sangamo is a company that's moving forward the genome editing space we've got two programs currently in clinical trials two programs that have been approved by the FDA we've got four actually six more programs that we intend to take through the FDA this year so this is a technology platform that is reaching a sense of maturity and happy to talk about this these are just a couple slides at the end to kind of compare and contrast various genome editing platforms and I'm sure we'll have time to talk about these on the on the panel today that's it we've learned a little bit about the technology here with these these particular presentations I'm kind of curious from each of you well first of all I'm going to give everyone a 60 second opportunity to introduce themselves and well you want to start with that absolutely so I'm Riley CEO and technical leader desktop genetics before this I did as a bioprocess engineering at Genentech so it made a lot of antibodies before that I've always really been working in biotech but I've also really had a strong interest in computing sort of probably from playing too many video games and so I have always operated I sort of the intersection of these two spaces and I think it's a there's a lot both can learn from each other great good edward Lanfear the president CEO and founder of Sangamo Biosciences about 20 years ago and been in the industry for about 30 years I'm Eric Rhodes I'm the senior vice president of R&D and the chief technology officer which has to do with genome editing at horizon discovery I've had about 10 years in genome editing space actually started at Sangamo and then moved through sigma-aldrich where we made available the first genome editing technology for tools and now moved to Rison discovery which is a company focused on developing tools cell lines animals for use in research space not a clinical applications Jenny and I'm Jennie rook I'm at early stage investor and life sciences technology companies my training undergraduate is in physics and computer science and then I found and fell in love with genetics Scott I got my PhD in genetics and then since then I've spent my career on the business side of biotech with a strong emphasis on genetic tools such as these gene editing tools Thank You Jenny and I guess just a compliment everybody else I'm also an investor in biotechnology and genetics although I tend to focus on the diagnostic side but what fascinates me about what we're going to talk about tonight is that if you've actually diagnosed a genetic defect now you can actually fix it at the molecular level as opposed to giving it some kind of broad chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill a cancer so that's one things it fascinates me about what we're going to talk about tonight so I'm kind of curious from each of you what do you think are the most promising areas where CRISPR technology or talen or finger is I think technology is going to be have an initial clinical effect not so much research but this is mostly what we're talking about today has been research application but what is it going to actually affect human health I'll start with that because Evan so we've been in the clinic with zinc finger nucleases for about five years of the HIV space very quickly the product is an autologous cell therapy and HIV patient so autologous meaning we take cells blood cells cd4 blood cells out of a HIV patient we genetically modify them with a zinc finger nucleases that targets a gene in those cd4 T cells called ccr5 ccr5 makes a receptor that's expressed on the surface of all of our T cells in which HIV uses that to get into and infect T cells knocking out that T cell gene makes the receptor disappear from the surface of those cells we then infuse those cells back into an HIV patient and the goal is to create a active immune response to the virus but cells that cannot be infected by the virus and so we're in the midst of Phase two clinical trials on that right okay any other thoughts I just say one other quickening so in addition to that we also have programming stem cells for HIV and we have to open IMD's now in the area of hemophilia and in lysosomal storage diseases and then we expect that IMD's open for what are called hemoglobinopathies which are beta thalassemia sickle cell disease like this year great great Derick have any thoughts I think one of the questions that we all need ask ourselves is sort of what are the issues with taking each of the technologies forward in the clinic and by far Sangamo is the farthest ahead with the same finger nucleuses and they are really sort of setting the stage for these technologies that follow there is only one technology so far that has been used clinically talents other than centimeters and it it hasn't been successful but there are still some of the same concerns about safety that there were the same fingers and there will be with Kris Pearn cast night gala yeah yeah I don't think be to be honest I don't think the game has changed with the advent of CRISPR Castine I think that simply has opened the game up a bit wider to more players angry I agree I might also point to indirect benefits to human health so the I unlike many investors I do love the tool space for the impact that it can have on science and health and some of the work that I funded when I was at the Gates Foundation was on genetic editing of animal models so that we could do better preclinical work in infectious disease for example so wasn't using these tools to modify human cells but modifying some of the tools that we need in order to get therapeutics into the clinic mm-hmm I had absolutely second what Jenny said I think for the vast majority of patients today unless you have a quite horrific genetic disease or a couple other more tractable targets the impact is really going to come from better medicines there are a lot of diseases we don't actually know how they work a lot of drugs fail in the clinic because we don't have the disease biology right and the ability to more reap more precisely figure out exactly how cancer is working or how Alzheimer is working could change the life for billions of people yeah actually I'll add something to that myself I'm an investor in a company called gene weave that was recently bought by Roche and what they do is they genetically modify viruses that affect bacteria and they modify them so that they light up when they find their target they set off Lucifer rays and so they can tell when person who's got staph aureus has methicillin-resistant Staph aureus because they actually look for the MEC gene mecca a gene that's in there that conveys resistance so they can now test every patient who comes into a hospital to see if they're carrying methicillin-resistant Staph aureus called MRSA okay which is one of the most serious clinical infection problems you find in hospitals and it's just simply from genetically engineering in this case a bacteriophage which is a virus that affects bacteria so that it does our work instead of its own work anyway all right so I have a question here about how big is the market for clinical applications for gene editing but I have the impression that it's it's pretty big now in 30 years it could be huge and so I'm not sure how to answer that question from a time point of view but I'm kind of curious what diseases are sort of the most vulnerable the single gene modification those kinds of things first or a pathogen it's got one variation that makes it drug resistant or something like that any thoughts on that subject I'm happy to tell you where you know everyday you've already been talking about some of them yes with HIV of talking the low-hanging fruit are genes where there is an unambiguous and that's important an unambiguous relationship between a mistake or that particular gene and a disease so an example of that is sickle cell disease and beta globin another example is hemophilia factor 8 and there are many many hundreds of so-called monogenic motor diseases that are directly amenable technically to genome editing strategies there's a number of issues you had some of these on one of your slides okay that also have to be considered beyond just can I target a gene sequence and can i disrupt or correct that sequence much of it has to do with delivery and being able to deliver to a target tissue for the right period of time some of the issues that Eric alluded to in terms of specificity to those targets so there's lots of different challenges but but basically the low-hanging fruit for the next 2 3 4 5 years are going to be gene targets where one is an unambiguous relationship between the gene and the disease yeah it's worth mentioning though the in addition to that's absolutely right the Vanguard and certainly I think we all defer to to Edward as the pioneer in this face but I think an emerging category is also the manipulation of the human immune system to fight disease whether it's cancer or infectious disease and that that is in the category that Edwards talking about of ex-vivo where you at least to start where you remove components of the patient's immune system modify them retrain for example components of the immune system to go back in and fight cancer cells I think that's a very exciting area as well yeah I think that's true in effect when it comes down to is we have been living for a few billion years here with evolution kind of controlling this manipulation and now all of a sudden we're grabbing the steering wheel which is kind of a scary thought and we'll probably start off at first by just simple things we don't want to go too complicated right off the bat because of the law and foreseeing consequences that I mentioned earlier which means all of a sudden we could extinct an entire species of mosquitoes or something like that because of one simple gene driver or something okay I've been reading a lot about the IP battles there are in this space because it sounds like CRISPR for example there are two different organizations that feel they kind of invented CRISPR and I both basically have pending patents of one sort or another do you guys encounter in your companies or in your investments do you encounter these IP and how do you basically deal with them we do but it's usually it depends on the customer and whether or not they have you know some companies just have enough money to go out and license all of the IP and that's it and be done with it which is a great strategy if you can afford it if you get actually quite a huge range and the other end of the spectrum you have the academic researchers who don't really care one way or the other you know and so they'll go out and do Chris because they read about it and they'll try it out in terms of us we're sort of a bit removed from it and so the larger effect is whether or not they're ready to move with crisp or they sort of it's sort of their own stuff out internally and they feel comfortable with it but some of the companies have really impressive programs whereas others are sort of kept getting more comfortable with it mm-hmm here's what's Rison is pretty much right in the crosshairs of the IP situation in that we provide tools for research now I think we see a different outlook from those groups that are on the therapeutic side clearly there are three major groups in the crisper cast line saying really has the zinc finger tight up there appears to be mostly one group about talons but in the research side where people want to use all of these and we employ all of those technologies we've had to take licenses to all of these things and it is complicated trying to understand what will rule and what are our customers demand of us so we've had to be as broad as possible we've taken licenses to virtually all of these technologies so Jenny I suspect this is one of the things it adds risk to every investment you make well I'm an investor in Caribou Biosciences which is one of the leaders in the CRISPR space they have the exclusive license to the UC berkeley jennifer doudna IP if you've read about the space you probably heard about so there's certainly we spend a lot of time thinking about electoral property as many life sciences innovative life sciences companies do more time talking to lawyers about intellectual property than an average saying what I'm seeing in the space not speaking for caribou but just as an investor is that there's so much excitement about the power of the technology and so much interest in starting to use it to make solutions that companies are taking I think the stance that in the long run they'll figure out a business solution and let's go ahead and pick a problem they want to solve and try to use whatever the correct tool for it and then hopefully retroactively Lee we'll we'll figure out some appropriate business relationships to enable those so yes it is complicated it'll be years before that particular dispute around CRISPR is is resolved because that Z along it takes but in the meantime it's it's delightful to see that it's as you're saying rally definitely not holding back research and also not holding up progress I think in the in the commercial sphere as well I also noticed that there seem to be different regulations in different countries as well so that all of a sudden somebody in England may be able to do something or somebody in France or China or something can do something that we could not do here at some point so that's another challenge is that some countries may be a lot more liberal about this and some countries may be a lot more paranoid about it that's true for both the intellectual property and I think as you're saying for the regulation of the use of the technologies so for example how the different countries think about whether using CRISPR kasra gene editing counts as genetically modified or not is is different again and what they're doing it on if they're doing it on a fetus on a human gene line germline that's a whole separate issue than when they're doing it on a piece of corn you know coral or something so actually moving to the FDA have any of you had experience with how the FDA likes to look at this because I would think the FDA since they've been so incredibly difficult about devices and about drugs over the years that they would be horrified by this as there are the people who are supposed to be the risk managers the ones that eliminate all risk before the public population can use it so have you encountered FDA resistance to this everything we do and in terms of therapeutic product development is regulated by the FDA and I might be the single anomaly on the planet but I think the FDA does a spectacularly good job could they have been more partners than regulators they are curious they're engaged they're thoughtful they're rational they're reasonable I think they're wonderful you may be the only person I know who thinks that and that you and the FDA they were sitting in the back they really think they they have a FDA has a terrible reputation my opinion in in the area when they have a tough job in a tough job but they do have a bureau that's Sieber the Center for biologics Evaluation research if a Center for gene and cell therapy and within that all of the genome editing work that that we do and others do is is is housed and it's it's a it's a scientific regulation agency you know they could use more funding they have turnover there's lots of issues related to a bureaucracy but yeah and they balance risk benefit they ask those questions but if they're up there a thoughtful and engaged group that you know I'm not pleased to have the I'm pleased as a citizen I'm pleased as a consumer of medicines I'm pleased as a part that children they get medicines to have the FDA do I do yeah other experience really so I think that the FDA is an excellent partner if you engage with them and engage with them early especially if you're a small biotech business but I think they are a perfect example of his almost immune system the biotech industry has against people coming in from tech or hardware or devices who don't know this getting in some really big fights and I think thorough notes and 23andme are they're at the top of the list they elected me flout the FDA's Authority and they do not like this and they will come after you very hard yeah so you have to be very careful and people don't they're like oh regular target we're agile we're going to innovate f it is not like agile they insist on waterfall yeah you cannot there's they don't like Minimum Viable products it has to be version 1.0 and that's there and this is a complete cultural shift though for other industries yeah yeah I think that's true I it's interesting that they have approved drugs in the past and then later on withdrawing them like Vioxx for example and the fact was it Vioxx helped a hundred thousand patients but heard five thousand or something like that so they don't they often are concerned about removing all damage before it's approved even though it might benefit ninety five of those thousand of those people but this is the direct side effect of what happens if the FDA does their job they don't get a bonus they don't get a reward they don't get stock options or an IPO but if they do their job wrong they get dragged in front of Congress and raked over the coals sure whatever what do you get and if you do your job very well at the FDA people will start going on cruise ships and getting their procedures done there we're going off to Malaysia or something like that so they have to be a little careful that they don't drive all of Medicine overseas when you're told you have colon cancer and you're going to die you're probably going to find a solution even if it isn't FDA approved so um the accuracy associated with these technologies I'm not sure that we fully grasp what the negative byproducts the negative effects can be with a lot of these things yes you can fix a monogenic mutation but if you also disrupt something else elsewhere in the genome what's the side effect you're not going to notice like they're suddenly much more prone to colon cancer five years later or something like that any comments on those sorts of things about the accuracy I wanted to emphasize something that Riley I think very correctly may point maim it in his talk which is this is a tool whose act is wildly different in different contexts including in particular the hands of the practitioner so if we were talking about scalpels have just been invented you wouldn't talk about their lack of accuracy because I can't do open-heart surgery I'm not trained I don't have the equipment etc the same is true with CRISPR casts it's really easy to pick up in the same way that a scalpel is unlike some of the previous technologies which had a higher barrier to entry that the level of expertise necessary to even give it a shot so we're seeing a much wider variability in accuracy and and impact there that that is one of the biggest knobs is is the practitioner and in the cellular context so some of the work that caribou is doing internally on a technology development front is to really understand the relationship between for example the guide a sequence that's used to target the the place where you want to make the break in the genome and how that varies depending on what type of cell you're in or how long the guide sequence is and it turns out all of those variables matter quite a lot not everyone knows that right so you're going to get a a wide variety of results so you shouldn't take either the range that's visible to the public or any given example as representative of the accuracy of the technique hey I think you have to test the technique on many people not just one or a few because the fact is everybody's somewhat genetically unique and you may find a side-effect in a person that you didn't expect okay so that's a complex issue yeah absolutely true the other thing that I would add to that is that the current generation of off target detecting assays push the limits of dextran sequencing systems to do the you know borderline of their capability except that they actually don't always agree with each other and it depends on who actually ran the sequencing assay that day so there's enormous variation happening in here too so now what is a false-positive actually me is it noise or not and then you touch on an extremely extremely important point everyone has a different genome and we there are now many cases emerging in the data of places examples where a different genotype creates a very attractive off target site that is picked up in one context but would not happen right and in a clinical setting this could actually kill someone we're talking about a situation where if you don't genotype the patient you could actually cause quite a bit of harm to them mm-hmm but unfortunately our system doesn't even really have a concert wait we have to rediscover the drug for every patient how does that work it's going to be quite a challenge I'm thinking about Vioxx again and the exact same thing that it worked really well for a lot of people but there were a few people it didn't work so well for it actually caused more problems than good that actually is interesting because what it comes down to is that we're going through this gene editing revolution at the same times we're coming to get our arms around the personalized aspect of medicine that everybody's a little different at a genetic big data level and so that we're going through both these things at the same time I think that's one of the big challenges that we have is we're having companion diagnostics that make you take this drug but someone else takes a different drug for the exact same condition I think that's also where you're going to see this field develop with ex vivo therapies to start yes right you pull the cells out you do your manipulations there are at least a battery of checks that you can do before you put them back into the patient's and once you start injecting directly into the patient you need to be pretty sure of what you're doing there's a different safety protocol associated with that so you know I think the steps are happening in that order for the most part and depending on the seriousness of the disease or the consequences of the therapy you know we will move certain things into an in vivo setting before the xbo yes and that's where and Eric's right that's where we've been as an ex vivo setting but now if we have developed the kind of specificity that you're talking about and the ability to characterize both the on and off target activity to the point where we've been able to move to nvivo settings so directly into the patient and and in a way and so those of you who are interested in that kind of question of the kind of specificity the kind of rigor that one has to do to show that you can do you're targeting precisely the site that you're interested in doing nothing else the National Institutes of Health has a committee called the recombinant Advisory Committee the RAC and novel genetic therapies go before the RAC and so we've presented all of our ex-vivo but now most recently all of our in vivo genome editing work at the RAC that's up on the NIH website so it's all there in much much more data in terms of specificity off-target activity toxicology carcinogenicity etc etc go into the filing of an investigational new drug application with the FDA and we've now have to approved in vivo inds that we're moving forward so it's an important question but if you're capable of building highly even Singh early specific reagents it's a solvable issue no I think what we may see is we may see a lot of working animals and plants first okay and working on things that we can Amada Phi see how well it works see if you know one in a hundred cows die if we modify the cows to make low-fat milk instead of - milk or something crazy like that I mean the fact is that we may start off by not actually a functioning or directing on human it's a Ted to a certain extent that's already been done I know it is and with I mean Eric was at Sigma you guys made hundred if not thousands of transgenic animals yeah with different models I think dozens it's probably now hundreds of plant species have been notified through genome editing so if that's the prerequisite those prerequisites are finished yeah and we are now moving to the point where this is being used and will be used both in cell based and autologous cell settings but also in vivo genome at ago there was an interesting comment that someone made here that gave me as a suggestion the stem cell revolution happened about 10 or 12 years ago it is not actually sort of swept through like everybody thought it was going to sweep through we're still not actually making hearts or making livers even though we knew how to do roughly how to do that sort of thing we craig Venter sort of sequenced the genome 16 years ago or so and yet we're still trying to figure things out how long do we think this is going to happen that we're going to play with this and mess with this and experiment on animals and experiment one severe cases or monogenic diseases and things like that before it actually starts becoming a commercially big deal as opposed to a interesting piece of science I think that's not a scientific question I think it right that's a business question it's a regulatory question I think that that framework is really what needs to happen but would say we've been working on gene therapy for 40 years as well we've killed some people along the way unfortunately we got it really wrong in some cases we've learned a lot of lessons at least and now there's a lot more safeguards in place and I think it doesn't but I would say it does it does it end what what it what is it done even look like here right is it any gene any time every time complex multigenic things like Alzheimer's and cancer that might be decades away but that doesn't mean you can't have an impact here right now mm-hmm the other thoughts well I think it's it's there are active clinical trial both with platform we're working on there are clinical trials with crispers that have been announced first 2017 maybe even earlier there's been at least one patient treated with a towel modified product we're now the point where it isn't a funk it isn't a question of gee well genome editing be something the question now is will that therapeutic product show safety and efficacy in well controlled clinical trials just like any other drug yeah so I can't tell you that that drug is going to work but the targets were going after if we know that replacing factor a and haemophiliac will improve and normalize clotting that if you can do that inside the patient there's every reason to believe that that can be effective so there are scientific platforms but once those platforms have been translated into a reproducibly a drug that can be reproduced on a blocked alot basis just like you do in GMP manufacturing it now becomes a function of does that product can that product stand up to a statistically significant well controlled clinical trial that shows safety and efficacy just like any other drug mm-hmm this is such a powerful technology that I worry if you get some psychopath using it that it could actually be weaponized in some fashion or another has there been any thought to that I mean right now we're basically depending on the fact that everybody working with CRISPR and Talon and zinc finger is well intentioned I worry about that too but that even as a weapon depending on the sophistication of the person developing this thing you still got the issues of delivery specificity all of these kinds of things that plague the therapeutic space or at least are the challenges in the therapeutic space so you know these things will evolve together I think but we have to be vigilant carefully about what we can we have to be ready housing to a certain extent a lot of potential to do bad things if you're not careful you mentioned gene drugs and your introduction a which is not really part of the sort of genome editing as we're talking appear here is is a bit tangential I think it does highlight something very important which is that these are very slow-moving things gene drives happen over generations so they are the air the century-long weapon the same thing even in this gene drives large mammals genes isin insects can happen a little quicker FairPoint it's based on the generation yeah but my point being that even genome editing if it were a weapon this is not a bullet this is something that's going to take place over weeks or months potentially and so they're not actually terribly even effective in this case relative and I think that's something that's just important to bear in mind the kinetics just really aren't there okay Luca nature's already a pretty good you tating mechanism yes so cosmic rays do a good job yes do we have to worry about the high school chemistry student going off and deciding he wants to do something crazy in other words if CRISPR is so cheap and so accessible and you can get things done is it possible that you can have some rogue high school student going off and doing something I can say having worked with almost a hundred different companies the level of support that even skilled people need at times is surprising oh I'm not horribly worried about maybe your honor high school student is something to worry about but you're sort of average mean you know mad at the world sort of high school student I'm not sure it's exactly there but I mean yeah if if one really wanted to do something biological there are far simpler ways to use viruses yeah that that can don't require crispers or genome editing or anything else synthetic biology space I mean there's either same question there's always does the minute on paper and put it into okay sort of as a last question is there anything that the US Congress or the US government needs to do to put sort of rules in place to prevent people from doing certain things like germline modifications and designer babies but on the other hand to promote the idea of appealing hemophilia or something like that I mean I'm kind of curious because right now I don't think Congress understands this at all okay and so I'm wondering do we need to put in some rules some limits some boundaries so I think the framework is already in place right this is a new version of gene editing this is not gene editing has suddenly existed where it didn't before again singham o--'s been doing this for decades we've got other kinds of gene editing tools so this is already contemplated by the RAC FTA I don't think it it changes the framework okay I I'll do this part quickly but in addition to my day job I'm also the chairman of an organization Washington DC called the Alliance for regenerative medicine which is a organization about 300 members all of the gene therapy companies all the genome editing companies all the stem cell companies all the cancer kartik companies so it's a it's a large organization patient advocacy group so on and we were early on little more than a year ago calling for a summit on genome editing in fertilized human embryos Congress has gotten interested in that the National Academy of Sciences has gotten interested now more recently this last a month are we in a problem thank you this last winter the National Academy - god of Medicine along with the Royal Society of London or of England and the National Academy Sciences of China did a summit in Washington DC on the whole issue of genome editing in to the germline so there is a active political discourse around issues related to gene therapy and genome editing you're right it takes a lot of Education in Washington to do that an awful lot of time sometimes yeah but it's it's important that you know one does have make an effort to try and educate politicians on these issues okay okay all right I have some questions that basically have come from the audience here so I'm going to actually throw them out I haven't filtered them in anyway but I'm going to sort of go through them first one actually is kind of interesting it says the panel seems to be an agreement on just about everything what is something that you are all in great disagreement about but we're all in in subtle disagreement about which one of the platforms is the better crisper talent area I doubt it I disagree that we disagree because I think I completely disagree I think if you scratch the surface hard you'd find you know camps relative to where one thing is better than the other and that sort of and that's why I think there are pros and cons to each I have funded every single gene editing platform we're talking about one way or another CRISPR is just the most recent and so I think each has incredible strengths and drawbacks and what we will in 50 years have a collection of all of them doing different things better and worse we use all three and we're agnostic as to which one we use we say what's the application what are we trying to achieve which one serves best in this particular situation right we could use all three at or rather implement we don't because no one asks for them and for CRISPR right the research scientist which are the vast majority of them are because it's best for research and it's also because of the economics though that's why it's the research and the technology is not going to stand still there's gonna be a Chris beer at some point okay we've already had new nucleation yes it's gonna happen it's gonna happen we're gonna move on we're basically just getting our hands on the accelerator pedals and the door of the brakes associated with modifying genomes and they're gonna be new ways of doing it no doubt so so when would we be able to design totally new mammals for pets and okay I would make the argument that we've already done so because I don't think a tiny miniature poodle is actually a natural animal okay so much significance so yeah there is there's a glow cat that a glow cat yes I've heard about that and I think the others TV shows about glow everything animus is there's glofish commercially available to separation the we train yeah we've been working or when I was at Cigna there was work be done on a hypoallergenic cat by eliminating the dander gene I don't know what's happened with that to be honest I don't know I mean those are some of the simple things again there's more of a medical push than a commercial push the globe fish obviously was more of a commercial novelty I think that the concept of the hypoallergenic animal is something that would have some benefit but it does take some investment and there's regulations even in the domestic animal field so you know I don't think there's quite the commercial push to do our old-fashioned way of modifying genomes by sort of selectively breeding has formed a whole bunch of dog breeds for example to dislocate their hips all the time so yeah that reason is actually a much more interesting question though which is that we're the right biology actually isn't be very easy to design it's very easy to evolve right selective Rick anytime biology actually works it's usually in the context of some sort of evolution or synthetic evolution with some time involved yes but over multiple generations and iterations because it effectively it's a simultaneous optimization problem we're actually very very bad at designing biology from the ground up yeah but maybe in 50 years we'll be much better at it well let me - so one of the companies I invested in is called zymogen and part of part of the I don't think they would describe it this way but part of why I did so is because their approach which is very high throughput a very broad number of tries at once so shots on goal strategy admits that we're bad at designing things right and so it says let's try a bunch of things that's straightforward if what you're working on is bacteria that can produce chemicals it's a little harder if what you're trying to make is in a and cats and then you're going to select the one that mount me I was the way you wanted to it that's a different optimization problem so you know whether we can automate and and do shots on goal for for pets I think it's kind of a different infrastructure investment but I agree it's not the design problem it's a selection problem well and I could make the argument to that the microbiome we all carry around in our guts is also a pet oh man for many many pets it might say that about you yes in fact I think they they're gonna say I'm basically the house and they're the they're the occupants of that the meat car yes we're all villages effectively and so there's a lot of risk in that situation to the microbiome is if we don't realize the extent to which we cannot live without a microbiome to a certain extent so okay there here's a question that I think is somewhat touched on before but I'm gonna ask it again but this is a more specific one what is the opportunity for a kid using a $70 CRISPR kit disrupting the biopharma industry and where should these kids go after making genetically engineered biofuels so one thing I can say starting an early-stage company in this face is that the barrier here the $70 kit gets you barely one step it's actually the four hundred million dollar pilot plant you would need to go into production there is no Amazon Web Services of biotech really yet in software world you can get servers on demand capacity on demand if it's trivial now right now you have to build your own it's as if every tech company had to build an entire data center on the scale of Google to even sell one instance of their product that's the challenge right now that you're facing and so that's far and away the much bigger barrier well I do know that there are a lot of cloud-based genetic tools at the present time the where you can buy just you know a few minutes on DNAnexus or something like that and do an awful lot of work for compute yes and there actually are some really exciting companies like transcript ik and emerald with their cloud labs that are also really cool right but this is new stuff and I think they will definitely change the arithmetic here yeah yeah this is an interesting question because it's I know Craig Venters been focused on this one does CRISPR promise a dramatic life duration extent human longevity is a very interesting issue we are all on this earth for a certain amount of time and we tended to generate as we go but is there it possible that I could someday be genetically engineered to be a teenager again but you got to remember what we're talking about here are tools that can be used to manipulate biology so now ask the question differently is there biology that one can use to extend life or to create a next outcome if there is then these tools might be useful to insert or delete or manipulate but de novo you know these tools aren't going to do those kinds of that yes and I think aging is quite multigenic it's not it again multi-gender or not that's the biology of the question yeah if there is a genetic basis for that biology then these tools can be used to affect that outcome I think he still is there helping to drive the research down that yeah and doing a much better job and what we had ten years ago but I agree with that would weed them it's biology that lies at the heart of all of this and every disease you tackle on ecology especially where we look a lot every change you make has some other effect and the cell is very adaptable to those things and so we have so much we don't know about so many diseases the monogenic diseases we can associate with a disease but it doesn't mean that it if we fix it that patient will necessarily be well they may have already adapt it in another way that gives us some sort of negative outcome so who knows I think it is very different with immunotherapy and things we're trying to get our hands around cancer so the next one that we probably have to focus on is narrow degenerative diseases where we are just simply ageing poorly and turning into zombies effectively so it's it's a it's an interesting place we are because in effect what we are doing right now is taking over Darwin's evolution with our own personal design for millions of years effectively life has basically gotten smarter or gotten better or gotten more competitive or fed itself by getting using evolution using survival and fittest effectively now of a sudden its survival the smartest or the survival of the best tools effectively so do you see a role for machine learning for artificial intelligence in this and I think the answer obviously is going to be yes because we are dealing with such large datasets so we're going to need help yes that's what we do that's like our company um so I guess yeah any other thoughts on one AI and actually I think we better hurry up and do these genetic modifications quickly because AI is going to take over pretty soon if I believe you on musk but that's a whole separate issue units you it's being used we're working with that stuff to try and improve the technology itself and then obviously the whole question of biology and all the impact of all those big datasets it's a yes again I think I'm more on the Ray Kurzweil side of saying that AI is going to be helpful to us in figuring all this out eventually as opposed to the anxiety-producing approach I think machine learning and the larger suite of tools to handle big data problems and opportunities a great way to identify new questions and hypotheses out of biological data and then you still have to do the science yeah the next question I've gotten from the audience is I'm a junior in high school how can we have this taught in our school see me after I'm really happy to say most of that program is right for me for high school Jean omitted there was there was a distant program at one point it was being put out so we think they're adopting it I'm you know and when we go to these national conventions and things like that there's generally an education sector where you have high school level in some case junior high learning about these seminars about the technologies what they can do to obtain that so I I think it's happening not everywhere get your teachers involved yeah it's five or ten years behind what's going on in the laboratory of the most advanced companies I suspect certainly yeah and it takes well and there is equipment needed I mean you know right now is it Riley said you can buy the $79 kit you still need to be able to grow cells whether they're bacterial or mammalian cells that requires other equipment and it gets more and more write sophisticated well this next question is actually asking about why is it that CRISPR is so special a good zinc finger and Talon and other things that nucleases have been have been there before but CRISPR I think the reason is and I'm very interested in what your responses is that it's cheaper and easier to do it's cheaper and easier and in particular I've used before the analogy of it being like the invention of GPS you there's now an with a long enough sequence an unambiguous relationship between your your directions and where in the genome you want to hit whereas before we were reduced to saying when we wanted directions to some place in the genome you had to translate through protein which if you've got the skills is a incredible way to do it because it's very specific and very amenable to therapeutics but if you don't and you maybe you're not from the area you're reduced to saying well I think you go down to the Dunkin Donuts and you take a left but then there's two Dunkin Donuts right is room for lots of error if you have to go through the process of translating where you want to be in the DNA via a protein based Direction system so CRISPR is really exciting because there's a one-to-one relationship between the guide sequence DNA the target sequence and so you're you're not trying to figure out how those things relate to each other and that's part of why it's so straightforward to use for new practitioners because they don't have to to go through the protein step next question is how do we get involved and make money if we are interested in riding the CRISPR wave so caribou is hiring pretty aggressively so is divergence oh no I've got some great portfolio companies who are looking for talent I think this is actually an interesting point though because CRISPR is so cheap you have to think of the business models a bit differently and I think they're coming at it more from the informatics side there are two real issues the first is that the margin on the CRISPR reagents is being unput under from medicine downward pressure at the moment and so it's very difficult to say like oh we're going to get the Commission and we'll use the software say as a loss leader or something like that the other issue though is I think there is a lot of resistance especially in academic laboratories to paying for software informatics because after all I have the post come in and do this and I have a bottom one from that informatics department come over and do it and you know we were going to save our money for tangible goods there's quite a lot of bias there that can be so blunt and I think that does make it a bit more difficult you know I do think though that there is certainly a lot of opportunities but you got to just be a bit more creative about how you seek them out it's a bit the the so what I think from that and that's absolutely right is join a products company someone who a company that is focused on solving a particular problem that is associated with a market and is using CRISPR as part of one of the tools if if you are interested in therapeutics broadly there are options as we've heard outside of CRISPR that are more broadly about using these tools for human therapeutics if you're interested in industrial bio or an AG or research and you're agnostic then you might look for the leaders or the emerging leaders in each of those sectors that are using CRISPR as part of their overall strategy I think understand the technology as well you just look for an unmet need and decide whether or not the technology can address that unmet need and I think that's been done to a degree because of the other technologies that are out there CRISPR is cheap enough now - it's a lower barrier at least to entry to try some of these things so I think you know if you have a great idea you can get it funded but it's that great idea coming up with it what is the unmet need that you can address with this technology okay I'm looking at the next question here changing the gene move cells in an adult organism is a tougher problem than changing isolated cells could you please comment on the state of the art and mass genomic conversion and that is one of the challenges and you want to try that in the in vivo therapy yeah that's what it it's more complicated it requires many other components beyond just the genome editing piece of it it requires novel or perfected delivery systems that requires tissues specific promoters it requires the ability to affect the duration of expression so there are many many many other levers and many other elements that go into being able to use genome editing systemically or envy MU versus isolating cells modifying those cells as Eric said being able to characterize those cells before you put them back in so most of the gene editing therapies whether or not they're well I should say gene therapy applications are generally still very targeted you're not trying to affect the whole body and you're looking at trying to get an effect on the liver or maybe isolated the brain or with right yeah so I I don't think anybody's really thinking about a whole body you know modification delivery is it just a insurmountable challenge it does suggest for example that we can harness viruses to do our work instead of their work where we already do we already yeah and there's some great there even in oncology I understand as well there's some great meta work where researchers are using CRISPR to in a directed evolution work modify viruses to have different tissue specificity so that they could then deliver ourselves tissue that's pretty great yeah yeah there's an interesting question here since data is since DNA is data easily created copied do you see the IP landscape changing in the future the way IPS handle more similar to the software and digital world and one of the things that's interesting about this is that you know myriad thought it had a patent on a particular gene sequence and then that the courts decided all of a sudden you can't patent a naturally-occurring sequence you know like patent an algorithm that puts a lot of them together or something like that so that is one of the interesting issues here any comments on how the IP landscape is changing in this area I think as biology becomes more of an engineering discipline this will need to change mm-hmm I think that the way we've approached it so far is isn't quite the right fit and I think there's a level of sophistication that we're going to get you in the near future around this topic yeah this is maybe an area where we have at room for disagreement what is that so as someone who came from the the coding world and I was studying computer science and then I got into the lab my first year in graduate school and I try to do PCR and it didn't work and I was incensed what do you mean it doesn't work I designed it correctly I followed protocol it turns out DNA is code until you get in the lab and then it's DNA all right it's a molecule it has properties we don't understand it it works in a very messy context of human or other biology so none of the products that are going through the clinic are data they are physical things that have to work in these messy environments so that's a I think that it's interesting to rethink how we deal with IP there but I don't think it's as simple as that it's just information I think the IP that stands is around products that people have done the work to have biological insight take them through the clinic and show that they have human health benefits or show that they make improvements in how we do agriculture that's where the invention is that's where the business is when we target germ lines for improvements and will there be a split in our focus our species on those who have been edited in those who have not well people already have tried with Chris right yeah I think that is important to point out and the problem that happens is that you get a mosaic embryo effectively like a Dalmatian embryo yeah and so that it's has to do with even up a single-cell level by the time it divides out a couple days later you're getting different outcomes in each of the different cells and so you're not getting a complete conversion and this is why it was more or less unanimously said it's a very bad idea to do this it's just not safe it's not wise and it's not really getting the line with the current scientific practice but I think that's a matter of time yeah that's that's a current technology limit and we could guess about the timing on that but we are currently advancing the tools for other applications that will make it absolutely possible to do germline modification either in vivo whole body transformation as someone already asked or ex vivo modification of single cells or blastocyst or embryos so that's gonna be possible so that's a question and it stands what happens when that's possible all right I agree with Jenni I think the findings out of the summit were go ahead and do research in embryos human embryos but don't do any implantation so the techniques as Jenny just said will be perfected tomorrow a year ten years some time unit it will be perfected there are you know cultural norms or legislative norms or funding agencies or all kinds of ways to try and regulate the use of genome editing in fertilized human embryos but once it's perfected it will be used and the question is how and what gene targets goes back to the biology right we're not going to create biology but we can direct and modify biology in a permanent way yeah and you know as much as I may not like it and I may be dead by then but there will be genome editing in human beings actually I can tell you one of my companies that Tara does this already in vitro fertilization they typically fertilize multiple embryos and then they selectively lyrium plants um and they could reimplantation drom or something like that but but they could very easily be doing designer babies which is a genetic diagnostic yes a PGD as a quote acceptable way to go about with families who have Huntington's or other diseases but they can be select a very reasonable way to go about it it's a whole different issue to go in and say we're going to target a gene to provoke some kind of biological outcome right and I do think it will happen we're starting to run out of time so I'm going to go very quickly through the last couple of questions here one person is asking can we cure mosquitoes from carrying the Zika virus for example and I believe that is already being done got it so and being done for malaria as well I understand so I think the answer is very obviously tow so and in that case you're modifying the mosquitoes gut you're not modifying humans got so a relatively safe one and I think the issue there is can it be done yes will it be done and how broadly will it be done is a political question okay I think we're close enough toward the end of time here that I'm going to ask everybody to kind of give me a sort of a wrap-up comment on this thing very quickly Jenny once you start if you want just to what do you what do you think this is going okay hi I think the one thing that we know is that we don't know and that the part of why I'm so excited about CRISPR based gene editing tools is that it has captured the attention of many people who have never thought about genes at all right and that's both in the public as well as other types of engineers and scientists and researchers and I think that bodes incredibly well for science that means the set of people who can come together to think about the hard problems that are facing us for the next 50 hundred million years is is much broader is much more interdisciplinary and and and that I can't possibly predict what it means to you as you said Ted suddenly have a much broader and stronger grasp on the tools of changing our genetics and also all of the the entire tree of life which would just realizes much bigger and goes well beyond ourselves having the set of tools to to change that much more rapidly and much more directly I think there's no way to predict what that looks like in even 50 years we're grabbing the steering wheel of evolution effectively Aaron Jamie yeah I think Jenny covered it well and that what Chris Burke a sign has done is its elevated this into the intellectual discussion of we're common people I think it's obviously taken science by fire but even from some of the questions we're getting tonight it's starting to have a societal impact and I think that's a good thing there's still a lot of unanswered questions but you know it's a very powerful technology has the space of gene-editing been really revolutionized I don't think so we had the tools before to do these things it's just been brought a little bit more broadly to the communities to use now so I think that will push this forward and that's a good thing yeah yeah hey any comments Olli yeah I know I mean I'd say that what you've heard about is a from a research perspective an incredible revolution because crispers make the kind of science that can be done a research level ubiquitous and available I think ultimately where I think the greatest impact is going to be is actually being able to move to permanent curative outcomes one-time treatment permanent cures and that can change the lives of many many many patients but you know the metaphor one you can use is like nuclear power right you nuclear power nuclear fusion can be used for good it can be used for evil and this is very very powerful sciences that can be used for lots and lots and lots of important valuable benefits to mankind but it can easily be used in other ways as well yeah really I think that you know as we said this is something you can't do right you can go and you can edit the human germline you can go you know edit cell lines in patients or not now the question is what do you do with this how do you actually benefit society and I think that still is very much an open question I think that we have this really great hammer and we're looking around for nails and I think biotech and Christopher and genome editing it's still kind of looking for some of its killer apps what are those great things that will effect you know everyone's life if you think about it biotech has not had as much impact on your life for the last 40 years of semiconductors nowhere even close right cell smartphones have changed how we live our lives dramatically dramatically and biotech unless you are a patient of one of these sort of key areas that you don't even know it's there sometimes and so I think it's really going to be interesting when does this go mainstream and I'll just sort of summarize I think that from my perspective this is a very momentous time on this planet after four and a half billion years here all of a sudden a single individual creature on the planet is taking control of the destiny of evolution and that is a big deal and we don't know where it goes now simultaneously there are other guys in the AI departments trying to make artificial intelligences that are going to be much smarter than us someday in probably this century so it's fascinating that these two things are happening at about the same time anyway I want to thank everyone for coming and the veca or you want to say something in close ok go for it so give a big round of applause to economist
