 on solicitation in biosensor data thank you so good afternoon I'm Lindsay Reynolds and I'm a postdoc in interaction design lab at Cornell so today I'm happy to be talking to you about our note which compares real-time representation of bio sensor data compared with placebo feedback so today i'll start by sharing our motivation and background for the mood light project and then i'll briefly describe the mood light system before explaining our experimental design presenting our results and discussing takeaways for the chi community so our context for the study was better understanding college students and stress although more broadly stresses a growing problem for lots of people we started our work by doing some design meetings with our campuses mental health service in order to help students develop effective stress management techniques therapists encouraged things like talk therapy relaxation tools like meditation and breathing exercises mindfulness practices however people can find these strategies extremely difficult to practice both in the clinic and at home one clinician told us students can self experiment with exercises but I don't feel like they're actually reflecting on these experiments it would be nice to have a way to help them reflect and provide convincing evidence that it works additionally we were interested in the experience of college students because they're more likely to have technology driven avoidance behaviors to stress such as like watching Netflix rather than more accepted stress management techniques with that in mind we developed mood light to help college students practice developing healthy stress management practices so in order to avoid to avoid avoidance behaviors like over use of smartphones and laptops and also to with an aim to is a tool to supplement these face-to-face therapy sessions we developed a move light as an ambient lighting system with mood light they're colored light bulbs that change color based on an individual's level of arousal which we measured using a wireless electrodermal activity sensor so EDA sensors like the one in this photo collect biometric data about an individual's current arousal level and then this information is fed into a programmable lighting system the Philips hue bulbs and fluctuations in a route so level are displaying changes in the lights colors like similar affective computing systems mood light was designed based on the assumption that increasing awareness about one's emotional states can have a positive effect on their mental health so this notes a part of a larger study that we did exploring uses of mood light but one of the things that we started out when wanting to do the study was better understanding and establishing a baseline regarding the usefulness of receiving feedback based on one's current physiological level of relaxation therefore our hypothesis was that participants would react more quickly when they were viewing feedback that was representative of their behavior on their emotional state than when they were exposed to feedback that doesn't resent that state so he tested this hypothesis using a within-subjects experimental design so we asked participants to try to change the color of the light bulb from deep red to a deep blue as quickly as possible by relaxing the longer the participant relaxes the quicker the color moves towards blue at the end of the the trial was indicated by an audio cue so in the solo condition the lights who started at a deep red and moved in the series of steps towards a deep blue each time the participants level arousal level decreased however we also had a placebo condition so this is the which we use as a control and in this case the lights Hugh started a deep red and moved according to a pre-recorded sequence which dode steady progression towards relaxation and wasn't influenced by the participants arousal level at all um the order sorry the UH the order of the trials were randomized after each trial participants completed a short questionnaire about their perceptions of the system so in terms of the setup of the space we can get to the study in two identical experiment rooms which contain no personal decorative items to help give portsmouth's nothing to focus on but the study in each space there was a small table some chairs desk lamps which contain the Philips hue bulbs in the Android phone that controlled mid light system our participants were 62 college students 39 of whom were female and they range in age from 18 to 29 years and received either 55 dollars in cash or course credit for participating in the study in pilot studies we determined what pattern of relaxation felt like feeling fully relaxed to participants and we used is the benchmark for defining the end of the trial on the metric we then used for evaluation was the time it took for participants to reach that fully relaxed eight which correspond to the full blue light hue in the solo condition we performed linear mixed model analysis on these data and we accounted for trial order gender their level of anxiety when they came in and none of these variables were statistically significant so in terms of our results so to reiterate our hypothesis was that participants were relax more quickly in the solo condition and they wouldn't the placebo condition but in fact we found the exact opposite participants completed the placebo trial more quickly than the solo trial which was really surprising to us considering that we intended this condition is a control condition just to understand the baseline of receiving one's feedback in the first place so with this surprising result one thing that we were really concerned about was whether participants knew that they couldn't control the lights and the placebo condition because if that was the case then they might have relaxed more quickly because they were less concerned about being evaluated and so we checked for this possibility by analyzing participants responses to the survey question how much did you feel like you could control the output of the lights and so we found no difference in participants responses following the placebo condition than in the solo condition obviously I can't say for sure what's going on here because it's the lack of a difference but it does provide some support for the idea that participants weren't aware that they couldn't control the lights in a placebo condition I'm so designing the mood light system we were motivated into by a belief that promoting self-awareness is a key to effective stress management but in this study we found that the context of performing exercises to actively reduce stress was it was better to receive feedback that suggests progress even if that's not was actually happening a finding like this challenge is current affective computing trends that focus on real time representation of emotional states and indicates that this is an area of affective computing that needs to be examined more deeply looking ahead to future work in this area our group is planning to deploy the mood light system and a mental health clinic to evaluate its use as a supplemental face-to-face therapy but they're also interesting opportunities to explore ways to combine the type of leading feedback with models that with models that positive change with this effective feedback future resource could also explore whether this effect we observe holds true for non blight types of feedback on such a sound or screen based things additionally one big area future work concerns the ethical implications of the study right so what we did works in an experimental setting we could debrief participants and we were clearly not providing therapy but what does this mean for designing tools that are going to be used in these very types of settings right like is it okay to mislead people when you're providing therapy I'm not going to want to say that and are there other ways that we can get the additional relaxation benefits that we saw with this leading feedback but without having to mislead people I think that's a really interesting area for exploration in the future there's some implementations to the study that should be considered when interpreting these findings so again given that we were interested in exploring stress among students we were lied on a student sample for this experiment but these results may not extend to other populations additionally we use an experimental method in which participants were aware that they were being evaluated right and so the effects in here might not be generalizable to more natural patterns of stress and relaxation and finally in the study we used only one measure of arousal the EDA and since any single measure has limitations in the future studies it would be helpful to include additional measures of arousal like heart rate variability to get a more complete picture of what's going on so in conclusion we started out with mood light to help with relaxation techniques through developing awareness of one's a current state with the belief that this awareness helps promote relaxation technique like cement techniques like meditation however the takeaway from the study flies in the face of this suggesting that in some cases it may be better for people to be exposed to stimuli that suggest progress even if that feedback isn't representative of what's really happening so thank you for your time and attention and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have hello thank you for the wonderful talk my name is Alexander machaca from the University of Salzburg do you think that you stressed people by exposing them to this task and that increase the reaction time yeah very possibly right so yeah one important that's why we want to make sure that we counter balance things that if we were stressing people out in the beginning that we weren't accounting for that we had some filler tasks in between I'm so a lot of us has explained more in the paper obviously but we had some filler tasks in between the two sessions is a way of sort of bringing people down to the baseline so we had them you know so to answer random questions about short stories and something you know they would provide explanations for how to get two directions on places on campus as a way of kind of helping them relax we looked at their levels of state and trait anxiety so their overall levels of anxiety as a person as well as sort of their current feelings of anxiety in the moment and that's some of the things we we counted for our model to try to do that right um clearly that's a limitation of a study like this right is that we're bringing people and we're telling them to relax like relax now right it's not easy or comfortable or normal to do right and so um obviously an experimental method was good for being able to control the way we did but I wouldn't want to rely just on this before you know it's one of the limitations around the stress study so yeah it's a great point Cosima Rogan is University of Bucharest you have a really nice design and also research design I has the suspicion that maybe for some people it works if the lamp is honest and for other people it works if the lamp is like hopeful yeah so research wise I think maybe in the future if you have more respondents you can do a cluster analysis and to see whether for some people they maybe they improve better when there is realistic feedback and others improve better when there is this wishful feedback this would help and it also sort of answer your ethical dilemma that people could have the option of deciding how sincere sincere the lamp should be maybe like this robot in interstellar like I want to ninety percent honest give a sense of humor or something love you you raise a great point in fact if I could go back and redo the study now one condition I'd love to include is one where we provide the same leading feedback but we help participants in this case we're measuring your level of relaxation but it had absolutely no influence on the light right because that would be great it would be great if it turns out that just being able to have that even if people know that that's not actually their feedback if we can see the same effects and not have to sort of have inherently that level of deception would be wonderful I like the idea of yeah seeing whether people would sort of want to know and say please don't please don't tell me the truth Thank you Thank You Lindsay and thank you to all our speakers today in
