 everyone this is Bureau I'll share with you some new technology I was just made aware of today as you can see here this this video depicts a guy operating a drone in restricted airspace somewhere he's not supposed to be operating it now you see security personnel or law enforcement using a new drone defender which is an anti-drone system designed to disable the drone without blasting out of the sky as you can see right there now this new drone defender uses radio pulses to disable a hostile drone within 400 meters or 1,300 feet these pulses interrupt the communication system of the drone making it think that it's out of range the drones safety protocols then kick in forcing it to either hover or return to its point of origin descending slowly as it prepares to land because this weapon system jams the communications with the nearby operator the drone defender can prevent detonation and other remote functions so as you can see it's a rifle ar-15 based system platform here it's a brand new technology here that they're rolling out
