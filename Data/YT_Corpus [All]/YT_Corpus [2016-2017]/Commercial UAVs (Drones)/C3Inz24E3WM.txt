 a question I'm often asked is who can fly a drone well technically anybody can fly a drone as long as it's for fun and recreational purposes only and you abide by a few certain rules such as Steve more than 30 meters away from people stay away from airports don't find controlled airspace and don't fly over populated areas there's some more rules that you need to be aware of and these can be found at the castle website anything other than fun and recreation becomes a commercial purpose and that includes things like getting a mate to take a few shots for your website that would be commercial now there's two levels of commercial there's under two kilogram class and basically everything else is anything under two kilos a person can have no license with no experience and probably hasn't got insurance they can fly a drone it's under two kilos and do it legally for commercial purposes as long as they abide by a few certain rules be aware of hiring some people like that we carry a full UAC which is a unmanned aerial vehicle operator's certificate now we are casa license we've been casa tested where you have passes in aviation theory meteorology animals aerodynamics and we carry 20 million dollars with the public liability insurance had lots of experience so consider before hiring somebody that may be a false economy you really only do pay for what you get you
