 roswell flight test crew here wrapping up our show coverage from AUVSI exponential in new orleans louisiana and i'm here with none other than the drone girl herself Sally French how you and Sally great how are you I'm very well so what did you see here at the show that you liked who was so many things the first thing I saw when I walked in was a big autel booze and which I've never seen them in person before some nice cute orange drones I love that and then I headed over to the main cage and saw tons of drone demos DJI is there all kinds of crazy contraptions inside of the drone cage and I'm wondering what they're going to do with them other than that I've seen really really cool drones that go in water I saw some roving drones and one that looks exactly like Wally I wish I knew which company made it I'm just totally inundated with so many drones I think this is a biggest drone show I've ever been to before now the one thing I've noticed at this show particularly among the larger aircraft you know the military of stuff is they're all going VTOL I mean there are three or four different ones they're like a normal fixed-wing drone but they've got four propellers let them take off straight up and then you've got like hotel which is also making a really sweet looking a little God has built this Kestrel which is very elegant the motor it lifts off and then the motors pivot and then the most clearly the award for the most audacious design goes to in situ that's got that big x8 flyer system lifts the scaneagle up and then just drops it I mean that is just I love that there's so many different designs is not just a fixed wing or it's not just a multi-rotor there's everything here from previous years we've seen a big change it's a lot less emphasis on the military big iron stuff we're seeing more commercials that what you've heard as well yeah I mean absolutely there were so many companies in the past who didn't want to come to AUVSI because they were sort of afraid of that military connotation and they didn't want to look at a DJ I drone and then have people automatically assume oh the military's using it and I don't believe they are and now i think is the first year that we're really seeing so many of the commercial drones or the consumer drones here because no one's afraid of that military connotation anymore the public perception has really shifted to drones can be used to fight fires and to gather agriculture data and to do search and rescue and just to take great selfies I love that shift and it's refreshing to see if the consumer SAT here and then the FAA had an announcement the certainty administrator where day was talking about change which I understand you have some direct personal experience with yes that changed to me blew my mind so what he announced today drones would be clear for educational use cases a college course could teach drones and fly drones and use them and they wouldn't need to get this section 333 exemption which is obviously quite the challenging process you need a pilot's license so actually I was in a drone journalism class at the University of Missouri back in i guess 2013 we were flying drones and we were operating under the assumption that this was educational use which is clear to fly drones and we got the joy of getting a cease and desist letter from the FAA saying we believe this is a commercial use because you're paying money for the credit hours for the class and the professor is taking a paycheck so that's a commercial use and we are going to shut down your program which was so unfortunate I mean if there's one thing this world needs more of its more drone education and the FAA told us know so this announcement to me is really personal in the FAA and actually you know we were wrong and I'm glad they admitted they were wrong and are able to make change and saying yes drone education classes are a good thing and shouldn't shouldn't be a hindrance to teach where should people go if they want to catch up with what you're doing they can find me at McGee drowned girl calm or twitter.com slash a drone girl all right well Sally thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us was a real pleasure to see here at the show thank you it's an honor to be with the Roswell white Ted Cruz we're truly glad to have you here and from auvsi 2016 this is the roswell flight test cruz signing off thanks again
