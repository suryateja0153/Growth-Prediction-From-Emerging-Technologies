 hey guys today I'm going to show you a super easy fast and cheap way to get insurance for your drone and it even includes commercial coverage okay so I have an app called Vera fly it allows me to set up the insurance right on my phone so I'm going to go ahead and touch on the app here okay and what it's going to show you first up at the top it gives you a million dollar liability coverage and then right now it's telling me it's gonna cost me ten dollars per hour for the insurance and the blue dot is pinpointing where I'm currently located and the shaded circle is indicating the radius that the insurance is covering it's a quarter mile radius okay now one of the things that I could do is scroll around and maybe I'm planning to go to a specific location to do some flying and so when I hover over on this spot here you'll see it costs a little bit more there's actually a couple of schools there I probably wouldn't fly around to school but maybe you might want to okay as long as it's safe of course right so it costs a little bit more there and then I'm going to scroll over here and there's an area here where it won't allow me to get insurance that's because there's a hospital here and it has a Healey pad on it okay so just wanted to show you that real quickly and then I'm going to go ahead and show you the actual policy so this policy here is through a company called global aerospace incorporated so this is the actual policy that was emailed to me once I started the insurance policy all right I'm going to go to another page here and here shows the start date and end time for the policy coverage so I took this policy out on this day starting at that time handing out that day handing at that time it's a one-hour policy okay and it says its covers within a quarter of statute mile of this latitude/longitude location there's the actual map down here below I'm going to switch over to the next page now so here's the actual limits of coverage for the insurance those coverage eight which is a general liability it's a million-dollar coverage and then there's coverage B which is relating to privacy so I'll cover that a little bit more but that's ten thousand dollars here and then I'm going to switch to another page here and this actually details the coverages that are provided by this company so coverage a for a million dollars covers bodily injury and property damage coverage B is violation of privacy liability so that's pretty cool too and that's limited to ten thousand dollars so again $1,000,000 for coverage a bodily injury and property damage liability and coverage B ten thousand dollars for violation of privacy all right so next I'm going to show you my phone again and I'm going to show you some of the screenshots that I've taken of the app once I started the policy so you'll be able to show someone that you have a certificate of insurance and the coverage and the coverage time frame okay I'm going to switch to the next photo here you could actually email the policy to someone so that they have that for their records and then I'll switch over to the last page here and it shows actually a cap down timer and the location where your coverage is in effect okay that's it hopefully you guys found this helpful comment please subscribe like if you like this video thanks a lot
