 I'm cifra member and I want to show you these tags they're used to prove the authenticity of designer goods inside each one is a microchip that uses near-field communication it uses blockchain technology similar to Bitcoin to create an unfortunate ownership normally a product like this would be injection molded but the heat from the molten plastic would damage the circuitry on the chips and the custom logo on the front of these tags and the unique serial number on the back would require custom tooling for each heart and that's why 3d printing is a great way to make these devices here's Chris the co-founder of origin on why they used ember 3d printer to manufacture these tags when we originally trying to make smart tags we started with FDM technology which is sort of the run-of-the-mill 3d printer you can buy as a desktop printer and it makes a good prototype to give you a rough idea of what it should look like the next thing we try is what's regarded is the highest quality 3d printing process which is SLA again we created a nice prototype here we also try to industrial multi jet printer these can range from a few hundred thousand dollars up to a million dollars ultimately when we use the Ember except prints the entire layer once it produces a much better finish and because the Ember is open sourced we're able to modify primarily the software to allow us to do things like embed the NFC chip directly into the smart tag as well as engrave it with a custom serial number and do the multi tone color this is a complete product that can compete with injection molding or to do it on the ember here's how these tags are made in origins production lab they are printed in three stages the main body the base and the logo they send the print file for the main body to an ember the build head lowers into a tray of red colored resin the part will form on the aluminum face of the build head blue light from beneath the tray prints the first layer the tray slides away and back again to print the next layer 35 layers in four minutes later the build head rises from the resin and the main body is finished on one side there is a rim this is where the microchip is in in production the part is left on the build head and the chip is inserted in the upside down part now they send the print file for the base to the Ember it will print directly over the chip completely encasing it in plastic this print file also includes the serial number origin software uses embers open source architecture to generate a unique number for each print file after this print is finished they remove the build head from the ember and take it to a press where they slide the parts off the build head they 3d print a fixture on a build head that fits the tag bodies which ensures alignment when printing the logo the build head goes back on to an ember this time with white resin and the logo is printed in about two minutes they remove the tags from the fixture clean them and after a quick UV cure they have a final product using this procedure they had only one failure in a run of 600 ember is open from the mechanics to the electronics which enables many aspects of origins workflow for example being able to customize embers print settings to a specific material allowed us to experiment with pretty much every resident on the market we've written software to largely automate most of the printing process on ember and then from there we've actually built on top of the printing process on ember you know being able to print over PCBs NFC inlays as well as being able to do multiple colors are things that were able to do because ember is open-source and going forward is a lot more that we can do really excited we really love working with Origen because we've learned a lot about how 3d printers are used in a production environment if you want to learn more about Origen visit made by Origen calm they make more than just these tags and if you want to learn more about these tags visit Chronicle comm if you're interested in developing a 3d printing workflow for your product send us an email and together we'll figure out if ember is a good fit for you or at the very least will point you in the right direction and if you want to see more videos about ember and 3d printing subscribe to the channel we'd love for you to leave comments and tell us what you want to see I drop that
