 Electronic Music The future of brain-machine interfaces is right at our fingertips. UC Berkeley engineers designed a sensor... as small as a grain of sand wireless implantable in the body providing data in real time. The "neural dust" successfully recorded electrical signals in nerves. Rat nerve Which is big because... These tiny devices could one day help quadriplegics move prosthetics. The neural dust would record electrical activity from nerve cells in the brain. Ultrasound is sent to the neural dust, which returns a signal with data about the nerve's electrical activity. That data is analyzed, revealing different electrical patterns, which dictate corresponding movements for a prosthetic. To be implanted in the brain, engineers are designing a newer, smaller neural dust... Using materials that could last a lifetime. Neural dust could be used for other health applications... like to check the  health of an organ... stimulate nerves to suppress appetite or control bladder function... or even treat conditions like epilepsy.
