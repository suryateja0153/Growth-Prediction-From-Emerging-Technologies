 new research in Britain has raised concerns about the potentially harmful effect of nanoparticles the emerging technology is used in a variety of medicines and even sunscreen the research found that the small particles could damage the DNA of cells their tiny microscopic particles which can store and release drugs in specific areas of the body as a result nanoparticles are increasingly being used in medicine and surgery but because the particles are so small there's been growing concerns about potential toxicity in emerging for the body of evidence that says that for some particles of certain scales and a certain materials that there are potential health risks new British researchers added to that concern it found nanoparticles could damage cells without even entering them scientists found the particles change the function of cells and how they communicate with other cells what this study shows is that even with a barrier between the blood supply where the nanoparticles are and cells that they can be damage to cells and not just a bit of damage but significant damage to the DNA one of the biggest areas of concerns has been the use of nanoparticles in sunscreen a review this year by the Therapeutic Goods Administration found sunscreen was safe and that the particles didn't penetrate skin cells if trends in science continued there's no doubt nanoparticles will be used more and more we really need to do fairly sophisticated studies of the toxicity of nanoparticles before we use them extensively in humans the TGA says it will monitor scientific literature should any tangible safety concerns be identified so if you Scott ABC News
