 I show so who are you I'm bill Lindsey I'm a factory applications engineer for dust networks for linear technology's what is dust networks thus networks is a low-power wireless mesh network for distributed sensing applications so this is a mess right here yes so each of these nodes has a radio these devices are communicating to one another over the air with their radios and they are time synchronized to each other they slave their clocks together and as a result you can see they know how to turn on and off their LEDs at exactly the same time because their time synchronized how can the synchronize the time do they have clock in there or something they each have an oscillator that every time a child sends a packet to a parent the parent gives him an acknowledgement with a correction for his oscillator so the clocks all drift together and remain synchronized over years and they keep synchronizing all the time that's correct and so and so now the devices that our repeaters or routers are still off most of the time and so you can still get multiple years of battery life in fact these led itself burns 400 times more what the radio burns because the radio is usually off right now they are in battery right that's correct so you charged in the oven so I didn't tails I replace the batteries about once every month or so every month and they just think for months I'm mentioning here we have a third party partners that make more product x units for our customers that don't want to have to make a product because the products that we sell are really is chips and boards and you have to actually integrate that into a product but if you'd rather buy something more off the shelf we're showing partner products that up so what's the LTC 5800 so that's our port ship that has a radio and a microcontroller inside it's an arm cortex-m me something m3 yes very good and these are these boards are just RF certified boards so if you don't want to pay the FCC for RFC RFC dafuck ations these are already modularly sort of fit what kind of RF can you do 80 to dot 15 dot for same as zigbee zigbee it's a 2.4 it's similar radio a zigbee it's a it's a 2.4 gigahertz radio and so that's networks has over 50,000 networks deployed in more than 220 countries what do you mean by 50,000 it works so we have many customers that are in large-scale production who deploy networks all over the world that our biggest market is industrial sensing so like farms or no like refineries and gas processing plants and oil wells and your factories so what do they send so these what with a kind of important process variable temperature tank level flow valve open closed status on in any kind of a industrial sensor that has a human-readable gauge now more and more you're seeing those sensors have an antenna coming out of it and that data is being sent over the air so that the owners of these facilities can make smarter decisions about how to run their facility and the dust is far the new linear tech purchase dust networks five years ago dust networks was a start-up out of Berkeley for about 12 years now but linear purchase dust five years ago and linear the big company making kid making analog IC s analog integrated circuits for for power power management mostly so they saw opportunity to work with you on making the IOT world yes because some of their best in class ships are for energy harvesting and so is so this board is driving a moat via solar or thermo electric energy harvesting nice and that ink that's an e-ink display that shows the status of things that's cool all right some well it's-- a huge all ready for you but it's going to be bigger that's correct it's a industrial the high-end industrial sensing is the place where we've had the most adoption but we expect that to come down to to broader range of applications
