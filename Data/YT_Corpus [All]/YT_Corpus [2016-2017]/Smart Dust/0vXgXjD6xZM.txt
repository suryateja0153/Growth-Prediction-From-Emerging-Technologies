 smart does our sensors in nanotechnology they are designed to monitor everything almost like electronic nerve endings for the planet the idea of smart dust emerged in the 1990s by a researcher named Chris fester from the University of California Berkeley mainly as a potential use for military applications the project officially came into process in 1998 in 2010 hewlett-packard or HP announced that they are working on a project they refer to as a central nervous system for the earth within the coming years HP plans to have over a trillion sensors everywhere although it was mainly meant for the military it can also be applied to almost any other industry smartest can be very useful in terms of predicting and monitoring events such as traffic patterns energy use and earthquakes currently the sensors that are being developed are larger than what one would expect the size of an actual fleck of dust berkeley researchers however are presently in the works of making one a cubic millimeter hoping that they will be manufactured to a smaller size as the project develops over time smartdust goal is to create something so minuscule that includes elements that are necessary in order to execute the sensory measurements it is designed to do so while communicating back to a base station or the command computer that gathers all the data smartest are small wireless micro electromechanical sensors that are able to sense anything from light to vibrations the micro electromechanical sensor is the combination of sensors electronics actuators and other mechanical elements and a common silicon substrate the microelectronic integrated circuits in the smart dust acts as the brain of the system inside the smart desk there are nodules that are called modes which includes sensors digital circuitry bi-directional wireless communication technology and also its power supplied that is incorporated on a miniscule des size device the modes are battery-operated devices for the sensors work directly with the mote processor digital circuitry is what permits demos to become small while still having the capability to have a battery a minimal amount of random access memory and also a wireless transmitter the sensors that are integrated inside the smart does transmit signals back to a command computer through wireless connection the wireless transmitter is most likely powered by radio frequency identification wireless communication systems are required for data in terms of sending and receiving with a transfer rate of 1 kilo bits per second the wireless communication that is used must be bi-directional between the dominant transceiver and up to a thousand dust motes all together these individual technologies combined enable smart dust to perform its necessary actions after pioneering and heading the smart dust project at the University of California Berkeley crisp mr. went on to found dust networks des networks has since become an acquisition of linear technologies and produces a trademarked smart mesh smart mesh offers embedded wireless sensor networks that goes to unmatched data reliability over ultra-low power secure wireless communications enabling sensors to be placed anywhere in tough industrial Internet of Things environments dust networks is defining the way to connect to smart devices with current applications in data center industrial automation renewable energy building automation remote monitoring and transportation smart dust is still very much in a developmental stage research teams like that of the MEMS laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University are working toward overcoming technical obstacles that prevent the mainstream adoption of smart desks other than creating smaller modes using MEMS and electronics onto a single chip has proven difficult illustrating the complexity of this issue is the collaboration of departments Carnegie Mellon must utilize to run their MEMS laboratory including the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering the robotics Institute part of the school of computer science and the institute for complex engineered systems in the broader scope of micro electromechanical systems technology the five major players are producing in a variety of fields the leader of 2014 MEMS sales according to you'll development research reports was engineering company Robert Bosch driven by mims for smartphone sales including pressure sensors in 2014 the sales gap between Bosch and the second largest seller of MEMS devices as T micro electronics was over 400 million dollars this multinational electronics and semiconductor manufacturer holds a unique sensor portfolio including UV index temperature touch and pressure sensors accelerometers gyroscopes and digital compasses following stmicroelectronics is a brand many students are familiar with texas instruments while those taking math courses may know them for their scientific calculators their registered trademark digital light processing chip sets are the world's leading projection display technology including digital cinema business education and home theater applications hewlett-packard's mems are drawing attention from the tech community as they may soon shake up motion sensing HP's MEMS sensors are optimized for seismic imaging applications being used for oil and gas exploration rounding out the top five in 2014 was Knowles electronics with unique focus on microphones their trademarked size sonic series was the world's first surface mount microphone and is still preferred by most cell phone companies today the MEMS technology platform is used in microphones for mobile handsets smartphones and tablets within the consumer electronics market according to computerworld com the smart dose is currently the size of a grain of sand five millimeters but they want to get it down to one millimeter in size smart dust is made up of sensors compute in circuits bi-directional wireless communication technology and power supplies as shown by computerworld com the price for the modes currently ranges from 50 to 100 dollars but it is expected to drop down for one dollar within the next five years potential commercial applications are bared ranging from catching manufacturing defects by sensing out of range vibrations and industrial equipment to tracking patient movements in a hospital room most people believe that the biggest funders of smart toast will be the military because of smart dose you could drop thousands of tiny sensors over a landscape and create an ad hoc wireless sensor network where there isn't one already also you can do it in a way that's almost completely undetectable it can also be applied almost any other industry smart does can be most useful in almost every industry by predicting and monitoring some of the users can be attract traffic patterns in robles by doing those people get a real-time update smartos can also be used to track inventory in warehouses the modes can track down shortages in stock and norther more or let you know if there is too much of a product they can also be used to control air conditioning and units in buildings turning air on and off the advantages are smartest smartest has many potential advantages that convolution lies a vast array of industries for example when applied in traffic control a system of smart dust motes or a large group of smart dust sensors could be used to monitor traffic hires of congestion and wrecks down to the exact location when applied to inventory control smartest can help businesses monitor their inventory by detecting when a certain line item is out of stock and reorder it in military uses smartest can be used as an improved perimeter system to help dec detect hostile or normal activity and the environmental advantage will be the smartest could help scientists learn more about the environment and is able to detect changes in heat and temperature and those be applied to help detect natural disasters in business uses smartest can help but this has become more efficient by helping them cut energy costs and reduce my labor hours the disadvantages of smart dust just like any other technological advancement smart dust has its disadvantages as well it ranges from security issues to environmental issues and environmental disadvantage smartest can be damaging to the environment due to the fact that is non biodegradable and once it is released into the environment it cannot be retrieved this will cause pollution and would damage the environment I privacy disadvantage the public would fear for their privacy due to the fact that smartest could be easily deployed I could gather information about anyone without being detected a security disadvantage there will be a vast number of security concerns among many organizations where smartest would allow anyone anywhere to obtain information no matter how confidential this will cause problems in the military and in the public and an employment disadvantage there will be huge loss of man labor hours across various companies because smartest can replace a vast number of employees thus making the employees unnecessary engineers are hoping to reduce the size of smartest two-millimeter small and less expensive to make once develops martes will be distributed throughout big cities to help manage the city's infrastructure purposes also people will be able to access them and share the data that are collected from smartest just by using their mobile devices some examples of how smudges can help the cities are if they are on a roll it can alert drivers to avoid potholes or anything that can cause damage to the car during traffic hours it will send mobile user alert about the density of the traffic flow and suggestions for alternative routes this will minimize the traffic flow help commuters optimizing their drive times and decrease the chance of accidents footbridges it can detect the pressure fractures so that individuals and community will be more alarm in case something might happen for buildings it can recognize human beings and their activities and then respond accordingly by linking new data with its database for example it can boost our personal computers when entering the building if they are attached somewhere around the entrance for Street it can recognize human beings the places their ad are going to and the activities they are performing for a street light it can detect the presence of pedestrian to intensify the lever of light according to the pedestrian flow
