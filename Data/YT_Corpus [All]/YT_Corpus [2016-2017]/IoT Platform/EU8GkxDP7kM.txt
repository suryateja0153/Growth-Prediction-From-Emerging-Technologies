 the industrial Internet of Things is all about building new data ecosystems connecting data sources like devices and sensors used in highly disparate industrial environments to an Internet backbone and providing data generated by that equipment to any web-enabled application in a simple secure way using open standards so here we have a thing a small robot arm used in the manufacture of widgets in this example the robot arm picks up a widget and places the widget in a new location for additional processing and widgets that don't meet quality standards will be placed into a recycling bin so we're gonna take data from this thing this robot arm and provide it in a variety of ways to different applications used by a variety of people and different roles for different purposes so some roles may want to turn this data into information about the trend of good widgets produced versus bag widgets produced some rules may want to take this data and turn it into informational alerts like when a shift is met the production quota and some roles may want to take this data and turn it into emergency alerts about problems and failures so here's our communications platform cap server e^x it's connected to the robot across a local network and is collecting data key performance indicators like placement cycles completed arm rotational speed account of good versus bad widgets placed and problem indicators like arm height that one can use to identify if the arm needs to be recalibrated so now we'll connect this robot to the cloud using the IOT gateway within cap server TX so to connect the robot to the cloud I'll be using our rest client agent within the IOT gateway so here are the data points that my rest client agent is collecting the agents configure to collect data at a specific rate and store it temporarily and then publish the collected data at a different rate with the rest client agent will be able to securely publish data outside of the manufacturing environment through firewalls and up to the cloud so that any application any web service can take advantage of the data and turn that data into information and since we're publishing data and we're pushing it instead of serving it or responding to requests for the data we can provide data to the cloud securely even from the most high-risk and restrictive environments once the data is made available within our IOT gateway we want to configure the flow of data between the Gateway and the various local and cloud-based applications based on what the data is and what kind of information it can produce so for this demonstration we're using an open source product called node-red which will allow us to route the data between caps over yaksas IOT gateway and wide variety of applications and since my agent is set up and my routes are configured I'm ready to connect the robot to the cloud and begin publishing data the agent is currently disabled now to start the flow of data I'll go ahead and enable the agent and now that the agent is enabled our IOT gateway is publishing data and with the help of node-red the data is being routed to a variety of applications and cloud services trending and analytics applications for manufacturing execution and operational intelligence social media services like Twitter so broadcast jobs well done in current quota status and text messages and emails for alerts like robot calibration issues and other problems that may impact production the industrial Internet of Things is about simple internet ready standards-based access to any and all types of data available within an industrial environment with kept server X's IOT gateway we've quickly cloud enabled a robot arm publishing its data to cloud services like text message and email systems no sequel data stores like MongoDB analytics applications like slam data and Splunk and social media platforms like Twitter applications that provide different people in different roles different views of the information based on who they are as individuals in their own interest in the data
