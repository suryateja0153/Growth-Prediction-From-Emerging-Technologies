 I'm sure you're enjoying the picture that I'm proudly displaying here the Golden Gate Bridge painted blue to match our corporate colors but seriously the bridge does have something to do with Internet of Things because it's a lot about building yeah connecting securing bridging and these are all the things that are related to the Internet of Things what is Internet of Things well we all have been living past 10 years through impressive mobile revolution when each and every of us got outfitted with at least one actually soon a dozen devices that are computing and communicating and it seems impressive well there are many billions of us on this planet and the revolution is going into the next phase with like durable smart devices and whatnot as impressive as it seems the next even bigger wave is rolling upon us and that's Internet of Things and that's about adding autonomous devices that compute and communicate without the intervention of a human user without competing to your wallet or even share of attention they connect autonomously they compute autonomously gathering the data from a multitude of sensors with the help of the clouds here they process the data and generate certain actions that automatically fulfilled by various connected actuators and of course because there is no limitation by the human factor there is virtually no limit to the Internet of Things size and scope so that's why we're seeing all those impressive was from analysts who are competing to each other offering the larger the more exciting projection for Internet of Things development 50 billion devices 50 data bytes of data that they will generate that will need to be well communicated analyzed processed and and turned into into actions what is that abide by the way anyone knows how many zeros that is no one cares right everyone knows that's a lot and that's great but how is that development being possible why is it starting or actually continuing today well of course one one this is a factor is the significant drop of course the the the boost and availability of all these components that were discussing here sensors right bandwidth because connectivity is a must for transmitting the data and of course here being here from Intel we pride ourselves on Moore's law basically says about something about doubling the compute power or dropping costs by a factor of two every 18 months so over the past 10 years that translates to 60 fold drop in the cost of computing yeah the propagation the growth of Internet of Things depends on the fulfillment of a whole set of principles and and these developments in affordability of smart devices of connectivity of compute capacity communication capacity certainly contributes to fulfilling these principles the founding one the basic one is actually security through the whole basically life cycle through the whole connectivity cycles for the whole processing cycle through actually everything the ease not only of drawing slides depicting Internet of Things development but really of bringing those billions of devices online and connecting to the cloud so to the data pod since here in a matter of minutes or even seconds it's about yeah ingesting that unbelievable amount of data that's been autonomously connected by all the sensors and actually making sense out of it figuring out what's important what's not what should be passed on to the cloud through the precious even you ever more affordable but ever overloaded bandwidth and then we we realize while Internet of Things is not developing by some in developed by some charity it's actually being developed and deployed by the industry by a whole bunch of for-profit organizations so somewhere actually sooner or later it should generate customer value and it should generate the value for those who provide all those services therefore we believe that it's a part of the set of principles to ensure the development of wanting the other things that we generate and visualize and make fillable the customer value and that we provide the infrastructure for companies organizations to deploy the services and actually get some value a good value in return just as the analysts and experts are bold in naming the huge numbers measuring the potential of the Internet of Things just as much they're careful set in the timeline when these projections will come through come true but 50 billion devices rights awareness that is it by the end of this decade or the next 10 years you will see that data quest IDC and so on a kind of careful around that and and giving in various papers various numbers and that's because of course despite its enormous potential despite the value that it delivers to the customers to the users to do industries the Internet of Things of course facing a whole array of challenges and basically what this slide says about those is that whenever those principles that were listed previously do not occur are not met well then we have a challenge so starting with the founding element security right of course the concerns about privacy about the security about increased vulnerability of the device of the things as they become in smart so computing and connected about compliance through the increasing increasingly growing array of standards and regulations is it's very quickly named as number one concerned whenever we are talking about practical deployment of some smart solution it's also the clash of cultures as operational technology so technology of operating things meet information technology technology of operating and and and running on data connectivity we'll talk about that that's of course we are great with a connect and compute well not as easy right with the connectivity challenges underutilized data yeah but those zettabytes regardless how many zeroes very frequently the value that gets that gets extracted out of the data is a single zero or many zeros but no one so making sense out of data put in place the algorithms that extract write data analyze write data it's always been a challenge when a human was doing that right with Google or whatever it's even more challenging for for a device to do so and then of course as always when we're talking about something is propagating across the industry across the world it's the challenge related to interoperability and standards one challenge that I actually wanted to dig into is the the phenomena that's actually related to to the fact that we're now talking about things and industries each industry has grown historically its own sets of yeah standards devices operational rules and so on that basically have mandated that the smart computing can connecting solutions that emerging for these industries unnecessarily specialized photo for those industries so even at the conference like this one right we were hearing very interesting insightful messages updates about particular segments of Internet of Things this is what happened in smart home this is what our company is offering to smart factories this is our smart mobility solution of course there are there is a strong drive in the industry to connect those islands of development right there for example the area of smart cities definitely involves most smart mobility smart car smart energy smart government right government and so on so just as much for the technology to be successful in the era of Internet of Things we believe that it should develop towards producing a larger share of horizontal so usable across all those segments elements both hardware and software components right we see that the threshold of basically successful deployment across segments is somewhere around 60 to 70% of horizontally interchangeable usable across segments technologies so that again I start with security that security model security implementations that are a common across multiple segments manageability data extraction data analysis API management of course very important by definition supports this reusability technologies such as distributed computation zone and of course coming from the organization that primarily works with developers developer tools technologies building blocks middleware that applicable applicable across segments and so magnify the return on investment that I put into developing every particular solution so they need this need for horizontal ization is what drives the vision and value proposition that we had Intel together with numerous partners at the industry are developing around IOT platform we believe as in the center of this slide that it should contain reusable building blocks yeah of course for faster time-to-market and every particular segment and also for greater ROI because it will be a return will be growing across multiple segments but investment the investment yet summarized across this segments at the same time actionable that's about using those underutilized data sources and of course I already mentioned it's not just us it's a multitude of our partners so it's a secure open scalable open to collaboration such our IT platform will offer those capabilities that are necessary to well if not completely remove but certainly alleviate the the challenges and fulfill the principles of successful IOT development easy connectivity across the devices the devices that are secure and manageable the data that's gettin analyzed rather than just wasted and exposed to the youtubes now the human operators users in the most meaningful way actually the crown of good analytics is the predictability when we can well not only observe what's what's happening but we can also predict things happening in the future for example can predict when this very hard to reach wind turbine somewhere in an RC will require maintenance so that we do it on time and prevent it actually going offline and requiring major investment to repair or replace you know so just an example since all these parameters from connectivity to predictability will need to be delivered by these smart platforms all at the same time of course we need a right level of performance so everything from the smallest sensor out there and to the thickest compute farm providing this analytics and predictions perform at the right level therefore we little always highlight the need to optimize both hardware and software platforms to deliver this level of performance that actually makes the magic happen let me skip the slide I mean we talked a lot about successful customer journey and all the cycle from development deployment manageability optimization relation to show this next next nice picture that actually symbolizes the successfully deployed IT platform basically as a reference model here but we'll see how we fill it with concrete content it starts here on the left with a whole array of connected yeah devices both a gathering data and actuators acting upon the results of all the data analysis and predictions a very important role is played here by the gateways just SEC we'll talk about that a little more depth to make sure that all computing communication data gathering are lytx that needs to happen on the edge so before the before the data gets into the pipe and and travels to the cloud that it does happen and happens in the right way and of course once we reach the cloud that's where the data all zettabytes of it turns into actionable insights but that's not the end of the story as we know we need the economy to work in this picture as well they for with Intel together with our partners offers a range of technologies and that's on the right edge of this diagram to easily connect but offer services around smart devices and and data that they produce and the data analysis and then interconnect those services and create the the offerings on top and then monetize those offerings here is a more formal diagram of in Tulare platform as a reference model again filled in all of its years with concrete product offerings from from Intel and from numerous partners on the edge again we see the array of sensors controlled and connected via gateways and then once the data travels through the pipe which is also actually should be highlighted here in a big way because the pipe itself and connectivity protocols you see a whole multitude of them is an important ear off of any IOT platform and then goes into in the cloud back-end processing the whole way to the treating data as a service and that's of course performed by today by multitude of web api's connecting the Web API so that's where Intel mastery for example technology offers very good solution and service our castration such as offered by opponent so all the all the range from the smallest sensor to the most sophisticated cloud analysis and valued service is a part of this model and and similar to plays together let us focus on what I already emphasized couple times on this gate weight here inside the the HTM before we go to the next slide just notice the the Coulomb of various connectivity technologists and protocols listed there right Wi-Fi Bluetooth of course various flavors of those a whole array of cell technologies ZigBee z-wave and so on well that's great that they all these connectivity protocols exist but how can we all use them and actually connect with them in a device that by definition should be very small low-power autonomous this challenge is addressed by an IOT gateway yeah so that's basically an interface device that exactly resolves this challenge of communicating but the whole array of various but a whole array of sensors and actuators connected by various protocols and technologies supporting a whole range of those that's of course not only the kind of dumb translator of protocols but also a compute device that adds again let me start with security features yeah manageability data encryption and so on but also a tremendous value by already performing smart functions on the edge so before we send the data into the pipe and to the cloud such as local data analytics or selecting the right data or aggregating the data producing this even predictive analytics being smart but using the energy and switching things on and off providing local storage and so on so by deploying this gateway devices on edge we not only solve the connectivity problem but also already deliver a good share of IT services even before we hit the pipe and and went to the cloud that's kind of a whole list of things for Gateway to do but adentro will say there is actually one most one role that the Gateway Arch the Gateway plays it's connecting the 85% 85% of what what it turns out that today whatever the grand vision of IT today 85 percent of devices deployed and factories transportation cities and so on are not connected not even among themselves leave alone to the to the cloud and to the internet right so that's a huge Greenfield in in front of us to to get those devices connected to get that data extracted analyzed processed and acted upon that is by our observation in many practical projects and deployments is the frontier line of Internet of Things today connecting the unconnected 85% well we wouldn't be Intel if we stopped here at reference model software stacks and yeah of course a whole range of nicely packaged gateways that we started offering two years ago we of course went further up or down with a point of view and offering arrange new actually families of CPUs of chips to power power the gateways and smart devices that includes our smallest CPU Intel technology CPU up to date in tow quark it goes not only into a range of entry-level IC gateways but also into these nice Intel Galileo board today already and second version of that that is fully compatible with Arduino and so allows not only professional developers and and those industrial companies who are the established players and Internet of Things playground but also each and every of us every developer student in high school student to start create smart devices to start testing i will teach technologies for themselves just using this open connectivity hardware provided by arduino connectivity and a whole world of software that's in tow comparable so x86 compatible right including of course a whole body of open source software that runs on this Galileo board a slightly higher class of CPUs that were launched for smart gateways and smart devices wearable devices as well as I mentioned is and Intel Edison that's already more solid compute machine connectivity machine with two very capable atom cores and an additional core plane role of a real-time a microcontroller and as you would expect not only we have a range of professional products with that a chip but also an Arduino compatible development board and we are proudly displaying several of those actually several creations based on such boards at our Expo booths right there and I think inside my colleague will also show us a little demo here but you'll see if you could join me on stage so what you see here is similar to a demo to what you see here outside at our booth we do have Edison here and there is temperature sensor connected here to this heat lamp I controlled here the heat lamp by my mobile phone I could also I also have it here on in the browser if you yes I could also control it here with an Edison which is here use just and powered only by a battery pack and while communicating over that's a small Edison development board without of course Arduino connectivity mechanically but same capabilities yep mhm can you oh yeah it's already here okay and I think you have to go Oh - really we refresh - that the page okay and here it streams the data to the Internet to the clouds and it also sent some messages and alarms and at a certain temperature it gets an actuator event and well the LED will start blinking well the latency is too high we would have to wait too long it takes some minutes until the event comes so you shouldn't use it for real-time purposes but it's just here to demo it I think you need to refresh the page you have to refresh the page I think okay okay and now if you go to now I can control just like you did from your phone because of course what were demonstrating here is that little Edison power device here connected to the cloud and from our user interface side Matthias was his smartphone me with the browser connect to the same cloud and through the app can control the device and can watch the data being collected from from that device and analyzed okay visualized in this case of course simple temperature graph in the cloud as well there would be nothing special and that's definitely not a rocket science technology what's impressive about that the whole thing was created in 30 minutes not by us with my tears by one but by one of the participants of our hackathons just using the Edison are doing a compatible development board and the software building blocks to quickly and easily connect to the cloud and return to my slides connect to the cloud and create a real functionable IOT solutions with all attributes smart sensors smart gateway cloud connectivity and analytics in the cloud and even user interface here this is these are these building blocks that we provide as kind of reference model for development boards both Edison and Galileo powered as you see there is no rocket science here either that's just your regular vanilla Linux but your to distribution from lino from Intel that are freely configurable so you can build your own distro for your creature creation if you if you don't want to use our reference a library layer that provides convenient bindings to all the i/o interfaces of the board and supports a whole lineup of execution environments and programming tools there are also open source based or standard Linux things here in your files you will find summary of development options that such boards offer as you see that's the whole spectrum there just again your plain open-source x86 compatible Linux software including by the way for diehards are doing offense okay are do you know is there if that's enough for you but you can go all all the way to actually we see that happen in real life to professional developments and products using C C++ for the clips or anything in between if you are scripting fan or coming from the app world then JavaScript Python Java are also options and even for novices were successfully using several visual kind of intuitive programming environments in this case provided by a company called boolean and very very nice thing we invite you to to visit the software in token flash' it is light to get more details on those options for developers there is also an electronic invitation there to attend our as I mentioned hackathons roadshows so if you click here you will for example find out that the next Roach IT Roadshow taking place in Berlin next month where you're actually getting an development board powered by Edison or Galileo set of sensors to to get you started and get your creativity going and then creating those cool devices and connecting them to the cloud okay that's the array of sensors you are getting so I'd like to wrap up by observing the fact that I would see is not only about converting the legacy world a few centralized computer devices and unconnected machinery out out there replacing it by billions connected devices but also about opening this world to the millions of new developers of course from professionals but all the way down to high school kids or even kindergarten kids that unlocks probably the most important success factor of IT human creativity thank you very much
