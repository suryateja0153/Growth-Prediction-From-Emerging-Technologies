 there are many devices out there that cannot directly connect to the what's now T platform Saturn an IP enabled devices communicate over other communication protocols magnetic B Bluetooth foreign ocean the concept of gateways was introduced to enable these devices for the Watson IOT platform let's take a look at an example in a smart home there are various sensors installed a gateway acts as a proxy between the devices and the Watson IOT platform the gateway is allowed to send data on behalf of devices behind the Gateway and receive commands for these devices the Gateway also allows device management actions like reboot or firmware update on the device behind the Gateway so let's have a look at how you create and connect a gateway in the Watson IOT platform after the Gateway is connected we will see how ok they can reduce the devices and send data on behalf of a device finally I'll show you how device management operation can be done you start by logging into the IBM bluemix platform in the catalogue of services you find the IOT platform service create your own IOT service and launch the dashboard now let's see the dashboard let's register our gateway first you have to create a gateway device type then you can register the gateway itself as the Gator is registered you can using the client ID starting with a G and authentication token as a password in the end of this video you will find a link you had sample code that you can use when your gateway is connected click on the Gateway and the detailed view of this gateway is provided here you can find what sensor data the Gateway is sending Agata can register devices behind decatur using two modes the manual and the automatic registration mode in the manual mode the gateway creates the device first using the REST API then it acts as a proxy for this device in the automatic mode the gateway does not have to first create a device but can start to publish data on behalf of another device if the device does not exist yet in the what's natty platform the device is automatically created they publish a sensor data on a topic of the corresponding device a gateway can also subscribe to the command topic of a specific device behind the Gateway let's have a look which divides the gateway has created in the meantime here you see an outdoor temperature sensor that was added by the gateway in the Gateway since the current temperature and humidity up to the platform in the details view of the device you see the gateway or which the device is connected to the platform now let's have a look at the device management operation for a gateway all the devices behind the gateway in order for a device to be manageable a management request for the specific device must be published by the gateway a response to the manage request system returned based on a payload of the manage requests device actions and firmware actions can be triggered from you note of the corresponding device every device management action is initiated on a platform UI or by a REST API call let's have a look at the device management action reboot after initialization of a reboot request the device management server publishes on a repo topic of the corresponding device the request to reboot as the Gateway is subscribed to this topic into receives tick message and provides a response to the device management server the Gateway translates the reboot request to the corresponding device after the device has rebooted it connects to the Gateway which transcends a managed request to the device management server this was a short game off the k2 in the what's nutty platformer you can find further reference materials in the following links
