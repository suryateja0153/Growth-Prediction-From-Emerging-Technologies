 introducing my devices Cayenne the world's first dragon off IOT project filter here we're going to show you how it works here's our cloud hosted online dashboard we've also built the iOS app and an Android app what we've accomplished is we've created what would take companies developers and makers months to create and we shrunk it down and put it into minutes there is no specific training required any year at any level of proficiency can come into our platform we have a very easy add device process whether it's an actuator extension a sensor a pulse width modulator whether that sensors for temperature motion distance or pressure you just select the sensor you want and give it a name select the widget and icon for the beginner user we offer tutorials on how to connect that hardware and for the advanced user we link to the technical data sheet where they can get all the specs for that hardware now we're going to head back to the main dashboard we'll also have access to a remote GPIO board you can also control all your hardware what we'll see next is our advanced rules engine or what we refer to as trigger logic if device a temperature goes above or below a certain threshold here in 1096 degrees you perform a specified action on device B whether it be to turn on a fan or motor or use our notification engine to send text messages or emails here's the trigger in action if light dimmer is turned on to a certain threshold then turn on length then the lamp points to a luminosity sensor that detects light when luminosity reading hits that determined threshold then turn on the fan when the fan turns on send me a text message now back to the app we will see all the widgets of everything that's connected so next what we're going to do is show you a video feed side-by-side now observe the feed I move the slider to turn on the LED that will turn on the lens now you will see the luminosity sensor reading go up to 1088 the fan will then turn on also notice on the app the widgets will automatically update to the state of the device so now you see that the sensor family it is on now I grab my cell phone where I'm at schedule trigger text message and there it is start building for free at Cayenne my device is calm
