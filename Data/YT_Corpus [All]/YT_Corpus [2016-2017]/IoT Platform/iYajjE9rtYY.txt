 hey guys they can hear me okay I'm on thanks for coming and it's just announced my name is Olivier there's an eye in between the V and the E that's a French version for Oliver you can call me Oliver if you want and a program manager at Microsoft and I look after all the developer SDKs for azure IOT people know what i OT e is about come on okay so everyone has his own interpretation definition whatever I'm not going to go through that I'm gonna save you the slide with this it's gonna be like 26 billion devices by 2020 you all know that what I wanted to do during this like 45 minutes is to give you a glance of what we have at Microsoft when it comes to IOT on their service side of things and how that applies to devices and mobile devices as well what I would like as well is that at the end of the session you eventually have to have tons of questions for me and I asked questions for you as well in terms of where you as mobile developers think we should go when it comes to SDKs for azure IOT services that make sense so you have my Twitter account here same thing for my email address or block at Microsoft to come something doesn't work on Azure eyes decay on the IOT as the case they may blame me happy to help while I will not go through the famous slices like that many billion devices what I want to do in the first few slides here is kind of explain what we think is the problem with IOT and how asher is trying to offer solutions for that and the first thing i want to talk about real quick is the fact that we see a market where people are trying to connect anything's to the cloud we're talking connected buildings we're talking connected cars connected fridges you name it and actually we're talking about really anything from industrial tomato consumer devices and so forth so that's the first problem that we're looking at from the IOT perspective and from the devices to be connected to the clouds perspective how do we we address these various types of devices form factors and and so forth and actually we also have some weird devices and I like to have a small list of things you cannot imagine exist out there you all heard I guess about you know the idea of controlling your coffee machine using your phone now you can also have connected bottles not sure exactly why but you can do that you can order your products directly from your machines using the Amazon button and you guess what that is that is a smart pillow it will actually tell you when to turn around not to get sunburned chopsticks smarts chopstick that actually are connected and are able to analyze the food you're eating so before putting in your mouse wait a couple seconds get the notification you can eat that and then you can eat a smart barbecue a smart grill right so you can know exactly when your meat is cooked and the connected cow you heard about that so these are some example of these anything's right connecting any type of things gathering data up to the cloud analyze that and eventually control the devices from the cloud that also means everything's and want I mean everything's I mean all devices and new devices customers they want to clarify or connect existing Hardware existing devices if you're a vending machine operator you don't want to redeploy vending machines you want to make sure that you can enhance or modify the existing machines for them to connect right so you need to be able to kind of upgrade your existing stuff and obviously we as a service also need to support new stuff new development languages new platforms in the IOT space and so forth and when I say platforms I actually include everything from tiny microcontrollers all the way up to big gateways running full OS eventually in the cloud so that's another big challenge how do you address tiny tiny things the same way you would address the big ones and you have very scenarios he's a device directly connected going through a gateway should that great we actually declare all the sensor devices as unique devices should he should it aggregate everything should you have some smarts down on the Gateway or everything in the cloud all these questions and trying to play the other one is everyone these days is running for a cloud for IOT I want to be a cloud for IOT solution I want the customers doing IOT and connecting these 26 billion devices to come to my cloud in my platform and as I'm sure I have to say I do one customers to come to my platform but these platforms are coming in to life these days like every day there's a new cloud offer for IOT and so it's something we think is really important from our perspective is to address this cloud to cloud mechanism if a cloud IOT offer is really good at something like for example doing device management and customers are adopting that but they cannot scale for doing smart analytics and machine learning because that cloud solution doesn't scale then how about connecting both of these cloud solutions together and offer customers something that they really need so this is the other part of the problem after there any type of devices we have all these type of devices we need to cover and all these devices actually they talk different languages so we need to consider how to address that talking see that talking c-sharp this one node what not so as a company we need to be careful about that and not just look at the big market and say go like all the devices and Yankees face they're running C or 90% so I'm just gonna do C we cannot do that we really have to look at the trends and understand all the languages that are used out there and understand what kind of audience we're talking to and so forth the other thing is and it's kind of big these days in in the communication discussions around IOT is the communication protocols there are standards out there people are betting on some people are betting on other ones didn't qtt is it gonna win is it should appear as is HTTP - is it aim QP is a co-op we need to look at the market and make sure that the options are available and I eventually were not down to a single of them that wouldn't be a nice IOT present station without security and these are the things we're trying to address on the azure IOT side of things privacy access control authentication encryption I'm not gonna dive into details here you have a rough idea we need to make sure the devices are connected in a safe way that the data goes from device to cloud and cloud to device and is safe in a secure way prevent the attack like men and mil tax and all these kind of things all that kept in mind also the fact that we're talking about tiny devices very often so how do these tiny devices support encryption support security and so forth is a tough question and we are trying to address these questions so here is what we offer at Microsoft for a variety services so first of all you might know that anyone has been working with Azure in general storage or something else mmm good portion of you so yeah anyone working with AWS services the other half nice so so basically same thing a bunch of services for you to aggregate each of these services there specialize into doing something right storing data in a certain way doing you know real-time analytics doing big data storage things and so forth so we have all of these you can connect external services the one service I want to focus on and talk about later in that presentation is azure IOT hub which is as its as its name indicates which is the cloud gateway for devices devices will authenticate and connect and send data and receive commands from azure IOT hub and you'll see how and you'll see how you can benefit from these SDKs that I'm going to show you so you have that notion of box of Lego's right bunch of services I'm gonna aggregate them and build an IOT solution but we know it's not easy so we are also offering something we call the azure IOT suite so the suite is a bundle of services and it's actually presented in the form of what we call the pre-configured solutions well you have a choice between today two that we're going to extend the the options to solutions today there's remote monitor predictive maintenance we're bringing asset management soon these are kind of the generic patterns that we're seeing in the market today especially in industrial automation market that we targeted first and you'll see in the minute how easy it is using one of these pre-configured solution to have something running up and running in a few minutes that allows you to do all from connecting a device to doing smart analytics presenting data in a dashboard and taking action on the data in these Suites you really need to think about them as a boilerplate for you to build your own IOT solutions why this is not a SAS offering this is still a platform as a service offering the idea is to pre aggregate pre-configure set of services for you because that's definitely not easy because that's what it looks like once it's all put together right so you have various types of services and this is just an example of one of these pre-configured solutions so you have the devices on one side you have azure IOT hub that ingest data from the services you have services like stream analytics they're able to do real-time analytics on data I get data from an input I do some sorting on it I filter i compute averages maxes whatever in in a sequel format sequel query formats and then I push it somewhere in the case of our remote monitoring solution we'll push to a blob storage to actually have the real data to be consumed by some web dashboard and then we also push to oil call Atlanta hub then hub is a very high throughput service allows you to take data and boom send you somewhere else with a buffer that he came control and then we have web shops that will do some work on these data coming from that event hub show that on a dashboard in the web using power bi controls we have dog TB in the back in order to add metadata on top of devices and do some sort of device management and then eventually you can use logic apps to trigger actions in another application and other solutions erm seeing these kind of things right you want to trigger on animate and maintenance ticket creation somewhere you can do that using logic apps all of that secured using Azure Active Directory so this is the big you ate everything Microsoft solution and this is you know an example how to do that if you are used to working with some open source solution that are out there to do IOT like look at all the Apache storm and all the other projects that are out there you can run them there and take and replace if you want to replace criminal attics with storm no problem just take it out replace with storm if you want to use your own you know big data solution and to poor not like you can do that or your actually supports all these services as well this is definitely once again an example of a solution for you to get started with so this is kind of a you know hey what does it mean how do I get started and and and this is exactly what we're going to talk about so you can start from one of these pre-configured solutions and you'll see it's easy but you can also do your own thing right aggregate these things on your own the recommendation that I would give you is to start from one of these starting points here the first one is look at our Ajay Ortiz targets we just released and build a series of kits hard work it's simple kits things that makers would use and sometimes individual industrial automation manufacturers the idea of this kits is to get you started in about twenty minutes having a device talking to an IOT suite to remote monitoring solution so the pre deployed one or do it yourself as in my create my own set of services that do something very simple to analyze data from a real device and take action so these starter kits are definitely a great starting point for you the second one is a set of samples we have end-to-end samples that we are publishing this is all open source if you are building your own IOT solution using azure IOT please feel free to submit a new sample I'll be more than happy to integrate that into our repositories so you can look at the eggroll ms azure IOT samples link there's plenty of things here and there's something else you're going to see soon as well we have also bunch of certified platforms we have something like 75 of them which is hardware platforms that have been certified to run with azure IOT which also are a very good starting point for you I'll share the slides after well through the evolve sign an app so you'll be able to get all these links you can also start from scratch scratch scratch write if you're one of these guys don't want to use a sample the only use starter kit don't want to use a pre-configured solution knock yourself out go to the portal for as you're creating a new IOT hub you'll see in a second how to do that you can use arm templates which are the azure resource manager templates allows you to deploy a set of services with a few command lines and you can visit our eyes your eye ot SDKs for resources right as in actual eyes decays and bunch of samples and so on so when it comes to the SDKs and tools and this is where it becomes interesting for you developers what do we have in stock so first when you build an IT solution is not just about connecting a device and ingesting data it's about all the rest also right so storing the data doing the analytics and so on so we have bunch of azure as the case for that most of them are what all of them support c-sharp for sure I can embed that most of them support Java lots of support Python so well you're a c-sharp so you you care about c-sharp but we do have a bunch of other options lots of note as well when it comes to you as your IOT hub which is that part I'm going to focus on today we have two types of SDKs all open source on github and these ones are on one side to connect data from devices into the into Azure and that's what I call a device client as the case so we have seen JavaScript Java c-sharp Python today extending the the support based on customer demands and the one I'm going to show you today is C sharp since build we have a PCL library allows you to use our stuff onto on top exam ring you're kind of lucky I've been asked like week ago hey can we can we have an azure Archie presentation examiner involves like yeah sure can I talk about everything yeah it better if you talk about seashores Emery support like just one week old I'm curious to see how can I go so what you'll see what we have in stock I'm sure you guys will have plenty of opinions on what to do what not to do how to change thing and so forth once again open source libraries send an issue send me an email if you have an idea after that presentation about how things should go on our side I'm like wide open and really want to get your input the second type of SDK which is the one I'm actually think you might be as much interested as the first one so having examined device become you know a IOT device basically contributing its sensors data into an IT solution is one thing the other thing I'm thinking that you might be interested in is actually managing the IOT solution from a dashboard on a mobile device or tablet right so basically being able to look at all the devices are connected have a look at the data they're sending sending commands back to the device enabling disabling a device and things like that so I'm I'm thinking that you might be as well interested in that area as much as in having a examine device sending data to IOT hub the bad news is that we don't yet have the PCL library for that kind of SDK will you have a c-sharp library but we've not done the work of making sure it runs at a PCL or within exam range so if you guys give it a try and you make it work let us know you might be faster than us we're definitely are planning to have a PCL version of that c-sharp service client sdk real soon and if you tell me to use less we won't do it but I guess you will not say that when it comes to devices we do have all these SDKs open source but you might not want you have to recompile everything if you're a C developer that's something maybe it'd be painful so what we're trying to do is actually provide packages like nougat packages in particular for you to not have to clone the full repo of the SDKs compile that get the binary or whatever and then use it in your project so in that case nougat you'll see how to you it's yours pretty straightforward at the nougat package using statement off you go a few api's and you can have a device talking to ID hub that's definitely something very important in a way we're developing our SDKs the pre-configured solutions back to their notion of IOT suite pre-configured bundle of solution or services all these are open source at all levels a configuration of the arm template to deploy everything the website dashboard the various code that runs into services the queries for the stream a latex jobs and things like that everything is open-source as well for you to look into for you to customize for building your own IOT solution last but not least couple tools that's an area that actually you might also be interested when you're developing for IOT especially if you're a device developer there's one thing you want to test is a is my device talking to my cloud and then if you are developing the cloud solution you want to say hey does my cloud solution work when I test with these kind of devices and I want to simulate the devices and so forth so we want to have tool that allows you to do both things like similar devices for testing cloud services but also having tools that monitor what's going on on devices validate that your code on device is running well so we have two tools today one which is a cross-platform tool based on node which is kawaii hub Explorer another one which today is a c-sharp application running only on Windows confer action guys if you want to help us having nets running as a as examining app on other things than just windows are more than open to that actually willing to make that happen I think I'm gonna have come down tomorrow around here so that's called device Explorer you'll see the the pure dotnet version running on my machine today but you'll can definitely imagine that be coming real soon examiner in applique with or without your help we'll make it happen I would love for that to be something we work on together as you know examining community and and our team focusing more on the services and and and with that I want to show you some demos and so the first thing I want to show you real quick is azure IOT sweet sorry and to do that I'm gonna go to the azure itea sweet portal so that's azure IOT sweet calm alright this is the landing page for your all your IOT suite solutions you'll see a bunch in there you're actually I'm logging in with a mic Microsoft account you'll see a bunch of solutions from my colleague doing demos during actual work I hope there's no specific name that will actually lead you to think we're doing something stupid so that's good nothing magic in it the way you're gonna create in your eye you to suite solution is as simple as well first you have to have an azure account right if you don't have an azure account you can create a trial subscription and try all that as well for free but then you need to have an azure account you could you as your to the comm you log in and then you're here to create a new solution and in there you have these two options that we're talking about remote monitoring and predictive maintenance and if I can't know okay I'm gonna select remote monitoring in that case and what its gonna do is gonna ask me for a name it's going to ask me for a region so our services are available in all these regions today right and we're extending yeah so we have basically most of them or here today that means that actually when you deploy your solution you have to care about you know redundancy and so on we take care of that for you and you pick a subscription if you're like me you have several and here you have the list of the services that will be deployed I want you to keep in mind something if you do start playing with our IT suite especially if it's for your own maker home project beware this is pinning up pretty much high and type of services because this is aiming at industrial automation customers we're actually willing to taste to test things at scale right so we have a way of billing for the services based on tiers and each of these tiers have specific limitations so here you see a GRT hub which is the data ingestion so we're doing the high frequency unit which might cost you money right on a monthly basis you deploy that we have a free tier so if you're doing your own home project use the free tier like go back in there change the tearing and so on on your on your settings so if you do our UT sweet be careful that this is gonna cost you money after some time the good thing is that if you try out with a trial subscription you have a a budget I don't remember I think it's a hundred dollars but it can run through in terms of consumption before you know you can do anything else and have to buy so that's something that gives you a chance to try out if you do the dude' yourself solution following the samples it can go is pretty much everything free and you know have your own home project for opening your garage door or things like that for free and then I would hit the create solution takes about seven ten minutes to deploy everything so I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna do actually open an existing solution let me go back to my home and I'm gonna start my solution which is called Olevia remote monitoring so it's used it's using active the active directory to login into manage security so I just logged in and here you have the basic dashboard for remote monitoring and I just I don't want to go into too many details but at a high level it gives you you know a telemetry history you see actual real time data from devices you see the geolocation of a device you can list the devices that are registered into my suite solution you can set rules in order to have things triggered when something happens on the data like temperature data goes above a certain threshold and I want to do something after that and so forth so that that gives you an idea of what is there by default and if you are for example once again to my example of the vending machine guy you can't only think of that at being your starting point for your project you do have the visibility on all the devices let me actually bring them up so all these devices you can have a bunch of metadata information about these devices about this state and so on you can actually see the real-time data on the dashboard lay for the temperature which is the expected temperature the actual temperature the external temperature and then you can actually make your decisions of like hey that one has a problem with temperature is actually going up shouldn't let me trigger you know a an action in my line of business application and create a ticket into matically and so on you can do that from here so you don't see any data coming up here and the reason why is because the sample device that I hear is shut down because I don't want it to spend money so but let's actually start an actual device I have a uwp app so I didn't have time this morning to port examine my dad but you should be pretty familiar with the way things are going so let me actually project my phone screen and like it's actually for that to be here allow that and start the app so this is a very simple app allows me to connect the device securely so once again I was secure I was saying I was talking about security here I have a device I've been adding a new device it has its own connection information with a device name and an authentication key so these have been generated by the suite and by IOT hub in particular and I'll be able to then you know connect my device connect the guy and once it's connected start sending data and here I'm gonna switch to this guy and I'm gonna start saying my world data coming from my real device which are basically sliders here there's a little latency so here here we go we have that it's running it's sending data pretty straightforward in terms off using what are you just saying the code for the uwp app is a sample which is on github so you can look at that but what we're going to do right now is actually look closer into the service ID hub which is beyond behind the society suite solution and how to build code using some rain for connecting an actual device to IOT hub so this gives you the final point I want to go to it right so this is imagine this is your solution I want to do that let me actually disk the construct that little and show you how to do that at a lower level so I'm gonna go to the portal to the azure portal and what I'm gonna do is show you how to create in your azure IOT hub instance on the portal to the left you have this big plus button I'm gonna add a service as soon as the portal is live yes plus and in there I can look for in Internet of Things the service call as your IOT hub if I go too fast you have questions just interrupt me and this is something I'm gonna call evolve demo and I was talking about tiers so you have to select at this point which tier you want to use and you start seeing like the limits that you have on each of them so here we have the free tier I cannot use that anymore because you can't have only one person scription will allow me to send 8,000 messages per day just isn't right if you like break it down to to a number of messages per second I will not do the math but you can imagine how many messages you can send for the free tier and for most of the home projects or not it's plenty enough otherwise you have the other ones which are you know the s1 or s2 and basically these ones like look at things like 400k messages per unit and per day and other ones like 6 million for that the other one you can definitely then scale have several units into a single IOT hub instance and go to billions of devices real fast we still have to see who wants to do that was billions anyways so I have my new name for my IT hub I select the number of units just one I have a number of partitions so the partition is an ocean for when you read out of the of the IT hub this is not something I'm gonna drill in today because we want to make it simple for you I'm gonna pick a resource group or in that case actually create a new one so resource groups is a way an azure to gather a set of services together so you can manage them delete them see them at once versus having to go through the portal if you're like me and have tons of services so let me call that evolved demo I'm creating net subscription and I hit create I'm gonna take a minute or two to create that but you get the idea there's a way you create a new IOT hub the next thing you're gonna have to do I'm switching to one already deployed I don't know how much time it's going to take usually it's one or two minutes but it can take like more I have an IOT hub that's been deployed there and what I can see from here is it's the actual consumption I can also see the list of devices that have been created so we have this notion of a device registry for for IOT hub allows you to create new device identities and key pairs and this is exactly what the device registry is about then you have this huge list of things that can get to millions of devices and now you know that devices are allowed to connect and the next thing you need to do is actually grab these key value pairs in order to provision your device for it to connect to IOT hub so here what I'm gonna do is actually go and check out the connection string for my IOT hub so this is the one that allows me to manage the IT hub I'm copying that connection string and I'm gonna start this little tool that we call device Explorer so this is the one I need your help guys to change into something more decent using xamarin and forms and run on a mobile device rather than just plain Windows I'm actually connecting that tool to IOT hub instance and from that tool I'm able to do bunch of things including listing the existing devices that have been created I can create a new one I'm gonna call that evolve whatever it doesn't matter and I can you know just add this device identity into my collection of devices up here it is and what I'm going to do is copy that connection string for later and then I will be able to monitor the data and so forth but for the sake of time because time is just flying I'm going to start Visual Studio now and what I want to do is show you real quick how to create exam or an app that talks to IOT hub using our SDK and the PC elaborate and I mentioned earlier just realize that okay I'll be here why so let me get a new project obviously you can do that from summer in studio if you prefer I'm going to start like you don't care like native I didn't have time to play with the forms just got the book yesterday like you and I've not studied enough so there you have a forms demo for the sake of today's theme I don't think it's a big deal these are just the basics once again I'm gonna be publishing all of that on github so you can definitely just count on the fact that you can just reuse that code and the next thing obviously is to good to nigut and search for something called you know I'm gonna need to connect this guy as well if I wanna run examine in iOS yep is it on hello so one find a way to get it like faster here yeah there you go so I'm going to look for Microsoft of a sure the devices that client PCL alright so that library here we've been pushing onto nougat will allow you to get all the simple API for you to connect the device to 80 hub send messages receive messages three AP is I think it should be fine we really want to make it super simple on a device development side of things so I am actually installing all these guys here it's so little and what I can do immediately is start working on the portable class here I'm gonna as add the using statement yes except trying to make up for the time okay sure working the background devices client and think I think I'm all right here and then the next action is basically to add a device client object which will be your divine the IT Help device you know thingy and in the in my portable class what I'm gonna do is actually initialize that by creating that client and the client what he needs is basically a connection string that I had before so let me do that connection string that's gonna be my constructor you'll see why in a second and that's pretty much it so here I have created an instance of my device client on the device and what I want to add is a function to add you know to send a message so this is how the function looks like I'm creating a new message and I'm needing these guys here and then I do a send event async for sending that message so again pretty straightforward I need to add the using statements for these guys another thing I'm gonna add is a way to listen for messages back from IOT hub see how that works and in there I'm gonna add this code here so I'm creating a task we're doing that in a pooling mode which is not good and the reason why we're doing that is because we've not implemented protocols like AMQP or mqtt on the PCO library yet that will allow to have a bi-directional connection with the device so today it's HTTP so you have to pull for getting a message from the client on the device and once again here I'm doing that little encoding thing and I should be good to go oops sorry it's not what I wanted I wanted to build that class so you see very simple I create an instance of that device client object I then have a function for sending and I have a function for receiving pretty straightforward let me go into my Android code and into the main activity here so as you might imagine what I'm gonna do is basically create an instance of myclass and I'm gonna do that here boom like that and I have to add the connection string and if it's still in my yes still there so here I have a connection string that is actually basically the way I provision my device for you to know where it's going to connect to and what are its credentials so provisioning manually you might ask like this not super secure it's hard-coded not good so we have ways to do that in a better way and I'm not showing that today because we don't have time so the next thing I want to do here is obviously though this thing is initialized so I guess I don't have much to do it's just like sending a message right so let me do that here code snippet and I'm gonna call the send message and this is the one function send message and in there I'm gonna say message number blah right from the vise which is a droid that's the Detroit application if I'm good I should have everything in there and I want to pick this guy here to start the Android simulator I'm using the exam ring player so I kind of like when it works and I will be deploying an application be a list like very simple just using the default you know hello world button there to send data up to my dear friend IOT hub in the meantime what I'm gonna do here is look at the device no come on yes and evolve them out and I'm gonna say hey monitor the events to see what's going on the app is starting deploying and we have seven more minutes I want to leave some time for Q&A at the end that's why I'm going a bit fast hello any questions in the meantime well it's actually thinking about it okay too late no questions so now I can just start sending data and you see boom in my oh it's on an app on my PC but basically the app is monitoring the IOT hub service right and so I see messages coming up into the cloud from the examiner and application with three lines of code but more good snippets but we imagine like creating the device client instance initializing it with the connection string sending a message and you've seen the receive message which is one function as well and I'm going to show you what happens if I have this device hello from evolve sand and here I should have that writing boom hello evolve because I had these nice debug write line in my code I can do that in iOS I don't think there's much interest apart from showing the new iOS simulator showing on Windows but basically what I would like to do right now is give some time for some questions unless you don't have questions and I show you another demo all right demos questions no demos they have not seen enough and I understand that so let me show you real quick another thing which is called connect the dots that we have that project that I created some buddies of mine a year and a half ago that I'm actually working on updating to IOT hub and that projects a connected us of i/o gives you a basic solution for you to start sending data to IOT hub which is not the IOT suite so basically Korea on ITF service website a couple of other services very easily so that it doesn't cost you too much and you can actually start playing around and customize to build your own garage door opening when what I have here as well is a small Arduino board that sends data over a serial connection and I have a doulton an application still to be ported to exam rain I know I'm bad but you guys can imagine that running on something else it's actually the same code running on mono on a Raspberry Pi but I'm gonna run it on my PC here just for the sake of the demo once again and this is this guy like I'm a store is an admin and what this little thing does very simply is sending data to IT hub for it to be displayed in a website so connected also the i/o is the code and if you look at the actual website you will have this kind of thing or basically in a couple clicks you can deploy that a cup of command lines actually can deploy the website and I have my monitor for my temperature and humidity if I blow on this guy I will see it going up and a matter of fact I if I'm not wrong and if it's working I might be able to run that in there as well so let me actually unlock this guy let me not care about this and I have examine little application here now allow me to connect to the same backhand same IOT hub instance and if it works when it works it will show the Droid application here and it's data and as I'm not very lucky it's not showing but that's that's on me I'll fix that so basically you have the idea connect-the-dots makes it like super simple for you to have your your you know back your dashboard for devices data to be shown and then eventually you have some samples on how to do stream analytics or machine learning onto that data in order to do something right whether show a dot on the screen here or do more these are very what much the basics of doing IOT hub development you've seen like developing for a device to send data I'd be curious to know maybe after we can discuss if you have ideas what do you need from the other side as well as in like what you need to do was a mobile application against a service like IOT hub which from the very tiny description I have time to give you dozens number of really to the IT solution I want to leave it like we have two minutes something for questions if you guys have questions just fire yes yeah so the question is what's different between IOT hub and event hub for this we've been playing with event hub which is another data ingestion service so event hub is actually not allowing you to do a per device authentication you have one connection string or one policy that you distribute against various devices so you basically have no way to really shut down one device from a device per device right so that's one the second one is event hub is uni-directional you can only go one direction with event hub as in a device sends data to event hub if you want to receive notification or commands back from the cloud you have to do to instantiate another client of another service like notification hubs or something else in order to get notifications IOT about that by default all right so these are the two main things the third thing is that event hubs only support AMQP and HTTP REST well I only have supports MQTT as well and we're extending to other protocols in the near future and one other things we're adding to IT hub is device management and a gateway SDK will allow you to actually have that gateway functionality so I don't see how basically think of it as the real IOT gateway solution while they then have the path through of data which could be fine enough in a lot of solutions you can go for the cheap I avenged I just want to have data ingested and I'm gonna deal with the device ID and whatever myself in the payload of the messages or you can go IOT hub which is a bit more advanced but gives you more functionality and in terms of cost is a bit more expensive but I'm sure it's gonna drag down based on the competition that we have with AWS and others there's another question about yes yep to the question I may repeat for the audience does IT help support today the addition of metadata and basically device state or device shadow equivalent that they have on Amazon the short answer is not yet so today what we have 90 hub is raw messaging but we just announced the arrival or device management which will have those notions of metadata and so forth on top of lwm to M which is a device management standard that we are supporting in that implementation as device management for IT hub so you'll be able to do the device State thing and so forth using the device management features there are added to IT up as we speak today now the question yes so say it again sorry the different differences between web I'm definitely not difference between web jobs and and and scheduler or other things I'm not I'm not super familiar web jobs think of it of a as an application running in the cloud right so you basically code it the way you want and it actually acts as an app in the cloud and you could have a UI or not that is seen through a website or it could just be like plainly contained and its own think of it as we provide infrastructure for you know doing your own containers if you want we do have containers support as well we have a new service called functions that actually allows you to abstract all the notion of deployment and so on so you can write some code node or c-sharp in the browser and and trigger that codes based on various types of triggers with is a change in a storage or an IOT hub just send data was things like that and can just execute simple pieces of code you have various options out there web jobs is one that we're using here we could definitely replace that with a function and you can replace that with VM running you know via Linux VM running on Azure to the exactly the same thing so it definitely depends on how you gonna scale are you gonna deploy what kind of platform service you want to use what you have today web drops I think today the support C sharp Java node Python so it can also be a factor for you to choose one on other the end more options then you can really like grasp so I don't think there's a real like use that for that kind of situation kind of guidance it's it's a lot of that what do you have today what is your culture how do you want to scale and so forth so the fact that we have web jobs in the IOT of pre-configured solutions just a matter of like the when we when we did your architecture there was the most logical today that functions are out we might be replacing these web jobless functions but you know so we'll see okay other questions otherwise and then we're good thank you very much and I'll be around
