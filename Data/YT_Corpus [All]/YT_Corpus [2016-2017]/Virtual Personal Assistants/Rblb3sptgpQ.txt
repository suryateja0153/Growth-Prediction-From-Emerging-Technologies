 good morning can you guys hear me okay all right great thank you so just out of curiosity how many people know what the word viv means and why we chose it to represent the company yes that's right it means life and it we're going to use this technology to breathe life into the inanimate objects and devices of our life through conversation so that's kind of where we're headed with this so roughly every 10 years a new paradigm comes along that changes the way we interact with computers well we don't think it's a secret what that next paradigm is going to be and we're not alone pretty much every major technology company is now investing billions of dollars in the intelligent assistant space right this is a race a race of a single interface for the user but we think lost in kind of a lot of the noise around this area around assistants and BOTS and agents is a really important question how do we take today's basic technologies and transform them experientially to something that's a true paradigm shift well we've come up with a list a list that we think are is an essential aspects of what this experience is going to take to go to the next level first of all one assistant you really just want one assistant right you don't want to have to look and think about which service providers you're going to be using to ask what questions what kind of commands that they require you really just want to ask right if you think app overload is a big deal today wait until you're looking at a hands-free device that has eight hundred bucks and trying to figure out how to ask this thing something okay this doesn't scale the other thing is you want it to be personalized to you you want your assistant to learn from you you want it to learn your preferences you want it to know whether you like aisle seats or window seats when you're on a plane or once it learns about your food preferences it won't you want it to be able to find you a restaurant in an unfamiliar area you also wanted to know all of these things regardless of what device you're talking to right so this needs to transfer over you don't want to have to start over every time that you have a different device you don't want to have to start the entire process of teaching your assistant about you and so on but I think the most important part about this is that no one company in the world has the resources to plug in every one of the different services that you might want to use but yet with your assistant and that's what viv has spent a whole lot of time in money on is perfecting this third party ecosystem and we think this is going to be the crucial thing that takes it from today's versions that each do something like 20 30 different things to doing hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of things so without further ado let's meet them now a couple of notes we're talking to pretty much all of the major companies around the world to put viv on all different types of devices but today I'm going to show it to you on a phone it's a pretty rich experience and the other thing I wanted to note was that series gives audible voice is something we're still working on so you're not going to hear that today but it will certainly be there when the product comes all right so viv as a platform is built so that you develop developers can come in and make things quite easily and create experiences that are fairly straightforward in a short period of time but it also has the capability of allowing developers to create much more complex experiences and so what I'm going to do here is use a few weather examples to start it off to show you sort of the spectrum of what it can do so starting on sort of the basic what's the weather like at home today right pretty straightforward our friends from Weather Underground get it pretty straightforward to type of a query but let's ratchet it up a little bit was it raining in Seattle three Thursday's ago right so great Weather Underground to the rescue again but as you can see if has a much stronger understanding when you can teach it and developed the let natural language aspects of it and I'm going to take another even bigger leap to sort of a question that you might not ask actually but just to show you a little more of the power will it the warmer than 70 degrees near the Golden Gate Bridge after 5 p.m. the day after tomorrow ok so this is a pretty sophisticated query very few assistants in the world do stuff like this but this is where viv can be trained up by developers so with that let's go behind the scenes let me show you a little bit about how this works okay so what we're looking at here is the viv developer Center this is a place where developers will go and develop new apps and teach you have new things so what I'm going to do is I'm going to load one of the queries that I did earlier I'm going to run that and then we are going to open the curtains a little bit and take a look at what's going on inside so looks fairly straightforward here but there's actually something pretty extraordinary going on so the first thing that we do is we have our friends from nuance we're using for our speech recognition today turn the sounds into words then you can see we have very sophisticated natural language understanding and that generates something called an intent but then here's where the magic comes in so we've got a new technology that we've been working on patenting and it's a computer science breakthrough called dynamic program generation so when it understood the intent of the user it generated this program so this is software that writing itself this is a really important aspect of scaling the assistant because every other platform like it has a program manager that says we're going to do movies or we're going to do something else they can lay it out and they program exactly what happens when you say some query related to some domain it's hard coded but that doesn't scale this is a dynamic program that in 10 milliseconds is writes itself that creates a execution program that goes out and ties the pieces of the services that you need generates the dialogue generates the layouts does everything that happens after the intent let me show you one more example so here's another query that I did earlier now you remember this one a minute ago much more sophisticated again in 10 milliseconds viv wrote a 44 step program that figured out all of the details around the context of the fact that Golden Gate Bridge is a point of interest and when the day after tomorrow is connecting all the services and minds it's pretty incredible technology so it's a little bit of what goes on behind the scenes all right you guys ready to have a little fun all right what I'm going to do now is show you where we put our emphasis on the initial development of this this is something we call conversational Commerce so the goal here is how easy can you make it to get things done by talking to things right so let me give you a few examples send Adam 20 bucks for the drinks last night he our friends from venmo come up it knows who Adam it is it knows what it's about we're going to go ahead and send that that's it it's a job Adams got his money one sentence and it's done let me continue send my mom some flowers for her birthday our friends from ProFlowers come up with some beautiful arrangements here but well she is a tulip lover let's try that what about tulips great so some beautiful arrangements here I'm going to go ahead and do that knows where my mother lives seamlessly puts all that together and we'll go ahead and buy that that's it the flowers are on the way right let's keep going get me a nice room in Palm Springs for Labor Day weekend our friends at hotels.com come up with some cool options okay I've stayed at the ondrea's hotel before it's pretty nice so I'm going to go ahead and get that I think a deluxe room would be good and let's book that has anyone ever seen a hotel booking that's that simple before come on you guys this is exciting stuff or what all right let's do one more I need a ride for six people from my office to Madison Square Garden all right so our friends from uber going to help us out here of course they know that viv knows had a car that takes six people requires an SUV or an XL we're going to request the ride all right now they're looking all right well I'm sorry Robert I'm going to have to cancel this ride today but hopefully we get a chance in the future we're going to cancel that okay now see what we've got here we're getting a phone call at the same time what do you guys think this is not this is all 100% live we just did four transactions in about two minutes by talking so we're very excited about this stuff now what I'm showing you here I don't know who's trying to get in touch with me but I'm gonna have to call them back what I just showed you is just a small slice of where we see the world headed you can imagine when you've got hundreds and thousands of developers plugging in new services and you're able to make the efficiencies of using conversational commerce like this so this is just the beginning so let's go in and look just quickly at the inside of lives brain what I'm showing you now is a little bit of a walkthrough of the actual capabilities on the inside of bib today so this is these are the actual models that the developers are building into I'll call this the universe of capabilities that are in there today and this is just with a few people at the our office building these so we can take a little walk through here we can say like we can go look at what the weather person built so it gives you a sense for how to model something in here what models are consists of let's take a look at another area I haven't didn't really talk about much about this today but I'm certainly going to partake in this tonight so you get a sense for what's in this brain that we call and this is going to be you can sort of get a sense of this universe and this is what the developers will be adding to over time and you can imagine that with thousands of people entering the power that this is going to gain so let me summarize so for consumers bibs going to be the intelligent interface to everything you're going to be talking to all different kinds of things it's going to be doing all sorts of things for you and for developers this is going to be the next great marketplace right you've got app stores today but the thing that comes after app stores is this new type of marketplace a marketplace that works for all the different kinds of devices that the Internet of Things will in use cases that they'll generate and a marketplace that will become the next big area so if you look ahead let's say in the next five years or so we think there's going to be a new icon that's going to be very recognizable as recognizable as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi that's going to be this one because when you see this you can be walking around in more and more devices you're going to see this icon and that means you can talk to that thing and that we think is going to be the end result of this and the power of viv over time well thank you guys very much for watching [Applause] thank you very much I was very impressive thank you let's chat about it for a minute what do you guys think interesting stuff so we saw the demonstration app that you had there I guess the very first question is sort of twofold you know what when is anything launching that we can use and then when is something launching the developers could start building on so we're going to start a rolling launch probably towards the end of the year and we'll be showcasing various types of domains like the things that I show today and in various ways apps and phone apps and other things that we're working on with partners and then we'll slowly start opening up the developer portal and we'll start working with some select partners towards the end of the year and then gradually open it to the full crowd so great so the chat pod era is you know fully upon us now and most of them pretty pretty much suck so they and their people are seeking kind of like behaviors that those are good that work so why is viv going to be the AI chat system that makes our lives better instead of just makes us talk to things we don't want to talk to well the whole idea of div is that developers can go in and build any kind of experience that they want and of course they're going to have a self-interested a motivation to make it work really well so whenever you're looking at the hotel examples are the weather examples or any kind of Commerce or any kind of app the people that are going to be building them are going to be super incentive to make sure that it works very well and the system is built to make it very easy to do that so you actually train and teach them new things all the time and you can imagine that when that goes from let's say the 25 different things that most assistants do today to a hundred things to a 5,000 things just becomes a much bigger part of your life more you know I think that our kids will grow up asking how did you ever get along without your assistant right the same way when I was in college my kids are incredulous that I didn't have a computer so I think generally speaking the aggregation of all of these developers building these incredible experiences together creates a very powerful medium so right now you have a system that you have stakeholders that have a desire to serve people directly like Amazon for instance sit well they want to sell stuff directly out of their app then you have the consumer on the other end of that it just wants to buy the thing and then in the middle right now we've got this sort of columnar interface that is largely made up of search Google is a big example so is Viv's something that's going to kind of like eliminate that middle part and just bypass Google entirely well I don't think I think search isn't going anywhere but I think you will find out that the more capable that these intelligent assistants become the more of a primary source for many things that they become for the user right so when there's a thousand things that I can do with it where I mean you saw how seamless this gets you really don't want to go back to the old way right I mean let's think about what we dump will we take for granted today and the experience of the internet if you want to do something you either go to a URL or you download an app first of all you have to have heard about this app then you download the app then you have to sign up for the app then you have to learn how to use the app right and then you have to place it on your home screen or wherever else it is these are a lot of steps involved in that right it's much easier to be able to simply have this assistant with you you state your intent and what it is you're trying to do and that experience I think as that becomes more powerful and developers band together and create these incredibly rich experiences users will migrate towards that new world so no I don't think search is going to disappear but I think that the rise of the assistant is inevitable and it sort of means that it goes from even installing an app that is accessed through notifications Nations or via like a text message or something like that to not even have it install the app at all but still access its benefits yeah so think about this world of the Internet of Things for example you're not going to be downloading a piece of software to your refrigerator or to your mirror in the morning or even necessarily to your car this all has to live in the cloud it all has to be dynamic so I think that model is really great for mobile but there's going to be this next world where you've got this cloud-based artificial intelligence agents that you'll be simply talking to and they'll follow you around all of the devices that you have we imagine buying something and a consumer electronic device taking it out of the box plugging it into the wall using a thumb iid like you do with your phone and having that thing say hey dog it's nice to meet you I've set your preferences in this in this device you want me to tell you about it right this is kind of a new thing we're talking about and it's not that far away and so if you if you have your way viv is going to be embedded in hardware available for download in enabled inside other apps right so it's not about launching a single app so I'm launching a system that people can embed in their devices their hardware and their software so we're going to start out with a similar experience to what I showed you today to showcase the power of it and that will invite developers in to have at it and build it for whatever self-interested reason they have and we'll watch how that market evolves it's hard to say where it's going to go but it's gonna be very exciting to see so you've used the term Cambrian explosion in the past and referring to how fast AI will grow as a sector what do you think the biggest practical benefits that AI is going to bring normal people it's just going to make things that are generally mundane and tasks heavy much easier to do and also this personalization aspect that I talked about you don't really every time you're asking for something you don't have to explain every bit of detail it starts to know you like like a assistant mine so really it's an efficiency game where you can help you I mean there's all sorts of interesting cases on how to apply that and one of the most interesting things is going to be to see what happens with live when people start applying all of the creativity I mean think about you know Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 with just like eight or nine apps that they made but wow what an incredible creative explosion happened when they open the App Store right we see the same thing happening in AI we're kind of at the same stage an ad so I can't even begin to imagine all the different ways that people are going to use this but we're super excited to watch the development and so when developers build for viv they're going to be able to add sort of instructions that tell viv how to do new things but you mentioned the part of the secret sauce that's things that set it apart from other AI systems like Siri or Amazon's echo or something like that aside from the extensible platform is this dynamic program generation right so could you explain a little bit more about when a developer creates a module that says hey now you know how to do this or that yeah what added benefits does the dynamic program generation get so you're you're honing in on a really important part of this new system it's kind of a breakthrough it's going to change the way programmers work with computers because they're not they're no longer required to actually teach the computer step by step coding every single line we're talking program synthesis here right yeah it's it's it's an it's a variation of that right so instead of having to write exactly every code instruct it you're really describing what it is you want to do and modeling what you want it to do and then the computer does the rest so that there's a lot of benefits to that it makes it easier and faster to actually get to program there's there's a bit of a black box there so people that have bad intentions can't deliberately program they don't have access to creating wreaking the havoc that some other systems might have if they have a system like that so we think that's a super crucial aspect to this it's a very important computer science breakthrough that our science department came up with so we're super excited about that you mentioned wreaking havoc you know Stephen Hawking said the artificial intelligence could like spell the end of the human race Bill Gates they said he's concerned about it Elon Musk's that it's akin to summoning the demon do you think you're building the thing that will enslave us all or do you have a rosier outlook I was just waiting for when this question was gonna get us gotta give the people what they want so I actually I'm glad that these questions are coming up because I do think this is going to be an issue down the road we were joking a little bit last night that if there is some sentient AI that starts scanning the internet looking for something that one of the first places they'll go is viv to try to take over that network of capabilities but no I'm not I'm not worried about that I don't think this is the beginning of the end quite yet so no I'm not too concerned about that issue today so this is this is the second company in this vein that you've started what is it about the conversational UI that convinces you it's the future it's just easier it's such a natural way for us to interact I had a guy that I was talking to that was about 65 and I was asking me what I was doing these days and I kind of explained it to him he said oh well I don't it's so techie I don't really understand all that stuff but I said no actually technology is coming to a place where it gets even easier for you to use it because you know how to hold a conversation it's just a natural way for humans to interact they've been doing it for thousands of years and if that became a de facto interface for pretty much everything that you do or at least many things where it's appropriate I think that's very powerful and it radically simplifies the world especially with technique and so you've uni co-founded Siri sold that to Apple and there have been many other you know similar startups an AI space that have been no acquired there are aqua hired to work in big companies AI system because as you mentioned everybody sort of has to have a department working on this if you know Mark Zuckerberg took you for a walk in the Facebook park for a hotdog and offered you all the kingdoms of the world for viv tomorrow would you do that or are you determined to see this one through to the natural conclusion well we're actually in talks to acquire TechCrunch right now so I'm not sure how that would work but I'm just kidding look our goal for this is ubiquity and we're going to follow the path that gets us to ubiquity that's very important to us we've had acquisition offers previously that we've not gone with but anybody on but now yeah you would probably know okay you can read about it probably we're friends with all these guys and there's a lot of a lot of interest and active you know stuff going on in this area but we are going to stay true to whatever we think is the right way to get to ubiquity so we're not going to do predetermined what the path that is but we're determined to finish the job for sure and we touched on this a little bit but these your vision for viv include hardware like embedded systems we're not in have any any plans to build any Hardware ourselves but we certainly are talking to many hardware providers to breathe life as I was talking about in the name into many different type of systems in fact there's some some interesting approaches that we've had that I can't tell you about today but I wouldn't even have thought of it before so it's really fun to see the creativity of what may happen here right well if I promise not to call your driver and tell you what happened because I can grab the number off the screens then maybe you'll tell me backstage thank you very much doc I appreciate okay thank you [Applause]
