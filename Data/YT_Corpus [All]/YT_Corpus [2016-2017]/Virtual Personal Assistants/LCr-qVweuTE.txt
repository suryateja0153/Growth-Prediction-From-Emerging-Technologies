 good evening entrepreneurs this is tom kremer calling from actually coming from balmy columbus ohio tonight got the 65 degrees here in February which is unusual we've had a cold winter and got to get out and enjoy and celebrate my daughter's birthday and what had a little bit of German cuisine that's what she wanted we have a eclectic taste in our household but anyway I just wanted to bring you a short video on what I call outsourcing your life this video is nothing new or what I'm about to talk to is nothing new you may have read the 4-hour workweek if you have and I suggest getting that book very good book to read if you want to become more productive and have more free time for yourself whether to make more money or to spend more time with your family so I've implemented a few things still not there yet i'm not working for hours a week but learned that I need to take the mundane off me things that are repetitive task whether that be in my personal life or in my job or in my small business and hand that off to other people so that I can free up my time to become more productive and push the business further so there's many aspects which you can do and the first thing I always suggest people is automate your life whether that's using emails using your phone whether I be an iphone or android you know doing a few things to really make Mike your life a little easier and really it's not a question about easier just more efficient and freeing up your time so this is going to be a series of videos mostly just from my experience not that I'm an expert on it just what I've encountered you know if I'm going to continue to do what I've done or tweak it to make it better so it'll be a series this is kind of a part 1 series and recently I had the opportunity just to use a shopping service and normally that's been around for a while around here but I'm just kind of one of those persons that like to do things myself I'm the one to do does grocery shopping in the house and you know that could take a good three to four hours a week end because I shop every two weeks so I get a lot of stuff for two weeks so in that sense I shop for two weeks so I don't go out again so in that respect I've you know cut a lot of that time down where I can just do it once every two weeks and have enough food to last us but I wanted to try out a curbside shopping service for my groceries on Friday and I was quite pleased that it worked out pretty good although my wife is skeptical on it so just wanted to share with you one that I'm using and kind of give you a little rundown on it so I'm going to share my screen on that and see if I'm on the right one here sorry about that no that's not what I want is so we're going to stop sharing that and let's go somewhere else let's try that so let's go into what I'm trying to do here or plant that's not what i want i want this right here apologize i'm just trying to have too many i should have it close some of these windows before before doing this so let's take a look okay we're there now sorry about that so what this is is a we have a local grocery store called giant eagle I really don't shop there too often because I think the price a little high but for the curbside I thought I'd just test this out and have a lot of groceries to get this two weeks / down to two people three people in the house from for my daughter's off to college so I thought I'd try this I know that the other grocery stores that's including kroger Meyer and Meyer are looking to expand into this area here this year in 2016 but basically it's where you can just go online and pick your items you need to do it with until you know give them a good four hours you know lead time you know so you want to be a little prepare to have your list together and give about four hours to get it together but uh basically step one is you schedule a pickup online fill your cart and then you stop on the curbside call them on the phone and get your products and in this case the first three in this case the first 3i pickups are actually free after that they're like 495 a pickup which is four dollars and ninety-five cents per ticket was pretty good so I'm already in here i'm going to skip the login so if i were to i want to go to my area where I'm added automatically kind of picks you up on google chrome where your your closest store is and so i'm going to get started here so let's say i want to order some toilet paper simple enough i just click that holds up takes a few seconds to pull up and okay well let's see what do i want today i think i want to get some let's just try this just put some sharma in there I get that added to the cart as you can see it's gone to the cart and don't need to bore you on the details but just if you get your list together put it together and then you want to go to checkout and it's pretty simple you don't have to pay until you actually get to the curb they'll scan it for you so I pretty much took about a half hour of my time to to put this together the you know put the list together and send it on its way and then I went and did some other errands and around four o'clock on that particular day I went to pick my items up took about 20 minutes and was at on the way home and didn't get everything at the grocery store cuz i was still shop for bargains but i only had to pick up a few items at another store but anyway that's just a short thing you might want to check out the personal shopping at you know see if you have it in your area or whatever i'm going to go to you can just do a google search on personal shopping it's personal let's see just type in curbside pickup which restores or something like that and you'll probably get there while more grocery delivery I don't haven't done that yet kurtz by Express giant eagle curbside pickup Meyer that's in select areas they haven't rolled it out yet but my my main story I grow too so I'm looking forward to seeing if they do that so at this point if you select the store from meijer you're not going to see I think it's only in two parts of Ohio where I'm at and they are going to be moving so right now it's just in Michigan in parts of Ohio that's just in my side you might want to check your area well anyway until I see again that will talk on once again outsource your life on another thing i'm working on until then talk to you later
