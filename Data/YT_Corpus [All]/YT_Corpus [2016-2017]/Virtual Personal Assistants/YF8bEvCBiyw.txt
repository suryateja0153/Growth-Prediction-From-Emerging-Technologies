more but we can't necessarily afford to take more than a couple weeks vacation at a time the good news is that there are a lot of jobs out there that you can do online with just a Wi-Fi connection and your laptop in theory if you can get one of these online jobs you can work from anywhere in the world as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection there are all kinds of jobs you can do online like graphic design web design you can be a translator or freelance writer you could be someone's virtual assistant or manage an organization social media account the options are endless and those are just a few of the really obvious ones but don't worry if you don't fit into one of those categories there are all kinds of online jobs out there working online is still a pretty new concept so it's not super easy to find online jobs but we came up with 8 tips to help you with your online job search and we'll put links to all these resources in the description box of this video tip number one would be to check out the Flex jobs job board it's kind of like your conventional job search engine except that it only advertises for jobs that are flexible in some way whether they're work from home positions telecommuting positions or even part-time telecommuting positions so it's definitely worth checking out to see what kind of online work opportunities they have there tip number two would be to check out the Forbes website every year they publish a list of the top 100 companies that hire for remote positions we'll give you a link to the 2016 list and you'll see a hundred companies listed and linked so you can click on every company's website and go visit either their career section or they're hiring section to see what kind of online opportunities they have available tip number three would be to check out the upwork website it used to be called Elance but it's changed a little bit basically it's a site where you can go to find freelance contract opportunities so what you do is you start by creating your own profile and you list the different skills you have and then you can start searching for jobs based on your skill set tip number four would be to check out the fancy hands website if you're interested in doing any kind of ritual assistant work so the cool thing about fancy hands is that you can make your own hours and apply for different short-term virtual assistant contracts and you would be doing work like data entry or online research or making reservations for someone I'm not sure if they hire outside of the US but it's worth looking into tip number five would be to make a list of organizations or companies that you might be interested in working for and going to their website to see their job board so a lot of companies don't necessarily post opportunities on other job boards they might just have a jobs page or a careers page on their own website so you might need to go to their website to find out about opportunities so for example I did a little test to see if this idea would work and I decided okay let's say I wanted to work for an animal rights organization I would make a list of the top ten animal rights organizations I might want to work for and then go to each individual web site and look at the job section of their site so I started off with the biggest animal rights organization out there PETA and right away I found on their job board that they have a separate category just for telecommuting and location independent positions tip number six might not seem very useful at first but it's how Matt and I both got our first online jobs and so that's why we're always pushing it it's just word of mouth so tell everyone in your life and in your circle of friends that you are looking for online work so that you can travel more even if no one in your immediate circle of friends or family knows about any opportunities you never know when they might hear about something and when that opportunity might filter back to you tip number seven would be to check out your local co-working spaces so a co-working space is basically like a shared office and you rent it by the day by the week by the month or even by the year and it's sort of a space where a lot of startup companies end up going so that they can take advantage of meeting spaces and fax machines and printers and stuff like that and also just get out of the house or get out of the hotel room depending on what their situation is and it might be a great way for you to network with people who are already working online so you can't necessarily just walk in and ask for an online job but you might be able to go to their website and see if they have any job boards see if they have any networking events maybe you could offer your services and volunteer and finally tip number eight would be to start your own online business so if you're not having any luck applying for online jobs through any of the other websites we've shared or if you don't really like any of the opportunities that you're finding you might be interested in starting your own online business maybe you could design apps you could write an e-book you could start your own online store starting an online business is a lot cheaper than starting a brick-and-mortar business but you still need to put a ton of time and energy into it to make it work the payoff if it does work out would be huge you'd be able to work from anywhere in the world you'd be working for yourself and making your own hours it sounds pretty cool so it's worth thinking about a couple other things to think about if you are looking for online work is to avoid any kind of scammy job offers that you might find out there so anything that's promising to get your rich quick by doing weird stuff like filling out surveys and clicking on ads all day long if and when you do get your online job make sure to do your research before you travel outside of your home country to make sure that you're not violating any kind of work visa or entry requirements of the country you're visiting last but not least if you want to be able to earn money and travel at the same time but you don't necessarily want to work on a laptop and be online all the time we're going to make a separate video about how you can find work offline so that you can still work and travel but you won't be tied to a laptop so stay tuned for
