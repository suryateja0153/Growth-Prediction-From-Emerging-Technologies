 hey there's Katrina sawa here that jumpstart your biz coach with jumpstart you are marketing calm and love yourself successful calm my book and today I want to share a couple of tips well today I want to share a couple tips about accountability and getting stuff done that seems to be one of the biggest things with a lot of my clients is they need that constant accountability they need to be able to talk to me text me email me probably once a week if not every other week to make sure they're on track with what they're doing and what they need to do every week in their business what they need to do every day sometimes because sometimes we get demotivated or something knocks us off our knocked us off our regular you know being kind of thing something happens and then it shifts your energy and it's hard to get productive so one of the things I teach people is to use a Google Calendar number one to help you with a little bit of productivity and the google calendar is is great better than an ical for example the I calendar on the Mac because that only goes to the Mac products so if you're ever in a hotel or need to go somewhere and check it on a pc you can't check your calendar on a pc and if you don't have if you have a droid phone you can't check your count on your phone so a google calendar is so universal and most people have a gmail address and you have a youtube account and so you can get into Google Drive you can have google calendar and all of it is free and the google calendar is really cool because you can time black things and you can make things different colors I have like my business calls in blue my networking events and personal things in red as my speaking gigs whether the virtual are in person or in green and birthdays are in yellow you know some we have a even a custody schedule with my with my stepdaughter she's in silver you know so I have everything on my calendar personal and business my assistants can see it my husband could see it if you want and that's one way to be more productive and stay accountable because you can move the little blocks around it's pretty easy to drag and drop another thing is to have a buddy you know do you have another tripping or in your life or in your world who's a motivated entrepreneur and can more like a task manager kind of person you want someone who's kind of a hard-ass and as your buddy in order to stay accountable either as a coach or a buddy rights but you can get a buddy and make sure that you guys meet once a week and it can be just a quick check-in call or a check-in email or something like that or a text even to help you stay on track with some of the things you need to do and you can share each other successes you can acknowledge each other the only thing sometimes a buddy can't help you with is if they're in the same position as you in your business they might not be able to give you sound advice on certain things you need to be doing that's where a mentor like me comes in comes in handy and I like to be that accountability person for my clients and I'm very accessible in most of my programs one-on-one because I know that that's a lot of what people need especially if you're in the first three to five years of your business or you're just starting out you need to know exactly what to do for your business you don't it's hard to listen to an audio and then really convert that advice to what you need to do so I'd love to chat with you more if you need accountability if you want more help or if you just want to kind of find out if or how i can help you or support you through your business i'd love to have a conversation just go to ask kat biz it's a sk k ay t dot bi z and there's a questionnaire there to fill out and I'd be happy to talk with you one-on-one where we can see if it's a good fit no charge if not you know go to the website at jumpstart your marketing com get on the email list I send out lots of great video tips every week like this and many more and opportunities to come to my events and more so have a great day everyone talk to you soon
