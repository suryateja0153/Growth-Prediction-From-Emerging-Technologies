 your phone can talk and not just talk it can think and talk that's what this video is all about hello and welcome to who do do calm I am vedecci la Pradeep and this time we'll be talking about artificial intelligence and its impact on our day-to-day lives the reason why I am talking about artificial intelligence and specifically about the usage in our day-to-day lives through our smartphones is because a few days ago Daggett loss who co-founded City when he was in Apple announced that they are launching a new assistant called viv and after a few days of this happening Google announced Google assistant and also Google home which also comes with this device which looks so similar but more useful than Amazon's eco let's see more about eco a little later but what does viv do let's find out the new talking assistant which can not only give you answers for the questions that are predetermined that basically means there are only a set of questions or commands that the earlier artificial intelligence apps like apples silly or Cortana by Microsoft which is still not available in India in a large scale that will not available in multi-platform the same goes for Apple's Siri which was the wonder of the year when it was launched few years ago but right now why valve is one step ahead this connects all the possibilities of what Siri katana or Amazon's Alexa which is launched with its product called eco by the way Eco is a very interesting device which can talk to you basically this device is connected to the Internet to the cloud and it gives you answers to your questions and also performs quite a lot of tasks for you but now viv is trying to do something more than that because all these products have been doing only a set of things but viv is going to give you much more than that because it's gonna be a multi-platform product which can be used on any platform and also riff keeps on learning always and with this learning we get to make viv do a lot of our tasks and that's a very cool thing like how in the presentation ordered a flower for his mother and also ordered a taxi and pay somebody some money booked a hotel room all in two minutes that true with just a conversation and a few clicks through viv in a few years from now I think we can talk to our devices talk to us smart phones or smart devices and make them do what we want them to do Google now before the announcement of the new assistant and also Google home would have been still like a katana or a City but it has gone one step ahead and things for us is what Google says and even Google home is supposed to be much better than Amazon eco but Google home seems to be quite fantastic and sounds like a fantasy isn't it but let's wait and watch and see what happens thank you so much for watching if you like the video please like comment share and if you want to see much more videos like this and keep knowing about cool technology facts and information please subscribe to Guru to official I am particular Pradeep signing off you
