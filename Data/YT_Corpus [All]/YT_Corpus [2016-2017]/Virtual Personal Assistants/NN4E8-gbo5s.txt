 welcome back thank you three more sessions to go until till we finished for the day on this stage there is obviously after that more going on next door I think Lindsay from access is on next door when we finish here so this session we're going to have three presentations on the stage around the theme of the fourth Industrial Revolution mainly around tech V Rai those kind of topics and crucially why it matters to you or should matter to you so we're gonna do three presentations one after the other and I'm going to ask the presenters to take a seat when they're done and if you have any burning questions then keep them for the end and we'll do questions any questions for all three speakers at the end and so that's that so moving swiftly on without further ado the first speaker is Mike Cooper global CEO of phd Mike so just try and imagine that a superior alien life-form gets in contact with us and says we're on our way we'll see in 15 years would we reply by saying that's great we'll leave the lights on see you when you get here but AI is effectively just around the corner and we're not really preparing certainly not in the marketing marketing industry anyway not everybody is excited about it Stephen Hawking has said that success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history it might also be the last unless we learn to manage the risks and Elon Musk Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak are also voicing similar reservations about this world that we're walking backwards into so some of the best minds in the world agree that it's a really big deal that something big is coming down the line but it's 1159 effectively on AI Eve so what's brought us here why now well there are really three key factors the first one is unstructured data which you hear people talk a lot about coming from from social media from sensors from transactions from a whole variety of different sources and 90% of that data has been generated in just the last two years the first billion users of the internet came on via fixed wire the second and third billion came on by mobile but the next decade will see the connection of more than twenty billion devices via the Internet of Things and all of those sources have been going to be generating more and more and more data so you know you've got a vast amount of data the second thing is the increasing sophistication of algorithms such as self learning ones developed by companies like deep mind and we'll see one of those in just a moment and the third one is the massive increase in computational speed and capacity so that we can store more data than ever before so that's the kind of background now machines can now manage deep learning this is where a computers learn to figure things out for themselves so just to be kind of like clear on this machine learning is where we have defined the parameters deep learning is something quite different it's where machines or computers can undertake tasks we have not even programmed them to do so I just wanted to show you a quick example that a very very simple example just to kind of like bring it alive in February 2015 demis hassabis and his team at deep mind a uk-based AI company created an algorithm that could play really simple Atari style arcade games so this is breakout this is an early version of an art re game so just watch this for a second this is the machine learning how to play so its optimizing performance to get the best possible score so this was the earliest iteration of this but you see that after 500 games the computer became a real expert doing it on its own and things have moved on enormous lee since then and many of you probably read that a I recently won against the world champion at go which is a three-dimensional game which is far more complicated than chess if beat the world champion at that game so AI is really starting to attract major amounts of investment the kind of funding that the internet attracted in the early years it's been projected that over the next four years seventy billion dollars will be invested in AI and it's really becoming the plaything of giants IBM with deep blue Facebook and Google are acquiring and hiring in this space iBM is using Watson to assess AI to assess medical records predicting future illnesses Google has spent multiple billion dollars acquiring deep mind and Facebook is using AI for image and video recognition and Kevin Kelly the founding editor of Wired magazine has said that everything we formally cognate I everything we formally electrified we will now cognate eyes so if you examine if you imagine for example Yahoo deciding to cognitive the 17 years of email data that they have 256 petabytes of unstructured data not just conversations but transactions healthcare data receipts travel information etc the cross-platform targeting potential of that is absolutely enormous and these changes will lead to a radical reorganization of marketing and the most obvious iteration of this in the new fee in the near future will be the launch of the virtual personal assistant and you've seen very basic versions of this with something like Siri but if for example you missed your flight back from Rome tomorrow or the next day which is entirely possible given the activities of many of the people here in Rome your VP a would rebook your flight change your hotel booking booked a cab and inform your loved ones take care of that whole process for you automatically but the connection with marketing is how would it choose which airline how would it choose which hotel and in this world marketing is effectively changing at least partially from a frontal cortex decision process to an algorithmic one so we're effectively going to be in a world where we're marketing to algorithms which is a huge step so the AI train is not just heading for our industry but it's going to pass right through our backyard and it will radically reorganize the world that we work in so one prediction for this is that many of the different disciplines that we have today like web and social analytics dynamic creative optimization search bidding DSPs DMPs attribution modeling they will all merge together as one and who sees what when and in which order will be decided by algorithms overseen by marketing experts so human decisioning in our industry certainly a micro-level will effectively disappear and human involvement will be elevated to be at the technology level such as building technology stats so just to give you an idea of what this might look like I just want you to imagine for a second that it's 2029 and you're looking backwards in history backwards in time at what's happened over the last few years it's hard to imagine our world without artificial intelligence a technology now evolving around us at an exponential rate yet we lived in that world not so long ago back in 2015 we were marveling at the speed of change how slow we would consider that change now it was 1936 when Alan Turing developed his hypothetical computing machine and 1943 that saw a computational model for neural networks developed based on algorithms by 2011 Apple had integrated Siri into their iPhone Google released Google now and tech giant's began to meaningfully explore the potential of a I soon Skype became capable of translating between languages in near real-time objects were listening to what we were saying and AI was listening to our machines washing machines assessing detergent quality cars judging petrol efficiency and homes managing their own energy usage an abundance of real-time data marking a new era of pre-emptive marketing 2020 was the year that the self-driving car became commercially available it was also the year objects social networks and smartphones were producing so much data that ad bidding was conducted in real time by artificial intelligence 2020 was also the year our virtual personal assistants became sentient life and began editing the world for us they understood everything every ingredient every location every price every possible way of booking cancelling and mending AI understood our intentions often before we did we spoke naturally to them and they back to us they understood and communicated on our behalf to other VPS two algorithms making all the necessary arrangements our VPS now recommended products and experiences a simple yes from us and they scheduled and made the booking for the big media agencies algorithm speed became the final competitor advantage by 2023 we had outsourced our decision-making to are artificially intelligent BPA's which now made purchase decisions on our behalf they bought when they knew we were running out they changed brand when they realize our preference had changed if we'd been told in 2015 that in less than 10 years marketers would be advertising to machines to persuade them to buy their products we'd have found it hard to imagine by now the job of marketers was to convince machines to buy brands sought the best human reviews to convince algorithms to purchase their products and services which brings us to 2029 machines have human levels of intelligence they tell us jokes they flirt our machines are microscopic and implantable the first company founded and run by an AI has been established soon artificial intelligence will explore the boundaries of art and music and an algorithm will win a Grand Prix at can and in little more than a decade from now AI will be advancing so rapidly that our ability to make predictions will break down singularity seems possible welcome to the future welcome to sentience so I think as an industry it's important to recognize that change is upon us as an industry and we need to start acting now we need to start understanding these things what it does mean is that you know there is a potential for this to be an even more remarkable industry in the future with a true blend of Technology science and creativity even more than we have today and I think you know the media agency anybody who works in marketing will be at the forefront of that change and there will be no better industry to belong in than this one as we as we navigate this so that is in the 11 minute tour through AI so I hope you know you picked up some of the points down fairly interesting thank you thank you very much thank you Mike as I said if you have questions for Mike keep them and we'll try and do some questions at the end if we have time up next Arif Cooley chief commercial officer from Blippar thank you 17 billion dollar investment in AI that's pretty amazing so high I feel to be here what I'd like to do in the theme of fourth revolution is going a little bit more current for today and then give you sort of some of the core philosophies that are driving the blipper business and potentially this AR movement and then go into some I'm gonna risk some live demos if you're all up for it you up for it yeah so here goes and the fact it doesn't work we've got a video that works too so flipper who are we and what do we do we are building the world's leading visual browser and what that means is that we we look at objects bring them to life and unlocks content that is relevant our mission and our vision is to give you more from the world that you see oh man augmented reality is a technology whereby it adds additional information to the physical world and there are three core philosophies that we're seeing that's really driving the Blippar model but also this amazing movement in AR VR but also the the core sort of surroundings of this which are AI you know artificial intelligence machine learning and computer vision and you're going to have a lot about this in the next coming years I'm sure you've heard it already but those are the driving factors so let's talk about the first philosophy our eyes it's no common sense that our eyes our primary sensor to body in fact 83% 83% of our combined census are driven by sight so when we look at things our eyes give us sight that sight gives us vision which helps us learn and drives our knowledge so why are we talking about this now there's this huge shift in how we're behaving with the phone you know back in the 90s it's evolved from being up hair back if we were doing the rim down there and what put it up there was was it would the actual camera right the camera put up there the quality of the camera but it's very much become an extension of our eyes so this behavior shift has really driven a lot of these new technologies that we're seeing today so that's one core philosophy so we'll just part that for now second product is a new media now what does that mean Blippar today looks at product packaging as a product but also chairs bottles trees and leaves we think of all of it so when we talk about product our ambition is to bring these products alive so that they communicate to you they tell you about the nutritional value or if you're hiking in the Amazon forest and you pick up a leaf you want to know about the leaf and the tree that's the level which we're thinking about so it's a really exciting journey so we believe product is a new medium we work with all our partners today through obviously looking at TV and digital as being the cool medium but this is that new era of product being the new media that's our second philosophy and the third one is really critical because it really dries to a component what John was saying about AI technology with VR but all of the components around technology but very simply words are not enough 19 years ago I sees yellow pages there's a great source of information and then came the you know search engines right so they're pretty much the primary primary sort of source for knowledge I was a primary gateway today for knowledge now we're sort of asking for information now we're asking but it has its limitations you know when my wife and I are sitting in the street she sees a red dress you know and she wants to get that rest a red dress how does she describe that online it's very difficult we're limited by vocabulary but let's take it let's take a step back from a global perspective one seventh of the world cannot read and write to seventh of the world can barely look at signage and maybe use some currency here and there that leaves four sevenths of the world which defines as high school dropouts to triple PhDs we take one person in that pool that's knowledgeable they probably use about 10% of their vocabulary so words are not enough when we think of when natura sand we want to investigate it's very limiting that's our third core principle and for that reason it's opened up this amazing new field of science and this new field of science is computer vision machine learning artificial intelligence all of these things have now surfaced to help us get better at this so has you know if you if you kind of feels that every 15 years is this swing so remember 95 to 2015 the big themes who are HTTP JavaScript again in the web going making everything come to life we've been living that for 15 years and it's been an amazing journey the next error as I mentioned was is this new sort of level of understanding or computer understanding so what I have behind me here is an actual picture of what today a computer understands the world and it looks sort of looks like basically so it's vision of the world today and acts like a five to six year old so you have sort of certain areas that are tied in there you've got ground grass you've got maybe a bicycle and person and this is advancing with AI this is advancing with machine learning and it's only going to get better and this is where only a five six year old today so there's been you know for the past 15 years we've been painting maybe 20 years we've you know if I had a desktop we've had photographs on our desktop we've put that onto our laptop we've got now I mobile phone with photographs we have cloud computing but we've got this huge amount of amazing data and it's it's really a challenge to you know how does one recognize you know John's shoes right now and understand the shoes that it is and interpretate it back as that's the shoe that John is wearing you know that's progressing and a huge cutter so that will be augmented reality augmented reality will disrupt major industries these industries go from education to retail entertainment enterprise but you'll see a big push towards that so on that note I want to get into some demos and show you where we are today we have a visual browser today that we've built it's a beta it's a three to four year old I know that because I test my son frequently so if I go to demo sir in the back put that in there this is when I play the elevator music hearts are pounding there's my little children okay so the blip our app today if you open up the bitmap I'm gonna look through the room so remember this is a three to five year old so it's a start blipping here these categories at we're boarding right now cats dogs pizza food someone start flipping right now this is our beta and I'm gonna look around the room and let's see what it picks up okay understand shares it sees this word powered around it or indoors or in a concert maybe I'm gonna get the audience now we wait at least a second oh you're playing a drum it's the giver hair with tables hand submission best of all computer you see the general place its scenic it's understanding that's around it and building upon this now notice the plate here it is a salad so we've talked about the phenomena of Internet of Things we believe in sort of this shift between internal on things so if I take a look this salad see what it finds here this is lettuce onions okay salad just pick up tomato more thing so you see how that populates and you can learn more about it so it's actually picking up all the visuals here now if this was a DVD which is it is it was let's see how it picks that up so this is comfy pad it's my son's favorite movie it's picked up the kungfu panda i can open this up and let's get some more information about Tom Capano it opens up in these molecules tab and I can sort of is that my okay that was my iPhone music as exactly so circulate there I can kind of see okay I can go to half I can go to the Facebook site have I activating it so it gets the Facebook page for the movie to get more information it's loading right there do you need a security check for some strange reason reviews so we're losing the movie so you see how can I get lost in this whole play there I've got the editing information so this is sort of very disruptive in the internet world where imagine every DVD every post will just give you information when you look at it this could be in glass could be in anything any lens so this is what we're building and at the moment it's that sort of four year old kind of getting there so I want to show you some some sort of use cases in education and how this is disruptive so so I have a picture here of a flower it's a sunflower so the goal hair would be teachers would rather have the tool they'll build their own lessons and create an AR lesson John I'm going to use you for some questions there that's okay so if you scan this you'll see what happens that's a loop okay so what it is you can see you have the teacher well the student is column day one and you see this pot hair right so it would go away come back next day it creates questions here so you can watch a video so we're on a video learn about photosynthesis right in this town down here somewhere then you can then take a quiz so it says Akane what does a plant used to collect water anyway roots thank you so you go next and then it says Chris number two what gas is released we know that Sox are June next why are flowers colorful anyone shout out don't be scared that's right the second one thank you done okay so gets it right and then you get to pour as a reward you get to pull some water you know in plant to plant and this will rotate you go back every day you change the questions get different quizzes but you made them for teachers to be able to build these lessons and each time you get rewarded you know the plant will grow so when you're on your final stage you'll have this beautiful sunflower which is about that you see that so that's a sort of a use case in terms of from an education perspective so we're investing heavily with the education sectors and on for-profit business giving them the tools that they can build these great re experiences share and learn with other teachers and build upon their the next one I want to choose more of a commercial one so maxfactor you know one of the biggest insights has been that they 70% of people who search for beauty cook them beauty products do this online ten percent of those folks actually end up in the store so how do you closed-loop within the store and create the student experience and the reason why they're doing online is the individuality they over to learn reviews to be able to pick the right makeup and and custom foundation so in doing so they basically built their point of cells being activated the product itself is activated so you can actually blip on the mascaras and all give you information so just give you sort of a use case of this and my time is up but I'll just pre show you this one huh let's see how it all comes to life you can find your perfect red for myself you just sort of look at your look your turn I would go dark I think for me and then you would get your result so general ways in which commercial folks are using it marketing folks using it to really drive sales but imagine a world where objects are recognizable and they they they bring life into bring content to you through this visual browser that we're building so that's thank you the like demo worked great thank you fascinating great great stuff up next Dylan CEO CEO and founder of Valle a creative deal is going to talk about a virtual reality and why we should care and he's a man who should know he was a co-founder of oculus in a previous life Dylan well great stuff AI and a ours really amazing in a really in a world where all these interesting tickle is coming up and you know we should be really looking forward to the changes that that these new technology will bring into our lives so how many of you out there have really tried to vote virtual reality has said before that's your hand Wow quite a bit okay have you guys check out through this cup of discovery we are not really there was a bit of you are outside and for your second nobody exercycle okay that's interesting um all right so I'm gonna talk about you know fairly new news today do have Sam this is a demonstration from Google and there's a Google i/o conference is happening it releases new demo video of their VR platform called a dream as you can see on your right there's a remote controller that he's holding on it at his hands and it's moving you know the direction that where he wants to go so this device is called daydream and this is gonna be available on the fall of this year for your Android end so most the people who are who have the fairly new cell phones will be able to use this headset this fellas phone to actually use virtual reality the picture you see there has set design and then the controller design is quite similar to what oculus has actually and if you see the daydream ready smartphone partners you will see all the major smartphone manufacturers out there for building the smartphones will be actually supporting this function and also if you see the media partners over there we have Wall Street Journal the New York Times Netflix CNN Hulu AMX Lionsgate they're all jumping into this area so the most important thing though is that Google's YouTube because YouTube will be completely redesigned and then will be able to host through system video if you actually were your VR headset so once you use if your headset right now you have to actually download the content from the YouTube and install in your hard drive and then put it in and then actually see the you know search the video with the Google cardboard but actually in the future in your future which is its fall they're gonna have actually YouTube completely redesigned for switch what's to be your experience well so for your advertisement that you will be producing for since the video will be compatible with the new headset that's coming out you know why this is important you know lot for about 128 years we've been looking at the digital content or even like a you know flat movie content into the 2d panel right so we are accustomed to see the things from a No rectangular screens but in the future with the virtual grade technology you'll no longer be seeing things who actually feeling things one of the reasons why face specially bought oculus year 2014 it's because he had a big dream Mark's talk about a big dream his dream is sexually connect the world and give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected so how do we actually give people the power to share in the past Facebook has been actually it was actually a text sharing platform so if I say Wow Italy is fantastic in the text people have been wondering ok building must mean Italy and he's seeing something and he's saying it'll is fantastic but chrome version of Facebook is actually saying wow it only looks fantastic maybe because I can I share some photos maybe I share some videos then you can actually kind of see the photos of your friends and then say wow this actually looks fantastic but in the future people will say wow it really feels fantastic because you'll be actually able to share you know your presence you know where you are at and actually things see things through your own eyes that's what virtual real I can offer you know with the virtual reality you know you can be anywhere doesn't feel like you can reach out and touch the pose and I can't get over the leaves moving oh I can't believe so she's she's actually over 90 years old and you know a couple of computer programmers the game programmers actually bought oculus death kit and show this to a grandma and she was actually seeing one of the houses that oculus built in the military and sort of style and she was actually looking through things that's like wow how even she was amazed by it this the reaction was that she can actually feels I can go and grab something up there right so even those who was sitting actually in her living room she was she felt like she was actually somewhere else and invert in virtual reality can do anything you were laughing at this but you know she was actually riding a roller coaster um the story is that this is a you know young married couple should there and a honeymoon stage and and and her husband is a computer program and he showed this you know roller coaster rides her wife and her life is supposed to be according to what we heard from the the person who made the video she's one of the girls that can never go in a roller coaster ride because she freaks out she always worried about what is this roller coaster stuff in the middle war like you know what are the safe secure just falls off you know she was so scared in real life that she never rise in her local roller coaster but in virtual reality you know she actually was able to you know felt like she's very no roller coaster so anniversary reality you don't have to be human as well so yeah imagine you know seeing the world through dog's eyes or imagine seeing the world's through the birds eyes or you know see the world through the insects eyes right anything is possible in virtual reality and the reason you can do this because you know there's no limit is it with a space and time most of the times when we're telling our story and we were bound by the times over they were bound by the space but in virtual reality actually enables the media people to teleport you into a new world and do anything you want and then actually it can be anything you want and this is a very powerful message because this was never able to be done in the past you know while the you know I'm great thing about virtual reality is that there's a new content design language here right now Express is moving away from seeing and he's moving towards to feeling you know one time there's a one gentleman he said he misses his grandmother so much because you know he has so many so much a lot of searchable memories with his grandmother but if you can actually film you know grandmother intricity video when she's still alive maybe ask questions about you know how she lived their lives and and so maybe you know ask for a piece of wisdom and they you filmed it and then you know in the future when she passed away and you want to actually carry that story over to your you know grandson then you can actually you know have to wear the headset then you feel like you're actually there and talking to your grandmother right and this is much more emotional than flat-screen TV and highly interactive because you know you're able to interact with the video and we are interacting because you're moving you're seeing things in all 360 degrees and this isn't actually leaves much more is much better impression than the you know 30-second video most of the time you know will me actually had this you know has said to people who are talking the first time they actually thought that this is much better experience there are challenges to you know customer adoption because we don't know why you should buy virtual reality I mean the concern virtual reality is the supply driven industry we see a lot of tech giant's Google Facebook Microsoft Samsung LG they're all jumping into this space telling that virtual reality so great but actually most of the people out there have not really gone out there and try the virtual reality experience so when I actually tell them you got to go by oculus rift it was cost about five hundred ninety nine dollars or go buy your HTC vive for $799 people are puzzled because they only know why do you go out there and buy it because we have we don't really have the customer meeting point yet where people are you know willing to learn the virtue of like real experience and I should pay for it and design ergonomics one time I was in the game show and in this I showed this that virtual relate has said that we built and then this gentleman got so excited that there's a girlfriend behind them and say hey honey you gotta come and try this out and she refused you know why her reason was that it's gonna ruin my makeup if there's a big phone you know attached the virtual reality headset you wear this it's gonna definitely erase your pretty makeup up here and she said it's gonna ruin my hair because we've got that's like third string attached to it and this can actually split you're headed to half so he's gonna it's not gonna look pretty right so she refused and one time also you know we had a you know high school kids trying our head said it was all sweaty too sweaty and zit face actually and hears about this like worrying has said and we're trying to give this headset to another person and he refused I'm not worrying this builds bros right so you know design ergonomics another challenge and it's not really fashionable right if you see something I'm wearing it you guys so there are three videos and then did they look cool probably not right it's not it's not something that you want to be wearing everything and you know showing the public so it looks a little geeky and nerdy right now but in the future I think it's going to be much smaller and it's what's better design contains another issue you know how do you tell the compelling we are storing you know in normal advertisement world when we see things in 2d flat screen you have a full control of the camera movement so you know camera directors would be able to show the scenes that you they want to show you about in virtual realities of 360 video so the audience actually the full control of the you know the view they want to see so you can't look around so how can you direct your audience to see your message right how do you actually control that so that's something that you have to be really struggling with and also simulation sickness you know a lot of people kind of feel sick after wearing VR goggles when you feel a lot of motion so when you're standing still and then we're in this fear headset and then you see a lot of motion the your visual sensory is not matching with the your current body stage so then you start to feel busy whoa so that is something you have to be worrying about and actually I'm thinking about when you're designing your advertisement in VR and the hardware you know we still have not enough you know resolutions in the panel and we actually need to have a longer last battery life to I was talking to one of the folks in the discovery VR booth and then you know we were discussing some of the challenges and definitely we were this self empowered hmd when you but watch you know an hour and a half and then your battery dies and this is a really panicky moment you know there's in the modern world that human feels panicky in two situations one when your batteries really low flashing red or your wife is dead right so we live in a world where having a self is very important and then this actually drives a lot of battery and saphir wireless to you know a lot of the cutting edge AMD's to go why are attached in so you're not really free to move around right so that's actually sums up my presentation thank you thank you very much gentlemen amazing fascinating thought-provoking and a little bit scary all at the same time thank you so much we're running way way late all thanks to mr. Charlie crow everything's his fault in case you hadn't picked that up but we may be looking for one question if there's anyone got a burning question yeah first guy with his hand up we've got just time for one question I'm really sorry I've got loads of questions as well but grab the guys afterwards and I'm sure they'll answer all your questions but we have time for one so let's do that it's David from an eval my question was for Blippar I was wondering if the technology works for something like a news article so can you highlight say an article about brexit and then it will pull up contextual articles that will give you more information about that story simple questions simple answer yeah guys thank you so much an idea as well it was fantastic thank you so much
