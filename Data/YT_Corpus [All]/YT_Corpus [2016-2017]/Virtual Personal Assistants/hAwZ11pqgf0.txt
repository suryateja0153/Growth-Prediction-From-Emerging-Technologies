to work from home typically this type of job requires you to have strong clerical skills whether it's internet research skills someone that is very highly organized and have a strong background in clerical even if you don't just someone that is very prompt and can complete tasks in a timely manner and as far as equipment all you will need is basically your computer whether it's a desktop laptop or Mac computer with reliable internet connection now some tasks may involve you completing phone calls so as long as you have a reliable phone line whether it's your personal cell phone or your home line then that is all you need in order to get started now you don't need a landline so let me you know specify that you don't need a slam line in order to work for any of these companies so let's
