 hey guys this is dan from the corporate DBS you're watching the corporate thief beat on youtube com don't forget to love like and subscribe to the channel guys thank you very much appreciate it you on how to sell a mixtape is another promo video for the video course on my website so don't forget to check out that it takes from A to Z on how to set up and sell your mixtape or your album on your own website and how to sell it online for easy course guides only five steps and it's really easy and I'll show you exactly what to do we follow me over the shoulder with the screen share and you know exactly how to set up website and moving on guys to today's video and I'm kind of kind of going back over something that I kind of talked about in one of the second or third videos where it came to fiber and talk about the blogs and I forgot that i have a great resource on my site how did i forget this and this is where I this is my own cheat sheet this is where I've written down notes on all these sites that I've studied so these are all hip-hop blogs or 700 or maybe more than others 800 I think i've updated and not so long ago maybe in February or generate so it's not that old the updated version and this is a hip-hop blogs cheat sheet and the link for this hip-hop blogs cheat sheet will be underneath the video you can get that download sent to your email address and the rap logs she she has the facebook link of the group the hip-hop blog it has the Twitter page it has links to where you can contact them I don't give them their email addresses on this because one they change all the time to they'll probably just got bombarded and it's a waste of time so I just send you to the links of the contact page you can have a thing a little notepad ready on your site and there's spaces for you to put fill in your own notes I talk about their advertising on that they gave on their sites it's a really good cheat sheet and you should use it to your advantage and how do you start using this cheat sheet well if you don't have that much rep as an artist yet the best way to go out is to go out and ask these sites do they need any help things they could use is album reduce or Kendrick Miller or King Jigme learn if Kim trick Lamar drop the mixtape or an album tomorrow and you guys can do a review of down album and give them that review ask him what they need a lot of the time its content a lot of the time they noticed that I create marketing videos that I asked me for some marketing and advice or they asked me to create an article for their sites and stuff like that so that's the niche that I mean that's the kind of thing that I was able to offer these websites and you just have to kind of come up and ask them what they need that's only if you don't have enough rep you got a lot of traffic you got a lot of people coming to your site you've got a big email list you've got a big YouTube channel Twitter etc you probably have more leverage but then again there's 700 blogs in this less solid thing I will say is to get some help doing this I did as well go on Fiverr I used freelancer because I just know people on there and I can work with them better nothing wrong with fibers well this guy here will work as your virtual assistant for an hour same as these key people look at the reviews of these people before you take them on ask them to create like a lot of template responses for these websites so before they start going out contacting them to promote your mixtape and ask them to create multiple kind of candid responses so you're not sending out the same generic email all the time that will eventually get trapped in their spam filter so the more emails that you create that have that don't sound the same so what I mean by that is I I just kind of go into my my gmail where you can kind of create your own responses so you just create a load of different responses a lot of different templates for emails so it won't say hi my name is Dan every single email it will kind of start off differently each time and this just makes it more successful to get into the inbox of these hip-hop blogs things I will also mention that I had a great conversation with a guy from the the artist shortcut com his name is Darius really cool cool guy and he talks a lot about approaching hip-hop blogs the podcast is it up yes but it should be on by the time this video is is released and definitely check out that podcast because he talks about this kind of reaching out to hip-hop blogs a lot and he does have good information and it's not easy to do another reason why i always suggest that you go and get virtual assistants to kind of take care of this work it might cost you a little bit of money to do but the reason why i will it's you don't always get the best response from certain blogs okay in my experience i noticed that it would make me angry when someone said they didn't like it or they just don't want to hear myself and it's very hard not to take a person you
