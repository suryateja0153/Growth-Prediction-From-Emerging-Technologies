I'm the gal for you I am the chief flight officer hello so that's as we are that's great thank you look so let's jump on into our content because we have a lot of things to talk about tonight and people are always wondering well you know I do everything by myself I don't know really how to grow my business and virtual interns is the answer we know we see it all the time companies double their profits by utilizing virtual interns so here's the problem let's talk about virtual first and both of you have virtual businesses which you know you're way ahead of the curve you're already doing what people dream about doing you know Zeph I know that you where you know probably you don't have any pants on right now no I dubai in my pjs today okay well I have my slippers on so you know just to give you a sense um but let's talk a little bit about virtual because I think one of the thing is companies can't even fathom how we do what we do so let's start off with Robert Robert why don't you talk a little bit about how working virtually works for you and your company sure well you know I also i look at virtual if you're not working across the desk from someone in my mind your virtual if you're in your office you're emailing someone that's virtual so unless they're physically in the same spaces you in my mind it's virtual so for me outings adventures like I imagined I run it from a laptop so it's it's either from my micro studio here or it's from a coffee shop a yogurt shop restaurant wherever it might be more but I can get a Wi-Fi connection becomes my office and then I'm working with teams there um in different places throughout the country whether it be my graphic my graphics team my team working on all the wordpress on my virtual interns we're all different time zones and different locations working together virtually that is awesome Zef what about you because your interns are around the world yeah so when I started my business right I'm like okay here's the fact that I don't like to go to work at somewhere else I just want to go to work where I am right so at that time probably about 5 10 years ago people that still are people are still like you know why would you not want to go out listen everybody has to dream I like I want to work from home right and then this this home business industry came through and people fell in love with it for me working for sure is giving me the freedom to work wherever I want like a you know Robert was saying and whenever I want literally and my team knows this I work on different time zones on different days sometimes I wake up in the morning I'm in France today you know and I think it gives us the ability to really work at our creative best I don't know what time is best for you for me it's working from 12am just six a.m. in the morning so I work virtually literally with a team of global entrance they could be in front and I could be like yeah i mean the time zone right now you know and it makes it so much easier because i had this dream that i did not have to wake up at the alarm clock right Oh fight traffic just to get to work hello or maybe I just like to go to work dress waist up I don't have to shower I don't have to brush my teeth but I'm being present and i'm working with a global team that makes perfect sense for me and that was like my dream and I think that's what I had in mind when I started you know building like this is online so having a virtual team makes really great sense for me and finish doing a build on that know is I'm give you a big plus and a minus the pluses is I can work whenever and for me typically my work schedule is around group fitness classes so i know when i can go to a spin class and i'm going to work before then I'm work after then so I'm scheduling everything around my group fitness closet now the downside is there's always work to do and I can always be working if there's the clock does not shut off unless you know until I shut it all right so there's no there's the plus and minus there but together it's really a fantastic way to be able to work you know Robert ends up he both remind me of a client that we had who was working in a Manhattan office they were paying in the excess of a million dollars for rent every year and when they started working with us and we help them with their virtual internship program in about three they said we're starting to think about going completely virtual for our entire company and it was really cool when they have the realization that every time that they're on the phone they're working virtually and every time they're texting they're working virtually and I asked them a question I got all of them on skype one day and they were all in their board room and I said to them well when you come into the office what's the first thing that you all do and each one of them one of them said I got again on my email and I said okay you don't have to be in the office to get on your email right and he goes no and then the next guy said well I call my my head of the departments and I said okay so that's on the loan right and I started seeing their faces when they have that realization of oh my god one of the guys by the way lived in Connecticut and he had an hour-and-a-half commute every day yep one way one way yes and I said that's three hours of your life that you can have back if you have an awesome home office you can still meet with your people every day you can still see them you can still you know have the vibrancy of what you have feel and half now but you're going to save yourself a ton of money well they end up becoming a virtual company and right off the top they sit they saved a million dollars just on real estate think about them when you add in their time their effort um you know their operational costs not having to have an office space for every person on the team not to have to pay for and then think about their team and how much of an improvement they all got in their lives working virtually if you're not doing it now maybe you should consider that you should with the technology re do it we don't know what am I one of my hobbies is reading studies on happiness and and one of the one of the topics they I see a liquid issues which is quite prevalent is the amount of time people have to commute to their job is a major determinant determination of someone's happiness and that is deterrence as well so that commute has such dramatic impact on people with virtual we're taking away those those our commutes say that p what I was going to say with Teddy technology advancements that we have and the fact that we live in a very technology driven world right all this things are made available to us to have a better quality of life of course that's also the downside of it everything has to be half a balance everything has to be managed right so i think is the fact that the century that we live in now and especially with the Millennials coming in into the workforce you know the the quality of life and what we want in our lives have changed it used to be go to school get a good job and then get you know you'll be taken care of but now these days if I have to travel two hours one way einen I don't care how much you're paying me so that thing you know those things are coming around that type of discussions you know people want a much more much better quality of life versus more money it's true and I'm not saying that we're not caring about money who doesn't but I think people are paying more attention to the quality of life that we want to live I agree so if I have a quick question for you we want to invite Lindsay in cuz lindsey is here and she would be great to talk about her her aspect on it how do i invite lindsay n the lindsay could just call into the cotton button there's a that's a circle in the indeed the other square Lindsay all you have to do is just click on it call it and then up we will approve her to take the seat okay great ah yes right okay Lindsay I think you're trying to call me thank you for joining us Lindsey so Lindsay why don't you give a quick introduction to yourself and then I would love to know why because you know you're you're working virtually you're doing you're doing social media I do you love it so interesting well my name is Lindsay and I currently am the senior social media specialist for super interns and so I am doing Facebook at the moment I just graduated from college in June so I am freshly out of college and basically I decided to go with super interns just because they were virtual and you know gaming experience is like the biggest thing when you try to send out a resume or whatever having experience is so important I have been down that road so many times that I know that you have to pretty much have experience um in order to really even have people consider you for an interview I have sent out tons of resumes and because of my lack of experience I guess you could say I have hardly got interviews so super interns gave me the opportunity to be able to get that experience and so that for me was the biggest thing being able to work virtually just because you know where how else are you gonna get experience besides doing it virtually so that is my take on it right well and where you are you may not find those opportunities right in your neighborhood so working virtually you can work with any company anywhere in the world and build your skills so what's what's your favorite benefit that you've gotten from working virtually um my favorite is there one thing that bubbles up are you a just um probably the fact that I get to work with so many like great people um because at some point in your life you're going to have to be in an office setting and so the fact that you get to work with your team members specifically a lot and then you work with other teams and it just gives you a chance to you know it gives you a chance to work with a community or a team of people that you know will eventually help you in the real world if you eventually get a job that's not virtual or a career that isn't virtual or whatever so I think and where are some of your teammates located um well Anna for example is located in Australia so that is a very huge time difference from where I am in Washington State and where she is so obviously I would never get to work with Emma in person so I get to work with her that's not true the next time that you go to Australia I think Emma's gonna want to meet you but I have to be thinking bigger lensing um and so I have Emma and then Jeremy he lives in Philadelphia so he's obviously across the u.s. and I can't think of where anyone else is from at the moment those are but they're all their own lives yeah they're not you know no one is just set in one place everyone you know is from different places so you get to meet people of all likes you know it's really nice i really like it really cool excellent yeah robert did you want to talk about maybe do with a little sir it would be great to find out from from our audience our who is working virtually who out there are you working virtually or are you not working virtually so yeah if anybody's doing any work virtually type me so we know who you are so uh you know we get to see who is actually working virtually I mean who doesn't these days come on it's like it's a new culture you know like are you working with ya if you're not working working virtually then i'll look at you this way what right so I do that a lot oh my gwad me so sometimes i'm not in I'm not poo-pooing and on anybody but it's just the fact that it comes down to what do you want and what you what you want your quality quality of life to be for me I decided I want a a little bit of a different quality of life where I don't have to wake up at five six or seven and be on other people's you know clock or if I have to be somewhere just because they want me to be there it's it's just about what type of quality of life do you want you know sometimes it's just about not spending two hours on the Train one way right so yeah Schneider is quite the schedule on virtual intern working full-time and in school wow you would have never been able to do all that if you worked aight aight an office job right so yeah because that's really amazing yes so she's like the multitasker extraordinaire that Sandra pretty yeah please do not explode I'm Jeremy that's awesome Jeremy Jeremy is kind of our a quiet comedian I really I really do appreciate that well for those of you who just joined this i'm here with our co-host robert geller the chief adventure officer of outings and adventures and our guests Zeb's am chief flight officer of entrepreneurs that sore and our spotlight is Lindsay Lindsay Justin and she is our senior social media specialist for super entrance com so now I think we need to get around to the next question and this is a problem too and I always hear people say interns can't help me so let's dig in zup you have had interns for how long and then I also want to know how have interns helped you double your profit last year I've had interns say probably close to five years now and do it haven't you all heard this I want another me I'll want another version of me I wanted a diversion of my right hand and I found that in my entrance right because I've had the fortune of working with some of the best global interns just not local I globally up and they really have helped me you know double my profits because thing about this right I all of us we all have very special skill sets and we're good at certain things so having them on the team has allowed me to focus on what I'm good at and I know I can do so much better where else they're there as my support system helping to do all the other stuff that I know I can delegate right so this way I can go on further and make it making more profits and while I have a great support system this is how my team has helped me done with my profits because they have allowed me to be the person that I need it to be for the business that makes sense so that's it does so that's how you know people always ask me like how do you do all this things like you know oh my god you put the 13 chose 22 speakers in 12 days I'm like well I don't have a magic wand by do have a team of interns you know I always need another Zeb I actually have a few zips around made so that works yeah yeah and Robert you are you're kind of new to having new virtual interns so how our interns going to help you double your profits this year well I'm not looking to double if I don't quintuple with the feet of a virtual insurance then then I'm not a good leader I'm actually looking to take take my company in a whole new direction and we are working on that as we speak that it is a process so um and it's interesting you know who's I've I've mentioned no delegating delegating is a very big piece of it and often one might think from the outside well what can you give an intern and I just have to look at my desk which is just right here in front of me and there are usually stacks of mechanism okay here's one so we've got this tactical show this down so those stacks are not far and really wit it enables me to delegate excuse an example is its social media or it's our website development and then it allows me that to go off on working on building relationship that only I can do because I'm having those face-to-face or even virtual of meetings that are substantial contracts and so by inviting all the delegates other tasks I can then go in another direction and and it's working as we speak actually I'm pretty excited about this that we have three major contracts right now that like the ink is is drawing on those and those are going to be catapult the company in this new direction that we're going and I'm able to do that because I am being freed up with the health of the virtual interns exactly exact is awesome I mean when you think about when do you make your most money as a business owner are you making your most money when you're I don't know if I'm writing a blog the answer is no yeah um first of all I'm not that great of a writer I mean I'm okay but I'd rather give writing to a team of interns virtual interns who love writing who wants to have that experience and skill and get it for the resume in their portfolio because I'm better at getting the deals I'm better at making the money and being in front of clients and selling them and so I think when we think about this you know it's a really um it's a really important mindset that I think a business owner has to take on and just say I'm not good at everything I'm going to give that stuff to people who were much more talented than I am so I love your answer Robert not only is it about your giving that that that project but it's also on the flip side what a great resume builder you know for those interns working without any adventures you're building a website your your help you're part of this team for us we're launching a portal and we're going from 0 to 60 in just seconds and that is from from the interns perspective what what a great resume builder being part of that team and being able to show and document no we started at with this many email addresses we started with this ranking on Alexa we started with this no of social media followers and then that in turn is able to document boom I was a part of this twenty-five percent code I was a part of these dollars that came in so it in such a win-win on both sides Lindsay can speak to that so Lindsay have you seen growth on your resume since you've been working with us yeah I would say so um I mean before coming to super interns all i had was volunteer experience really on my resume i didn't have work experience of any kind so being that i was able to add you know like you know team building or you know whatever working with a team and being able to manage social media pages and like being able to add all these things to my resume it definitely makes me look more like I have more experience i guess i can say than what I had before just because now you know I'm doing it with a reputable company and all that kind of stuff so it definitely helps in adding those certain skills that certain employers or hiring managers are looking for just because you know they may want that one person that can do a social media you know manage a social media page or being able to work with a team or you know there's just those hints the things that they may look for you know that you have I'm just curious Lindsay did you know how a resume should look before you started doing this internship um I could you know about results it did did you know that that we cared about money how money gets made and how we save money and did you know that that any of those things were important on a resume um not particularly I think I hadn't had a few classes that kind of like just had told you you know how it should look but not you know it just kind of depended on what it was that was on there so that was really the only thing that I ever learned about you know what I was supposed to have on a resume so probably not that specifically but yeah I knew partially so you've learned that yeah in your experience okay great mm-hmm well Robert do you think it's time to do another survey oh and we've got a question here so let's take the question maybe first and then we'll do a survey group so can I get an idea of your costs for interns compared to regular VA's great question so depending upon how you work with the company on a VA you're pretty much going to be paying them an hourly rate and you can get them relatively inexpensive um you know there's VA's that you know really super highly professional VA's that you'll want to do specific things for your company and then you know some of the other things like database entry that's a great job for a VA you don't have to pay them as much the major difference though doug is so much the cost factor because interns can be as expensive or less than VA but the thing that's really important is an intern looks at your business different than a VA an intern will be more about the project and really understanding the business aspects of your business versus a VA is kind of task oriented so for example if i do have database entry I'm never giving that to an intern it's not a good internship an intern needs to do things like for example our database dynamos one of the things they do for us as they gather reports they do analysis and then they present to our team here's what we learned here's what happened in the last week here's what we need to change here's what we need to do again because we did such a great job there that's the recommendations and and that sort of thing if I have my database dynamos just do database entry that would be a terrible internship for them and it also you know it's a task-oriented thing so I would more than likely give that to a BA to do so I hope that answered your question so Robert you ready to go on to a survey yes well this goes out I should have drunk it two different ways that is um for all the business owners out there what would you think would be a task a project for virtual interns so many business owners out there is go ahead and throw in some idea is that what you think your interns would work on and then for our interns out there that are working virtually what are what are you working on going to share some of that information like like I have virtual insurance working on my wordpress a website so that one project that I have for my virtual interns yeah Zef what is um what's a project that you give to your team so some examples that I do like my video production will basically put like a video trailer I'll say you know this is what the video trailers objective is and you come up with a draft and we'll review the content and they'll they'll do the design the content the production and putting them together that's a video trailer and then for our social media coordinator they kind of planned the content based on what what content needs to be repurposed you know and set up the editorial calendars for us and my PR intern will set up plans for us and maybe create media kits that we sent out to our guests and co-host to get them prepped up for the shows so they set it up for us and communications things that you know they need to develop anyways the skill sets they need to develop so those are some great examples of the the projects I I have them on and you just keep going on and on and on and on because you have figured out the recipe when you whip when you first started you were like I'm not sure what an intern should do for me now you're like oh my god i need another 20 i need to 10 of me in 10 of everybody in the team you know so yeah yeah that's always I don't think to do and what I in fact I I was hoping you could come in I I had a Russian intern who attended school franklin Marshall in Virginia and he was our HR intern he goes like I would never have learned this if I did not take on this internship he says I and I could never have you know improve my English I could never have in or develop my confidence of being on camera or even interviewing people and the best thing about the most rewarding thing for me is to even sometimes see my talents on camera the first day they were on camera right and having that meeting with me because I have everybody record their sessions with me and then just watch their confidence like oh my god you're ready to take on the world and this particular intern actually was interviewing a potential candidate for a new intake and that new intake said to him I didn't know that you're an intern I'm like Edward that's how much this guy had grown that you know you never tell he's just an intern because he has we have groomed him from zero to hero in my adult I'm it's whatever just an intern is I think people have a perception that affects you coffee right and they clean your file cabinets and that's not what they do and here's another thing and I think this is tips to all the business owners out there I don't treat my entrance like interns I treat them like they're my peers I treat them like they are my backup support system I develop their mindset that you have skin in the game right because you have a lot to lose if you don't do your job or do your assignments as you know you're required to if you don't have skin in the game you don't feel like you belong you will never grow and develop those skill sets right so we actually from day one we train them to think that out that way and sometimes I stretch them I put them out of their comfort level but when they graduate oh my god right they go like I'm ready to take on the world and I love that because I can't say more because it really makes my heart melt to see them like I can take on the world now Pete's right yes almost you know i have to say i don't i don't like using the word interns i almost kind of like almost a little embarrassed because their team members and and their a vital part of our team and I i I'd asleep internally we don't use for an intern oh they're they're a team member there they're doing their part they're carrying their weight we are growing this business together right I also call them talents you know and I call them talents of my team sore so that in itself sets their mindset and I don't I heartily allow them to give up I hardly allow them to wine because if they whine I said listen if you why now can you imagine what it would be in the real world I said this is nothing you know and as you know thing yes if you want to be the best of the best of the crops out there you want a competitive in the new world especially because I think one of the biggest challenge I don't know if Robert you and Julie have this challenge in the beginning also with your team members is that sometimes if they are not accustomed to working virtually right they have this challenge with time management I mean don't even start with them we have that challenge too yes a fact that if you don't we don't get them straightened out in the early stages of their internship that they will really try to you know they would really try it all really tried hard to make sure that they don't fail and I don't allow them to give up because once they give up I said that's you know when you go out in the real world that's going to set you up for failure immediately so I it's all about the mindset and getting them ready for the real world so yeah I think this is owners sometimes and not necessarily open to that you know they're like oh you mean I have to do all this work without like yeah you know you're taking on somebody your grooming them so yeah it's a little bit of work on our end to look for Julie there's a question over here yeah and I was reading that there was a question about the ten to fifteen dollars are we talking about ten to fifteen dollars an hour and can they both be full or part-time so when we talk about interns interns really should be doing ten hours a week and that's if their unpaid and unpaid internships are legal and wonderful and can be fantastic for people that can't get a paid internship a paid internship can be ten to fifteen dollars it can be minimum wage and that can maybe be ten hours maybe 20 hours we don't recommend that becomes a lot a lot a lot of hours because um people have lives and they have a probably a job that they go to or they're going to school or they have a husband or they have children or they have you know other things in their lives so we really do when it comes two interns we like to say ten hours is the perfect amount everyone can find ten hours a week they can do a 200-hour internship which is 20 weeks they really kind of get in there and they get to know what the what the activities should be and that's what we find to be the sweet spot so I hope I answered your question there was another question um and that is what's the difference between a virtual intern and an assistant really good question um an assistant is somebody who is a task-oriented so again I have an assistant I have an assistant I pay her um I actually called her my mistress of sanity um and what she does is she takes care of emails or she'll go grocery shopping for me she'll take care of all kinds of tasks that i may have I would never give those things to an intern an intern needs to have something there's a very high value value to them something that they would be proud of to put on their resume what they're doing a paid or unpaid internship and we believe it super interns calm that both are important we would love to pay everybody not every company can pay their interns what we have found in paid internships is that does not guarantee that you're going to get the best people what you really are looking for are people who want to get experience skill and knowledge they want a mentor they want somebody that they can come to with their problems and that they're going to grow with it sell I it's an extension of their schooling it's an extension of their education yeah and whether they're in school or not we believe the interns should be 18 to 88 so for some people who have been out of work you know for two years dead an internship because you want to get out of the unemployment line and you want to get back into the business world and an internship will do that for you he's super Julie of Stephanie missed off sky Kanan she's asking if she can get on for a few a little bit to ask her question if she if you want to bring her in I can go out for a little while I'd love to but before we do that we have somebody else that we need to bring in who's been waiting and that is Meagan Sims so Lindsay we're going to say goodbye to you thank you so much for coming but I over a she ate it yeah we're gonna bring in Megan and then we'll put Stephanie up next okay yay my name is Nick behind I mean by Lindsey ok so now Megan if you will ask for the seat there she is and she's coming on Megan oops probably not not having a good signal or setup not right Megan if you're not on Chrome you need to be on Chrome or Mozilla right now right now chrome is the best browser for it and if you're not getting through just try to refresh your browser ab kiya firefox is having a try some sort of a problem today problem it needs to be on a chrome if you can so if you can just get a chrome that would be great so now let's bring on Stephanie did we say yes yay here's ebony yeah so Stephanie hopefully you're on a different browser hi hey Stephanie Wow well I said I haven't seen you for a while I've been on a lot baby how are you I'm clean okay so what was your question Stephanie I've been longing for a virtual assistant for a long time i co-own a Wellness Center we do acupuncture massage facials and I am a massage therapist and run the practice but I'm actually going to learn a new system tomorrow's called remus broadcasting and it's so complicated in a sense I thought I should get an assistant have them learn it and then whenever I want to do this project or do it just have her do it like how do you go about like finding out where to go you know that kind of thing would that be something having a good virtual assistant would be you know can I answer that real quick for for you to put Julie like real quick yeah all right Stephanie up so I think there's going to be a difference between your definition of virtual assistants and virtual in turn two totally different things alright because from my personal experience virtual intense meets a little bit of skin in the game for you the business owner who has hired them to work with you on your team virtual assistant just like Julie was saying earlier is very task-oriented they don't necessarily want to learn or invest in the invest in getting to know more about what you do they just are here's give me a test tell me what to do I'll get it done where else virtual entrance earn more into the what can I get from this experience is more of Education for them to divide their skill set so that's basically what we're talking about today but you know if you want I can definitely send you a lot of referrals I have here's the good thing right so for some of you folks my previous interns have actually gone I've set them up to start their own businesses that's my reward because I am still having goosebumps because this is what I tell every of my intent because I'm all about the Entrepreneurship how you can take your own destiny into your own hands give you the skill sets Julie I've always said give them a don't give them a fish teach them how to fish so I've set them up some of them have gone out to be great business owners like some of them have been have started their own virtual assistant businesses so I can definitely send you a few names if you'll connect with me Stephanie and I can send you that way if if virtual assistants are who you are looking for Stephanie the window we think about interns is the interns or the bridge from where you are now to being a big company yep so if you want to if your vision is I want to be a company I want to be a multi-million dollar company you're not going to get there with a bunch of bas the way you'll get there is with virtual interns because virtual interns are the closest to employees wow that's pretty so that's the big difference because an assistant of a VA and VA's are awesome I mean again I've got an assistant I think everyone should have them they're important to a business but they're not the thing that's going to help you get from hey I do everything myself to do I have a multi-million dollar company because those were interns the interns will teach you how to become the cup the interns have taught me how to do I have 80 interns and they have taught me how to be a big company so where do you find them and and what they get from it is the experience and and that's what they get which is pretty amazing yeah so so you can find interns a lot of places we help companies that's one of the things we do is we help companies grow by utilizing virtual interns but you can find interns everywhere you can put them on your social media you can say hey I'm needing virtual interns you can put them on your website there's a lot of ways to do it we help companies do all that stuff because when a company starts doing that they've discovered it's a lot of work but we know how to do it all because that's what we're experts in so I hope we answered your question good girl thank you so much for coming on awesome we've got to get to our next spotlight person because i think megan is waiting to get on yeah be sure to connect if you want to send some your way Stephanie you know some referrals for you if you're looking to hire in a virtual assistants so thank you Stephanie and we're trying to get Megan on oh there she is hello everybody hey Megan so I can thank you for coming to the show please introduce yourself hello everybody my name of any of you morons I am the senior public relations agent for super interns com I live in Chicago Illinois and I'm a recent graduate from Northern Illinois University with my back through science and communications awesome Megan we're dying to know because Stephanie ask this question she said why would we want to intern except for the experience can you tell everybody why I mean if it's making ten hours you can do a lot of stuff in 10 hours you can watch an athletics you can give yourself a facial every day you could get in the bathtub and eat bonbons you know I'm starting to actually think that I liked all these ideas that I feel now Megan why would you choose an internship what are you getting from that well I chose to do an internship to make sure that what I want to do for my future is what I'm into so like I'm in public relations agent for super insurance com I want to make sure that I really want to be a public relations agent you know even though I'm gradual anything I graduated so and i also want to run my own business and part of that is to part of the businesses for me to first set up a public relations agency part of that business so that's the reason why I did the internship part of the whole thing and you've gotten a first-hand experience so you know some of the inside secrets now don't you just yep yep little bit so that is awesome um Robert do we have another problem that we should talk about today well you know we've touched on something and that is you know if someone's ever want to talk to you about this if someone said to you I don't know where to start a business it was saying where we start what kind of problems what I would be best to give to an intern what would you tell them gosh where do I start literally no but I would really think you think about right what is the most time-consuming thing that is on your plate right now but you know you can delegate that out to somebody but when i say delegate it's not about like hey okay just just send it to somebody meaning that you can probably give it to an intern and probably that in turn can do it better than you do that's basically what i would start with right just like what you said Julie kiss here's the thing i know my personality and I know how I deliver and presenting my content better so i am very audio-visual i'm not saying that i cannot write a copy you know for sales letter or sales page and all landing page whatever it will just take me so so long to write this because I'm always overthinking stuff right so this is something that a copywriting intern or a content either a writing in turn can do for you because I can literally just say what I want and probably put in a recorded audio and send it to him or her and say this is the objective of this ject here's what I want you to do ABCDE and that's how you can start right and I always tell everybody don't overthink things right start with one because if you start thinking like okay I'm going to get an intern today oh my god I'm looking at my calendar i'm looking at that holy cow i have so much the more you do that you're going to get overwhelmed and you cannot deliver and cannot delegate well to your intent they're gonna get confused they're gonna get flustered just as you are they wouldn't know where to start and you I know how to delegate that's always we start with one not three not five not 71 okay and I i will start everybody at that and that's how we start our interns do they have a week period for orientation that I say to them you start here and then you get another call you start here again so it's a process it's it's not an overnight success so it's always a journey so start with one and also she touched on there and that is having a clear path it's not you know you know I mean all of these entrepreneurs we can be a little scattered at times and we're just distracted and squirrel and then we're just go this direction note how about this to do this it's really being focused giving a task sync it through and not just you know okay there's something new on my desk now we'll give to the internal something else on my desk in return no it's having a clear path clear expectation and in a clear idea what that project is Robert definitely what go ahead dream well I was just I'm curious to know what Megan thinks because Megan being the senior PR agent I mean Megan if you didn't do and if you didn't have the team you had who would be doing all that work myself honestly i'm glad that i do have the team that i have and is this made some what is made this so much easier because instead of me you know reaching out and trying to get like you know different like 40 to 60 clients every week we got people reaching out to like this mini this week and this mean that we can making sure that we're not calling this IP so that way it makes our job a lot easier to gives me more time to work on different projects that you know people have for me so right and I have to say if I didn't have a PR team I don't know how we would do half the things that we do because I would never get around to it I don't have the time for it it's important obviously it's important for any company to have strategies and to have you know p a p our presence so if i want to you know send out a press release really quick I've got my team that can write one up and get it out there for me but if I'm all by myself I may not even think oh I need to you know write a story about a movie that's coming out about interns you know that's one of the things a movie came out about int about Robert De Niro was the intern and you know I was like okay PR agents we got to write a story we wrote a story we got it out there and you know boom people started coming to us saying I'm 80 years old and I want to be an intern just a quick funny story I'm actually in the middle of watching that now bike in between stuff so it's actually a pretty good movie so so thank you for your recommendation okay great all right well let's um you know for those of you they're just joining our show the topic is a virtual interns and double your profits and i'm here with co-host robert geller who is the chief adventure officer of outings and the ventures and Zeb's an hour chief flight officer of entrepreneurs that sore and our spotlight is Meagan Sims who's our senior PR agent for super interns calm um so do we have any other questions that's coming on right now um I think we got through all the questions was there do you guys have any questions for each other is there anything that you want to know that maybe we haven't talked tapped into no actually like Meghan is such a resource here Megan for you to be the most efficient for you to get as much as you can out of your internship what has been best way for your supervisor to your team leader in giving you Direction from your perspective what has helped you have the most effective internship actually for myself it's been autonomy so with me learning I tend to learn by myself and me of course with help some pointers it's great but I sent you know kinda didn't solve my own problems myself so having that autonomy for me it's helped me in my internship because I can go like okay I did this and then be like SJ be like oh you know fixed assistance in this and I have the time like okay this is what she wanted me to do let me fix that and I know for the next time so having that just that autonomy is one thing that's helped me be the best I can out of this internship well there's a model the model to the interval we having that interim like that that is taking it upon themselves that's fantastic that's what we're all looking for as a team member and because in the real world that's what we're looking for so to have that skill set at that early on a kudos you Megan thank you know what Robert you're you're bringing up something though that is really about company and their values because I think if you set up your company you have to do everything and that you know your control freak and by the way a lot of entrepreneurs are there also perfectionist which can create paralysis and so if you let go those two things all the control and if you stop trying to be perfect you will have amazing interns that will come into your business they will love you because you're not going to tell them everything I mean I'm thinking of one of my teammates right now who you know when he first started he was kind of on his own a little bit and he was blogging and is grown in this leadership way where I I'll come into a meeting and I kind of like sit back and just listen and awe there's no reason for me to even show up that day sometimes I say to myself I don't even have to show up that the company is going to run itself and I do feel bad that way on some days other days I think we have disaster zones everywhere and that will happen but I think when you set yourself up to be that kind of company that nothing that anything anything you know I make mistakes all the time so nothing that Megan does is going to ruin my business you know and besides that megan has the best interest of the company in her heart because she understands what our purpose is well and that comes top down that that's a quick that's a culture that SJ you created it and then evidently it is coming down and permeating through every aspect into your movie your internship as well so that's fantastic so well we're getting close to the end of our show here so I'm just going to say a few more things um I think I need to mention that if you want or need interns because some people may be saying well ok now I need interns and I get it so if you want or need interns go to super interns com forward slash services forward slash debt dash interns or you can just go to super entrance calm and click on the button that says get interns and we will talk with you will meet with you for a half hour and we'll just talk to you about your business and how you can utilize interns and did you guys have any other questions for each other Megan I even asked oh go ahead z I don't have question but i do want to kind of say some things that all right so this is mostly from the business end of things right for the business owners right yeah so i'm saying this because I I may work differently from all of you out there just because I have invested interest I truly have invested interest in my talented team okay here's the thing many people come in say okay I do want an intern but they're not really prepared to have an intent and I'm saying this not to step on anybody's toes you can be a coach you can be an awesome celebrity person right trainer offer whatever yo you know however you're rocking your boat but the thing is that if you're not ready to work with an intern it may not be best for you to work with one here's why all right when I got into the program and learning how to you know work with engines I'm like oh you know we that's a preconceived notion out there about working with interns that's number one that's always going to be there but we're breaking all this various right now but the fact that as business owners if you're a business owner you should understand this and especially if you're a coach you have to really understand this because in order for you to invest your time and work with an intent it's not about just giving them like oh here go write a task-oriented you could just hire virtual assistants for that but you're interested in the growth in how to help them fish forever there's a little bit of skin in the game for you and here's my thought process for you because you're passing on some of you your most important you know you're delegating some of your priceless works work right because you also need to learn to delegate number one so you need to have processes that you know you can just pass it on to your to your new talent and have them do what they need to do and let them be and grow with it because if you don't understand your own process you're going to confuse the heck out of the talent does that make sense because I don't want to work with you if you're wondering why interns don't want to work with you that's probably why they can't sense that you don't understand what your business is all about number one you don't have it all together and they're thinking oh my god they're going to just put this into my lap and if you don't understand your process and you're thinking they're just going to come on to your team make it an easy for you then you might not be ready to work with a tinted sometimes I think maybe business owners don't think about that because here's what I tell my interns I'm here it's a two ways I'm here to learn from you and you of the one for me right and we're in this partnership I set them straight it's a partnership it's not like you're just getting stuff from you I'm going to learn from you to write is we come from two different generations and most of the time not many business owners are willing to do that because they feel like they just have to tell them what to do and be done with it that's not how I roll how i roll is I'm invested in the growth of my talents because it's important because when they leave my internship is a reflection of who they are and what my business is absolutely right absolutely so think about that and be mindful about it that's great so thank you so much you can feel like work with quite a quite a number of tail is right definitely so you guys were at the end of our show just again say who you are how people can get hold of you you know Robert you're on Twitter they people can reach out to you right now and become a follower Zeph you to Megan you too so Robert go ahead and start i'll keep adventure officer other than adventures I look at these it's interns is also as a way to interact all way to have a positive influence on
