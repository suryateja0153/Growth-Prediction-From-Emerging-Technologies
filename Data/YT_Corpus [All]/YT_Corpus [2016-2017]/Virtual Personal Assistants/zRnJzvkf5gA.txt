 good morning on now we are going to see a presentation on mobile IP I am Keiko Sheik apcs a session of our College of Engineering and Technology Salem mobile IP so before going to see what is mobile IP let us see what is the need for going for mobile IP when your mobile node which is most from one place to another place normally it may be a mobile phone or a PDA or when it moves from one place to another place consider a home network that is in London so where the mobile node actually presents and it moves to a foreign into a Tokyo there is a need for the mobile node to change its IP address so whenever the IP address is changed the mobile node usually moves from one place to another place for frequent of times so whenever it moves it there is a need for the mobile node to change its IP address so there is a problem in creation of there is a problem in communication when the mobile node moves from one network to another network so in order to avoid that we are going for a mobile IP so let us see how that mobile IP solves this problem of disconnection when the mobile node moves from one place to another place so what is mobile IP the mobile IP enables an IP node to retain the same IP address on maintain and existing communications while traveling from one link to another another important definition is a mobile IP is designed to allow mobile devices users to move from one network to another while maintaining a permanent IP address so the mobile IP enables the users to create to retain its same IP address while moving from one network to another whether it is from one place to another place the mobile node does not need to change its IP or transmit news when it moves to your new locations so in previous we have seen that when home network is London the mobile node is the IP address is seventy one point thirteen point two not four point zero it changes to toe ten point four point seventy nine point zero when it moves to Tokyo this changing of IP address is not needed in using in mobile IP so that enables IP you know to read in the same IP address and moving from one link to another place so mobile IP so this is the simple structure of working of immobilizing and the mobile I nod visiting Network so there isn't home network as the screen here indicates on the right side the home network is the network where the mobile node actually belongs to on the foreign head for a network is the network where the mobile node is currently belonging and the correspondent node is the lower which wants to communicate with the mobile node so this is the typical or structure of here mobile IP so you will see what are the mobile IP component components that should be and used in the available that is what one is the mobile node second is the home agent foreign agent and correspondent so this is the working of your mobile IP then we will see what is this mobile node and we will come back to the working mobile node is nothing but they are normally a cell phone your personal digital assistants or your laptop which communicates with the user's home agent the home engine is which belongs to the home network as I already said the home network is the network where the mobile node actually belongs to the home agent it is here router on the home network on serving as an anchor point for communication with the moment that is maybe like an a Rooter or an entry point by which we can double by which the mobile node can be asses in the home network so it also tunnels the packets from devices on the Internet is called correspondent load to the roaming mobile node so when you have corresponding node wants to communicate with the mobile node you terminus the pocket to that mobile Lord where it is actually where the mobile node is actually present see a tunnel where the tunnel is in the tunneling what is that a Lisa that is a imaginary path that is existing between the foreign agent under home agent is given the body a tunnel is established between the home agent and a reachable point of here mobile load in the corner that is usually a foreign agent so what is a foreign agent the foreign agent is your router that may function as your point of attachment to the mobile node when it goes through you for ended on the same which is similar to the home agent functions of the home agent but it isn't for in a term that will delivers a packet from the home agent to the mobile or the home agent simply forwards the packet that are coming here onto the foreign agent foreign agent will follow the packet to the mobile node the corresponding R is one which communicate with the mobile or as I already said no cosmonaut which communicates with the mobile image so how it works so it working is classified into three sections one is age and discovery so the agent is currency mobile not discovers it's foreign and home agents during that age and discovered s is the home agent what is its calling it so that will be discovered that is agent discovery registration is a sentence the mobile node registers its current location with the foreign agent on the home agent during where it is present what is the location of the original home agent so that will be registered here on tunneling it is the tunnel it is a virtual tunnel that is set up by the home agent to the foreign agent the care of address to route the packets for them over load and it's ropes as it roams so we have to forward the packets to the tunnels and its rooms to IP addresses for a mobile you know that is we already know home address take care of what a home a decision where the actual IP address where the home agent where the mobile not actually present that isn't static one and care of what does is one which topology the reason signifi as to which that the mobile node can be identified so the Kara fortress is the termination point of the tunnel toward the mobile load when it is on de foreign it work the home agent maintains an association between the co IP address of the mobile node and its care of address which is the current location of the mobile node onthe for in our visited so by this care of waters we can able to identify the current locations so a futures have a mobile IP transparency so it is not off of the mobility so it can be transparent we can able to identify where it is cheaper and this will be compatible so with the existing internet probable no special organizations is needed and it is much more secure to communicate say q2 communications on the efficiency is also higher and scalability that can be expandable to billions of holes so that is an important feature of that mobile IT key mechanisms in mobile I three basic mechanisms are needed so discovering a care of address and registering and tunneling of a care of an ostomy you have seen already this basic mechanisms under roof optimizations so all the data packets to the mobile node goes through a home agent so we just watch whenever your correspond or wants to communicate and they do forward the packets only to the home agent so there will be heavy traffic between home major and correspondent Lord causing latency to increase because the tunnel may in cover with many number of packets so there will be a Travie traffic between the home agent and a foreign agent so to work on this problem the following route optimisation needs that is enabled arc notification of the correspondent node and direct tunneling from the correspondent coast to the mobile post unbinding a catch maintained at the corresponding node god so instead of britain if you are going to the tunneling a dad the location of the mobile node can be informed to the correspondent so that they a direct communications can be taken place between the correspondent node and the overload the oscillation of the home address with the care of photos is called as binding this is any ideas about that over IP and we are the references where did you meet I of the tank doctor ganache and your vinyasa grunt on the way for is kinder form I suppose and we have to tag on a reference book from Russian cover partner and write signal for from the book fundamentals of awakening thank you so much
