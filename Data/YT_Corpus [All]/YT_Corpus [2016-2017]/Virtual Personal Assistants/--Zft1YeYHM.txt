 hi today's good person to know is rod to jang he's a senior director at microsoft and he's talked with all about the benefits and opportunities that developers now have using their platform rod said that the benefits of the cloud in wearable space is immense and trust Microsoft because of their volumes they're spending an awful lot of money to be the top of their game it is true there are lots of companies out there who are offering the same services how do you know which company to go with rod said think about where these companies will be in two to three years time and base your decision on that he also spoke about Windows 10 the new devices that they're releasing such as a TV adapter the band and the hollow lens glasses but what I found really amazing was the fact the developers can now develop an app once on Windows but it's also useful on Android and iOS now I always thought these platforms worked independently of each other so there you go so if you are a developer check out developers windows calm and see how you can take advantage of the new devices that they're about to release so thank you for watching the introduction of personal digital assistants I'm it is really nice but I'm still surprised that when Cortana or Siri or whatever equivalent you are using tells you that you need to leave a little bit early for your travels because there is a traffic jam on your route to your next appointment for me that's still on surprising experience but I think that my kids will not expect anything else on the cloud side we're actually building out capacity as part of our microsoft stuff microsoft offering we are exhausting the capacity of our suppliers currently we cannot add enough data centers so we are resource strapped here and that's something to really do and to take into consideration when you think about how relevant the move to the cloud is for us what are the opportunity for Microsoft in the wearable a space and I think one of the decision factor should be is that you should have some trust in our volumes because it's all about choice the reality of the IT industry is is that there are a lot of companies out there and very few are left so that means is that when you have a strong position you have that strong position probably two to three years but you have to earn that position every time again and again and again and when you walk around in our cloud data centers the amount of equipment and the amount of investment we're doing is huge but at the same time you should also start thinking about what's the longer term prospects so what's happening with the cloud proposition what's happening with device strategy and where should I join the likely winners of the future from the very tiny ones the raspberry PI's on the yeah this is for you the left side up to the xbox one which will soon run also Windows 10 based applications to the surface hub which is a kind of conference room system which runs Windows 10 and on the hollow lens which also runs Windows 10 for us it's actually really important to show the integration across those platforms and I think that's where we have a unique approach with the universal Windows apps and strategy you can develop an application and run it in all of these platforms you can also make it holographic aware and extend your application to dead new world and that's something for instance we're doing with minecraft a minecraft we will provide extensions to so that you can actually use this in a virtual reality situation the ambition was when 1 billion a Windows 10 devices in three years and as it looks right now we are on tracking making that number because one of the integral parts of Windows 10 is the availability of a store and the store also means is that you as in a developer but also as a partner and interested in virtual reality and wearable technology can actually market your applications through the store of Microsoft and I think that has a big benefit specifically when you target this based on the universal Windows platform you can develop your application once with a similar tool set and actually deploy this across multiple platforms which also it creates now the opportunity to even extend this picture so that you can develop an application once for the billion windows devices but at the same time you could also target Android and iOS platforms so there is a huge potential here as a landing platform for your solution and of course that opens up some new opportunities EF or released a new device category which is called device hub or service hub and what we intend to do with this is to automate the way how you do meetings so it's an video conference system with annotations with some smart tricks in here so that we can actually boost the productivity of group meetings the Xbox one is not a finished product it's a product which is continuously being developed so if you have an xbox one you will get feet new features every time and we will also enable windows 10 based applications you double p applications to the platform some people might actually recognize this little piece of hardware which is a Microsoft TV adapter because when I use my phone and I have a windows phone running Windows 10 and runs continuum I can actually work in the run word an office on my television based from my telephone using this very nifty piece of equipment one of the device categories which is really hot are the hybrid pcs let's talk a little bit about the band which tracks your well-being tracks your what you are doing with an enormous array of sensors and but also provides me with some feedback it buzzes it beeps it has a display it can actually tell me some stuff it has a companion application on this device which is called the Microsoft health app and it's also available for other platforms which shows me all my statistics and what I need to do and and gathers data but this phone also has a motion sensor so it combines the motion sensor of this phone with what I have on my wrist into a single application and then it ties back to a Microsoft health back and platform which tracks my programs so i can see every and anything which is happening in my progress and running and my personal records and i can set goals but i can also turn it around i can also tell microsoft health is that i would like to develop some skills or some some personal fitness on a specific area and then the system will actually download exercises to my band and the band will show me and tell me what i need to do and we have chosen specifically to look at augmented reality and i think it's an interesting device to start thinking about here are the five building blocks you need to start yays is the first form of user interaction on holo interact with those items use gestures the sensors on Hollins with specific movements of your hand when you go now to our depth of windows com website you can see all the information about the upcoming release of hollow lands and then the software platforms around this and I think it's really an interesting opportunity for you to start thinking about how you can make your virtual reality or your application all ends capable follow Microsoft in this space and see what we are trying to do benefit from the the platform volume we're going to do but also the innovations were landing here or in the field both of our wearable technology side as in augmented reality and make your applications your neck wearable technology application successful running on our platform now it is true there are lots of companies out there you offering you benefits of using the cloud but think wisely be careful who you'll go with because they may not be around them two or three years time so I hope you
