 I wrote a book right it's called by a game and it's free click the link down there you got there you're talking about maximizing your money earning and people everybody wants to make money right I don't care if you play ball I don't care if you're male female you from Europe or from Australia you from the USA the north the south everybody wants to make money right everybody here wants to make money if you want to make money tap the screen like a hundred times so I know that y'all want to make money because if y'all want to make money I probably shouldn't talk about this topic alright I want to make money just tap your screen a bunch of times my name is Drake Baldwin for those who don't know I introduced myself in a second but we talking about maximizing your money the reason I put your in all capital letters is because all of us have different situations something you might be an entrepreneur some of y'all might work a job something you might not even have a job maybe you want to start making money but everybody wants to make more money from wherever you whatever you're doing if you could take everything you're doing now and just make more money doing it is that something you'd be interested in doing is that something you're interested in learning how you can do that YouTube bug that's what's up so if you're interested in learning how you can take the stuff you're already doing if you're already doing something that makes you money make sure you tap the screen a bunch of times type screen a hundred times take you like 30 seconds but anyway that's what we're gonna talk about the day for those who don't know me and for those who do introducing myself real quick my name is dray Baldwin many know me as Dre all day my company is called work on your game or work on your [ __ ] game that's was that F stands for and my backgrounds as a professional athlete play basketball overseas nine years at the planet Division three college and barely even playing in high school thank you for those hundred hearts barely even played in high school I come from the city of Philadelphia it might be snowing in Philly today I don't know cuz I'm in Philly I moved to South Florida because of the weather that's really why I moved to South Florida cuz of weather I went to school at Penn State that's another piece of information that you may or may not care about right now I'm an entrepreneur I'm a professional speaker I'm author of five books acts my expertise is in social media marketing branding all this online stuff I do a lot of stuff online I got my own website up blog I make thousands of YouTube videos I do all these social media stuff and also that the secret sauce of everything was is the mental game confidence belief getting the success principles right setting your goals properly and making sure that your actions and your thoughts are on line with each others if they're not on you're not gonna get the right results so those are the things that I focus on and today we talking about how did I market my books through doing stuff like this periscope and telling people that I had a book out when I start telling people on periscope that I have books I start selling more books that's a true story but anyway what I'm gonna do today we're gonna talk about maximizing your money-making because all of us as I said want to make more money from what we're already making we maybe want to do more maybe want to do reps maybe you need to change some things we're doing maybe we needed different strategies so I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna help you start making more money on top of what you're doing right now if that is if you're doing something now if you know nothing you're not gonna make more money doing nothing but if you're already doing something I'm gonna tell you some ways to optimize how you make that money because the biggest challenge we all have is not that we don't know things we could do to make more money we all know what we could do the problem is there's only 24 hours in a day problem is there's only so much energy we have as humans the problem is there's only so many different places one person could be at the same time all right shout out coach opinion whoever codes been here shut up in a Vinny Del Negro shot the Vinny Del Negro but anyway alright so we're gonna talk about how you can make more money with the same 24 hours in a day you got with the same knowledge skills and expertise you've got now some caveats of course if you put in more work and less time you can get more money of course if you do some different things you can make more money and of course if you're not doing anything right now nothing I say is gonna make you money you should probably stop watching this gonna make some money so let's get right into it and I'm gonna take questions at the end so if you have questions hold your questions if you've got questions about me personally I'm gonna talk about myself a little bit of these but questions I can answer specifically for your situation hold those questions and I will answer those at the end of this scope so what the end is gonna be when I'm done with these so make sure you hold your questions and get them ready all right number one thing we talking about here is maximizing your money and these are the things I'm going to tell you here just to let y'all know sometimes I may tell you something that may seem simple it may seem like oh well I heard that before or I read that in a book before or you know I know this other speaker he said that or somebody told me that three weeks ago I might tell you something that you've heard before but it's the difference between you hearing something and actually taking something you use it so what I do when I work with people as a closure consultant is not just give them information because you can get information for free I take information organize it and show you how to apply it in a way that you'll actually use it and get a result out of it my name is it gets you results from the information not just give you information so I am not I'm not a motivational speaker I am the speaker but I'm not a motivational speaker because motivation is like putting gas in a car and putting your foot on the gas pedal you'll go fast and you'll go hard but where the hell are you going I'm like the steering wheel so I'm going to show you not only you need some gas you got to press on the gas at some point but I'm going to show you not only how to go hard and go far but they're actually going the direction that you're gonna get to where you got to go everybody understand that if you understand I please tap the screen for the hearts as we get right into this enough with the introductions number one thing you need to do to maximize your money raise and gentlemen this is a very simple thing but a lot of people don't even think about it is this you must know what activities look at your activity over the last 30 days and ask yourself which of these activities is actually making me money know what those are and then only do those activities I'm gonna repeat that one more time because this is a point that a lot of people don't give there's a point that I hadn't even thought about until I started coming up with these concepts this is it know what activities over the last 30 days what activities have made you money which activities actually make you money all right we gotta get rid of this guy we'll get rid of hell if we got to know what I took these are making you money or leading to you making money and only do those activities yeah I understand that all right we got rid of him and so some people say well what about practicing for it let me give you an example for myself example for myself people always ask me try how do you make money what is it that you do I tell you three things that I do to make me money three things recording writing I'm on the phone those three things make me money now if I go to the gym and lift weights I do that because it helps my body feel better how's my mind feel good I go to sleep because the human body needs sleep maybe you need sex maybe you got to eat dinner those are things you got to do maybe you got to drink water and take a shower everything that I do is gonna make me money I would say will come probably from one of those three things recording writing I'm on the phone I'm on the phone I'm selling myself to somebody I'm booking something I'm talking to a client I'm something as maybe I'm setting up a meeting that I ended up driving to the meeting so driving doesn't make me money but driving to the meeting and what I do at the meeting will make me money recording this active recording right here periscope is not paying me to do this recording but there's a bunch of people watching this you are paying me attention when you pay attention to me you like this guy says maybe after you listen to me every day for the next 30 days you might say you know I want know more about this guy let me go buy his book so that's going to sell me a book do you understand what I'm saying so it's not necessarily everything you do directly you get paid at the exact moment you finish doing it but everything you do needs to either get you paid or directly lead to an activity to get you paid so for example I made a bunch of videos on YouTube and YouTube inherently didn't pay me for making the video but when I made the video somebody said who wants to make a training program so I made a training program people bought the training program so every activity that you do should somehow someway be to you making money and if it doesn't stop doing it let me get to that in a second so number one look back on your last 30 days ask yourself what activities made you money or led to you making money and do those activities only or prioritize those activities it's often players ask me athletes especially say how can you you can get paid yes you can you pay the YouTube I mean inherently like YouTube didn't give me a check just because I made the videos what I'm saying now when the ads come in and all that then you can get paid that's a different story but what I mean is just making a video itself they didn't pay me just to record the video because anybody can do that is the content that people saw value in they get you paid you understand them saying but that's a different conversation so you must know what gets you paid what makes you money and those are the things you prioritize so when you start today you're trying to figure out how to set your day up the number one things that get scheduled in because remember we're not going to do this anymore right no more to-do lists use a calendar because it's finite you only got 24 hours to fill in it you must prioritize the things that will make you money not anything else gets prioritize once those things are scheduled in then you can put in all other [ __ ] is not making you no money so number one no one makes you money and prioritize that thing number two this is an important thing that especially for entrepreneurs is hard for about an entrepreneurs to get get this point and actually start using this when everybody gets it but nobody used not everybody uses it number two is this eliminate or outsource outsource any necessary activities eliminate unnecessary activities that someone else can do for example there are activities let's say somebody needs to follow up on somebody that you're trying to you're trying to close a deal with a follow up needs to happen and follow-up email needs to be saying need to send an email out to your mailing list you don't necessarily have to do that you can outsource that to somebody else ie a personal assistant ie a virtual assistant the thing is often when you tell people get an assistant that I will an assistant cost money that's the number one objection you can get a virtual assistant for very cheap places intimate you could pay like thirty bucks a month and get a virtual assistant to do five to ten tasks for you over the course of a month five tasks will save you some time each size takes 20 minutes and they do five or six tests you just saved yourself two hours for $30 now is two hours of your life worth $30 that basically means are you work $15 an hour and the answer is yes and that means you should get an assistant everybody get that so you need to take this is what one of my mentors told me she said Dre you first of all tell us first of all think of how much you think your time is work for an hours somebody want to buy an hour of Dre how much would they have to spend an hour of your day whatever they want to do but they got to pay you for how much is that when you come up with that number this is what the next thing you do when you're doing an activity that somebody else could do ask yourself this question if you if you're worried about hiring somebody can I hire somebody for less than my number so let's say your number is $1,000 I'll say I said if you want an hour on my time i cost you a thousand bucks right so if I'm doing some tasks like now responding to some emails that I could have an assistant respond to if I told him how to I asked myself can I pay somebody and train them for less than $1,000 an hour to do what I'm doing right now if the answer is yes then you need to hire an assistant if the answer is no that you need to do it everybody understand what I just said yeah that makes sense please tap the screen for the hearts you decide how much your time is worth and if you can hire somebody for less than that amount you need to hire them because you're making money because if I had to pay an assistant let's just use fat numbers to make sense if I had to pay them my time is an hour $1,000 an hour and I had to pay an assistant $100 an hour for two hours of work guess what during that two hours of their doing things I don't have to do now my two hours is free to go make $1,000 per hour so that means I spent $200 for two hours but I made $2,000 so my net is $1,800 everybody catch what I just said if you're going to be an entrepreneur or you are already an entrepreneur you must you had to start thinking this way don't always think in terms of the bottom line like I don't want to spend money on things if you don't spend money if it's Harvey Grant Cardone said this one in his book if it's hard for you to part with money to give to somebody else to get stuff done it's gonna be very hard for other people to part with money to give to you to sell your products or services or whatever it is you're doing if you are cheap people are going to be cheap with you if you are willing to give and you're willing to make stuff happen with your money people gonna be willing to make stuff happen with their money and give it to you so you can't you can't be cheap and expect people nothing to people be generous with their money when he dealing with you you understand that the network question will get to that hoe that's it in so number two step is this number two step is this Eliminator outsource necessary activities now if there is an activity that you absolutely don't need to be doing is not necessarily stop building and this is step number three step number three to maximize your money is this your money earning is this stop doing [ __ ] that does not make you money if you are doing something that is not making you money why are you doing it that's the number one question number two stop doing it doesn't even matter what the answer the number one is number two stop doing it anything that is not making you money stop doing it those are time wasting activities we all know things we do to waste time anything is not necessary all right you need you don't make money sleeping but you need to sleep you don't make money even lunch but you're having lunch you don't make money maybe when you go and run two miles every morning but you need to do it because you need a healthy physical body I get those things so understanding that stuff exactly by watching TV you know reading a soap opera magazine anything is not making you money and is not necessary for your life for your well-being stop doing it now that sounds very simple right but a lot of people if you watch anybody over course of a 24 hour day you'll see a lot of people doing a lot of [ __ ] that makes them no money right hanging around on a bot with your friends exactly oh I appreciate that pipe 32 I'm glad this is value that's what I mean this what I'm talking about deliver value to people so anything that is not making you money stop doing this so let me review all three and if you got questions get ready with your questions here it is number one identify the things that actually make you money look for recreational activities that help you what do you mean by that be more specific in that question number one identify the things that actually gets you money identify the things that you do that make you money and prioritize those things if you're not if you have not prioritize doing those things you should be doing anything else number one thing you schedule in a day for example for me it's recording writing on the phone those are three things I schedule i schedule time do those three things there's no more time left and guess what I doing nothing else got me I'm not doing nothing else until those three things are done after those are done then yeah I could talk to you then yeah I could go do that thing then yeah might come by your networking event yeah I might know support you your online webinar after I prioritize the three things is gonna make me money so prioritize the things that make you money do those first number two eliminate unnecessary activities and outsource necessary stuff that somebody else can do so you can get somebody else to do it I can't hire somebody to do this I can write down everything that I want to say I can't hire somebody to deliver it the way I do it so I have to do this but let's say I wanted somebody to edit it possibly I could hire somebody to edit the video you'll get what I'm saying if there's a way that I can show them how to do it make a system so outsource things that need to be done but don't have to be done by you and number three stop doing stuff that's not making you money there's not making you money you shouldn't be doing I mean if your goal is to make money now if your goal is to do something else then I guess you could do whatever but if your goal is to make money why would you do something that's not making you no money that makes no sense doesn't now anybody got any questions but I post your questions this is Dre all day you're talking to for those who came in how do I stop procrastinating and stop having second thoughts I did a scope about procrastinating this on YouTube you look up go to youtube look up my name Jerry Baldwin and the word procrastination you'll see it what the things that make you money isn't making you any money at the moment what do you mean be specific you make money on periscope I dressed that earlier in the scope did you see that when I talked about that periscope itself doesn't pay me periscope doesn't pay me for doing this stream right now but everybody's watching his paying attention to me you get what I'm saying then you see the metaphor they paying attention to me so maybe they'll follow me maybe they'll go get my book for free buy a game on my website and at that point then I can maybe I can market you a product maybe you'll buy a book after you watch 40 of these on 12 how can I make money go to Costco with 20 bucks buy skittles and songs for $1 at school I didn't see that last question that you posed whoever posted a question right before that what games do I have we mean what kind of games you're talking about I don't have any games well games you mean like monopoly video games well if you don't have money to outsource it where do you find cheap outsourcing you can go online you can go online just look up virtual assistants look up virtual assistants you'll see a thousand different results and if you outsource to like the Philippines or India you can get them for extremely cheap thing is that their comprehension of English is not always good so you had to be very clear in your instructions now use the same idea to become a better ballplayer of course you can how does the whole passion thing fit and if your passion does not make money what is this whole scope is to people this is for making money this is for you to make money games not make programs online so if you go to hoop and book , I got programs for basketball players and on my website dry out there I got three programs coming bulletproof mindset get the girl in people skills so just stop because you aren't making money right now not necessarily I mean as long as you can of course support it through something else that makes you money so if you're doing something that's not making money but you want it to make you money you should keep working on it because it's gonna make you money if it's gonna make you money then of course you keep working on it but at the same time if you want to maximize remember what the title is scope is maximizing your money earning so I'm talking about the things that are gonna maximize your money here so if your goal is to maximize the amount of money you're earning these are the steps to follow now there are things you can work on and don't make your money at first of course nothing's gonna make you money the first day not always I won't play basketball for it but a parent who doesn't have one what do you need what do you need money to play basketball for you know why do you need money all sorts on Fiverr is true you outsource on Fiverr listen understand that you usually get what you pay for in business if you pay a little bit you're gonna get a little bit of results that's just how it goes so if you want better results you got to pay more what about volunteer work curtsey coaching for underprivileged hey you can still do that I'm not saying don't do it we talking about maximizing your money earning so when it comes to making money if when you're thinking about making money these are the steps then find yourself becoming - distracted by things that don't make you money I aim not to that's why I do scopes like this where I'm sharing how to not to get distracted no doubt paid off I'll get five dollars for a logo you must look good as yourself money for the team what do you mean the volunteer work no money to make money to get on the basketball team you'll need your parent to make you money how old are you and if you're not sure is gonna make the money than it was a waste of time no not at all it's not for anyone else at the terminal it's a waste of time for you because your time is your time so you have to first of all decide what would be worth your time can you do volunteer work and you do a passion project it doesn't pay of course you can do that of course but when it comes to you maximizing your money learning these are the steps that you need to take to make make sure you do that now there are other things in life that are important besides maximizing money earning of course I'm not saying don't do anything else I'm saying when it comes to maximizing money these are the things that you need to do if I'm speaking too fast you need to listen a little faster so on it slow down for you to catch up anybody else got any questions on a player who's talking about their parent doesn't have any money right why do you need your parents to have money for you to make the basketball team I don't make no sense if you old enough to type on periscope then that means you're old enough to ask somebody yo you wanna buy a Snickers bar and sell it what's the smartest thing a basketball player can invest his money on you can invest your time which is more valuable than money and to working on your game and getting good because if you can't play you ain't no basketball player you need a ball and a hoop there exactly yeah exactly sf6 minutes and you put the last word in it so if you are you 16 listen go to Costco with 20 bucks buy a pack of potato chips or bottled water or Gatorade or candy it's gonna be like 20 of them in a pack is gonna cost you like $6 and go something for $1 apiece or two dollars or five dollars whatever you can get your gonna make a profit and they just keep doing it over and over and over again yeah candy potato chip man and the pretzels man the cookies man the bottled water man and Gatorade man you could be Otto's things you can sell roses something to the men that get to the girls that they like it was suggested pay a consultation for you to promote my book now you don't need to pay a consultation fee to promote a book if you want to promote a book this is what you do get on social media deliver value since you write the book you must know something deliver value to send the book on free platforms like this where people can see it and see that you got something of value and then you tell those people about your book and let them go by the people who have seen value in what you deliver you'll had to pay anybody to promote a book and books don't make books are not written for people to make money anyway books are books are tools for you to share information how did I get so smart experience I got smart through experience doing things not from I read I do read a lot I listen to other people who are smart but I also take the things that I read in here and not go apply them that's how I learn I'm happy now I need to start thinking oh yeah absolutely it sure is definitely don't don't use your parents your parents don't your parents don't need to be subsidizing your basketball only thing is should pay for listen only three things your parents owe you is food clothing and shelter that's it they don't owe you basketball I want to use the knowledge from the books to apply it to make money yeah that's what you should do if you read a book don't just read a book and do nothing with the information it's worthless you got to take the knowledge as you get from a book and actually go do something with it that's what makes it value you read a book and do nothing with what you learned and you just wasted time and the thing is you want to clear your mind a lot of times entrepreneurs get cluttered minds cuz they like I got a thousand things to do but if you just narrow down the things that are only making you money then you can then you got clarity of mine she can't even do that all right well you could do that tuna guess what when you tombstone when you die you want the tombstone to say hey he would have been great but his mom didn't pay for anything you don't want them to say that on your tombstone right somebody stole your 50 of the ball book and go get another so you got a what they didn't steal with them you ain't giving it back that means you know who did it that means you gave it to him what's the best

work I already knew worked I was actually I projected that idea out to you Napoleon Hill talks about that when it comes to hitting the gym how many days what I recommend is it important if you are an athlete if you want be a pro of seven days a week don't meet you I do the same thing every day but you need to be in the gym because an athletes athletes product is their body so is every day even if you're not an athlete I still go to the gym every day I mean I'm trying to go to sound with no team but I still go to the gym this is what I like doing makes me feel good makes me look good it makes me perform good selling and Kia shopping mall any interesting concept stop every single person that walks by I know you're gonna get ignored 90% of the time but do it stop every single person that walks past you all day if you selling at a kiosk at the mall you know there used to be more that used to be more aggressive you know your kiosk people at the mall they stopped you when you walk by chocolates and emotional your hands they used to be more aggressive when his pro ball was it hard mentally no was it hard it was fun I was doing what I wanted to do it's crazy I'm trying to go pro but I need rest yeah that's why you sleep at night I say all day I said every day there's between you doing something all day and do something every day you can go to the gym for two hours a day you still got 22 hours to rest I think that's plenty of time what comes what I go through for a basketball scholarship Kentucky or Michigan but will depend on more factors than just the school I probably want to go to like um or USC I need somewhere where it's warm with some palm trees Michigan too cold Kentucky I think the weather was that gradient but it'd be other factors besides distance cool right who's on the team who's the coach did they recruit me do they want me that they offered me a scholarship all those things am I gonna put him I can have a chance to play right away and all those all that stuff of factoring so I wouldn't just go off the school's itself and I don't really watch college basketball anyway so I'm probably a good person to ask that question New York Matt Cole right now
