 hi so this video is about where I pink computing could be going in general it's an area of interest to me it's an area I want to kind of innovate in you know in a future sense I have a background in technology of being working in technology-based companies or industries in those 17 on a full-time basis so I used to quit college so I could pursue my passion for working and taking up in the technology industry and that's what I've been doing all my life and I love thinking about technology where it's going keeping a keeping iron out some of the developing technology and kind of playing it in my mind where I think they will be heading so I think from a personal computing point of view I I suspect for the next so that's its kind of fun it depends on how certain technologies evolve obviously at how what the outcome is going to be but I think there's gonna be four major components to how personal computing involves and up and I'm gonna look at functional computing from an everyday use something that requires you can't just use it a very efficient manner and frog from that point of view I'm not kind of looking at virtual reality just yet because I think in my mind virtual reality is going to take another five or six years for it to start getting more accepting the mainstream in kind of there's gonna be many more I curations before it starts taking off maybe eight years and I think a lot of it has to do with the kulluk the big bonus nature of Technology from the perspective of like right now smartphones allow you use computation on almost ubiquitous real-time basis just can't pull it up from your holster or your wherever you keep your smartphone in you have information available accessible to you however you want it done take time for thing to get there I think I'm not sure so not looking at work so reality just yet although I think it's a very promising construct with immense potential in terms of what it could potentially walk into beyond virtual reality I kind of look at something that I call the continuum which is basically not just a real-life replica of of the world on a one-to-one kind of simulated level but you have multiple levels of reality and basically in power and tire rolls with a concert like that as long as you have enough computation so that being said you know very hopeful about virtual reality but I don't think it's going to be gaining mainstream market share at least for the next eight years specific to how quickly smartphones I have wine computing in general in the web have evolved into I want to be proven wrong here so that being said I think there's gonna be four areas where I think computing is going for the next five to eight years maybe 10 years maps um the four areas and how i categorize them is one is communications in general and i think i just kind of let's I want to simplify down to a level where I'm saying connectivities going to be available to a larger group of people and the mechanisms have by which connectivities provides going to come through a variety of different mechanisms what would that really need is I mean right now it's mostly broadband but we could really start seeing the application or the provisions of providing internet directly from space and that's when or blames or aerostats like Google and Facebook are planning or groans at that and that's when not just the accessibility factor opens up but the throughput the bandwidth raids also open up as well as fiber in general so my vision is kind of like entire rivers of data flowing to these and how I want to see it is things flowing in a transparent manner almost transparent manner so you've got like perhaps targeted Wi-Fi or some next iteration of fly fly there's gonna be able to power a dream like that you basically have rivers of data flowing through the cities and although you cannot directly tell what's in the data packages by moving so that if you could slow it down you can see like you no imagery and whatnot well there's many different kinds of data for into the fightin you could you could see things traveling from that point of view and from from from that respect how I kind of see it in my mind is that everything that needs to be attached to the Internet the internet goes out and finds it so right now things are kind of I wouldn't call it stupid design but you basically power this pocket of connectivity in an area so where there's Wi-Fi in your home or a cellular tower in an entire town or in part of the town what's going to happen in a future sense is that any device that seeks to get on the internet hop on the internet is going to sing a painting in its vicinity and if the connectivity happens to be in that vicinity then it's going to find an ideal optimal route to that there are advantages to a design like that because you can route the data that much more efficiently so gonna mind like the least of my hops be able to get through a device and then back and it's like when you run a trace route right and I think that's how I think the next version of connectivity should evolve um so other than the the rivers of data I think competing in general will be ubiquitous my sense is that we will probably find a bunch of different break rooms competing is done um it could be many different kinds quantum could be one chips modeled after the human brain as in near morphic chips could be another I'm personally very hopeful about the advances in nanotechnology and what it's going to be able to provide in terms of computation so in order to will get the ball rolling their nanotechnologies gotta feed in one cycle compliments and other so AI is going to be complementing nanotechnology and vice versa so however this comes about I think this will be the number one candidate I think I'm others could very well providing greater solution but I think nanotechnologies going to be the solution that would help provide ubiquitous computing and when competing becomes ubiquitous then you can literally change how it how information is accessed in computation in general is accessed as well so my vision here in this respect is a combination of a bunch of different things so I think hardware's then become irrelevant so is obviously these the mechanisms the accessories the input devices by which you access information which I'll come back and talk about it in a bit but with Hardware becoming irrelevant you gotta have kind of think about that and like what exactly is going to happen from the perspective of accessing information so right now well let's think about is so right now what you do is use a computation device such as a computer or a tablet or a smartphone and other people to access whatever you need in a future sense with the rise of your pincode is computing it's not just the ubiquitous nature of computing that is available anywhere what what's also happening is that you have massive amounts of competition available to you however you want it for a very very cheap price um and I mean in my mind you know looking at some of the projections I can I can I can I can almost sense that you're really able to have massive amounts of computation available not just competition any trauma on a daily basis but that you're going to be able to run say if you're a scientist run hundreds of thousands of zettabytes of data take it uploaded to the cloud run friending on it using massive amounts of competition and all that's going to cost you is a couple pennies so that's coming i think in maybe that's 15 years out that's coming 15 isn't 15 but coming back to the question of well if the hardware's come almost disappeared then how you access information so I don't know what how it's going to happen dependent I want architect the mechanism so that would happen but either there would be something that is going to be used like an advanced version of this it's not gonna be that big it's probably gonna be a fraction of the size um so you basically need some mechanism to be able to authenticate to the cloud and once that happens then it is right there in the information that you need is right there using a combination of things you could use you can use advanced Holograms you could use um some other display device you could use the advanced version next version of google glass beam damages directly in your retina and my personal favorite is beaming the imagery directly into your cortex or the rigid part of your brain which is what Ray Kurzweil predicts is going to happen in 2045 buy things is to eat current law saying is still 30 years out I think it could be earlier I all has to do with advanced nanotechnology so a bunch of different ways to access the information as you can appreciate and basically you know how things used to be showcased and it shows like Jonny Quest I don't know if anyone's actually seen that show but Johnny coast was big on VR virtual reality it was big on AR as well and Holograms dr. quest was obviously a expert in Computer Sciences I'm a bunch of different fields like sociology and archaeology and whatnot so your Social Sciences makes of Natural Sciences and Social Sciences well yeah that was a pretty awesome show and I think we're getting very close to the kind of realities as they were or technology that as they were imagined that show and and some of these some of these friends are waiting to appear now it's not like 15 years out so if you look at advanced Holograms or like the first step to wear something that's it look like advanced hologram so the coming out of California policy and know and they make nano-sized projectors so literally projector is half the size of a matchstick that's gonna be able to project hologram and those the way I understand it are going to smartphones so that's just the start that's it start a new technology is you know it keeps getting better with every cycle and a lot of these breakthroughs are coming out from a lot of different places is all about how which technology you decide to choose which technologies are pushed to be able to provide the computing platform the future so these were in three areas but advances in connectivity leading to better faster throughputs rise of ubiquitous computing in general which will find its depending on computer engineering innovation in computer engineering and architecture how innovation is there will push your big Buddhist computing which anyone could access I'm going to very cheap level almost free then there's the display systems or mechanism to be able to harness information and the fourth one is Mike probably my personal favorite is dude I've been thinking about this for a long time I i read an article in there was an advertisement in a magazine I read when I was a teenager it was called it was an advertisement for IBM I believed in the title was competing at the speed of thought and idea was basically advertising their workstations but I always kind of wondered how we could get to a level where what we're thinking is in sync with what the machines can do and that's I think one of the reasons why I kind of gone into bunch of different areas specifically from the perspective of cognitive computing and cognitive sciences in general so my attention is always going to bring out areas or or research or development from these areas and cut tied into how a seamless user experience can be powered by usage but by basically bringing about that vision of the true nature of competing at the speed of thought now that's not what that our advertisement was actually referring to in the 90s they were basically talked about how fast these workstations are but I think we're getting close to a reality we're competing in effect can be done at the speed of thought I think we're barely starting here barely starting with being able to control basic machinery with by just thinking about it so there's a couple experiments down here and now we're barely starting when it comes to artificial de lepa T so you can think of a something and as long as you have the right connect weapon and your tots can be transferred and being to somebody else I'm personally more interested in whatever form of technologies exist and using a sum total of that to be able to power in you community which will allow us to basically interact with the machines on real-time basis so there's a bunch of different ways that how this could come about but I think external neocortical modems would be the start I think or something just advanced version of a brain machine interface so you got to come wonder how that's gonna happen there's a bunch of different ways that could come by get target out with a couple of your senses or we just use brain machine interfaces by kind of reading the waves as it is a click or the greater we're gonna see is so one thing I feeds into the other so if you push computer from an engineering point of view there's the brute way of doing it that there's a more nuanced way of doing it I'm worn the new hands can do that thing you can build technologies more eloquently what would you do things at a new ants way and you have danced more capability of building one thing on top of another not just on brute force in your way into everything so here I think further advancements when it comes to patent recognition so curveball curveball states that there are 300 million pattern recognizers in the human brain whether that we're gonna be able to map all of them out if that is true is that another guy I forget his name but he actually can test that theory but if there are in effect patent recognized didn't rain then we need to anything can map a number of them just like we've mapped the entire genome now something that crate inventor has done in the 90s an amazing industries that come out of it I think the same would happen with Pat recognizers in the brain so I think there's something in this definitely there's something there's definitely a lot in how Kurzweil has pitched this theory aim even if you can figure out a fraction of these Pat recognizing how they work what they do then we're going to be able to power a lot of things with something like that and it would just be immense it would open up entire in this piece this one aspect and so I think we're detracting from the conversation sorry great start working how that's a nice butt but brain-machine interfaces would be the first step when it comes to having computation at the speed of light well better at the speed of thought sorry and imagine a reality where you kind of tap into a construct and all you need to do is just think about it and the way you interact with the machine the way the machine interacts back with you is all determined upon pots so when you walk into a reality or a specific area whether it's real or virtual there is proximity there is the ubiquitous nature of it there is sentience from a machine perspective so not only does it know that you as an individual that unique individual in a physical or virtual world is there but it's able to tap into your physiological state your part of your cognitive state and whatever experience the construct delivers to you is predicated upon those things and a couple more so then the interaction would be intelligent from that point onwards because it's not going to be you going into a UI to click on something and open it and then the information comes to you in a dub fashion where you can go sequentially through everything it's like no priority or urgency or importance attached to the information coming to you with the opposite of all that information will be brought to you based on a lot of different factors some of which have been shared and you basically have conversations with machines I think so the part that vision is that intelligent assistants will have evolved so we're talking about something more advanced than Siri I think Siri is going through morph into something like with a I most like a hundred percent that's what vid is going to replace something like Siri and then you gotta kind of wonder what live I is going to evolve into so there's an infinite number of possibilities between where we are today and what can be brought about and I think artificial intelligent assistance all right is going to be a huge factor when it comes to computational platforms of the future and so you just be interacting with the computer is isn't how you interact with people there is always going to be raised where you think if it's faster to manipulate information not just like doing this but thinking about it you can be able to do that this is kind of like that BD equivalent of what you can do with a command line right now in some respects it's pretty powerful if you know how to use it or just or a code in general um and so there's always going to be that aspect of it but for the majority of the population who do not want to go through the I guess you want to call it hassle of the hard work then or then they would have the option just to interact with the intelligent assistant and it's going to be a personal assistant that's gonna be available to you however he wanted wherever you want and he's going to take care of all your needs I kind of got a glimpse of this reading a book by martine rock black and she kind of talks about virtually human as the name of the book so basically talk about modding clones and very fascinating book immensely fascinating i could i finished the book and look at it in a day and a half it was like it was mesmerised so i think that's where intelligent assistance in general would be going all of it all of these things finds its underpinnings on computer engineering and with more computational resources available you can power experiences beyond your imagination literally beyond your imagination and so this this is going to be really interesting how we push nano and AI the babies I think that's going to be the area where the breakthroughs are gonna come from but very well can come from quantum or it could come from another place as well but the four areas again specific connectivity targeted Wi-Fi it could be one of them or not kind of not sure about that one ubiquitous computing is definitely happening and they be able to be able to tap into your Vic of this company computing is going to be a natural evolution about that movement and the fourth one is brain machine interfaces and how they will evolve and how the contracts will be typed is something like intelligent assistance so just that's just a glimpse of my vision of where I think personal computing is going thanks
