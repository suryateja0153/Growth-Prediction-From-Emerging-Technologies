 we are living in the future and I can prove it because I've got a new personal assistant and she's a robot let's see if she can help me navigate the complexities of modern of his life meet my lovely new secretary called Amy Ingram sadly she's not real in any sense she's not even a robot she's entirely online and I chat to her via email what Amy claims to do is do one thing very well and that is help me run my diary particularly scheduling meetings so how does Amy work well you sign up with her and then she sends you an email he says click here to connect all of your calendars so that's what I'm doing I then have to put in my scheduling preferences so I'm setting all these preferences via the X dot a I website but in fact I pictures the email Amy with you know I really like coffee meetings in the morning on a Tuesday and if you should mention the word beer that means I want to meet after work and she'll sort it out for you the key thing is and this is what's so strange and unnerving is you complete a knee in to all correspondence you have with your contacts about a meter and then Amy takes over but I've been getting to grips with Amy over the last week or so and she's sort of taken over my life I was contacted by someone in the PR industry wanted to meet for breakfast and I said great I copied a me into this correspondent and I said how about Woolsey on Wednesday who all's he happens to be a well-known restaurant I knew this PR person would know but Amy's come back to me saying I see we'd like to use the walls things location for this meeting to make sure that you and poppy don't miss each other and you give me in exact address and I thought I'd be very difficult and I just said Piccadilly which isn't a huge big Street but to give credit the next thing I heard Amy comes back to me with a diary invite with indeed a completely great dress at the time and it sent out to both me and papi though curiously I see that amy has invited herself to breakfast but as she's virtual I'm not one so she could slip in very easy for a flat white and a croissant now I like the fact they're here I've got from papi saying I began through my emails communicating with Amy and I thought she was a real person so Amy clearly does what she says on the tin well a lot of people predicted that 2016 would be the year of AI and based on Amy they might be right she behaves like a human and she sends out emails on my behalf in very humans you can sign some often from Amy Ingram personal assistant to Harry wallup which for me is a little bit pompous as a journalist but if you are a startup business or consultant I can see the hats real kudos to your fledgling business okay she can't yet put me hotel tickets or train tickets or buy flowers for my wife on her birthday but other companies are all working on this sort of idea living in the future I think we might just be get ready to live your life
