 so today I'm going to give you an overview of our 2016 outlook and the four trends that we've identified for 2016 then we're going to take a deep dive into one of them and we'll have events later in here for the other other three trends and we actually have copies of the outlook here for you to take with you printed copies and the website is also up and will be updated later today with some video overviews for all of those trends so we've got all your trends for you we're going to take a deep dive into one of them so as part of the outlook we like to identify one big story one takeaway that sort of encompasses all of the trends and it can be a useful strategy for coping with these changes and this year that story is brands as a service and we think that in 2016 we really need to for our brands to thrive we really need to connect with consumers and provide them value at every touch point regardless of if that's actually part of our organic product or service so it in 2016 really every brand needs to find a way to become some kind of a lifestyle brand and that's our big takeaway we'll talk about that a little later but right now I want to dive into the trends for 2016 so the first one is a path I'd TV and we know that consumer behavior has been shifting slowly for a while and we think this is accelerating the how and when and where we watch video content is changing pretty quickly and the distinction between what we watch in our living rooms on our televisions well we watch on our phones and tablets and computers that distinction is really really blurring and this is brings with it a bunch of challenges but also a lot of benefits we're getting a lot of the benefits of digital which is really coming to television which is still you know obviously a huge mass market concern next is a boundless retail so the line between online and offline retail is also blurring we're seeing big ecommerce companies like Amazon starting to open brick-and-mortar stores and at the same time we're seeing brick-and-mortar retailers start to use mobile CRM tools to actually be able to track consumers through the entire purchase funnel the same way that we do online and at the same time even the line between when I'm shopping and when I'm not as a consumer is blurring when we have things like appliances that can start to reorder their own supplies automatically without me actually having to do anything so we're really always shopping and the distinction between online and offline retail is really blurring and add avoidance so last year ad blockers made a lot of headlines and this is a question we get asked to talk about a lot we like to think of it in the bigger picture as not just ad blockers but there are options for consumers to avoid advertising across pretty much every media type including audio and video as well as text on the web and so how do we reach these consumers who are increasingly not seeing anything like that looked like traditional advertising we need to develop new strategies and tactics actually reach these consumers and our final trend for 2016 as conversational interfaces and this is our topic for today conversational interfaces refer to devices and products and services that can speak to us using natural language whether that's through voice or through text so let's take a little bit of a deeper dive into conversational interfaces the idea of things that could talk back to us has been around for a long time does anybody remember this this is I if you were in our last our last presentation you know that I like to take a big historical look at why these transport important this is smarter child this was a bot a chat bot that existed on AOL Instant Messenger back in two thousand and it wasn't actually that smart all it was really doing was identifying the parts of speech from dictionary words and then repeating them back to you in some predefined templates but you know it was engaging enough that there were millions of people who had conversations with it and interestingly I did some research the company that behind smarter child eventually went on to make a lot of those voice-activated phone trees that we all love so much and eventually was bought by microsoft and then shut down in 2007 so these this idea of things talk back to us has been around for a while but when we think of conversational interfaces in the modern era you can really trace it back to the introduction of Siri on the iPhone in 2011 and regardless of what you think about Syria now or thought about Siri then it obviously is the beginning of a new trend in technology as pretty much every major technology company has jumped into the conversational interface in the past few years so we have Google introducing Google now with ok Google in 2012 Microsoft with Cortana in 2014 amazon with alexa and the echo also in 2014 and last year soundhound with their hound 25 platform that lets any developer embed the sort of functionality into their app in last year in 2015 so when you look at these together they're what we might call virtual personal assistants and this is not the entire realm of conversational interfaces but it is where all of the big boys are playing and virtual personal assistants basically try to take take on the test that you might ask a human to do for you and automate them in some way so I'm sure you all are familiar with Syria or Google now at this point but this is one specific kind of conversational interface and the way that it works is it turns your speech into text it sends that text up to a server where there's some artificial intelligence the artificial intelligence tries to make sense of your rambling sentence and a pen spits back out text which is then sometimes spoken back to you sometimes it's displayed on the screen sometimes it triggers other actions like turning on your lights or starting your car things like that if you look at this process though there's actually one step in this that is not strictly required for this to work and that is his speech because turns out humans actually text with each other and communicate using text as well and so if you think back to the previous slide there was one major tech company that actually wasn't on there and that is Facebook and Facebook last year launched em which is their entry into the virtual personal realm and M it communicates to you via text only and there are some advantages to this because as we know when you're speaking to another human whether that's in person or over the phone you expect a reply pretty quickly but when you're texting with them it's okay for there to be a little bit of a delay and Facebook has really used this to their advantage one thing you can do when when you are when a delay is okay is route that message in different ways so a really interesting thing about em is that it is sometimes responds to you using artificial intelligence and sometimes it routes that request to a human if the artificial intelligence doesn't know how to handle it it sends that request to a human so unlike Siri or Google now if you ask em a question you get a response you don't get a funny joke because it doesn't know what to do and it might take a second but you always get a response and this enables em to do things like crazy things like lower your cable bill which is what happened when a verge writer actually asked em to lower his cable go from comcast gave gave em the account number and all the other information and someone a human sitting on the M team actually called and got his cable bill lowered which is kind of amazing so you know this this routing really enables it to do all kinds of crazy new things because of this obviously this is not scalable in the same way you couldn't roll this out to everybody with an iPhone or an Android phone today so M is actually in private beta only in San Francisco right now but over time Facebook is going to build in a lot of the human questions the questions that are getting routed to humans the more common ones will get built into the AI and over time the AI will be able to handle more and more of these things so that's we're pretty interested in em and to see how that develops so those virtual personal assistants are one realm but you don't have to necessarily tackle the entire quantity of human knowledge to participate with conversational interfaces Facebook actually also has another horse in the game which is messenger for business and this lets businesses actually message on a one-to-one basis and it uses it enables some of the same tools to route through artificial intelligence or to humans and actually one of our one of the partners that we work with message AI who is here today they actually provide a platform that provides this routing on messenger as well as other text based platforms so you can hook it up program it with rai answers to some of the most common questions or to handle things like where is my package okay send me your order number okay here's your fedex tracking number here's where your package is that can all be automated whereas more complicated questions get routed to a human and facebook is actually pretty invested in taking over the call center for customer service so we think you know messenger for business is actually going to be a pretty big trend going forward and because who doesn't who wants to sit on hold for waiting for someone in a call center if you can do this via text message it's much more convenient for everybody when you're waiting you just put your phone in your pocket you don't have to you know sit on hold or something like that so where else might this be useful this kind of routing between humans and AI and these sort of automated chat bots another place is slack does anybody else hear you slack we use it at the lab there any other teams that are using slack okay great awesome so some slack is corporate communications it's like group chat for your office and from the beginning slat slack has had sort of automated BOTS built into it there was slack bot which could always set you could set reminders you can set reminders for yourself or for your colleagues but there's all kinds of new opportunities because of their developer platform so that slack actually let there are new slack bots that will do things like run your meetings for you where if you just have a normal check in every morning or once a week or whatever with your team it will send out a message to all team members wait for everybody to respond with what their status is and then send out sort of the collated list of what everybody is working on and it sort of let you have a meeting without actually having to stop what you're doing and have a meeting which is pretty cool and the slack slack platform is actually integrates all kinds of other things there's four square and Yelp integration they're seamless integration there's ubermann aggression there's lots of interesting things happening where you can just sort of type to something in in a format that you're already typing to and get make something happen in the real world on top of that there's there's a ton of startups that are actually in this space that are working in the sort of text-based conversational interface realm so one of them XII who is here on the right they're actually here with us today they have a virtual assistant that helps you schedule meetings you just copy her on your emails when you're trying to set up a meeting with someone and all of those back and forth emails of when you're available when you're not available all those things that are annoying because you can't actually see each other's calendars XD I actually handles all of that to scheduled a meeting for you you don't have to see it you just eventually get the meeting the meeting requests from XDA I there's pana which is a virtual travel agent and actually you just tell pana where you need to go and when you need to go and pana picks the best flight for you and you just hit one button and you book it right in the app there's lark which does something similar for health and fitness so if you are tracking what you're eating rather than search through a database like MyFitnessPal and have to figure out well which is the best match for this random thing that i made myself on the weekend or this random restaurant i went to you just type a general description of what you've eaten and it figures out how many calories are in that and how much you need to be working out and then lastly there is Stefan's head which is actually doesn't even have an app it's actually just SMS based and it's an sms-based ecommerce platform so about once a week you get a text from Stefan and he sends you a link to to a web page but rather than actually purchasing anything on the page you just text him back if you want something and he remembers things like what size t-shirt you wear and he remembers things like your credit card so you don't have to you don't have to actually enter all that information in any time you don't have to login ever it's all just done through this one-to-one communication channel over SMS and it has Stefan's head particularly has a great personality and is pretty funny and they've done a lot of brand promotions actually so it's something to to look at from that perspective so that's sort of a big overview of what's happening in the space now let's talk about specifically what this means for brands well for one thing we think that this is probably the interface of the future much in the same way that kids today think that screens that you can't touch or broken we think that in the future kids are going to be think that things are broken that they can't talk to or that they can't text to that any device or service that you can't talk to is broken and why is that well that is because of the explosion of connected devices in the world so as we move from the smartphone to everything that has a battery or or electric power eventually being connected to the network over the next couple of decades a lot of those things don't have screens so we have to be able to communicate with them somehow and voice and text is a pretty good way to communicate with those things and that's going to be an order of magnitude larger so at some point you know we will have a smartphone for every person on the planet so about eight billion smartphones eventually there will be hundreds of billions of connected devices and a lot of them were going to talk to so one implication of this is that it really changes search and discovery so now we search on Google we get you know a page with 10 blue links that goes out the window when we're searching for things with voice or text most of these are actually using the AI to power recommendations so you really only get one result and that result is a combination of whatever the artificial intelligence is thinks you know for for globally for the group combined with what it knows about you but that presents a lot of interesting challenges for brands because if I am always buying one particular brand of cat food for example how does a challenger brand you know break into that because Alexa actually is always going to assume that i want this exact same brand of cat food so we have to figure out how to convince consumers to request us by name that is one strategy to to do that obviously there's also will be opportunities for paid placements especially you can imagine for Amazon and Facebook are looking at paid placements as part of their conversational interfaces and that's not a part of the market right now but we can imagine that that's going to be part of it in the future and another thing is really about finding your brand voice I know this sounds trite because we've been talking about brand voice forever but it has to get very specific when you have to not only tell an artificial intelligence how to speak for your brand but also all of your customer service reps are no longer you know Cindy in customer service they are speaking as your brand and your brand will have one voice whether it's powered by an artificial intelligence or coming from from actual humans this is an example of a message a I integration actually that um did with the goosebumps movie which saw a tremendous success and it actually let you chat with the villain from the movie and he would do things like send you gifts and movie trailers and stuff but they saw I think it was something like 20 million engagements over the course of this campaign so super successful and a case that we like to to feature and lastly you you need to partner to handle with Penn Delise integrations these are things that no brand is really able to do natively at this point as i mentioned slack has an open developer ecosystem so does alexa which is in the echo but also at CES they announced that Alexa is actually coming to ford cars in 2016 hmm so we actually pitch at the lab we pitch Alexa and slack integrations to our clients all the time if you guys are interested in this please come talk to us we love talking about this stuff we would love to help you figure out what the right kinds of integrations might be for your clients and then outside of that there's obviously the Hound defied platform from soundhound which lets you integrate this kind of virtual personal assistant directly into your app if your clients have apps already within with an install base already or interested in integrating some of this how and if I might be the right platform for them and message a I as I said can provide this sort of text-based conversational interface across platforms so that's with that said we have three guests with us today and I'd like to bring them out now we have Michael danusia from soundhound Alec spoon from XII and puneet meha from message AI hey guys oh hi guys so let's start out with a big question which is why now why do you guys think you know I mentioned obviously this has been a thing that's been brewing for a while why wire conversational interfaces sort of blowing up right now yeah I think when you look at this space right now the interest level is certainly through the roof I can just recall a few weeks ago is like a Thursday night primetime NFL broadcast and I saw advertisement for Siri someone for Amazon and I saw one for Google now all within the same telecast so I think the interest level is through the roof and looking back to your question if you look at like consumer behaviors and knees right now they're very focused on on demand you know how products and services are evaluated about how effectively they can connect audiences to what they're actively seeking how fast can they get them what they want and if there's a quicker way to get from point A to point B for your consumer that's that's the only going to be of interest at the same time I think like with what's currently existed in the marketplace there have been some limitations that are certainly this year is going to be a big year for us as we look to introduce our products and technologies a lot of the sake Google and Apple specifically they do speech to text text immediately okay what our platform does either our consumer facing app hound which is going to go live next month and then the development platform you mentioned how to fly is it does natural language processing and voice recognition simultaneous so it's one engine or interface so to speak that is doing this off ones just like you hear me talking to you right now you're processing what I'm saying and you hear my voice at the same time our ability to do that results in much faster results much more accuracy and the ability to have a much more natural dialogue with devices ok I think the interest has always been there that which is mostly gated by technology limitation let me we've gone from websites nicer looking websites apps those are in a way to this crutch of how we was the best way we can do based on technology limitation or what how how we can interact with with the machine I think with the only advancement in data in the amount of data that we have ability to process a lot of data that ability to actually capture all these new types of data sources with smartphones Fitbit and then and so and so and so forth that allow us to now kind of all those technology come together to allow us to kind of catch up to the demand that we have always had yeah our opinion this has to do with consumers you look at the smartphone and there's only one thing VC messaging is the top habit on the smartphone the three billion people on the top for messaging apps three billion with the B that's bigger than all social networks put together that's bigger than the audience that Facebook Instagram LinkedIn Twitter and Pinterest have put together on the social network side now think about the focus that brands have on social networks and compare that to what they're doing on messaging that's the opportunity so that's what you know today is the time and early mover brands like to solve what goosebumps Ted no that's 100 million dollar movie the level of engagement was through the roof why because consumers wanted consumers don't care what brands want they want what they want and they want messaging so that's why the time for conversation interfaces is now yeah so do you this is going to be the primary way that we're interacting with products and services going forward I think conversations is one aspect and conversations are great because of what we call explicit intent like think of the internet word and we had searched right search box is a place where you go and type in what you need it's explicit intent but the good thing with the smartphone is that it has a bunch of sensors so it can figure out where you are it can remember this is home it can know that it's raining outside and that constitutes what we call implicit intent so so we think that you know the interfaces of the future would have a conversation aspect to it which would be primary but they would take into account the simplicity intent so it's the best of both words kind of what Google now does in the background married with you can just message anything you want the migration path is look of feels more like you know before we all have desktops and most of our work and perform on desktop and then you know the way of abs or iPads and so on that light we can perform a lot of the work and the entertainment on those devices but there will be special cases where you still want if you doing excel or video editing you still end up sitting on a laptop on a dash of big screens so I think that a lot of these tasks that are easy to do and mix a lot more sense to do with the conversation it will be done on conversations for certain things that you if you want to see visualizations I for example let's say I'm calling a car from from uber or anything like that right now they have integrations with facebook that I see the messaging but sometimes I think you still want to see the map and see whether by the car is right and in that there's no better interface to show you the map except actually looking at the map so I think those the match will stay yeah you know I think just one quick point to make on that when we started our thesis was that for infrequently used services messaging is the best interface so if i use uber every day i'll take the pain to download their app i'll take the pain true as a consumer as i will take the pain to develop a habit to learn their app right but if i'm dealing with a brand that i talked to only you know two times a month or sometimes once in six months you know how can I brand be really great at developing a digital habit that's not their core strength the core strength is selling their product and service so this should ride on an existing habit so yeah long story short for frequently used services apps are still a good interface but for infrequently used services the category where most trans fallen that's where messaging would be a big winner yeah and to address your questionnaire I think the answer is simply yes and that again going back to my earlier point if there's a whit like if you're looking at consumer behaviors and there's a way to get them what they're looking for in a more efficient natural way they should leverage that I mean just look at examples where you've had communication breakdown with a significant other / text messaging or you could have gotten for point-to-point be much more effectively if you pick up the phone and talk to someone rather than sending highly detailed long lengthy email to someone so if if there's a way for us to talk to technology that same way conversational natural then it's definitely going to lean more towards that Avenue yeah I think we definitely agree we need with that assessment that the sort of lightweight things that you only need occasionally by putting them in a messenger type interface whether that's voice or text it's it's just without removing that app install barrier makes them a lot more accessible so how do we we've seen some brand engagements like the goose bump thing is a really great example how do you guys think that the sort of platform for brands how do you think that's going to involve are we all going to be like text messaging the coca-cola bears all the time or like you know like how where do you see brands fitting into this equation well I think brands certainly have a lot to say and share with their audiences right so I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility but like say frost for example we're trying to look at the leverage our search assistant at pound which is going to go live next month and create more innovative ways for brands to speak to their audience so a thoughts like you'd mentioned before if you look at search marketing right now it's typically a bunch of blue links loading on a page we want to create an ownership opportunity for a brand to live there and have a dialogue with the audio how do they do that we're still working through that and having that discussion with media brands right now but just say for example someone within your tart coca-cola's target audience is looking for a pizza joint nearby we have the ability now contextual targeting existed for some times we can target based on natural language phrasing the waist i'm going to actually speak so if it's a kid saying pizza joint rather than pizza place whatever we can hit them with media based on that and then to take that further we can leverage our technology through the hound 25 platform and build it into an ad unit for coca-cola where it can prompt the user to have a dialogue with it based on what it's looking to share whether that be content whether that be contest sweepstakes offers there's a lot of different opportunities depending on what the strategy and objectives are for that brand yeah so you know when I was looking at the list of trends I saw two more which was one was boundless retail and the second was a devoid instead and I think you know the ability to message a brand is not just because the consumers want that I think they also contribute to those too so obviously consumer doesn't want to talk to a brand if you the brand is talking at them but one on one it results in something like goosebumps for organic posts no media behind it 800 hours of conversation like when did we see that last and people open up and share their most personal details including the name of their kids and asking slappy do you know come with them to their chemo appointment or watch the movie with them so it's I mean it gets that personal so so you know that's the thing where you know a droid ins is that's the reason that people are not engaging with these ads is because they're not person they're not one-to-one and they're not getting people are not getting out of it and boundless retail is another thing they are we working with some of the largest cpg brands in the world and they want to engage with the customers one-on-one now they don't want to rely on the retailer to talk about the product in a less qualified way then they should you know as an example the largest shampoo faction in the word you can guess who they are the sitting on years of research in the Europe data center that matches shampoo with the right hair type and weather conditions and the data tells them that thirty percent of the people end up wrong using the wrong shampoo now what can I user interface should they use to get to these consumers it has to be something like messaging so we think that trend is bigger than just limiting at the interface level we think it's contributing to retail it's contributing to add avoidance and you know the holistic picture there yeah definitely definitely and yeah I think that the one to ones are a private nature of these conversations with brands is actually really changes the dynamic one reason why we're super bullish on messaging services for customer service is that it it changes how even how consumers talk to browns even when they're upset about things obviously we know you know complaining on twitter has become a sort of dreg or waiver for consumers to sort of get attention from brands but once you take that into a one-to-one communication people just speak differently to the brands because it's they they speak to them like they're speaking to an individual person rather than just some faceless entity which really changes the whole conversation and really you know lets brands sort of be more effective in the way that I deal with customer service for sure so uh back to sort of I guess the interface layer and this might be a little political given all of your all of your platforms but do you guys have feelings on when text or voice input is sort of the right way to communicate with these conversational interfaces obviously some of you have preferences but you know from from the labs perspective there they're pretty equivalent from user input it's just what is sort of right in the moment and what's the easiest way for consumers to get that message out but you guys have have thoughts on that so you know for X dot I i we we chose to communicate with you it allows you to schedule meetings over emails which we get asked all the time like what other why aren't you on some of the newer platform and and so on but the question though the way we think about it is we're not trying to build something just fun and and trying to catch it was was was new but more on how are people actually using it you what medium do people use to schedule meetings today and then for us we look at it as most people still scheduled meetings over emails now if things move and we go to different platforms that the way our primary businesses can duck in other ways other channels then we will move to those channels but right now that's where where consumers want to go order where our custom don't want to go are you guys maybe this is something you can't talk about but are you guys looking at slack at all consider me mrs. we looked at all channels I think the way we think about is that they are the different that did the channels it's all very different than the AI that are making determinations and in the language understanding it's much more about okay where where are we getting the data and then how we can process them they are kind of two it's different entities yeah I think it's basically case by case depending on what the person is looking for and I think tap typing and swiping certainly not going anywhere but it really depends on what's the most effective way I guess to get to where you're looking to go and I mean for us we're having conversations across a number of different verticals so if it's with a personal you know credit card organization or personal finance that's much more sensitive information where you may not be as likely to walk down the street and talk into a device about it so there they seem to be more centered on the text service approach which our technology has capabilities but voice is is really what we're focused on so whereas if you're a drive-through service attic us our organization that they're they're looking to eliminate keyboards lemonade you know human interaction sadly in some cases where the voice technology I think we'll play a more prominent role yeah now the way we look at this is it's essentially a formula for us which says don't change the consumer habit so I think you know as an example what X naught a is doing is great because people are already using email to schedule meetings so don't change that habit otherwise it will be too big a hurdle to cross with brand to consumer interaction consumers are already using messaging right three billion people on these messaging to go back there sometimes 50 times a day to message with their friends and if a brand says I want to become a friend where should they go they should go where they're talking to their friends and the facebook allows that with messenger for business that's an amazing opportunity and then I think if we dig down one layer deeper we look at you know what kind of services do brands want to provide and mostly it would be three things you know one is they want to get serendipitously discovered which is the top of the funnel right more marketing related use cases second is decision support so if I'm in and I'll about to buy a shampoo with cpg products if I'm about to make a decision on a product or a service then decision support and this happens before the transaction happens right so it's traditionally marketing part of the funnel but it's where you have these qualified people who have expressed intent that they want to engage with the brand and they're very very valuable and today they get lost with traditional channels and then it is you know post-sales support so you Bing build a longer-term relationship with the brand and these consumers become amplifiers right and the feedback into the top of the funnel so it's kind of how it goes through the funnel but again long story short right on an existing habit for brands you know that's messaging is where it is right I think this something that might be helpful for some of the folks here just I'm thinking about how you know to take this back to our clients can you talk a little bit about what the scripting process is like like if we're going to do a brand execution whether it be through voice or text like what is that process of actually scripting for artificial intelligences and or for humans like how do you how do you manage that what are the kinds of people that you bring in are they normal copywriters or they more like script writers like what is that what is that like so in our case as an example slappy was trained for about a week and a half you know one book that I recommend that has nothing to do there is don't shoot the dog it talks to you about how to train a pet so so it's essentially reinforced learning and that's kind of how I learned so what we have done is we have simplified the process for marketers and we give them what we call cartridges and and then you know somebody who does copy or creative this essentially able to load these cartridges with content and you know kind of stitch them together and then our system creates something like slappy so they're completely you know the interface is really simple to use and the reports are really simple to use so you start you know you can a be test you can do all of that but you don't have to know AI to do it do any of that and like I said Sony Pictures spent about a week and a half training slappy and then there were you know a couple of hundred people that actually talked to slappy so slappy was learning on the job before it went like one messenger and then once that was done oh snap he was up and running on messenger and then so far that was it was the highest engaged campaign on facebook Messenger anywhere in the world heated the compressor now drug again would be like you have WordPress you have Drupal that you can build kind of less website very quickly and then you have other website that you customized for that then you have internal team that actually build a website and optimize it and so and so forth so I think the job category of a international designer I think grow dramatically over the next 5-10 years just because of then you will be have areas where you can just kind of plug and play and not have to think too much about the interactions and 4x Rai we think deeply about how that interaction is going to be lightweight with crafting this character we the voice we want we want the voice to be decentralized that when when Amy or Andrews speaking to you writing to you it that the all the interactions are standardized at it feels like it's the same person who wrote it's writing to you just just like you dealing with a person instead of having one engineers wrote a template here and then another engineers wrote another template there so with that we we did not hire a copywriter we end up home growing our own person from for my team who deeply understand how we how a really good executive assistant will will interact and kind of the tying in the detail and very very tightly integrate that person into the engineering team boo hoo and the science team will actually building the experience this is to us is both a experience challenge as well as a data science challenge yeah yeah just you know quickly adding on to that so in our case as well and I would encourage you to talk to slap it as a private instance we created for all of you guys you would see the sloppy has a real personality he's nasty now you watch the movie and slappy is nasty like you kids have nightmares about slappy so you will see that like as an example you know I have it on my phone I'll show it to you after you're done with this but you know there was one time when I said hi and snappy says hey how are you doing and i said hi again says hey I thought we got past that and tell me to emojis so so that's the thing you know the personality aspect is really important has to gel really well with the brand so so you know the the goal for us is the reason you've spent years building this a high platform is so that for a marketer it's really easy to add in the personality the content the coffee the creative and then you don't have to go really out of the way to be you know an AI interface designer our system cannot does that for you and you feed in what you normally would be doing for us we're looking really to sort of take ourselves out of the equation with the platform that we've developed where it's open let's give you a little bit more insight into it so the how to fight platform it has nearly 150 domains that currently exists and that domains being travel local search whether nutrition finance information like that all through this platform it's all open so you can go in there we want to share this technology and access it yourself go in there if you're right now if a domain exists say it's weather just for example you want to start a weather app and voice enable it you can go in right now without having to speak to anyone within the organization and develop your weather app and power it through voice through that existing domain so there's a lot that brands can do right now and then we're having you know many conversations on the side you know some of which i PG that we look forward to the media lab but we're going to have a platform that's going to exist hopefully around q2 early q3 to build custom domain so if something doesn't exist there and we don't have all that data and information the brand can still go into their into that platform how to Phi and start building a custom donate domain associated with so again we're trying to share the technology and sort of take ourselves out of the equation and give full control to the brand's but of course be there as a resource if needed yes that's a good jumping-off point so Michael you guys kind of are becoming your own platform provider in a lot of ways but is there anything that you all of you are looking for from the big platform providers from Apple Google Amazon Facebook in terms of integration points right now out of the big ones you know Facebook and and Amazon with the only ones that really allow platform integration Apple and Google obviously are sort of the elephants in the room when it comes to integrating with their their platforms what do you what are you guys looking for maybe hoping for from from those platform providers in the next year or so yeah well I think there's there's definitely working synergies between us or they could leverage some things that we do well and we can leverage things that they do well but like for us Google and Apple are very important to our business model in that they operate the primary app stores right so they're going to be key for distribution of the consumer facing a pound when it goes live next month and there's over a million I believe it's over a million now apps available in the App Store and you know lobbying for exposure and placement within that is certainly very political but that's going to be detrimental you know really as long with other marketing efforts for the organization to get people excited and people aware of what we're trying to bring to the marketplace yes I look so sorry I we we are on email so we're not any other platforms and as a start-up weeks only prefer not to be on on anyone anyone's platform if we can help just because of the dependency in the walk-in and so on so forth I'm certainly very interested to see how you know Skype stores like Alex that will play out just because I i think is a very different experience on if i have to download or he'll have to authorize 20 30 apps and how do i find those app but i'm just talking to your interface how do i see them it's the current the apple of the android absolute experience already tough to kind of find apps that you really suit too i think that that challenge would be even more so in a in a comic conversation you I that they don't actually don't see anything how do you know which one you want I mean sometimes you really and how do you discover new ones so they will be very very different yeah we agree we definitely see its discovery as a big challenge and with Alexa even though there's dozens of new skills at it every week just remembering which ones you've enabled alone it's just sort of challenging yeah yeah so for us we support the top platforms we support facebook Messenger for business we support Twitter direct messaging we support kick if you have a teenage audience whatsapp is about to launch so we've been working with them whatsapp for business is about to become available we support I message on the smartphone and then we support slack so those are the six that we are focused on okay open it up for some questions from the audience anybody have any questions immediately I thought of like I mean as far as Airlines go yes opana there's a startup called panna that is focused on travel and they are sort of concierge you know travel travel agent that handles via text and they do do bookings and they also will sort of help you reschedule things if you miss your flight or your flight is delayed it is backed by a combination of AI and and humans so there will be humans on the other side if you really do need help with something like that I think pana is the only one that I know of in the travel space really but they are they're pretty interesting they have a personal service but also an enterprise level service so they will they're actually fighting to compete with concur for travel bookings for enterprise right now unfortunately we can't use them but but it's so yeah I would say check out panna but to like entering my information I'm wondering what sort of obstacle here you'll have adoption in severity and generational good it's a great question so I'm having these same conversations right now again if you go back to personal finance and baking very secure sensitive information so and I'm also talking about how our platform is open for people to access information not sure what the correct engineering term is for this again but there's an option to close it right so it's locked and it's not open so not every organization that we work with is going to want their information living in the cloud and available to other people to access obviously in those instances their security in place to ensure that it's locked away from anyone else accessing it so if you're American Express it's the same as you're typing and putting your information into the app if you're speaking it you're still talking to the same you're still going through the same security parameters that you would in any other situation yeah so there are two models to consider there the first one is the concierge model where you give your information to let's say Facebook em and Facebook em does something on your behalf right or a travel concierge or a health care can see it whatever it is second model and and over there you have to be able to trust the service right there is no other option the second model is where a brand engages with you directly which is using facebook Messenger for business so remember the days when Facebook came out and and Facebook had Grand pages so every brand came in and built a facebook fan page so similarly now every brand wants to build a messenger ID so people can message with them and that messenger ID is owned by the brand so you're talking to the brand directly so there is no third party and the brand is using a combination of AI and humans so it's either the Community Managers or support people so these guys are really in you know working for the brand you're not talking to a third party there so so we work only with the second model where every brand we want every brand to have a messaging ID on twitter d.m on facebook Messenger on cake on whatsapp so people can message them and then the brand team along with a I you know addresses all of that yeah i think if you think about it like you feel okay giving comcast your account number when you call the phone number that's on comcast website at some point you will be able to message cast directly and give them your account number through messenger and there is going to be a little bit of a not a learning curve but a trust curve where people are going to have to get comfortable with that but I think it's the same way that you know your bank says don't just call the phone number that's in this random email because it could be a phishing email like go to our website call that number and that's like the official number to call us at I think it'll be something similar around just establishing trust on these platforms and yeah there might be some things that some people will never want to give a third party to their you know virtual personal assistant whether it's M or Siri or Google or whoever but that one-to-one direct relationship there there will be a trust learning curve there for sure yeah and I mean if you think about today's word when you use an app from a brand or you use the site website from a brand you go there and you login you know what is an app an app is a bot right it's a piece of technology so similarly this conversation thing is just a bot and in many cases what brands are doing is they're having a logged-in experience and a logged out experience so for the decision part of the funnel of the marketing pieces you know mostly which concerns this room they might have a loud out experience for customer support you might not have to give them your ID they might give you a screen and you type in your user ID password and then they have all your information just one or two more questions so you know in most cases what we have noticed is that a brand should focus on what would be a 10x experience for the consumer and and sometimes they have some difficulty really adding value by digital experience to a consumers life so and that's the reason when brands built all these apps nobody downloaded them because they don't really add daily value now the good thing is that you don't have to add daily value you can be there and you can add periodic value right even if it's once in two months it's okay because I message some friends once in two months and that protocol is fine so the two big challenges we have seen your number one is them figuring out what are those most valuable customer touchpoints some of them have not thought on those lines you know they've just been doing blind media by mostly a spray and pray approach and this is about organic conversations that result in a real transaction so it's not about filling in you know hundreds of million people at the top of the funnel and then selling to only one percent of those it's about filling the funnel with you know one tenth of that and selling to still five times so the outcome is much higher and most brands are still kind of learning that you know the second thing we've figured out is how they look at AI some of them think oh this is AI it's going to take a long time to train you know what to talk with my brand voice you know and the proof is in the pudding right with Sony Pictures they tried it for 100 million dollar movie so it all it took them was a couple of weeks and then they said yeah this is we don't need a community manager on this particular instance let it run on its own so so I think it's those two things is figuring out what the best 10 x is for the consumer and then knowing and understanding that the tech is finally there we are in 2016 northern 2010 just going on that a little bit more like with AI and voice most hot pot and when you're having this conversation with brands it's critical that works like that's consistent in that the user experience is adding value to what they're doing I mean if you're going to change your business models to be powered by natural language and voice technology it has to work nearly a hundred percent of the time for them because you can't afford to you know lose lose your valuable consumer based on a poor experience and because i think the experiences for lack of better words may have been a little bit clunky and in the past and haven't been as positive as I think they will be in as early as this year there's some there a little bit skeptical I think to dive in full force but you know for us we really feel like a successful brand integration is one that blows their mind and changes the way that they used to do things in the past they're no longer doing it that way they're doing it this way rather than opening up a nap typing in a destination hitting another button and to get your car serviced to the airport hit one button and say I need a car right now to JFK Airport at this address done yeah and then you know one last thing to add to that is some of the brands are not are not yet realizing how big of an opportunity this is because you remember the early days of the App Store you know you could just create and publish a nap and you just get 10,000 downloads a day organically you didn't have to compete for the million other apps right so now we are in those days within messaging interfaces with any brand that comes on board you know would just get organic traffic free right that's why for organic posts on Facebook 800 hours of conversation like unheard of right so and that that window of opportunity is probably the next six months so some brands that we working with they get it in 15 minutes they move on it they benefit from it you know the others that kind of get in their own way and so it's a you know the window of opportunity is not too large I think that's a great place to end thank you guys for being here thank you guys for coming and we will see you in march for app ified TV okay you
