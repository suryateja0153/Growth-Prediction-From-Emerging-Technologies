 all right everyone thanks for joining us today for the artificial intelligence research briefing so we're just going to run through a couple housekeeping items and then I'll pass you over to Nick to dive into the content itself so first we sort of host two types of webinars here at CB insights one is sort of an hour-long broader more sort of interactive webinar where we go across a range of verticals and then this one is sort of one of our deep dive research briefings where we try to go very in-depth very quickly on a specific subject and keep it tight and short to respect your time so we're not actually going to take any questions at the end but we will answer any questions you do have so please go ahead and ask them you can do that either via the questions tab inside GoToWebinar email us at webinar at CBN sites comm or tweet at CB insights using the hash tag CBI ai and Nick and team will get back to you pretty shortly afterwards and don't worry about taking notes or anything like that we will distribute both the slides and the recording shortly after the webinar so you can have it you can do what you want with it we love folks that use our research in their research so just let us know if you're using it and how we're always curious if you do run into any sort of technical issues during the the broadcast itself your best bet is the citrix helpdesk but again worst case you'll have the slides and recording afterwards so not to worry so just a little bit about Nick Nick is one of our tech industry analysts here at CB insights obviously one of his research areas is artificial intelligence but in addition he focuses on IOT arv arts augmented reality virtual reality drone sort of our frontier tech umbrella as well as wearables prior to joining us here he was at MakerBot industries also in a research role and he came out of Hamilton College you've probably seen his research if you follow CP insights at all in Forbes fortune wired a range of other publications so we're definitely in good hands he's certainly the expert on the space just another reminder if you have questions insights visuals you want to share we're at CB insights on Twitter and we're using the hashtag CBI ai for this webinar just a little bit about us I mean all the data you're gonna see is pulled straight from our data an analytics platform so we're a software tool that lets you ask any questions you want about the private markets private companies within them who's investing in in which companies which trends and sectors are performing well which aren't etc etc so we're pretty broad research tool as well as a deep one and we're used by a lot of the world's leading global corporations some of the names here on the screen as well as most of the venture capitalists in the world so if you have research needs you know we're happy to talk about how our platform can help you answer questions on your own just drop us a line so with that I'm going to turn it over to Nick to run through artificial intelligence all right hi everybody and thanks Victor for that intro I'm super happy to be talking today about artificial intelligence it's a very fascinating field out there and it has implications on pretty much every industry around and it's really just beginning to take off so just to outline what we're gonna cover today in the webinar first we'll start off with some definitions of AI what it is the shape of the industry and the verticals to where it's being applied then we'll examine where AI is driving investment and take a look at how corporate investors are responding after that we'll do a deeper dive into AI as applied to healthcare which is one of the hottest areas for investment currently and then highlight some of the funding trends within that specific vertical after that we'll drill into a couple hot areas like advertising and business intelligence and then we'll wrap up with some industry trends and news and things were expecting to see in the coming years within the space and again if I'm moving too fast don't worry at all and we'll send out the slide deck and the webinar recording at the end and you can revisit that at your convenience so to begin you've probably heard a I've thrown around a lot lately and it's pretty much become the new tech company focus across the board so looking here everyone from Amazon to Baidu is betting big that AI is going to be a core part of their future business so Jeff Bezos of Amazon said quote it's the first inning it might be the first guy's up to bat we're on the edge of the golden age of AI and sundar pichai a ton recent earnings call unveiled the new tech company are the new company thesis at Google he said quote in the long run I think will evolve in computing from a mobile first to an AI first world so undoubtedly AI is becoming the new a central tool for anyone in the business of bits and bytes so what do we it CB insights define as AI we're talking about companies that are applying solutions to specific verticals like healthcare advertising or finance as well as those who are developing the general-purpose AI technology also known as core AI or general AI and that runs the gamut from image recognition to conversational intelligence and everything in between there so technically speaking what is AI now just to give a quick overview on the buzzwords that I'm sure you've heard thrown around more broadly ani is a branch of computer science that's trying to get computers to exhibit intelligence or perform cognitive tasks like humans do so a very popular range of techniques within AI is machine learning and one very popular machine learning technique called deep learning is where a lot of the conversation has centered around as of late and that's because deep learning is where a lot of the advances and productive research is happening within the field and if you want to learn more about it I highly recommend Frank Chen's recent video on the subject it's extremely informative if you want to learn more about the history well worth watching but what does AI look like in the field right now well if you've been on BuzzFeed or Airbnb suggested listing prices or Facebook's mmm assistant these all used deep learning or machine learning algorithms to optimize your clicks your listing price or to process and understand your language and this is all going on while the system is improving itself in the background soon AI techniques will make every application smarter faster and better suited for our needs because they're improving automatically through the experience of feeding it more data now a computer that solves problems and automatically learns from its experience it's no doubt useful in pretty much every industry imaginable so consequently everything from Finance and cybersecurity to agriculture and education they're all getting overhauled with this AI technology and it's easy to dismiss it as just another Silicon Valley buzzword but a lot of the hype is totally well-founded recently in autonomous vehicles were seeing some interesting things like George Hotz of comma a I was able to build a self-driving vehicle as a one-man team and that project recently garnered investment from andreessen horowitz and then be it in robotics and smart factories ecommerce or healthcare imaging analysis just to name a few there's really no shortage of applications and that you can see AI it will be able to revolutionize that just to give you a point of reference on on that hype I was referring to we can take a look at AI in our trends tool and it's a new CBN science feature that allows you to track news mentions and you can see here artificial intelligence versus gamification which was definitely a fad buzzword that came and went and you can see that it's probably here to stay given that comparison looking here big data or chatbots those are definitely very in fashion words right now and it's definitely comparing well against those and then just drilling into AI and seeing like the vertical to where it's being applied we see health AI versus robotics and smart factory AI versus AI is applied to auto and you can see here that you know Auto AI is moving up healthcare is trending even higher and then robotics and smart factories still has the most mentioned sim overall what does this really all mean well a lot of this has to do with the overall status of AI research right now so the sentiment in the field is extremely optimistic because research is advancing quickly whereas in the past that attitude is certainly fluctuated so since the 1950s AI has gone through several different hype cycles and then when funding and interest falls it's generally referred to as an AI winter but the feeling right now is that we're in an AI spring where pretty much anything is possible so moving into the investment landscape and globally we've seen more than six billion dollars invested over 1,100 deals and taking a look at the yearly financing trends here equity financing it to the space have gone from 282 million dollars in 2011 to two point four billion dollars in 2015 and that's a 746 percent increase in just five years and taking a look here at the quarterly chart and it really just illustrates how fast deals are accelerating so just this past quarter quarter one a ideals peaked at 143 and just quarter over a quarter that translates to 36 percent growth we're also seeing some really high tallies in quarter four and quarter four of 2014 and quarter three of 2015 we see that there's two quarters each got more than 900 million dollars invested in that time and so this is definitely a hot space for investment at the moment and deals to the space definitely skewed towards the early stages so seed in series a saw the majority of deals in all of the past five years and as the industry matures we expect that figure to retreat a little bit but it hasn't done that that much yet so in 2011 70% of the deals were cedar series a and nowadays it's 65% so it hasn't really moved terribly in those past five years but it's really the middle stages that is driving most of the investment so funding is at least in the dollars invested it's the middle stages that are taking the most and that's Series B and Series C we consider the middle stage now moving into the most active players in AI this list of the most active VCS in the space the number one most active was Khosla Ventures followed by a time between Intel Capital and data collective and then in fourth was GV so Google's venture arm right there and a very useful way to visualize these investment connections is with our business social graph so here we visualize those top four AI investors bets and you can see here there's a ton of investment connections between data collective and Khosla Ventures and they share a lot of portfolio companies and two interesting ones you can see those connections with timeful and AD company later acquired by Google and then the results of vicarious and that has a star-studded cap table that with angels that include Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk to name a few there and also interestingly Khosla Ventures backed for healthcare related AI companies so using this business social graphs a very useful tool for understanding those connections between the startups and their investors so moving into the corporates that are getting involved it's pretty evident how funding has ramped up in the past two years so corporate back deals and dollars reached a new high in 2015 with 926 million dollars invested across 88 deals and some of the largest rounds last year included a series raised by tubulin a series D round raised by insidesales.com and then a fifty five million dollar Series C round raised by a Yas D which happens to be backed by his city ventures again looking at the quarterly trend the the pace of deal-making is accelerating fast so we're seeing those funding spikes in quarter 1 of 2015 we're driven by those previously mentioned rounds by Yazdi tabouleh and insidesales.com so taking a look at the most active corporate venture arms that are investing nearly all of these top corporate venture arms are for tech or data giants which is somewhat unsurprising I guess so topping this list we have Intel capital we have Google Ventures we have GE ventures Samsung Ventures and Bloomberg beta and investment in the space likely offers all of them immense value and the ability to extract more out of their very data-driven core businesses and again we visualized those connections using our business social graph which illustrates here a pretty notable three-way connection between Intel Capital G V and Samsung Ventures and that's on expect elapse and that's a company working on conversational intelligence it's another very interesting visualization there so aside from those what other areas are hot just doing a quick look at the Coria companies those companies that are focused on general purpose a I for a variety of industries now here's a list of those most well-funded in that area so we have sentient a Yazdi digital reasoning vicarious and data robot and all of these song fifty million dollars or more in equity finding financing so while a lot of investments certainly going to general-purpose AI we've also mapped out the more specific verticals where AI companies are seeing funding so this is a heat map based on our sub industry taxonomy z' and we can see that top deals our top areas for deals were healthcare advertising sales and marketing as well as business intelligence among many others here you can see and because healthcare is driving so much of the activity we really wanted to do a little bit of a deeper dive into that area and I think one quote that really highlights the possibility within the healthcare arena Bernard Tyson of Kaiser Permanente said quote I don't think any physician today should be practicing without artificial intelligence assisting in their practice it's just impossible otherwise to pick up on patterns to pick up on trends to really monitor care and so going forward AI can be that ultimate enabling tool for the the future of healthcare and we made a market map of AI companies within the healthcare space and group them according to what area they're innovating within and drug discovery was one interesting one so this is using AI in data analysis for a pharmaceutical R&D with the mental goal of reducing trial times and bringing drugs to market so companies working there include 2x AR which is a company backed by injury sin Horowitz as well as numeron which is backed by Atlas ventures and foundation capital another interesting space towards the left side of this graphic you can see there's wearables so devices for remote patient monitoring or using advanced algorithms on the data to improve health outcomes so two interesting companies there were physic you and bio beats and then lastly in the far left you can see Diagnostics and imaging companies which is kind of an interesting space these are companies that are branching that are working on improving the imaging itself or trying to squeeze more juice from the same data to make diagnosis more accurate so companies working there include deep learning startup deep genomics zebra medical vision which is backed by clothes adventures and Marc Benioff as well as our Terrace which is backed by GE ventures here's the list of the most well funded AI companies that are working in healthcare and topping the list there's well.talk which is a health management platform that partnered once with IBM Watson there's AI Carbon X in health data there's stratified medical in drug R&D butterfly network and ultrasound imaging and a pixie oh and clinical data analytics and you might also notice that in total funding these top even those core EAJA companies we were talking about before so one example well talk saw pretty sizable 192 million dollars in total funding so looking at deals to healthcare related AI companies deal volume has been increasing year over year since 2011 and with deals more than doubling in 2014 so and 2015 the growth was a little bit more modest but funding had a massive leap of nearly four hundred and sixty percent in the year of 2014 so went from 64 million dollars the year prior in 2013 to 358 million in 2014 and that massive jump was driven in large part by butterfly networks one hundred million dollar Series C round as well as stratified medicals round of 64 million dollars and just in comparison the largest round in 2013 was for less than twenty million dollars over not only seeing more deal as we're seeing bigger deals in the healthcare AI space again the court the chart really just underscores how deals are seeing an incredible uptick especially as late so taking a look at the deal share over the past five years new startups are definitely venturing into this healthcare AI space so the vast majority 69 percent of deals were at the early stages that's seed and series a middle stages took 13% and late stages saw just 3% of the deals and then taking a look at the dollars invested funding into healthcare is slightly less skewed but still saw 39% of dollars invested at the early stages middle stages saw 32% of the dollars invested and then 13% of funding went to late stage deals and then finally wrapping up on the health care front there's an increasing amount of healthcare deals as a proportion of all AI investments so in 2011 healthcare made up 11% of all the AI deals and actually in last year and 2015 that figure was 15% so healthcare is playing an increasingly big role in the greater AI ecosystem so aside from healthcare what other areas are hot remember remember that in our heat map before we saw that advertising sales and marketing was an area that saw a relatively high amount of deals so companies here are using advanced algorithms to predict the best time to reach you on what device and then tailor email messages based on your online behavior and here's the list of the most well-funded within that area insidesales.com tops the list that ones backed by Microsoft ventures among several other corporates as well so moving into one other hot space this one is a the popular sub industry of business intelligence so a tensity here provides corporate insights and is the most well funded on this list and one application here is also using natural language processing to analyze social media sentiment which is pretty similar to also what net base is doing so where is AI going again bringing in that heat map we're seeing activity picking up for CRM so customer relationship management as well as personal assistants and that's indicated by their increasingly yellow tiles over the years here some areas for opportunity we're actually seeing that there's still plenty of room with in e-commerce and education and e-commerce aside from like a sudden spike in 2015 they're still relatively light on deals for both those categories and overall within this space we're seeing an increasing amount of exit activity so last year I saw that there were two IPOs the automated marketing company Edgar rhythms and the Internet of Things company building IQ we're among the 38 exits in AI last year and just that the current run rate right now and without having closed quarter to 2016 still on track to have a record-breaking year for exits we've seen already 24 have happened thus far and we're expecting to see 2016 to be another record year for AI exits actually what's kind of interesting about these exits and the companies that are getting acquired the vast majority are snapped up within four years from their first financing so you can see here from the dot plot that very few or even above the five-year mark except for a few outliers they're just another cool visualization you can do inside the CD insights product and one very cool timeline we built here illustrates the M&A activity chronologically so you can see from this Google is clearly ahead of the pack and made some pretty key acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 so neural network startup DNN research and late deepmind technologies for 650 million dollars and you may know that deep mine was the company that later within Google developed the AI algorithms to beat the human world champion in the board game go also interesting salesforce an apple join the race last year and you can see they've each made three acquisitions and overall we expect this race to continue to heat up in the coming years as big corporations start to compete with one another and keep on snapping up different private AI companies and integrating them and third into their larger businesses and then highlights some notable industry news from the year of course there was google's go breakthrough using deep mind technology to be at least at all the top ranking human player a little after that I mentioned it before comma AI is George Hotz who built a self-driving car in his garage and got funding from a 16 Z then we saw on viv labs the maker of Siri amounts a demo for its AI assistant and a little more recently Facebook announced its M chat bot assistant will eventually be powered completely by by AI but first needs to build out a common sense AI to more intuitively learn language and circumvent needing to feed it enormous data sets for it to learn very simple things but actually really interesting Li just this last week IBM whose Watson AI project helped get the company more patents granted than any other American company in 2015 IBM recently announced a large partnership with 16 medical imaging companies with the goal of predicting diseases like cancer diabetes and heart failure which is a very exciting application and to wrap up with some recent deals silence is a pretty interesting one we saw its a cyber security company that recently did a 100 million dollar series D mana which I've talked about in my previous industrial IOT webinar they're applying anti techniques to industrial Internet of Things data and they just did a series B fractal analytics did a large growth round in May globality which counts Al Gore and Sheryl Sandberg among some of its angel investors held a series B in April and I carbon ex a health care company based in China did a massive 154 million dollar series a at a 1 billion dollar valuation so an exciting unicorn to keep track of there but that concludes pretty much everything I had prepared for you today and I just want to thank you again for listening and please know that AI is an area of ongoing coverage for us so stay tuned for coming research and a more full length webinar and we will be feeling questions offline on Twitter if you use the hashtag CBI ai and if you want to find me my handle is @n Papaji so Nick Papageorge at n P Appa G and again we will send out the slide deck and a webinar recording at the end of the presentation which you can revisit and just want to thank you again and I look forward to bringing you more in the future
