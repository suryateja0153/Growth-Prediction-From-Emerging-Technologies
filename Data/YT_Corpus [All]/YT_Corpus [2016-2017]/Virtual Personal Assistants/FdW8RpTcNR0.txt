to share this out on Twitter and by your followers on periscope and share this out on facebook especially for catching us on the replay share this out on youtube so check this out this was my life I was 22 years old I had two businesses I had three dogs that were basically my kids I had a long time girlfriend lives you're basically married you know I had three cars and I was you know most people would call me successful but that was on the outside on the inside I was you know not having the best amount of sleep there was just a lot of work going on I was always stressed out I was always nervous that something wasn't going down my business owned me I did not own my business and very specifically I remember one time that I was watching TV or watching the movie with my girlfriend at the time and I was so stuck into thinking about business that she had to literally snap like this for about three minutes straight just to get me to come back to her because I was off in space somewhere thinking about okay who's handling this what's going on with this operation what's going on with here and if you guys can relate let me know about putting a blunt down in the comments below that it's something like that has ever happened where you just so absorbed in your business where you neglected straight of neglected the people around you and you know that was one instance and check this out I didn't really think too much of it at the time typical guy right so the next day I actually come home from putting like another 20 hours in my business I come home and my girl has all of her bags packed straight up in fellas if you ever been in the situation holla if you hear me ok if you've ever come home and your girlfriend or your lady or your booth thing just has all our stuff back and she's got that look and you know that looks especially my fellows she's got that look like yeah you pretty much messed up and I'm this close to leaving so I did what every guy with you and I just went over and I said hey you know man get this thing figured out and I'll sit with me I promise you this is the last time that is going to happen and you know let me let me figure this thing out so I can figure this out just give me some time and so she was like all right aight i convince her to stay we unpack her stuff and then i had a mission guys how to keep this woman in my life so I have a confession I have a confession guys I was once the bottleneck of my business too and it was affecting myself it was affecting my business it was affecting my personal life was affecting so many aspects of my life that's because I was a bother i cut my face I was you know the end-all be-all if I didn't show up to work my business did it grow and a lot of you guys were listening to this right now on that same exact position don't worry because I'm going to help you out with the rest of this training it was affecting my personal life as you guys know you know I almost you know had a nice young lady leave my life because of my business obligations and I couldn't go on like this I mean is there something that I couldn't do I knew this stuff is on there this is not free reported this is live but this will get pre-recorded for some of the periscope viewers so can you guys are late can you guys are late with you know neglecting somebody neglecting your personal life neglecting your obligations neglecting your health neglecting you know other parts of your business because you're just so consumed with doing things that you are you know you're you think you should be doing it you can relate let me know and i want to introduce you guys to the Brooking meet so this is the rookie mean we got a lot of people on periscope so they can relate a lot so the rookie me had multiple businesses I was missing family gatherings I had a zero social life I was up late I was up early I was sleep deprived I was not working out I had no yoga for those of you guys can follow me you could know that I love yoga special on her roots operation I had to eat all of my meals in five minutes I didn't have x hehe I literally didn't have time to eat I just had five minutes to eat so you know how the army guys go to the cafeteria and just chow down their food that was me everywhere that I went my to-do list ran for weeks and my life was not really the best part of a existence at that point in time I just you know was so over well it's not a good good look I did not all my time and if that describes your life right now if you can relate to that you know please let me know cuz i made this training specifically for you and help is on the way I wanted to work less make more money and have more time for the things that truly matter in life and so for me that was beaches friends family and see gars for you could be something else everybody is on this earth to create their own livestock and do that very quickly here in 2016 so I wrote my goal down and this is listen what I literally wrote I want to make more money for every hour that I work I want my time to be truly valuable and I want to work less here's the first thing that I get so take out your notes guys this is where your note-taking skills come in handy the first thing that I did was I wrote down everything that I did I check to see if what I was doing was making me money and I split it up into two lists the first list was a money making lists the second list was a no money making lists so just to recap we got two lists you want to split it in between one of the things that are making you money and one of the things that are not making you money very simple maybe these and honestly guys I was shocked and I was embarrassed I really was eighty percent of the tasks that I was doing was not making me money twenty percent of the tasks that I was doing was made any money so here I am you know running all these businesses neglected people in my life and when I was neglecting people and not taking care of myself and the people around me eighty percent of my time was devoted to not making money and being busy only twenty percent of my time was making money and I was you know quite frankly shocked and embarrassed that I neglected the people in my life or busy work it was very embarrassing honestly so it reminded me of the old to 80 20 roll ah the old 8020 rule and here for those you guys are not familiar with the 8020 rule here's the 8020 definition everything and everything runs the eighty percent of the effects come from twenty percent of the cost so for example twenty percent of the professional football athletes come from California Florida or Texas twenty percent of the world's wealth is in you know one in particular City and you know this particular part of the world 20 end of the world be supply comes from this country and so on and so forth you can find the eighty twenty percent full and every single aspect of life and this is called the Pareto principle so I strongly recommend for you to look into this this is true and everything you're going to see a t20 everywhere you go so I immediately handled or handed off 80 I immediately handle tasks to my assistant that was in eighteen percent so if it wasn't making me money boom that was the first thing that I hand it off to my assistant and that's the first thing that I recommend for you guys to do I only focused on the twenty percent and this is a very simple formula when you focus on the things that make you money you're going to make more money let's say that again because it might have missed you when you focus your time on the thing that makes you money you're going to make more honey and yo man isn't asking for my notes yes if you're looking for my notes you can go to my private Facebook group the talents fry or you can go to WWE talented mr. Salas calm and you can find all of my presentations there and so there we go revenue generating activities so our GA stands for revenue generating activities and let's break this down revenue for those you guys who don't know what revenue is revenue is the lifeblood of every single business guys your business needs brevity if you are running a business right now and you don't have revenue I hate people want to tell you this you don't have a business you have a liability you have a loss any encounter will tell you to shut your business down you are fundamentally not practicing you know good business and you should shut down immediately so this is what book is on to our second word is generating even though you may not have revenue right now you can generate revenue right now and the way generate revenue is by focusing on the final word activities the activities that make you read it and so focus your time on our GA revenue generating activities you get if you have any questions about our GA what is slacking how to identify them make sure you note at www talented mr. Salas calm I've got so many free resources on how to identify what your r-ga is and of course time equals money focus your time on our GA to make more money focus your time on revenue generating activities to make more money that's right that's what you always hear people who are rich say time is money time is money Mark Cuban Richard Branson so many people who are billionaires they would never spend time up being a janitor at their business they will never be the receptionist at their business because it is literally beneath their a great and they're bound to their business and their value is growing that business to hire more janitors so however more secretary to provide more value into the marketplace and into the world so let's talk about the first stuff to outsource the first up to hand off to your assistant so the first task that I hand it off to my assistant was social media management and very specifically and here's where you guys want to take notes I handled them off or ended off scheduling posts so going into HootSuite for going into Twitter or editor buffer post planner all of these scheduling tools I just gave that has my virtual assistant I said you know what I realized that social media is the biggest time-suck of all time online and I don't want to spend my time you know and more time necessary than social media because social me is very profitable it's very advantageous to build your brand to generate leads to connect with your audience to get feedback and that's what you should use your time on social media for you really should have used your time to focus want the back in unless you're looking at analytics but even then that can be outsourced I'll talk to that here and it's just a little bit so the next step up is content curation so content curation is different from content creation where you don't have to create content you can find a really informative blog that is truly a resource to your audience and you can go through and have your assistant find those high performing or viral worthy blog posts and put that out into your audience in your tribe amongst all your social media channels so they can then share that out for you and now let that is it has a proven article or blog that you did not have to create that is now being dispersed and distributed amongst all of your social channels so you get more eyeballs so you get more followers which turns into more leads which turns into more sales which means more revenue which means more organ capital which means more working capital to invest back into your business to blow it up if I'm making sense put a one down in the comments below if you haven't already shared this out and fight your followers share this out to Twitter let me know how to don't how it's going down I know I have some technical difficulties and I pros for just a little bit but I really appreciate you guys sticking with me on my coconut Wi-Fi hopefully the recording is great for you guys let me know on YouTube up next is your graphics you've got to give your graphics in order you're not an artist let's be real a lot of us likes and make pretty things but you're not an artist your value to your business is not going to can book or Adobe spark or even photoshop if you're skilled like that that stuff making graphics takes time and you should be having your virtual assistant do that thankfully there's free tools zero dollars and zero cents right now that you can have your assistant go and watch a 20 to 25 minute you tube video at youtube university and watch and how to make the perfect can book graphic and when they make that perfect camera graphic guess what you want to make me template so here's a monastic for you guys you want to make a template of your podcast shows of your webinar so if you look at all of my Instagram post on my pinterest post there's a certain template that my be a swish out different things and we've got certain fonts and colors and guidelines and designs that will stick around so we can quickly make graphics and numbers are everything especially if you're going to leverage social media and marketing business behind you gotta know your conversions got to know your attention you got to know your unsubscribes you got to know your lives and your engagement now getting all that information is very very time-consuming you need that information but you don't necessarily need to go out scoop of that information that is something that you don't need to do and your assistance should do that for you so you know what's working and what's not working so you can best serve your audience up next is your engagement I get so many messages on facebook that might be a would definitely to to connect with people they'll respond long and say hey want to let you know that we've received your message this is Frank's assistant we're going to give his out to uh Frank and check this out and you know we'll get back to you and now they're like okay it's good customer service they sent a request they got a response they no one's going to take us some time to get back to them they explained that there's a process to communicating with us and they don't feel like we've dropped the ball and now they're very anxious to talk to us the next time so answering messages is huge again social media is a time-suck there's so many on all of my people that are going to ask and demand your time that it's best for you to really filter those beads and qualify those eats through your assistance and you're always been of your time talking with people that are truly going to be able to work with you in and are able to take those next step with you so that's the first time sub so just to recap social media is the biggest time son of all time outsource it completely and follow my material all on social media at talented mr. solace because i really love least a lot of my material on how to delegate and how to growth hack your social media practice with it with a virtual assistant up next is email man guys email is such a pain I probably realistically get about 500 to 700 emails a day no joke I'm sure you guys get the same and here's what immediately you want to do clean up that inbox first and foremost tell your assistant to go to your inbox and unsubscribe to newsletters that don't serve you and I'm talking about banana republic guys I'm talking about the gap I'm talking about forever 21 I'm talking about Netflix I'm talking about amazon all of these newsletters that are better you're not that are not serving youth that are asking for your money that are as MPEG to spend your resources from your business that you should be investing into your business you don't mean spending your time with that you don't need to spend your time interview more entertaining those thoughts because there's this thing called the death of a thousand paper cuts and I'm going to break down this process this is an extra bonus for you guys the death of a thousand paper cuts is this your brain as a human being you have a certain amount of mental stamina and if you have to decide on okay do I want to take a soy latte a latte or coffee at the coffee shop that is nuking away at your decision making buildings if you have to decide okay on my way to work if there's traffic do I need to make a left or right that decision is nikic away at your decision-making capabilities same thing with emails imagine all the emails that come of your brain subconsciously as it intellectually even mean you have to use some portion of your brain to read those emails and that is making away at your mental stamina which mix away at your decision-making capabilities now do that enough in a better in a 24 hour cycle or even an eight hour work cycle which is unrealistic for most of us entrepreneurs guess what by the time it's it's time to make that high-level decision that's going to change your business you will not be as mentally prepared as we normally would have if somebody else would have handled those little things this is why I take uber this is why I get my groceries delivered up and go into that a little bit later the presentation a little ahead of myself if you're picking up when I'm put down make sure you share this out and invite your peeps but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how to organize your inbox a little bit and why it's so important so you want to organize your game box into separate folders so you know ok these are these letters that do surgery like right now I'm getting really big into a copywriting and there's a few people that I'm calling on the piece letters to see how their copywriting it's done and any offers it may have to be so I have a copy writing and folder on my inbox then I have a folder of virtual assistants that want to work with me and work with my clients I have an entire folder there so if I mean somebody I can just say okay who do I who I knowing this who do I know in graphics what I know and let me go ahead and see if they're available for work I have a holder of my podcast for my interview by media and so on and so forth it's much more organized that way then I have my assistant create templates and when my assistant creates templates for my email is I we have a specific template for how to get on podcast I don't know how to impress people to be on my show how to bottle the league and so on and so forth I have my assistant model of all of my prospects and this is huge guys scheduling and confirming appointment is one of the biggest time sucks on email it's like okay one time or to you hey what time works to you what time works for you and it's like that back and forth that is really not going to serve you in your business and it's going to make doing this with you a little impractical and we'll just might not like that so having your assistant professionally schedule and confirm your employment is going to make your life so much easier especially if you're meeting with clients doing any consulting doing any proposals you get to spend that time that you want to schedule and confirm on that appointment I'm better serving your client and that's an extra 30 minutes to an hour that you can some focus on that client to win that contract guys holla if you hear maybe picking up when I put them let me know by typing a one down in the comments below everybody and here's a bonus pro tip as you guys are making comments it that really appreciate the support everybody around the world here's a bonus bonus pro tip so thank you so much Giggy thank you so much and then thank you so much you'll really appreciate that Jennifer today and amazing so here's a bonus pro tip streak is a email management system in your inbox and this is going to allow you to easily manage this and it's going to allow your assistant to go in there and focus on your inbox and making it very organized so to recap you want to outsource your social media and delegate your social media busy work first and then have your assistant going after your email that's really going to help you out now finally guys this is where it's really going to pay off but this is where it really gets good let's talk about upgrading your lifestyle and this is where I really get excited hexcel by now so I focus as much literally as much of my waking hours that I possibly can on my business I don't dry I have a driver I take taxis and I take ubers arrived a public transportation my my hands instead of being on the steering wheel are better served on my phone building my empire following up with leaves and creating content that is where mine that is revering the most value to my business right there so I don't even spend time on my phone opening up goober and calling an uber to go take me to the mall or to the gym or wherever I need to go I don't spend any of my time doing that whatsoever I have my assistant go in and they call them when you perform you or they call up a taxi for me and I don't handle anything my assistant will send me a message two minutes before they arrive and say hey Frank I usually live in condos hey Frank don't leisure the luggage should probably get it out now and so when I get that message to my assistant I just locked up walk out and I get to spend more time focusing on building my business so that might be 5x + 20 minutes that I don't you know invest in my business but that adds up let's have you that five times in a in a week that's an hour a week for hours a mother you know 48 hours in a in a year that's an extra 50 hours that I get to invest in my business what could you do with an extra 50 hours in your list how would that make your bottom line go up who could you network with what kind of client calls cuz you go on you know what kind of sponsorships can you get the domino effect and butterfly effect really does add up so love next is I have a maze so I don't handle any of the house work at all and I don't even call up my made my assistant is in direct communication with my maid and she informed me when my baby comes in to come surgery so she's like hey your maids coming in at nine o'clock today or at this time today and because i don't have to call her I just know that things are going to get you know cleaned up and everything's going to be expand I don't spend that time even calling for confirming that my mates showing up and if she's naturally not my assistant then has a protocol today to go call up my number two maybe my number three mate just so my house can be clean and I don't have to worry about that so that's a whole wire that I don't have to put out I don't have to deal with that at all that's what I really love and I find a lot of stress free pass on something like that so dry cleaning this is very helpful for me I wear a lot of students I do a lot of presentations I you know so on a real estate and I have a lot of sync I have a lot of clothes that require maintenance and for me to go to brush to the dry cleaning store or shop or to even call up somebody for them to pick it up it's just too much of a hassle and my assisting calls up my dry cleaners to come pick it up for my doorstep to you handle all that and I don't have to worry about it it just gets done I didn't say hey i sent a text to my VA for my phone and I say hey I haven't dry cleaning to be done and they do it up next is a grocery delivery now guys this is what you're really going to get your mind blown let's go ahead and say let's go talk averages so on average if you live in a first world country it's going to take you anywhere in the world about 20 to 30 minutes to get to the grocery store it's going to take you 20 to 30 minutes to get back the grocery store this is including traffic you know carding x y&z that is an hour of your day that is an hour of your week and to give a big family or you get a lot like I do that might be even two to three hours of your week and that really really really adds up that's not even taking into consideration the time that you spend in the aisles pick up the same exact food we're all creatures of habits and we all the same things every one of us has the same aisle the favorite cereal we get the same type of eggs the same type of milk why is it important for you to go there and pick it up yourself think you got a deal with the lines and I don't know that all right hey sorry for the technical difficulties I'm on the coconut Wi-Fi here very quickly we're talking about grocery delivery and I don't know about you but every time that I go to the grocery store I get stuck behind that old lady who still writes checks man this lady is still writing checks and I get stuck behind her and she said how much sweetie and she's like riding with her fingers that are about to break this her bones or so damn Fredo because she's so damn old and she's trying to ride a ship in the year 2016 and then she's trying to balance her checkbook and use a coupon at the same time that she got from the newspaper and I'm just trying to go home and worry about my email list or write a blog post or workout or video but look the cigar or do something like that so you know I as you can tell I hate me to the grocery store I absolutely hate it you know and I would rather get my groceries delivered to me in the way that I get my groceries delivered to me is well down in the South I'm from Texas we have the store called a GP and they have an application that my virtual assistant downloads I have a set list she you know goes the one with usual frame and I say yes and you know what I'm having people over can we have an extra two bottles of wine and we do X Y and C X you know blah blah blah let me get some wine also I need to up my calories from the throwing it double the chicken or courtship with the eggs or something like that I just tell her what I eat and if she just puts it in the app and then an hour later it is delivered into my doorstep I don't have to deal with all of that so that's a bunch of time that I get back now also reservations I entertain a lot of clients I have a lot of friends we'd like to go on to the next places and talk business smoke cigars enjoy ourselves and resident calling up a restaurant get reservations that does take some time and you know it's it's very easy to like let us slip and then you know like most guys and this is where the fellas for sure wait to the last minute and we're like I'll let me call that reservation and by the time we call it up I'm sorry sir our reservations are booked for the evening and now you talk to a girl you taking her to uh to trulucks steakhouse in downtown Austin Texas and you got to take her to Red Lobster and she's like you know all pretty dress for sure looks you got it owner red lobster get the cheddar biscuits you know what I'm saying fellas holla you hear me same thing for movie tickets you say all that time vbr my virtual assistant always make sure that I gave my game of thrones and the walking dead recorded and my cowboy game recorded so I can watch that anywhere in the world all of my travel plans and my book my travel plans are both of my virtual assistant so I don't spend time you know I keep it looking for the best prize looking for the best rate they kind of know when I like to leave how much I want to spend and so on and so forth and the biggest time say and the lifestyle upgrade that i get for my assistant is price shock so every one of us does it like right now I'm in the market for drum and I'm trying to find it the best Trump for the best price I want to compare I want to see which one is which and that takes some time so what I do is I just say you know what assisted why don't you get it is I give it to my assistant and they handle all that funny so that saves me so much time I keep bringing a time but time is so pretty important that I can reinvest back into my business so here is the million-dollar question what are you going to do with all of your free time what are you going to do with all of your free time guys I would already going to travel you have you now have more time for traveling you have it now not more time for vacations yeah more time to go to different conferences to go to speak and different events you have that time now you can also take up new hobbies so you can spark that creativity i'm always a fan of if you're not growing you're dying and you also need new skills and your best skills come through hobbies you really good at one you like to eat so why not find out what you're really good at and take on more hobbies you have more time for friends and family you know you've got people around you you want to make sure that you invest time with them as we all know life is a no is very precious Theo says that he would travel the world helping for families especially kids that's his passion you know a lot of people want to give back you have more time to get back a fulfilled life sports genius creativity guys of the field like sparks genius creativity as we all want to provide so you and your business can grow from a stress-free relaxed frame of mind and the time that you now spend working it's more productive your mental stamina is fresh and quick so you can make better decisions for your business and so you can make profitable decisions for your business you will make more money and you will spend less time working inside of your business if that's something that you're looking to do say that again if you're looking to make more money in less time without working inside of your business then you guys definitely have some all the week gotta follow all of my content this is exactly what I'm about and by your friends and tell them to follow my closet as well because once you start focusing on that you can focus on your business growing if you're not on the inside of your business you can be on the outside of your business working on your business to build it to make it grow and you know what are you waiting for why I want to have you not outsource I truly want to know let me know in the comments down below send me a tweet at talent
