 we've got so many answers already haven't we from justing one piece of analysis which is basically what if what if what if what if well I would do this well I would do this well I already do this so every time you do or what if you don't just open up and go on I clever you go well what am I gonna do as a result now you may not do all of this straight away but having thought about it when something hits you go ah I thought about that what was I going to do again and so you just one step further forward because we are entrepreneurs property is like a great big fat tanker you know when those massive things that go between China and Canada and so to turn it round is quite difficult and slow so I want you to have done all the thinking in advance so you like well if they do that then I'll do this so you can get a faster speed of turnaround at the point that you need to make kind of a slightly strategic move to the left or to the right no hitting icebergs please not at all so we've gone through that and it's what does that mean for my property strategy every single time
