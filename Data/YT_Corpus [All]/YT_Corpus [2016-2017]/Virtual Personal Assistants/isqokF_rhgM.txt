 hi this is yaro and welcome to the third video in this three-part mini training series I've put together for you in the lead up to our live workshop where you're gonna learn how to launch your own online platform and grow your email list and build a following so you can sell your own products and services so in the first video I talked about the numbers how many people are online and what a tremendous opportunity you have to share your ideas share your knowledge and grow your platform and essentially grow your email list for free and then sell your products and services in the second video I explained about the attention deficit issue that exists today on the internet because there is so much information and how you can use your platform to cut through the noise and grab attention and build that loyal following now in this third video I'm gonna introduce you to the overall process the phases the four phases that you have to work through to build your platform in the workshop I'm gonna go deep into all four of these phases but I want you to be aware heading into that workshop what exactly you have to do so what is it like to build your own platform so what I'm gonna do now is switch over to my slide just to show you exactly what those four phases are so here we go okay here are my four phases this is the four phase plan that you're gonna work through to build your platform and I'm gonna explain in much more detail each of these four phases in the workshop but here's an overview so you know what you're going to learn the first phase I call profit identification this is making sure you're building a platform going after the big money you're not going after an area where there isn't much money or you're not going after the wrong tarek type of people you're not basically building a whole platform to only find out that you can't actually make money in that area the second phase is what I call building trust this is simply sharing your ideas and your content in order to build a relationship with to educate them to help them when you do this well with the right types of content you'll build trust and you'll never have to sell selling is only necessary when Trust isn't present so if you do the work to provide valuable content you will build trust naturally hence you won't need to do hard selling so explain what type of content you need to produce and distribute on your online platform in order to get this outcome so people come to you hungry to buy without your needing to sell in the third phase I call it distribution this is how you can use the internet to reach new audiences this is pretty straightforward it's all about going out onto the internet picking a medium of distribution a platform that you don't own it's someone else's platform it could be a social media platform it could be a multimedia platform it's all the possible tools you no doubt have heard about the Facebook's the instagrams the Pinterest the podcasting the youtubing all those places where there already are audiences and going out to the one best point of distribution for you so I'm going to explain how to pick the right distribution channel because I don't want you feeling like you have to be everywhere and go on all the different platforms out there because that's too much work it's too stressful you can't do that at the beginning of building your platform maybe when things get bigger you can expand to multiple distribution channels but to start with I want you to reach your audience just with one powerful channel and explain how to do that inside the workshop and finally I'm gonna teach you how to generate cash flow right now when you start a platform to begin with what you really need is incoming cash because that gives you the power to grow obviously gives you the power to cover your costs as well so you have to focus on making money it has to be built in to the creation of your platform I'm gonna explain the different types of income streams you can tap into what I personally recommend you tap into and also the order I recommend you establish them in because let's face it you might not be ready to go and create a huge two thousand dollar course yet because you just don't have enough Meishan you don't have all the pieces of the puzzle put together yet so there is a product or a service that is right for the situation you're in I'm going to go through them inside the presentation inside the workshop so we're gonna go through all four of these phases the profit identification phase building trust tapping into distribution channels and then establishing consistent cash flow when you successfully move through all four phases the end result is the creation of a powerful online platform that delivers some truly amazing changes to your life of course there's the obvious you're going to sell your own products and services and you're gonna get paid really really well we're talking multiple six figures even up to millions of dollars simply because you help people with your information it's a beautiful way to make money and I want you to experience that on top of this this is a business model that you can do what I call live the laptop lifestyle it's the main brand it's the main phrase that I put out into the world because it's how I've lived my life for over 15 years it's how many of my graduates currently live their life because you have an internet business that's based purely on you sharing ideas so you can be sitting in a lap using your laptop in a cafe anywhere in Europe you could be down by a beach somewhere in Australia that's where I'm from originally you could be skiing in in Canada which is where I'm currently living you could be doing what you do anywhere in the world the options are there you have the freedom you have the opportunity when your platform is doing the work for you also you can have tremendous opportunities that you might even be thinking about right now but Mike one day want for example you can get a book deal you could become a paid speaker and travel around the world you could meet industry figures that you never thought you could get in touch with even legends and celebrity simply because you make the choice to build your platform now I'm my best case study for what I teach because I've obviously practiced what I teach but I also have some incredible graduates who've done amazing things with their own businesses following this system and creating their own platform during the live workshop I'm gonna actually show you some live case studies of many of my graduates in all kinds of different subjects because I want you to see how their platforms currently exist online what kind of content they share how they grow their email lists and what products and services they sell and they do it in all kinds of subjects from dealing with attention deficit disorder producing TV shows becoming a virtual assistant riding BMX bikes professionally a woman in business coach book publishing treating acne college sports writing books motivating people cosmetic chemistry personal training even doing other languages like I've got a person in French teaching people how to make money blogging in French and another person teaching people speed reading in Indonesian and outsourcing so these are some of the people who have gone through my training graduated and really taken this principle of growing your platform to the next level they're making anywhere from at least a hundred thousand dollars a year all the way up to several million dollars I will introduce you to a couple of my million-dollar case studies and I do this because I want you to see the tangible reality of what it means to actually implement this idea and build a platform so look out for these amazing case studies in the live workshop in case this is perhaps a little bit confusing a little bit fuzzy these live case studies will definitely clarify things for you what I especially love about all the people I just showed you on that slide is they all started from nothing they didn't necessarily had any technical skills they're not programmers they're not developers or coders they may have never even had a website before but what they did have were good ideas and they knew they could share those ideas and help people solve problems and from there they went on to build these online platforms and grow their following and today they reap the rewards but they were just like you possibly are right now they were starting from a base of nothing no email lists no following never written a piece of content that they published on the Internet they learn how to do it they follow the system I teach and today they're living extremely amazing lives that most people really can only I'm out so what I want for you is for you to actually show up on this live workshop so I can introduce you and teach you how to do this this is a workshop where it's not just about me explaining to you how great my life is this is about actually taking you through eight steps to build your platform this is a how-to learning workshop you are gonna walk away with some actionable steps to make progress building your own platform but for that to happen you have to be there on the live workshop so I hope you already have the details in your calendar you've got
