 I just returned from an amazon focus seller conference and let me tell you it was outstanding no disrespect any presenter because they were all extremely knowledgeable relatable and accommodating but the overwhelming value to this like most conferences was networking for anyone new to attending conferences I can't emphasize enough how enriching networking is in our first few years of selling we didn't attend many conferences and when we did we very rarely interacted with other attendees due to being intimidated uncomfortable worse than either of those feeling like we were more advanced than the other attendees as time has passed and I've been able to see the business relationships developed accomplishes positively and directly affect the dividends of my company I can confidently say that this was naive at best and more likely flat out stupid since we began interacting exchanging stories ideas and insight with other attendees we have established a group of multi-million dollar sellers we regularly brainstorm with if they consider to be a high-level mastermind and the best part is each and every one of the people in the mastermind we met while attending a conference one of our mastermind members provide an insight that more than double the production from our virtual assistants another partner with us on a product is currently netting over two thousand dollars in profit per month yet another shared some retail arbitrage belongs during q4 that easily brought in over 15,000 in revenue now these are just a few examples of how this mastermind formed by other conference attendees catapulted our business so the next time you consider attending a conference just do it then once you get there overcome your intimidation and venture outside your comfort zone because business and even personal growth can only come with perceived limitations or question and then tested don't let your dreams be dreams yesterday you said tomorrow so just do it make your dreams come true just do it
