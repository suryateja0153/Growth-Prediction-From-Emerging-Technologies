 so roughly every 10 years a new paradigm comes along that changes the way we interact with computers well we don't think it's a secret what that next paradigm is going to be and we're not alone pretty much every major technology company is now investing billions of dollars in the intelligent assistant space right this is a race a race to the single interface for the user so without further ado let's meet them now a couple of notes we're talking to pretty much all of the major companies around the world to put viv on all different types of devices but today I'm going to show it to you on a phone it's a pretty rich experience and the other thing I wanted to note was that series gives audible voice is something we're still working on so you're not going to hear that today but it'll certainly be there when the product comes was it raining in Seattle three Thursday's ago right so great weather underground to the rescue again but as you can see it has a much stronger understanding when you can teach it and developed the let natural language aspects of it and I'm gonna take another even bigger leap to sort of a question that you might not ask actually but just to show you a little more of the power will it be warmer than 70 degrees near the Golden Gate Bridge after 5 p.m. the day after tomorrow okay so this is a pretty sophisticated query very few assistants in the world do stuff like this but this is where viv can be trained up by developers so we've got a new technology that we've been working on patenting and it's a computer science breakthrough called dynamic program generation so when it understood the intent of the user it generated this program so this is software that writing itself now you remember this one a minute ago much more sophisticated again in ten milliseconds viv wrote a 44 step program that figured out all of the details are on the context of the fact that Golden Gate Bridge is a point of interest and when the day after tomorrow is connecting all the services and minds it's pretty incredible technology so what I'm gonna do now is show you where we put our emphasis on the initial development of this this is something we call conversational commerce so the goal here is how easy can you make it to get things done by talking to things right so let me give you a few examples send Adam 20 bucks for the drinks last night hey our friends from venmo come up it knows who Adam it is it knows what it's about we're gonna go ahead and send that that's it it's done Adams got his money one sentence and it's done let me continue send my mom some flowers for her birthday our friends from ProFlowers come up with some beautiful arrangements here but well she is a tulip lover let's try that what about tulips great so some beautiful arrangements here I'm gonna go ahead and do that knows where my mother lives seamlessly puts all that together and we'll go ahead and buy that and that's it the flowers are on the way right let's keep going get me a nice room in Palm Springs for Labor Day weekend our friends at hotels.com come up with some cool options okay I've stayed at the Andreas Hotel before it's pretty nice so I'm going to go ahead and get that I think a deluxe room must be good and let's book that all right let's do one more I need a ride for six people from my office to Madison Square Garden all right so our friends from uber gonna help us out here of course they know that viv knows that a car that takes six people requires an SUV or an excel we're going to request the ride all right now they're looking all right well I'm sorry Robert I'm gonna have to cancel this ride today but hopefully we get a chance in the future what I just showed you is just a small slice of where we see the world headed you can imagine when you've got hundreds and thousands of developers plugging in new services and you're able to make the efficiencies of using conversational commerce like this so this is just the beginning so let's go in and look just quickly at the inside of lives brain what I'm showing you now it's a little bit of a walkthrough of the actual capabilities on the inside of bib today so this is these are the actual models that the developers are building into I'll call this the universe of capabilities that are in there today and this is just with a few people at the our office building these so we can take a little walk through here we can say like we can go look at what the weather person built so it gives you a sense for how to model something in here what the models are consists of let's take a look at another area I haven't didn't really talk about much about this today but I'm certainly going to partake in this tonight so you get a sense for what's in this brain that we call and this is going to be you can sort of get a sense of this universe and this is what the developers will be adding to over time and you can imagine that with thousands of people entering the power that this is going to gain
