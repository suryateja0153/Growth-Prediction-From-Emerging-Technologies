 hey guys welcome back and this is video two ministries of five for the virtual freedom book thanks for tuning again so in the last video we talked about the different types of outsourcing that's available to entrepreneurs as well as obviously the importance of that three list of freedom exercise that I just get everybody I meet to do they can usually hear a few pennies dropping every now and then when that exercise is actually being done in this video we're going to be talking about the different ways or the different places you can find your VA's for your tasks your projects and for your team as well so the first little resource I want to throw at you here are these job posting sites so literally all over the Internet you know the ones I'm talking about elance odesk freelancer these are all very very big websites where basically freelancers and virtual workers from all around the world can bid on picking up your work your tasks and your projects and these job posting sites are basically put up and they're in the realm of helping people on tasks and projects they're not exactly ideal for finding full-time employees but they are fantastic when it comes to finding people for those tasks that you need done and for those projects that you need completed and worked on as well I personally work from people in places like obviously here in the Philippines I've worked with people in India I've worked with people in Eastern Europe Russia the US Canada UK Australia South Africa I just recently had a website designed by a team of people this was about a two month long project based out of Switzerland and that included designers and developers so there are real hot better talent and that's a beautiful thing about utilizing virtual staff is you'll not trapped one geographical location right you can utilize the talent that spread out all around the world so when it comes to tasks I'm going to come to the projects those are the types of job posting sites that you need to get involved with and the way it works is very very simple you basically create your job description or your your task or your project description you post that to the website you then go ahead and start except accepting bids on the job as simple as that you might interview a few people you might ask a few additional questions you can look through their experience their reviews their ratings from other outsources just like yourself and then based on all of those things you go ahead and make a decision as to who to hire to take care of those tasks and projects okay so that's the first thing all right the second way to be able to find va's and this is Maureen towards the team building aspect of outsourcing and really hiring for those roles rather than the tasks are VA recruiting services now these differ a little bit to outsourcing based companies and when I say that honor just sort of caddy yet here and take it back a little bit one of the biggest mistakes that a lot of entrepreneurs make is hiring a company that have virtual assistants working for them within their facility and you think it's great and everything that you know they're in an office there working that being managed and all these things but here's the truth of the matter they may work for you but they never actually work for you if that makes sense meaning they can handle tasks for you on a day-to-day basis but you're not their employer you're paying their employer for the services and they're obviously marking up those services as well to make their profit right the problem with this is if that virtual assistant six months down the line after you've been working with them and they've got used to you and you've got used to them and everything if that person disappears or leaves or quit some moves on or gets promoted to another area internally you've lost that VA that's it they're done you have to start from all over scratch again with somebody new that might replace them so I don't like those kind of VA based outsourcing services when it comes to building a team if you want someone to be on your team you need to be the one that is training them you need to be the one that's managing them you need to be the one that's motivating them and you need to be the one that's paying them plain simple so VA recruiting services my company virtual staff finder is the perfect way to be able to find people that are virtual they are based out of home nine times out of ten and you can go ahead and hire people to work for you directly now i can't speak for all the VA recruiting companies out there and there are several we're not the only ones out there doing it but what i can do is tell you very quickly how virtual staff finder works so that if you do want to go down this Avenue you have a rough idea as to how it might work whether you end up working with our company or not so the way the virtual staff finder works is you go ahead and sign up for the service at virtual staff finder com we get the order you don't get an automated email you get an email from a real person welcoming you to the company and along with that email would be a blank job description document and then what you do is you go ahead and fill out that document with all the particular such as the hours you want your v8 of work that types of tasks you want them to do how much you're willing to pay and lots of other stuff once that's completed to send it back to us it goes into our sourcing department they start then going through all the VA's that we have on our books we interview a bunch of people we do a bunch of reference checks we do IQ and personality tests as well and then we go ahead and send you the three top candidates from that pool for you to actually interview yourself via Skype and you pick the one you like the most and get to work that's it so there's the ways that there's a different ways you can find all of the different types of VA's that you want just to recap tasks and project-based all the job posting sites elance odesk freelance if those are just three there's tons of them out there so that's the best way to do that if you look in the build an actual team member you can work with somebody that you've may be found on those sites and offer them a full time job if you work with them a few times but ultimately VA recruiting services are the way to go for that particular avenue as well all right so look that wraps up the second video in the next video we're going to be talking about hiring and we're going to be going through all the different things that you have to remember when hiring people so that you really edge your bets and trying to hit the ground running so I'll see you in the next video UK
