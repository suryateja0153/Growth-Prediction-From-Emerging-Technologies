 if you've ever used Siri or any other voice assistant you know that the usefulness of them is pretty limited so the original creators of Siri want to fix that viv is a virtual assistant with the kind of artificial intelligence a lot of the current voice assistants are missing for instance if you wanted to order a pizza viv could handle all of the ordering for you and it can get into the details like toppings and pizza size all without ever going to another app or calling Domino's and unlike many of the current assistants you can ask the questions in a variety of ways that means you can talk to it more like a human and less like a robot viv is taking a cue from Amazon Alexa and already works with a lot of third-party services like uber GrubHub and seek guru the only question is when will actually be able to try it right now you can't download it or buy it and moves creators haven't yet decided if they'll run it themselves or sell it to another company in the meantime if you want to get a pizza you're going to have to pick up the phone
