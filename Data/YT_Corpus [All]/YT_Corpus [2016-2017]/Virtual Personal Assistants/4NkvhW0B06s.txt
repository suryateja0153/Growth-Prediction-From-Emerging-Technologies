 first thing you do is you go and download what's called Android assistant I've been using this this certain program for years now ever since damn I can't remember I think when I get out the Navy 2011 I've been using it on Android so it's been a long long long time I've been using it always helpful always great and it doesn't you know throw a whole bunch of ads in your phone and doesn't run your phone to to death there's a lot of programs out there guys that you can use but I recommend this one fully it's called Android assistant and no they're not paying me to say this I've just been using it today and thing forever if they do want to sponsor me hey whatever that's another story so Android assistant here we go here's what it is and you can actually monitor your CPU info RAM info how much you're using your battery I'm not gonna say these are gonna probably be you know accurate to the dot but it gives you a pretty good rough estimate and it'll show you your internal storage info right here SD card if you have one as well so at any time you can always take a quick boost and that's gonna kill some of the things that you have going on so I don't know if it just killed my so anyways so that's that quick boost part go back into it and then what you can do is you can go to system clear and then in your system clear this will clear your cache and other unwanted files so we'll go in here and you see how the cache a is building up this is just from daily stuff doing whatever so you would go to full scan if you really want to get everything in there now you just wait for it to populate there that all the stuff and then you hit clear selected and boom there's one hundred and forty three megabytes that just cleared off now and some other stuff so that will clear most of your stuff right there and then if you'd like to go further with that you go system clear again you can go settings and then you can actually go to auto start and then you can actually have this thing helping you out whenever you need it look Auto boost so I'll just hit auto boost so automatically this old do just so actually automatic clear stuff as it builds up and like I said this is the only app I really trust when it comes to these things they have a lot of things called EU booster battery juicer battery saver and also the crap I wouldn't use it honestly because I don't know what the what is doing to the phones and I've always used this one so then now we have processes and a bunch of tools that you can use on your phone which is pretty cool brightness sleep volume settings so all your settings that you can you know on there and then you can also batch uninstall so if you have a lot of programs that you want to uninstall all at once and you don't want to go into settings and uninstall each and every one of them you can just hit batch uninstall or batch install if you have a bunch of programs that you have apks for and you want to install them break real fast you can do that as well backup and restore after sdcard so if you have some apps that you want to put on the SD card to save some space on your internal storage that's good as well startup managers so if you want to stop things from starting up every time they kill your battery or that make your phone slow there you go battery usage will tell you we how much you're using what percentage and all this other stuff so that's pretty cool file manager so you can actually go through your files and figure out what you don't need cats clear we just did that system clear we just did that system info it's also pretty cool because it tells you exactly what model version resolution this is basically all the things that come with your phone or all the specs that your phone has so pretty cool so you know exactly what you stand in as far as your phone goes and then permissions to see what permissions apps have which can be a pretty scary thing and yeah so I hope you guys have found this very helpful you know I always do tutorials like this every once in awhile to help out subscribers and viewers so if you'd liked it if you like this video please like comment share please share my videos and subscribe and you guys have a great one thanks for watching everyone
