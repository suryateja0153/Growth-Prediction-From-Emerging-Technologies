 a new competitor to Apple's Siri voice controlled personal assistant launches Monday it's called viv and it's actually been developed by the creators of Siri joining us now to talk about this new voice controlled assistant is Michael Lear month he's the editor of tech media and culture at the International Business Times Michael thanks for joining us I guess first off what would set viv apart from Syria and other voice controlled digital assistants do we need another one yeah well this was sort of the original vision of Siri because these are the guys behind it you know they sold their original company Siri to Apple in 2010 and almost immediately realize that Apple was going to turn it into a basically an extension of Apple's walled garden you know to connect to Apple's apps and services or just to send you to Google so their vision is to do you know do a voice assistant that kind of is is open and kind of brings brings all services and doesn't depend on an ecosystem so do you think that there's enough there then to convince Siri users to make a switch those that maybe you know don't really care if it's if it's open on the backend and just simply want to use it I think that's a huge hurdle for this you know it's it's it kind of feels like a company that was built to be bought just like Siri was it's it's a little bit hard to imagine you know launching a new consumer product broadly especially when you've got you know Alexa out there Siri you've got Google now Facebook bots you know there's a lot of things trying to chat chat to you in the home right now and you know you know not having devices and not being built into anything is a huge hurdle hmm so that's one of the hurdles but are there other big challenges I mean after all these voice controlled systems aren't widely used by consumers just yet except for my mother she talks cereal you know I think we may be slightly overestimating how much people want to talk to things you know I mean smart phones really aren't aren't used much for comment for calls so much as data and and messaging you know I think you know that the Turing test is is that could I talk to this robot as if it were a person you know is that really something we should be holding our devices to you know sometimes a conversation is a less efficient way to get information or to get things done huh very interesting I never really thought about having a conversation with my devices but now that you put it that way it seems to make sense thank you so much Michael for joining us I appreciate you being your thoughts and thank you all for watching I'm Courtney Reagan have a great day hey CNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel here you're going to find videos packed with all of the information that you need to be smarter about your finances you can subscribe by clicking right here and click on all the videos around me or the I right here to watch the latest from CNBC thanks for watching
