 most people are yes we're gonna begin the webinar right now so we are very excited to have earnest cents on the line aka Ernie Attorney he is going to tell everyone about creating a practice so efficient that it virtually runs by itself so Ernie first up I want to thank you so much for being with us today oh you're welcome thanks for having me of course and to start things off I'll just give everyone a little bit about us basically my name is Dave economist CEO year practice Panther on the phone we have Ernie the attorney Ernie spent 20 years actually doing commercial litigation in a big New Orleans firm along the way he learned the keys to paperless lawyering which in turn inspired him to start a ninja efficient solo practice and now as the founder of small from bootcamp calm he shows other lawyers how to put their practices on autopilot just like he did as well Ernie is also a recognized speaker nationally and an author and he also runs a website called paperless acecomm so first off by telling us a little bit more about herself um well I practiced law for many years as you said I did it in a large firm I'll talk a little bit about that when I get to how I you know transition and how technology technology played a role in that these are some of the books that I've written over the years and you know I'll tell people who are interested in books how they can get them if they are interested in them but what I really want to talk about today is something that I think can help everybody who's on this webinar who listens to it later as a recording especially those lawyers have been small firms because that's really where the rubber meets the road as far as you know technology goes and so this talk I call a law firm autopilot because I do think that there's a lot of automation that lawyers can take advantage of that's already sitting there inside their computers and that's what we're gonna talk about today so as I said you know this some fly star lawyers but it's gonna be particularly beneficial and relevant to lawyers and small firms because those are the folks that you have the most control over how they want to practice law they don't have to have a committee meeting to decide what they want to do they can just kind of do it so being in a small firm has a lot of advantages I know because I was in a big firm and that I was in a small firm so the thing about small firms is you know it's wonderful because you have autonomy and control but it's also challenging because you don't necessarily have all the resources that big firms have and well you can take advantage of technology technology is also from any small firms one of the main sources of the challenge right and so we're going to talk about that and you know I think one thing that happens with some lawyers is they think that because technology is challenging and frustrating it's their fault that they can't you know solve this problem and it is not their fault because you know whoever taught you how to use this technology kind of appeared on the horizon quickly they don't teach you in law school they don't teach you how to practice law in law school so they're definitely not going to teach you how to use technology but even CLE programs can't really fill that huge gap because technology appeared so quickly it's it's changing so quickly and so it is a challenge but we're gonna help lawyers on this webinar today tackle that challenge and basically what you're saying is you know the typical solo practitioner small firm doesn't have the resources of a big firm you're pretty much doing everything yourself and solo so you need to be competitive by automating as much as possible to get more done faster using tools you already have today correct yeah exactly exactly and you know and they shouldn't feel intimidated you know I had the same problem so I guess you know this is where I tell my story because I think it helps illustrate how I didn't have some magic bullet you know I was not a technologist I was a philosophy major and you know I had to learn the stuff like everybody else did and it was kind of accidental for me and basically what happened was you know when I went to law school I thought I wanted to be like Perry Mason or Matlock and you know be the solo scrappy lawyer guy and you know be simple and efficient but I was coming out of Law School in 1985 and I did really well in law school which was nice and so because the the legal economics were wonderful back then there were all these firms were growing and everything was wonderful you know if you did well in law school firms were beating the door down to hire you and pay you a lot of money and so that was great you know I go to law school and they're always big firms were prestigious and so forth and but they weren't you know that wasn't I didn't want to practice in a big firm but I did want to do the kind of work that big firms did and so the temptation of money was one thing the temptation of you know working for a prestigious firm was nice but the real icing on the cake for me as far as the decision was I really didn't know how to start a firm you know that that law school and so I said well I'm gonna go work in a big firm you know they'll get good money a high prestige and it was great you know like I had a nice office you know with the tasks and fancy stuff this is not my actual office and I guess you know and then firm was in a tall building and they had all kinds of smart people paralegals and secretaries that knew exactly what to do and they were at my disposal and the cases that I worked on really exciting so life was really great and then until it wasn't when I became miserable because after a while I realized that you had to practice law I knew how to manage my cases but I I was trapped in this world because basically I had cases that were paper intensive and when you have paper intensive cases you need you know boxes to put them in file cabinets to store them in an office space to manage the file cabinets and people to shuffle the paper around and that meant I wasn't gonna be able to leave a small I mean a large firm and start a small firm I was gonna leave a large firm and start slightly smaller but still complicated and convoluted and I didn't want that except that one day a friend of mine you know who's in the copy service business showed me how to scan documents and he said look I'm gonna do this for you for free on the page I'm asking him because I want you to see how this is gonna improve your life and I said fine without um this was in 2000 2000 2001 I think yeah and so I had this case it was going to come up for trial in 30 days because it was a fast-tracked ero case and I said you know you gotta copy all these documents we need the stuff copy said okay fine I'll copy the documents but I'm also gonna scan them like I told you and I'm gonna do it for free so you can see how this works yeah and then he showed me how it worked I said oh this is cool I can just sit at my computer hit next page next page next page and quickly review these documents which I needed to review myself because there wasn't time to offload that to a paralegal and I was able to do it really fast really efficiently and then the the the mind-blowing thing that happened next was when I said well there's this one document that we need to find really quickly and we know somebody wrote this so I don't have time to go next page next page I'm just gonna boxes out and see if I can find it that way and he said no no no says let me show you what this thing yeah he was telling me about OCR and I wasn't paying attention and he said let me just show you what this does I said okay and he typed in the keywords with the guy's name and instantly there appeared not only the document I was looking for but two other ones that were equally relevant and then my mind was blown and I said okay I see what I need to do here I need to make every case from now on paperless and ocr'd so I can search for things and do it more efficiently and so that was when I began my quest to do this and I did it over a long period of time and I had to figure it out all on my own or mostly on my own there were other lawyers that were doing it but not many and so yeah so my message is the lawyers it's you know you don't need to figure it all out other people have figured this out you just need to slipstream to use a race car analogy behind the people that have already figured it out and they've connected the dots and just you know look at what the dots were that they connected and let leverage what they did and that's what I've been doing ever since and that's what I recommend other people do because it's efficient and it's less stressful yeah copy their four sectors to explain with OCR is a lot of people work and now you and I are gonna throw like a lot of turns that we expect you would have no probably so OCR stands for optical character recognition what that basically means is that once you scan a document in from a scanner to your computer it automatically recognizes the text on the paper and it converts it to text on your computer so it's searchable so you can do you know control that or find on a Mac and you can search for any keyword or any name or anywhere you're looking for in the whole document and it will find it right away that's what already was talking about and searching for anything else thousands of pages and pretty much one-click energy it's amazing it this was you were doing a sixteen years ago and I'm talking today a lot of eternity donors they're awful you know if there a reason that you've seen why um no I just think that I think lawyers are busy and when they have free time they don't necessarily want to use that free time to you know getting frustrated with technology but if somebody can show them really quickly how they can benefit they they're interested now and and all right so it's really it's really just that and so the notice yard thing is one part of it and paperless as we'll talk about because we're going to talk about what the progress you know the progression is but the big thing about being paperless besides being able to find information really quickly which is you know huge benefit is the idea that you can automate processes once they're digital it's very inexpensive and I have a graphic here using gears because it's very hard to represent what happens inside of a computer with automation because it's all electronic but you know the the mechanical metaphor it works for people who need to understand a little if you do one thing one gear spins it spins another gear well in the digital world you can set up things to happen automatically very quickly at almost lightning speed and it's cheap it's fast and it's a little challenging to figure out how to automate things but it's not so much because of the computers but rather because it's so powerful that you know you really have to wrap your head around what you can do and what the best practices are and things like that and you don't need to really do it you can hire people to do it for you but you do need to understand that you would rather be automating things than doing them by hand or having people that work for you to do them by hand because humans make mistakes because they get bored or they get distracted whereas computers do the same thing over and over really fast and they never make a mistake software doesn't futz so automation is the key and you know you don't need to get frustrated it's possible to do it keys are you know tapping into things like online the web and so that's what I did you know I leveraged the web I started a blog let's call Ernie the attorney that got a lot of attention and it was at that point when I realized that I could attract clients automatically through the web at you know for low cost basically $40 for the website I use back then I knew that I could go out on my own because I could automate things I could dispense with the need for filing cabinets I could practice out of my house if I wanted to and have the same kind of work work for the same kind of clients and that's when I started my own firm and you know along the way I was motivated to keep things simple because I didn't want complexity in my life if I could avoid it and that meant getting rid of paper which of course when I went up against big firms they were very patronizing and dismissive they had not the paper that they managed in their cases but meanwhile I'd go to court with my little laptop and I could find things really quickly and so you know I not only would beat them in court but I would humiliate them because they were constantly rummaging around and their clients or the judge was looking at them like why are you so inefficient and disorganized when you have all these people and here's this little guy with a laptop who's just quietly sitting there like you know the doc where you don't see anything paddling underneath but you know on top of the surface it looks cool so you know the more I did it the more I realize how powerful it was and you know basically the process you know to turn it back to not what I'm doing or what I did but rather how did the folks on this webinar do it in the process if you want to break it down in three steps it's you know one you digitize everything that is in paper form and keep things that are in digital form in digital form and then you automate as much as possible and figure out how to streamline your workflows and when you've figured out what you can automate then some things you have to delegate but you can outsource those to virtual assistants whether they're people that work within your firm remotely or people that you hire one off on a part-time basis because they have special skills that you need either for a limited time or just on a limited time on an ongoing basis um that's the formula you know that's how that's what the modern law firm looks like digitized automate outsource and you know I break it down and attack principles ten of them that I think are the ones you can use to wrap your head around how you do all of this and if you want I can just go through those principles now yeah using automation is obviously we're going to show us now do you think that nowadays a lot of these bigger firms are doing the things you're talking about of this PowerPoint or still no um I think it's hard for me to wrap my head around that I you know I always bet against humans rapidly adopting new efficient ways of doing things especially if they're in larger groups of humans where they have to have committees and subcommittees and you know so that's a cynical statement from somebody who worked in a large law firm where the people have the best of intentions but you know committees work against contentions and barriers things being adopted efficiently which is why I said if you're in a small firm you can about this stuff quickly your challenge is you need you need to do it in a way that isn't disruptive but if you follow the right path and get the right assistance to help you connect the dots then you can do it wave more efficiently than large firms got it and large firms actually outsource anything you think they would do that uh well yeah they do outsource things I mean they outsource their bookkeeping sometimes but I think you know they're more reticent about outsourcing people because you know the people part of the equation is here they need to make money but I want to turn this into a yeah yeah so let's talk about the ten principles so one technology is obviously really important in today's world if you're becoming a model where and you know we don't have robot lawyers yet exactly but they're coming in in one sense and that is in the software sense there are already algorithms you know which we can call robot lawyers that do things super efficiently using artificial intelligence and here you see large firm Baker hot Hostetler is using this robot lawyer to help with bankruptcy cases this was an article in May of 2016 so you know we used to laugh at this kind of stuff but now it's actually starting to happen and we read about the chat BOTS earlier that the guy I think in London created young kid who was like 19 years old yeah to use artificial intelligence to help process parking fines so you know this we used to laugh at this stuff and say yeah sure that'll happen one day but now it's happening you know the big the big moneymaker for most lawyers and small firms is how do you get new clients and you need to pay attention to the fact that clients are increasingly looking for lawyers via the internet or if they're not starting their search on the Internet they're still doing research to confirm what they already know or to vet the lawyers that they have winnow down their search to so the Internet's way more important so in 2014 this was the breakdown in 2016 according to Google which tracks this kind of stuff sixty-three percent of people looking for legal services use a Google search and 37% do something else so you know you're you need to be online I guess is you know part of the equation so that means you know being in a small firm means you have to you have dangerous but you have opportunity and you need to figure out how to leverage the opportunities and when you're trying to leverage technology which is can be challenging you need to accept the fact that everybody in law now needs to learn how to leverage technology I mean your own computers you're using email your clients are on the web you know you just can't ignore technology and say no I'm just going to type all my stuff with typewriters and and carbon paper and go back it's not enough yeah so the key to all this to me is and this I can't repeat this enough times the key to all this is you have to be aware that when you're dealing with technology there are always trade-offs now you know when you're dealing with life there are always trade-offs so trade-offs are everywhere if you do one thing you can't do something else so if you do this you know you can do something else you know the one thing does it better in one way and the other does it better in another way so you have to assess trade-offs and I like to start this conversation with people outside of you know complicated technology and give you a simple analogy that I think people can relate to it's not hard to understand which is like let's say you know you worry about your bike getting stolen you buy a new bike and you say to your friend who's super knowledgeable about bikes because you know he races and he's you know competed in the Tour de France or something like that and you say I got this new bike you know I'm worried about it being stolen because oh great yeah I got a lot of advice for you so what I'm about to say relates to this idea that when you're trying to figure out how to assess the trade-offs you don't know how these trade-offs work because you're not super versed in technology and you say well I'm just gonna rely on my friend who's super versed in technology and my recommendation would be you not rely on your friends who just because they're super versed in technology but rather you find trustworthy guides who are usually tech consultants of some sort and preferably one who is working with lots of lawyers like you because they're going to understand the tre not just in a hyper technical way but they're gonna understand them with the empathetic viewpoint of somebody in your position because they work with people in your position all time so here's what happens if you rely on your super smart friend with the bike theft thing he's gonna say oh yeah here what's the best bike lock he's gonna say get the you lock cuz that's the one he uses that it's super hard breakthrough and he's not gonna like the cable lock and the other ones cuz he doesn't use that but you let's say maybe use you know you want to lock up two bikes because you and your significant other or you know kids or something want to ride your bikes together and you know the u-lock isn't gonna lock two bikes at one time the cable lock is a necessity but he doesn't think that way cuz he thinks the way he thinks so you need to think about the trade-offs as best you can from your position but then when you find people to help guide you you need to understand do they have a bias to have a blind spot and I'm I'm just telling you your tech savvy friend and I used to be that tech savvy friend who gave bad advice because I just thought oh well is what I use this is what you should use and that's not what you want you want somebody who thinks about your position and can help you and be empathetic to your position so that's really important being systematic when you deal with technology is important because if you're going to automate you know automation isn't by necessity systematic but if you go oh yeah I'm just gonna grab that tool and automate it it's gonna look ugly because if you're not systematic about it you're just automating chaos so before you even get into it you need to have mindset of a system building you know mindset so it's like if I do this then I'm gonna need to do this and if I do that then I'm gonna need to do this and lawyers are very systematic we just don't stop to think about let's write it all out what we do but we are inherently systematic you sort of have that ego we're not good at is being disciplined about writing the steps down we you know like when I went to work at the big firm they would say hey go find a case we go do this and say well you know can you give me some background on what kind of cases I'm likely to find they tell you because they were busy lawyers so you had to figure it out but it's not a good idea to take people that are new well people that are not sufficiently trained and just tell them to figure it out that's not systematic you want to say right okay let me think through how did it work for me and then try to describe the steps and so if you want to learn about how to create systems you know there's lots of books out there this is one that has a lot of great reviews on Amazon if it's not specific to lawyers but it's it's helpful and what I would do if I got it and I have gotten it and I can tell you how to make it even easier skip over the first part of the book where he tells you about his struggles in life because every self-help book always has to describe for you how the person had the problem and then how they solved it you know to make it relevant and lots of other reasons but you know his his story is not as interesting to lawyers skip over that just read about how he develops the systems but if you want to read a lawyer specific one I would get John Fisher's book you can see here that if you get the hardcover on Amazon it's two hundred and ninety four dollars in reality if you were to email him he would send it to you for free the hardcover because he's using a generation thing but this Kindle app you can get that one right away for 19 bucks but this is a personal in January describing assist the recent hundred dollar book yeah it's not he's you know that's he's creating it's the Trump effect you know my brand is expensive and it's clever and that's smart but he will send it to you for free it's a really nice guy and a lot of lawyers who have talked to you that said well that's great for personal injury lawyers look let me tell you something it's 80% of it is relevant to lawyers in any kind of practice any kind of practice whatsoever and what's interesting about the book that that I think lawyers should look at is the book fulfills several functions one it's the marketing thing but but mostly for him it is actually the system that he so he when he hired as a virtual assistant and he only has one full time person that worked for him otherwise he outsources everything or hires virtual lawyers he gives them this book and says here here's my system beat it and don't ask me any questions because of everything you need to know is in this book so it's a really smart book and I think it's really worthwhile for every lawyer to look at and see this is a guy who built these systems over many years put it in a book anybody can get it and study it and look you basically see a blueprint of how he did it in his practice and I think even if you were actually selling it for two hundred ninety four dollars I would think it would be worth that so right yeah so that's that system is systematization now it's like you're talking about like a processes procedures that my staff on how to build your own successful law practice well systems for anything you know systems for like you know how do you go deposit checks I mean really systematic lawyers have systems for everything and they've written it down because they are envisioning that they might might have to you know hire a new person for that role that they used to have in that role because that person laughter got fired got hit by a truck or whatever and it's sort of them having to take time to train the person every time or tell them go figure it out in which case is gonna be a lot of chaos write down the process and say here go look at it and when I went to clerk for a federal judge for two years out of law school he was very systematic he had a book which he called the Bible that book had an explanation of how to do everything like how often to water the plants for generator it sounds like really OCD but he no he didn't come out and say hey welcome to the section age let me tell you how you do your job is like you'd see this stack of paper over here because it wasn't an actual book it was like printout so read this and if something's not in there that should be in there figure out how to do it and get the word processing file and update it so you know that's what you want to do you want to describe it and then tell whoever is doing it to update the system so that the next person who comes along can do it so that's what I mean right by being systematic so basically always improving is when you when your firm invention does grow you hire more people you don't need it single steps each person just here read the Word document you'll learn how to do everything basically yep exactly yeah and then when you're systematic you're ready to start automating because you know to be to take advantage of automation you have to go about it in a systematic way and so to leverage it you know you want to think about the different things you do and so there's a really great podcast on Liris it's the one in its episode 47 with baron henley and i recommend you listen to that one because one of the things that lawyers do a lot is create documents memos briefs letters to the client bills whatever lots of different kinds of documents within a small firm big firm lawyers create documents and so what Baron talked about in this what this webinar or sorry this podcast was how do you go about automating the creation of documents and step one if you want to be systematic is you sit down and think about well which ones are we gonna automate first and so he's got this matrix he describes which I have you know created a graphic to illustrate which he said you know on one hand you want to look at how often you create documents in different kinds and then how hard it is to create those documents and any document that's in the upper right of this matrix namely hard to create and you create it off and that's where you want to start automating and then you know he moved to well you know you don't create that often but it's hard or you create it often and it's hard I'm sorry sorry it's like you created often but it's not that hard either one of those would be the next stage and then you know if it's easy and you rarely create it like emails or like one-off letters you know you can't really automate those he said but I would say you kind of can't automate those in the sense that you don't want to be typing them so I would recommend that folks look at dragon software which is dictation software on the windows side it's super inexpensive think it's like $59 you go to Amazon and check it out and on the Mac side it's $199 but if you get it when it first comes out or when they first upgraded its $99 I think dragon for Mac is now it might still be in the $99 phase because they just upgraded it to 6 so you might be able to buy for a limited time for 99 bucks but which whichever one it is is the process is the same basically you get the software you install it there's not not really any training much anymore and you're up and running right away and the trade off the challenge is that you have to learn how to command this tool by giving voice commands as opposed to typing you can type some stuff if you want to but the idea is you just sit down you blast out text and you do it really quickly and so I recommend that what lawyers do is get a copy of this especially in windows and windows it's like mind-blowing ly amazing but they're both really good and then to get up to speed quickly I would confine yourself to one kind of document and train yourself with that and the kind of document that most lawyers have that are annoying is emails you have a lot of emails I'm sure and of course you try to knock them out on your smart phone but if you're sitting in your office you have emails where need to give a thoughtful response and not appear hurried you know yes you can type but there's a cognitive load too typing even if you can type super fast which disappears when you can just black you know blurt out the words you want to say and you might go back and edit them you know quickly but the ability to get through email that requires some you know discussion is my it's is amazing right so like I used to I hate typing I hate type emails because I know what I need to say just to say this thing and get it out of there well now with with Dragon I just you know I just blurt it out and hit Send I might edit edit it a little bit but it it doesn't kind of feel no frustration of having to type I just say what I need to say but the cool thing about doing it only with email at first when you're learning it is you're gonna learn it in a very confined environment it's gonna make it easy for you to learn the common commands things like all that or capitalized this word or whatever so you know getting up to speed with it is easier if you just confine yourself to do an email once you got email down you'll know how to use it for everything so for everything not just for documents you can use it for email or in the computer at all yeah absolutely anywhere you need to type you know text it can type text for you and how much editing are you doing a lot of times I use serial emails as well on the go I noticed that I have a lot of mistakes a lot of edits to do is it the same exterior it's better than Apple version um I don't really do that much editing I don't have to and I will be honest like there are certain times when for certain types of writing I prefer to type you know like you know if I'm writing a blog post you know I'm not good I'm not trying to crank it out really quickly I'm trying to think of the best way I say something and in those instances I type and because speed is not helpful to me it's more the thoughtfulness that goes into it and sometimes for a brief you know are certain passages in a brief that might be what you want to do too but once you have this ability it's like you know Superman could fly but he didn't fly everywhere sometimes he walked so you know sometimes you're going to use your basic you know non Superman power to do what you need to do because that's just you know what's called for it's not like you're gonna always use this but once you know how to use it you're gonna always know how to use it when it's called for so that's the takeaway here all right so the next step is you know you want to be paperless because as I mentioned earlier you can automate things more easily when it's digital there's a lot to be said about how to become paperless I have a whole website devoted to this really what I would tell you to do is go to paperless chase com click on the link that says you know get our five keys to creating a paperless law office and I will send you a one-page PDF download because I don't want to overwhelm you and I'll say here are five things you can do it'll get you started you know which scanner is the best one again you know so just five tips and then I'll follow it up with ten emails come one a day walk you through some other processes and that's how you learn to be paperless it's all free I walk you through it I have if you know if I were doing this as a separate talk it's a whole hour long talk and even then I still tell people go click on this link and do this because I know that you need to get this information in small bite-sized chunks so you don't get it so you need to become paperless you don't have to do it overnight there's a process and I explained it and then when you're paperless you know you will have your documents stored locally on your computer in your office but wouldn't it be cool if you could access those documents from anywhere anytime from any kind of device no matter where you are in the world and the answer is you can if you make those documents available by taking taking advantage of cloud storage so the time has passed for lawyers to go I don't understand the cloud it's horrible somebody could steal my data things could go wrong yes things can go wrong in the cloud because they can go wrong anywhere on planet earth people can steal your papers they can you know blow up hurricanes can come you know you just need to learn how to secure your date in the cloud and all of the stuff that words wonder about rather than me go through this in a tedious fashion because this again is a whole hour long talk if you go to papers chase calm and click on the link that says cloud storage for lawyers to be mystified there's a whole blog post about this including a youtube video put on by Google where they explain how they do security and after you watch it you'll understand that your data in Google's hands is way more secure than your data in your hands as long as you're not foolish and give away your password to a hacker and you know let them get into your data but you know this there's steps man I will talk about that later in the security section but your data and Google's hands you know they won't lose it accidentally let's put it that way they know how to do backup and they know how to you know secure things so security is you know important the thing about security is it's not a you know hacker are good at technology and they're good at automation but the real weak link with security is human psychology and humans do certain things in very predictable ways and so we're gonna talk about psychology that's a picture of Sigmund Freud one of the great Pantheon founders of technology I'm sorry of psychology and so here's here's how a basic hacker thing happens like hacker will send to a lawyer an email okay so it'll say something like I can't believe this picture of you and then it'll have text and says this is ridiculous and you should be ashamed so if you go click that link right away because it came into your inbox and you think oh my god this is a picture of me out there and you click on that link as soon as you've clicked on that link game over okay well why do we have access to Hillary Clinton's emails because her campaign manager did exactly this something came to him and said oh my god you clicked on it game over access to all of his information it installs a key logger program they're now monitoring every key you typed so every password you type in anywhere they're tracking it and they're gonna get everything you own everywhere if you click on this link and you say another way that they do it is I say oh the shared PDF file there's lots of different ploys that they use they could say something like my god I can't believe that Donald Trump would do this and if it comes out of that you're gonna go what did he do next you click on the link so you have to train yourself you know not to click on links that have surprising shocking information especially if there's a very little text if it doesn't you know if you're gonna send one of these things to your friends say hey you know Donald Trump did some if you really did something horrible say Donald Trump sued saying really horrible I read about it here type out more stuff because if your friends train not to click on the link they're not going to click on it so you say well oh but the email came from my friend you know why can't I trust an email for my friend and the answer is because your friend's computer got hacked and then the hacker goes into the contact list and sends emails to all the people in the contact list with this ploy and he's gonna get access to everybody this is how they do okay this is the number one way there are other ways but this is the number one way it's the rock solid you can always count on humans to click on links with provocative stuff don't do that and and the other thing is don't have a password that's super easy to guess because then they don't even have to go through this trouble they just go oh okay let's see let's try to guess what the person's password is and they're gonna start with the 25 most common passwords every year there's a list you know and these same things are always in there some things move up something move down but password is always up there at the top 1 2 3 4 5 6 is always up there at the top and they learn this because when a hack occurs and then whoever adobe or whoever got hacked has to say okay well here the passwords that they got they can see like what are people using and people are using really easy to guess passwords and so hackers have programs that run through these things plus some other things common words in the dictionary and they quickly guess password so that you can either can get into it you know like you clicking on a link or they don't even need that if you use a stupid passwords don't use a stupid password definitely don't use password they can use any of these other ones either so what you want to do is use the really strong password so strong password is one that has uppercase lowercase letters has symbols as numbers and those are impossible to guessed the NSA computer it would take it a hundred years to get this you know password or you can use a passphrase if you want to make your life easier which is you use words that you know with spaces between them because passwords can contain spaces and you can use uppercase lowercase if you need to and so these kind of pass phrases are also incredibly difficult to guess or to brute-force attack guess but they're easy for you to remember now the problem is you don't want to use that one password for all your accounts because what happens and this is not a hypothetical this is like it's going to happen one of your accounts gets hacked by hackers they break into the chase or Adobe's infamous for this LinkedIn had an attack and so if a hacker says ah we have this person's email address and we have this password let's go see if they use it across all of their important accounts and of course most people do and especially important not to do this with your email accounts because what happens when you can't again the chase because you can't remember they say well you know we'll set a password reset where they gonna send it to your email address so you protecting your email account this is Fort Knox you must protect your email account above all things so that means having different passwords for all these different accounts and then you say oh Ernie that's really great advice but that seems like a lot of work yes it would be if you did it all manually but we're gonna automate this and so use a password manager well several of them out there he is but LastPass is one that I usually recommend if you if you want to spend the least amount of money it's twelve bucks a year works across all your devices it does everything that all the other ones do you can store your credit cards in there your addresses you it'll generate passwords for you that are hard to guess and of course so how do you get into this you use it by logging in with a password and guess what you don't want to do with the one password you use to log into this right you don't want to be password or one two three four five six make it a passphrase because that's easy to remember and then you're logging into that one really easy and then the rest of them can be gobbledygook or whatever because you don't care you're never gonna try to remember them you don't have to remember so right there I you know I think this is the security you need to know and if you know this every time you see some account of some hacker did something odds are 80% of time it's gonna be an attack just like the one I described and it's going to involve psychology so don't click on links that come from people you know or don't know that have a short bit attacks that have some provocative thing that gets you excited and train your staff not to do to do that either right and you know we also use a lot of practical use last class as well it's amazing they helped me generate 25 character passwords an autosave and auto loans you end and auto remembers and it's amazing so for all of us we have multiple class works for every single different web so you go to which is very important and one day I don't know if we touched here is you're not going to touch on two-factor authentication are you you know I don't have that in there but I'll describe it briefly it's kind of you need a lot of I think it's best if I had slides to demonstrate it but here's conceptually how it works okay so let's consider the problem that it solves let's say that a hacker gets your password they actually get your real password and before you can go in and change it you know you do the best thing humanly possible but you still it's going to take you time they have your password and they got a log in your email account so what's gonna happen is they're gonna be logging in from Russia or China or wherever the hell they are which is going to be an IP address meaning a you know a special address that the system keeps track of it says oh well Ernie used to log in from this IP address that was the one at his house now we're seeing for the first time a login from a computer that was not that trusted address well here's what we're gonna do now we're gonna make Ernie or whoever is pretending to be Ernie tell us that it's really Ernie how are we going to do this well we we know Ernie has one thing probably with him at all times that's his cell phone and so when you enable two-factor authentication what you do is you say to Google let's say you're doing it in Google and you're saying Google I want to enable two-factor authentication Google's gonna say what's your cell phone number and it's gonna say and you put it in and it's going to send you a text message immediately with six characters and say enter these six characters now so that will know that you in fact are in possession of that cell phone you enter it it goes okay good you are in possession that cell phone that is your cell phone you probably will have you have it with you at all times and so from now on whenever a login is happening from a new IP address it's going to send a text message to that I to that cell phone it's here's your code and it's gonna sit there and it's not gonna let the person login until they enter that code number so even if a hacker had your password they can't login because they don't have your cell phone so two-factor authentication is super secure and you should enable it on every financial account every email account everything that matters to you because even if the hacker had your password they're not going to be able to get in unless they have that code Watford has the ability for this like Gmail page Bank of America even practice senator you can enable two-factor authentication but a lot of people don't even know about it or do it all they have to do is just pretty much Google how to do it I'll find it's a very simple step everywhere from what I see yeah and it is a little annoying I mean let's be I mean let's be clear you know security is annoying right but here's the again it's a trade off do you want a little annoyance on a regular basis or do you want your entire bank account siphon off you want the risk of that you know so my rule of thumb is if your security practices aren't mildly annoying on a regular basis you don't have good security practices that's how you know if you're not being annoyed on a regular basis then you're you're sitting duck yeah I agree so let's talk about marketing because this is important for two reasons one because it'll help you get better clients make more money with less effort because you can automate this and also because even though you know the accreditation authorities and so forth say well you know we shouldn't give CLE for marketing there's an ethics component to this which they will give you credit for and it's when you tell people how to avoid being unprofessional and undignified I'm about to tell you how to do both of those things at the same time so here's the deal you wanna you need to go out and meet people you're a small firm you know you can't house or sense to other people you have to meet people in actual real world space and network to get clients that's part of the job right that's how you market 'add and got new clients from day one from Abraham Lincoln's day networking and you know face to face is still important yeah I'm not saying you can automate everything and just stop meeting people in in space and just become a hermit inside your house that's not going to work but you can automate aspects of even that part of it so here's how it works you know you want a website because whether people are looking for you are looking for kind of lawyer that you fit the bill of and they wind up on your website or whether they saw you speak at an event read an article you wrote were mentioned your name was mentioned to them by somebody that they trust however it works we saw that graphic earlier over 60% of them and probably increasing every every year are gonna go check you out where are they gonna check you out online they're gonna type your name in type in your city type in whatever they need to type in to see if you have a website if you don't have a website they might find your habo page or other things so you should have a website so if they find that because you want to control your message for those kind of people so a website is a profit producer in essence because it lets you reach entire world lets you establish your expertise you can target the ideal clients you want you can get them interested in you prompting the email you do this all automatically while you're doing other things you know 24/7 and if you want to know how this works again it's like with the paperless thing there's a lot here to explain and I would rather do it over time and not overwhelm you so if you you know go to this link and I'll tell you how to get all this stuff you know afterwards but if you want to write down a link I mean you have to make the upper case proper so the D has to be uppercase and the W has to be uppercase if you go to that link I you'll sign up and I'll give you all this information dripped out in emails over time with links it's all free you learn how to do it but basically the system that you want to use is called direct marketing direct marketing is the kind of marketing that's tasteful it's not annoying it's not interruptive and it helps you find and then helps those people find you who are your ideal clients so you want to spend zero time screening out unsatisfactory clients you want only the best clients to say oh gee you're the lawyer for me and then contact you now it is true that in some practice areas this is easier to do than others but if that doesn't matter how hard it is you know to set it up once you set it up its automated and trust me no matter how hard it is it's worth it because this system will work 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year the best look to learn the principles for this I think is this book called the no BS guide to direct marketing and Kennedy and I know you and I David have talked about Dan Kennedy who's a guy is so you can chime in and tell folks what you think about Dan Kennedy yeah I mean I think maybe two months ago you introduced me to him and tell me to buy this book I did I read it it's incredible this book I love the most because a lot of attorneys get a lot of their business from this referral sort of mouth they're not doing any direct marketing they're not doing any promotional materials and he adds online a lot of times were we asked an attorney they're sending us core software or to get most your leads from how do you track them how do you track the retin use olive oil they don't they just must be word of mouth so the in Kennedy is pretty much telling everyone to go out there try something new but hold yourself accountable you're spending money on a magazine that or a Google ad you want to track the results you want to track the revenue you're generating from them so make sure you do all that I love Dan Kennedy I think he's amazing yeah and he's been doing he's been doing marketing since way before there was the internet he didn't even like the internet but he understands these principles and he's systematic about it and he understands what doesn't work and he doesn't pull any punches in attacking the types of advertising that don't work and he dismisses brand-building because that's just a waste of money you know and so he tells you the things at work and Tom's gonna really clear way he's a great writer he's funny he's sarcastic as hell so I recommend that and like I said if you want to go to the website pay pro stays calm actually I don't think I have this link up here anymore that says how to create a website for 500 or less but you know if you email me up I'll be happy to you know send you that campaign as well all right so you've automated as much as possible you're automating your marketing you know you get your practice going to where you know like you're like John Fisher you have maybe one full-time assistant or however many full-time assistants you need you want to leverage the power of being able to hire people who are super expert at a given skill people who can work for you part-time if you need to people who can work for you you know between hours of 6 o'clock at night and 6:00 in the morning if you need them to because they live in a part of the world where that's daylight for them you know the power of outsourcing is huge now it's not where you start it's where you get to once you understand how to be systematic when you understand how to be in the cloud you were secure you got all that stuff down but you can get started quickly even tomorrow with some things like like if you have a receptionist who answers the phone and does other things I would say free that person up to do other things because first off they're not going to be as good at just answering the phone as a service like Ruby receptionist is I can't say enough good things about Ruby receptionist you know they they solve so many problems they're there they are the under-promise over-deliver they make you look super good people will think that this receptionist works for you full-time it can be kind of expensive it's um it's $250 a month for a hundred minutes of their time it's not after the calls pass through how long you talk on the call after that it's just how many minutes the receptionist is engaged in but it's actually winds up being a lot less minutes that they are being used and you think because what most people do at least this out how much for most people most muscle areas what's the Kline is good you know they know you they will leave messages happily or you the cellphone number if you want to do that but it's really for the client who calls for the first time you know that's checked you out on the website you don't want that person to think you answer your phone at all times number one you don't want to be answering your phone number two if the phone's being answered you want it to be answered by somebody who sounds very pleasant and it's always pleasant and cheerful because they've trained to train to be cheerful and pleasant and they know what to do and they know if you're in a meeting you know all the stuff that Ruby does is super amazing you can try it for free for I think 14 or 21 days they have a sign-up fee if you click on this link or use this signup thing I have an affiliate arrangement with with them where they knock off $75 or do something I don't know what but use it or don't use it but they'll give you $75 off so I would get an affiliate link from somebody if you want to try it and save yourself a little money that's one kind of virtual system and just to add as well we see movie everywhere a lot of attorneys you speak to use Ruby I can't say enough good things about them as well it's like they're always present you always have a secretary you're always answering the phone people love it and it's a fraction of the cost like they say if actually hiring a full-time assisting in the actual office or secretary just to add we're doing the webinar with Ruby the next one the series on Friday November 11th and two weeks so like that great yep so Ruby's great and then another easy one to kind of dip your toes into the shallow end of the pool is a service called fiverr.com and there's a lot of stuff in here it's just goofy that you don't care about but you can get people to design a business card you can get people to put up a wordpress site and the idea here is everything cost five dollars for some kind of really basic thing that somebody would do but then if you want them the additional features or you know rapid service or something you can pay a little bit more but why this is good is because there's no risk that you're gonna miss communicate about what's supposed to be done so because one of the tricks with a virtual assistant is you have to get good at being very clear about what you went on what the Birbal is how much time they need to spend but this system kind of takes all that out because it's so low cost they're just gonna say this is what I'll do for five bucks and you they say yes I want it or no I don't and you click the button and you get it so it kind of starts to train you what it's like to get stuff done by other humans on planet earth that are Virtual Assistants but doing it in a way that's low cost low risk but can have some serious value if you find a dragon they call them gigs so flavors create and then fancy hand is a step up from that and here's where you pay $20 a month and they'll do five tasks for you per month and the first month you know if you connect it to the service doesn't tweet out on social media or they give you some different incentives they will give you an additional ten tasks for that that month and that's great because the first month you're gonna one wonder what you should do and you don't want to feel like oh I want to use up my five tasks except for something super important just use the tasks get used to it the kind of stuff I've used them for is I'm doing research for a blog post I asked them to do that or ask them to you know book or you know buy flowers for somebody or find the best place to eat in a city the zoo research stuff they're really great at they can charge we're gonna charge a credit card but they will charge the credit card they have on account for you to charge for your services up to like I think 125 dollars if you want them to buy flowers or buy stuff they will ask you to prove it before they purchase it they if you connect their service to your Google email account they can set up a calendar appointment so you can forward an email from somebody it says yeah let's get together in the state gets forwarded to them and they didn't have to tell them what to do they read it and see oh this is about a calendar appointment I'll just put their ad in the Ernie's calendar so you know if you think of it it's like basically five dollars per task but you're committed to paying $20 a month no sorry 25 dollars a month and you get five tasks for free very cool you can check it out you don't like it stop paying for it but you'll get a taste of what Virtual Assistants is like then once personal assistant basically $25 a month if I classify free and you can tell them if I'm correct just a clarified by my wife flowers and spin up to a hundred dollars and they'll buy it before you do everything for you yep oh and then the last stage and this is you know this is when you get to the highest level where you have to hire somebody and you have to negotiate independently and you have to find them and you have to work out how long they're gonna work for you it might be on a continuing ongoing basis or might be one big project or it might be several different of people there's a site called hop work which is an amalgamation of two sites one that used to be called Elance and one that used to be called oDesk and so this is kind of like this is it there's one place now there might be others but this is the eBay of hiring virtual assistants that I have hired two assistants through this place to set up my websites to help me with various technical problems anything that's you know work that can be done remotely like design work create a business car design your website whatever you need done if it can be done remotely by a human you could probably find somebody on upwork to do it now the challenge is you're gonna have to vet the person and figure out who the best person is and you know there's a challenge there and you have to describe for that person how to do the job and you can't just say go figure it out so there's a challenge to it but if you're good at describing how to do things to the people that work for you now then up work won't be such a challenge but if you're not good at that that I would recommend you know you go through those other phases first and get comfortable with assigning work to somebody remotely but the power here is is you know off the charts so that's that is all my two cents on up work you know basically have to just filter people based on expertise and reviews all the reviews some of whom were I've noticed in my community trust he speaks them a little bit and then if you're happy with what they can offer you gonna give you a baton to get another we've used up work in the past so it's very powerful I definitely agree as well yeah and then the last you know phase of all this is that you have to be keeping up with training because things are always changing in the tech world and you want to know how to connect the dots as quickly as possible and not have to fumble around and experiment on your own you want to get guidance from people who are doing it that you can trust so some of the ways you can do this are listening to podcasts I'm a huge fan of podcasts there's a lot of them out there but a couple that I recommend for lawyers are the lowest podcast Sam Glover is a great interviewer he gets it's really great for small firms and then the legal talk network there's like 16 different ones that you can pick around and see which one you're interested in there's one for security there's one for new tips is one for mobile devices whatever you want it's in there and the legal talk network great stuff there there's a new podcast I'll call the law entrepreneur with Neil Tyra he's a Mac user but it's not Mac centric but he's a very good interviewer and it's more about the practice management side everyday running of a law practice and he is running a law practice so he's really good at getting guests who talk about things in ways that are relatable to lawyers and small firms and then another new podcast is called building new law it's a Canadian legal podcast they actually got Seth Godin on there it's just getting going says not to me yes Seth Godin is great I so I would check that one out as well and then besides podcasts you can take online courses with you to me or lynda.com which got acquired by LinkedIn which then got acquired by Microsoft so online education is a huge thing I had an online course that I released to folks which I'm going to release again in the future that kind of covers all its stuff in more detail so you know online course is a really powerful way to learn all this stuff online but you know basically what you want to do is learn how to use you know your tool right keep the tools simple learn how to use them digitize automate outsource and I'm happy to help any of you all on this journey because I know what it was like to go from the world of tedious frustrating paper to the world of easy paperless automation so if you want more information about all this stuff if you text the word mod firm all caps no spaces to number three three four four four you could sign up really easily and quickly and I will send you a bunch more free information that follows up on what we covered today very much Wow forever elisany as well this webinar is recorded so we will you know everyone at the end very shortly now ready a lot of people don't know what you do full-time so if you can't it's part of one what about yourself how you help attorneys worldwide I know you have two companies paperless chase and small firm bootcamp right yeah but I mean really you know the explanation is I try to help lawyers connect the dots more quickly and I do as much as I can for free because I know you know you need to get this information and I automated it so it doesn't cost me anything to send most of it out and so if you you know if you text mod firm three three three three three four four four you'll start to see how automated the process of educating people about what I do and about you know what they can do and that's the process that Dan Kennedy recommends you use to nurture clients and prospective clients and so you'll basically be getting you know training or you'll see how that plays out and then I will describe for you how you could take advantage of it as well so that's it pretty simple pretty basic easy to do came by email is for Dragon dictating software do you recommend a specific microphone for the computer um you know there's not there's not one that's necessarily better than the others again it's trade us what features does it have that you would want there's a site called wire cutter comm which in the past week got acquired by the New York Times because it was so good at you know picking out the best thing in whatever category and so if you go to wire cutter comm and look for you best USB mic whatever that mic is you know read the features they have wonderful comprehensive reviews and then you know bookmark that because you can use it for other things but that would be how I would find the best USB mic because whatever that mic is it'll be best for dragon but it'll also be good if you ever want to use Skype and make phone calls or or do other things with the USB mic so that would be my recommendation got it yeah as well I know that we purchased uh it's called a blue snowball my very very good powerful mic I've been used for webinars and training videos and everything so that might be a good one as well my next question comes in from John what scanner do you recommend for going paperless oh this is easy one the fujitsu scansnap ix500 it costs four hundred and twenty dollars roughly on Amazon if you'd better the paperless chase.com website and look there's a thing it says best law firm or best scanner for small law firm and you click on that link there's a comprehensive explanation of why that's the best why the other ones that some people think might be equivalent is not in fact equivalent and rather than bore everybody just go to paperless acecomm find a sidebar click on that link read everything there and then if you want to buy it on Amazon you can click the link there and go buy it on Amazon and read the reviews on Amazon the reviews this trust me everyone who has the scanner will Bend you're here for like 15 minutes about how amazing it is that's the only scan yep does two sides at one time illegal color black and white mixed mouths a coleslaw awesome and then the next question comes in from Patrick Burnie could you comment on voice to text software other than dragon so I guess looking for another software than dragon um yeah look so now I'm not a Windows user so I don't know what cortana does you know but nowadays on the Mac side Siri is starting to take this over and so you can kind of start to predict them one day both Microsoft and Apple will basically embed and include for free in their operating system something that basically does everything that dragon does so they're starting to do that and you can try the latest operating system for the Mac Siri is enabled and I haven't played with it too much I will say it's not as good as dragon so I'm not gonna play with it too much more I mean it's good but you know I have something that's better already so I'm gonna keep using the thing that's better and you probably have the same experience with Cortana on the windows side versus dragon over there so if you have it and it's free you know start with that a lot of questions pouring in that dragon is funny so Thomas asked very similar question do you know a series for Mac and the new Sierra operating system will work like dragon that means for email so I guess you say that you're not really sure but as Apple involves they will be releasing probably more and more features for learning theory yeah and like some of the things that doesn't do so for me there's so there's a lot of commands that you're gonna learn you want to to use like you know a word will appear and I wanted that to be capitalized you can we dragon you say capitalized and you say the word they'll just jump over and capitalize that's not going to happen in Siri you can also say you know bold and describe the tax and it'll bold it or underlying it or whatever and so there's a lot of things that you're doing with dragon once you learn the commands where you couldn't move the mouse fast enough to make it you know to make those changes so it's not just typing speed like we were talking about earlier before we got on David where you said you know you're pretty fast typist it's like when you start to realize how you can manipulate text with dragon it's really powerful but you have to know the commands and they have to become second nature and that takes time but that's not going on in Syria or I'm sure Cortana so you know if you've been one of them I would recommend you know just pay the $69 or $60 in the window side or the 99 or even the $200 on the Mac because whatever it is it's worth it and then just commit to learning it and I told you how to learn it just do it with just email and then and then you know it comes with a little printout and actually I'll tell you what I did I have I'm looking at it right now I have this one this is dragon commands and in all caps it says equals all caps and then so what I'm doing is I'm reminding myself because I can never remember what is title case what is it where I want just the first word capitalized what is it where I want all the words capitalized I can't remember the commands yet so I have a little thing sitting taped to my computer one day I'll know that by heart then I can get rid of that one and put up another one that I need to learn so trying to learn all the commands at once it's not going to happen just learn the ones that are most important to you by taping a little cheat sheet on to your monitor and learn that one once you got that one committed then learn the next one awesome and third one of those things still there's still a lot of people here you can actually use the GoToWebinar slide-out car to ask any questions you want to myself for Ernie and Walden and comments and saying yes a blue Yeti is next Mike and he also had a question for you Ernie Ernie have you been able to find competent help through outsourcing for email marketing campaign so I'll just quickly answer that I personally have found help through outsourcing via a network I think we had someone design our email newsletter not the content just the design of it that's my answer I guess yeah so two things one about the blue Yeti Micah I should have mentioned this so one consideration going back to trade us is a microphone that sits physically on your desk like the like the like the blue Yeti or the blue snowball whatever one that one those sit on your desk that means it's gonna take up space and you might knock it over and you might have to position your your head to be close to it the reason why the USB mic is really good is because the little mic part is sitting right next to your mouth at the same level all the time and it's got a cord so if you can snake it under your desk around your desk and it's not taking up space on your desk and if you turn to get something while you're talking somebody on the phone if you're using it for that purpose it's gonna still pick up your voice at the same way so that's just a consideration I'm not saying one's better than the other but those are the trade-offs in fact it it's okay so that's the mic thing as to email marketing yes I have I use people for every aspect of this because here are the things you need to do with your marketing one you need a website okay that's up work I hired somebody to set up the website just put it up that's one person then I said later on I want to design some stuff tweak it that's a different person that same person who's a design person could do my business cards okay do my business cards that same person could also create a one-page handout that looks pretty in a PDF it's a good download which you know on your website you will say to whatever prospective client you have this is you learn this from Dan Kennedy you have to give somebody something of value for free in exchange for their email address because they're not just going to give you their email address like sign up for our newsletter please that is the lamest thing in the world nobody's signing up for any newsletters yeah understanding of why it matters why it's useful because we already ate too much email and it's coming from annoying people so but if you say oh you know I can send you my free diet on you know 15 things to look for when you hire a lawyer who does X which is what you do and of course all those 15 things will be things you do but maybe some things that other people don't so you say yeah and get this there's a curiosity factor they go yeah I want to get that but you want it to look nice you don't want it to just be the word document that you print it up and tight you hire somebody on top work and say look could you make this look nice put my logo on it put my colors just make it look nice making it be a PDF they'll do that for you it might cost you like 40 bucks now you got a lead magnet and when they download it it's gonna go into your email account which is whatever let's say it's a Weber or I use Infusionsoft which is more expensive but does more stuff how do you send the emails out how do you sequence those out you could figure this out on your own if you want to and if you're fairly tech savvy or even not that tech savvy you can figure it out but it's gonna take you a lot of time why not just pay somebody to do it for you because they're gonna know all the latest things to do they're gonna you know not flip the switch that needs to be flipped they're gonna do it right the first time and if you need it updated later on you'll already have them in upwork and you can say oh yeah I hired that person way back let me hire them again so every aspect of my marketing other than the emails I write I write those myself everything else out sourced through that work yeah awesome and just add that as well so you could actually find email marketing templates and a website called the Saurus botnet which has a bunch of stuff not only email marketing templates so for Walden I just need that message back with the link and Han asked a question if you use Apple products in the buildin speakers and microphones efficient for driving um yeah in the latest versions of Dragon with my laptop I can just like speak into my laptop and the little mic that's in the laptop will pick it up the thing is I have to put my head fairly close to where that is and maintain it there so I look like I'm I look like a weirdo if I were in the park I would look very weird but you know that if that's what you got to do that's what you got to do so it is you can do it I would recommend if you're gonna really try to get the most out of it you invest in a USB mic and Joe brought up a question which dragon version do you use anyway I eat the version I use on the Mac they just upgraded to six I upgraded his tics it's pretty good there's AG lunar named David sparks he's got a website called max Sparky and he is a big user of the Mac dictation software so whenever he doesn't review and talks about how great it is once he says it's okay I go after him and he also has tips and tutorials I think about how to use it he's got a great podcast that's one of the podcasts I should have recommended for Mac users it's called them Mac power users so his websites called Mac Mac Sparky but he's got a podcast he does another lawyer in Florida named Katy Floyd who's super smart and savvy and they do this podcast about how to use your Mac it's not for lawyers but since they are both lawyers it's a value to any lawyer who's using a Mac but it's a lot about software do they use and why they like it and what the problems are and stuff like that so that users check out Mac power users podcast awesome and next question comes from email from Greg I think we answered a little bit of it but he wanted to know Ernie what are you outsourcing so no you have everything but is there anything that you would be outsourced all the prime um yeah I like well I use Infusionsoft and I have a guy who just does my fusion stuff stuff for me full time actually he and I are because Infusionsoft is expensive but it does a lot of different things and I guess I'll take this opportunity to say that we are going to collaborate together to make it easier for lawyers who want to use Infusionsoft but don't want to have to go through the trial by fire that Infusionsoft makes you go through because Infusionsoft isn't built specifically for any one type of business when you if you want to use Infusionsoft and it cost $200 a month minimum they will force you to go through a training which cost $1500 because what they don't want to do is have people sign up for it and they could confuse about how to use it so they're basically saying like look you know it's like if we if you're a pilot you know they're not gonna let you get in a plane without training you you know you could we can trust you with a bicycle but with a pot you with a plane you're gonna have to have training and that's how Infusionsoft is and the problem with Infusionsoft that I found is you have great power but really what anybody who's going to use it like especially lawyers are going to want it's just like hey just create the campaigns for me that I'm going to and so Jason my guy that I found threw up work and I just decided why don't we create the base of campaigns and lawyers would probably want to use namely the sequence of emails it goes out after they download your lead magnet after they hire you and then coming in for the first appointment you know sequence of emails it says you know you're all booked you all said and in the morning of the pointment if a reminder here's where you park and then when you know you've finished doing a great job for them send them a thing that says here are you know here's a review and give us some feedback let's know how we did but while it's also feedback for you it could be a testimonial if they say really glowing things about you and then there's an automated thing that gets them to give you permission or if they want to get permission they can and then at the end of it you know you'll have a testimonial or at least will have feedback and you'll have permission although that's automated all those campaigns are built in Infusionsoft and Jason because he's an infusion soft certified guy now he can just drop that into your account set it up for you if you want to keep hiring him to do a lot of stuff you can but I just think if you're gonna use infusions often obviously not not many lawyers are gonna want to spend $200 to do it per month but I can tell you it's worth it if you have a website and you're sophisticated about your marketing you can use it to do other things besides just the email marketing so that's what I use outsourcing for the most is marketing because there's a lot of elements to automating marketing you know and I do not want to sit there and connect those dots even though I can and even though I have it's frustrating I'm not a detailed person when it comes to that stuff I forget to Don and I across a tee which in the world of technology means you forgot to put a comma the whole thing crashes so you know that because you're a developer so don't go down that path hire somebody to do it for you that's really where I get the most value out of upwork is with the marketing guy and to follow up on that question Barry wrote in you offer five tips and it's ten follow up emails on your website do you recommend it earnings do the same type of email drip campaign are you allowed to do it for prospects so I guess yes yeah and you need their permission first yes and you get their permission because any you know inherently when you say I will send you this if you give me permission to send it to you by email they're saying well yes of course I'm gonna give you permission says you send it to me by email now the permission part of it let me just know so I break this out when lawyers start thinking about this they think oh am I allowed to do this trust me ethically allowed to do it in every state because you have permission and once you have permission for one thing you have permission for other things now at this point your problem isn't ethics your problem is the email service provider even after you've gotten permission from them if you annoy the hell out of people by sending them lots more emails begging and pleading and being the annoying overzealous cars' used-car salesmen person then know they will unsubscribe or they'll click the link that says you're a spammer even though you're not because you got permissioned you know so you don't want to do that so the whole trick to direct marketing is and this is why it's very intricate I can't explain it all in one fell swoop and you need to get that in Kennedy's book and even then you know I can explain to you how it applies to lawyers but the point of it is you need to always be giving incredibly valuable information and you need to be targeting your marketing to the most select person that you most want to work with which is counterintuitive to most people like but wait I don't want to you know not market to other people that might want to hire me because until I get good enough at hiring you know getting only the people they'll pay me the most amount of money that I most like working with I need to take these other cases yes I understand that but here's what you don't understand and you will understand very quickly once we start doing it is when you're speaking only to the most select group the other people are listening they see this and the attitude isn't oh you're not talking to me their attitudes oh my god you're incredibly selective so either so they become even more inclined to want to hunt you know to hire you and but by speaking to the most select people you're going to get all of those people as is humanly possible because you know it's like writing a love letter right to somebody this is essentially with you this is a analogy I like now you know if you write a love letter to somebody you care deeply about you know they're gonna go oh my god you care so much about me now some people won't care about you and that's unfortunate but you know you've automated this letter you know writing thing to a lot of people are all getting it but they think it's just to them guess what you don't want to do you've written this wonderful love letter how are you going to address it dear to whom it may concern right because then they're not they don't feel special well your whole marketing is to whom it may concern like that's like when you saying I do everything for everybody you're saying to whom it may concern I do everything for everybody and guess how special people feel when you say that not at all they your stuff and if you say I do three different kinds of law I do personal injury I do state planning and I do you know criminal law somebody who finds you who says oh you you do criminal law and then they compare you to somebody who only does criminal law do you not see how that's like if you're gonna go hire a doctor who says I do brain surgery I do infectious disease I do geriatric care I do hair transplants are you gonna hire the person there to do your brain surgery when you can find a brain surgeon no inherently you trust people who specialize so either specialize or find ways to market your different quote-unquote specialties which aren't actually specialties because you're doing three things or four things try to find ways and you can do this that I can't explain you know in detail how it's done but it's done where when they show up at your website the ones who are looking for you for one thing don't tend to see the other stuff because that's kind of erode the trust that they might have so there are ways to do this it's more complicated it's more expensive and it's also more burdensome for you as a practitioner to keep up with the developments in several different practice areas is also more more burdensome to come up with systems that are different in different practice areas and then write them all down and then give those things to different kinds of people that work you know you can do that if you want to but you're multiplying the amount of work and expense that you have to do so when I tell people is what practice area do you most enjoy do you it produces the clients you most like figure out how to market in that one as though that's the only one you're gonna do because odds are it is gonna be the one you only want to do once he get good at it because you like it already and then if you really want to circle back and do those other ones go go ahead go for it but at least you now know what's involved you know the expense you know how much effort it is and it's not any less effort or if it is it's like five percent less effort um and five percent less money it's just as much work to do each single one and then you know managing those different practice areas also hard so everything works against you when you don't specialize everything worked for you including the power of marketing automation when you do specialize you just need to learn how to connect the dots not that hard and get people to help you who can help you connect the dots awesome thank you and one of the last questions comes from Avon do you recommend a wordpress Wix or Go Daddy for Bill I recommend WordPress stop reading the list WordPress here's why here's why I have used every conceivable blog software website software how I started I use blogger TypePad I use moveable type if anybody remembers that one I've used them all Squarespace I've even tried Wix just for laughs here's why you don't want to do that first off if you're gonna use this for marketing you're gonna want the one that's most optimized or has the tools that they're most optimized for marketing and that's WordPress secondly you're not going to want to set this up yourself and you there are more people who know WordPress because it's the dominant platform and so it's gonna be cheaper and easier and you're gonna get better people more easily if you use WordPress because remember you're not gonna do it yourself and you want to design it you pick a theme there's lots of different themes what if you text you know if you get the five another website thing that I talked about that's basically me explaining like look yeah here's how you can up work here's what you say to somebody that up worked and say just put up a wordpress site it's actually $200 or less that it will cost you then you'll have to pay for hosting that's really the only you know question is you want to pay a little bit for hosting or get more robust hosting you can change easily later but it's WordPress and I don't know I don't know how many websites out there powered by WordPress but it's an in godly number the New York Times uses WordPress David you use WordPress right yep yep humph you know what did I miss my as WordPress the only choice number one and similar use abuse as way and going everything else where you can drag and drop elements you can edit tags if you ever want to edit a page in your website just click edit page and it opens up what do they call it a way to view or just like work work the bold underline whatever you want so it's very easy to edit they have amazing plugins so if using - if you're looking to increase your ranking on Google you're gonna make it faster you want to add live chat whatever you want to do there's a plugin for basically it's probably the most popular CMS platform I can think of right now also like you said if you know how to set up a wordpress site you can do it very quickly so obviously nothing here in there before but Ernie you said that I thought or the quad that you had a one-pager pretty much explaining to everyone how to do it correct I don't I look you know I have empathy for lawyers unless you want to prove something you know enter the science fair and you know something and should prove that you were able to set up your own WordPress site I wouldn't do it I can do it and I don't do it anymore why because I got better things to do with my time and while it is pretty easy you know there are things you could screw up you know and you don't want to screw them up so just pay somebody there's a guy I found on upwork who's in st. Louis or no he's in Cleveland and he he's Rojas media Rob Rojas are Oh Jas that's media I just pay him and he does stuff and like you know I needed something set up for friend I hired him I was like a hundred bucks I was like maybe 60 every time I need something done I just say hey Rob jump on that would you he's like really fast he's awesome I found him threw up work but now I hired him directly it's easy to find people to help you with WordPress don't do it yourself what you do want to do yourself is once you learn once you have it set up posting content to it like David said it's easy it's like typing into word does you know the WYSIWYG editor you bold stuff that part you know you can do and you want to do and that you don't need outsource that although you could but you don't want to you want to know write your own stuff if you can but everything else setting it up oh my god no don't waste your time yep exactly so one of the things that the trust me fun is what's the constant force net where you could actually find really nice WordPress themes you could buy it for 50 bucks and it will up worker that he's fine well freelance on a cup work and for maybe a few hundred bucks you have a beautiful little website Donald's in two weeks so so that's the way to go I think as well and last question comes from some of our companies from units to the chat law or doing this asking what is the small firm bootcamp so from what I understand this is a weekend training that you do for an attorney that want to learn how to do everything you're talking about basic ray yeah well so what happened was ahead of cyclop a puss chased calm and I still have it and it's all about paperless and then as I learned that more lawyers want to learn more than just paperless like how to use the cloud at a automate all that stuff that you know the word paperless doesn't convey that and so I would do these seminars and I called them boot camps I called them small firm boot camps there live to day events they happen in New Orleans the next one's going to be an end of March I have the date but I can't remember what it is off the top of my head and it's two days and so that I created that site for that but then the people would come to the two days we're like well you know some people couldn't come and they say can't you do it online so I created an online course it's called the modern law firm course and it's got like 60 lessons in there and I opened it up for registration back in March last year and then a bunch of people went through and now I don't openly sell it but if you know if you text my law firm three three four four four one of the things will happen is you'll get three videos there are the first three lessons in that course for free and then if you go through that then you can buy the course at the currently low price that it's at it's gonna jump the next time I rerelease it by a lot so so if you want to do that if you want to get that online course you can do that and if you're in the system in my email system then when I do the two-day live event I will for sure tell everybody about it and you know let you know when you can get the low price on that this year it's gonna be a lot of fun we're going to do it on the weekend we'd do Thursday and Friday before the weekend on which New Orleans has something called Bayou Boogaloo which is like a music festival so food crafts music kind of like Jazz Fest except mostly it's only local so the hotel prices will be reasonable and not off the charts like they would be for Jazz Fest and so we wanted to make it so that folks who had been in New Orleans or who had been there before ever wanted to say it has something else to do an extend their stay over a fun weekend so that's why we're picking that weekend that's what we're gonna do it we are looking forward to it's gonna be a lot of fun awesome yeah hopefully I'll make it this year and say hi the there is one last question so we have Walden Axl was the last recommendation made regarding getting a new website within two weeks so basically Walden you basically go to clean for dotnet you click WordPress you find a wordpress theme that you like you buy it for $50 then you go to upward comma Kearney said you find a freelancer specialize been building WordPress websites you send a message or you post a job and say I want to spend $300 I have a theme already can you build me the site and you hire them you give me the theme they put on your website and all you need to do is give me a content the text images and the link that you want and that within one or two weeks you can evolve a completely go well you can have it fastened to it you can have it fast in two weeks like that so that $500 you know link thing what I explained to people is like here's what you need to do is I explain it all in detail and then I say okay so when you go to help work copy and paste this text into the box that says this and the screenshots that describes everything as far as the themes I also limit your number of choices because it's overwhelming the number of teams you could pick and thing is do you want what themes are I'm gonna give you three things you're gonna immediately forget but you want them mobile responsive you want the site to look good on a mobile device so that's mobile responsive you want to it to be html5 you know ready you want it to be optimized for SEO so there's a company called studiopress that is owned by a lawyer named Brian Clark who no longer practices law who had to figure this stuff all out he has a site called Copyblogger I highly recommend it it's it's the one I use to learn what the best platforms were their themes are all of those things so if you pick any studiopress theme by definition it will comply with all of that stuff that I just mentioned you can go look elsewhere but there seems like a hundred bucks a pop so for the extra 50 bucks you know you know it works oh yeah you know but you want that you know and I'm sure you would agree right those three things your things you need and then you just you know now you know what what you want you say okay I want this theme hey mr. upward guy and actually the upper kya hai' for the first time when I hired him he said by the way I own all those themes and I can give it to you for free so if you even put that into your up work request there probably people out there that have bought all the themes from studiopress and if you tell them you want a studiopress theme they'll include it as part of the cost their cost and they'll just you know use it as a lead generator and not charging more for it so yeah they're amazing very high quality your website yep well now they're on Rainmaker which is their platform but you know it's yes they're all using studiopress themes because by definition that's all you get to choose from so they're all good I mean not all of them are applicable to lawyers so one of the things I tell you is like if I were you I would you know confine your search to among you know they have 30 something themes through your press says let's say here a four or five they're probably good ones to start with and I think as a designer later on you can it can make the theme look completely different but what you're doing with the team's you're ballparking it like it's got this look I'm happy with this so I'm saying is you can have it up in like a day if you if you got the theme you can go down upward and go I want this team I've got a hosting set up over here here are my passwords go load that baby up you could have it up in an hour but you know day is reasonable cool and everyone listening if you have any more questions email me my direct emails David at practice panda-sama or you can also tweet to us on Twitter I practice Panther and or you can Paul you can touch learn you how Bernie how can i well if you type in mad for oh yeah I'll be in touch with you automatically but if you want to

to you all shortly and put it up on YouTube and last but not least Bernie thank you so much once again for taking the time to be with us today absolutely you're very welcome happy to do the right
