 hey guy is our shisha from guiding tech and if you might know hound from sound house is an all new personal assistant available for your smartphones and today I am going to compare it with Google now and Siri how just came out from its beta state and is only available for the residents of us at the moment but of course you can side load it on your devices now how is known to be good with complex questions and you can ask layers of questions and let's have a look at how it compete against Google now and Siri who are you that's good who are you okay let's go ahead with the iPhone who are you okay let's go on with the next question so what is the temperature in Delhi today and and how about tomorrow and how about 10 days from now but that's a good thing now let's go ahead with the Google and let's ask ok sorry about that temperature in Delhi today and how about tomorrow and how about ten days from now and indeed a good one now let's go ahead with the iPhone temperature in Delhi today I guess it's taking the wrong city because I mean I'm a location that's us for my iPhone let's just continue with the questions for now how about tomorrow and how about 10 days from now okay now let's go ahead with our third question and that would be a complicated one so let me ask the Hound what is the population of India and the currency of Latvia now that's a good thing lets me ask the same question from Google what is the population of India and the currency of Latvia so it just gives me a plain simple web result while the hound gave me the direct answer now let me ask the same thing from Siri what's the population of India and the currency of Latvia I guess it didn't take the second part of the question let me ask her again what's the population of India and the currency of Latvia so let's just take it that it's not understanding my question and it's it's gonna give me a web search result so that's good for now now let me go ahead with the next question so tell me a joke let me ask another one tell me a good joke okay go ahead Google tell me a joke oh I thought it would do something better than giving me a search is that okay let me ask the same questions okay Siri tell me a joke still tell me a joke tell me a joke so okay the it answers well even though it didn't give me any of the jokes and whatever hound gave me was actually not kind of a joke but still I mean I would give the point to the hound so let me go ahead with my next question and that would be I I mean I'll ask them to identify a song that I will be playing on one of my cell phones so let's just start okay how identify this song sounds like titanium indeed it is now let me ask the same question to Google identify this song okay the action is not supported in my country so I will give it a pass and let me ask the same question to Siri identify this song identify the song that's playing nice work three yes indeed it is titanium so due to my country the Google Nam was not able to tell me the song well that's okay I mean not the first thing that I'm not getting because of my location that is not the USA or the Canada so let me go ahead with my second last question in the list and let's just ask hound take a note okay so that feature doesn't seems to be working for how let me try this on Google take a note hello friends okay going ahead with my iPhone hey CD take a note hello friends that's good so moving ahead to my last question show me my calendar okay show me my calendar did that worked pretty well hey Siri show me my calendar that's good so guys as you can see Han was not able to do pretty good when it comes to the internal apps like taking a note or showing me the calendar but then it does a pretty good job in identifying the songs telling answers to complex questions I mean two of them at the same time and while other two just showed me a web search result so all I want to say is it's been a long time since both Google now and Sri have been in development and Hound is just the new kid in the town but still it got some pretty good tricks up its sleeves and I mean it can give a good competition to both it's contended that it's a Google now and Siri of course so friends lets us give the developers have found some time to come up with some good new features to take on Google now and serene if you have any doubts please to ask me in the comment section and don't forget to subscribe to our channel if you haven't already this is Ashish from guiding tech and I hope to see you in my next videos till then take care and have a wonderful day
