 I'm like and it's super effective and the original draft for halo combat evolved Cortana was supposed to have a British accent this is later dropped but the occasional british phrase was still left in there like sawed off what she says to the 343 Guilty Spark so right there this is Cortana fans might be too late Cortana is a smart synthetic third-generation intelligence character in the Halo series she begins service on intent of ever 7th 2549 and her backstory is written up in Halo novels Cortana was created using a flash clone copy of dr. Katherine Hayes Lee's brain an illegal and unethical practice 20 flash cloned brains were created but only two survived one of the two survivors was used to create Cortana the neural pathways of the cloned brain were scanned and copied through a process called cognitive impression modeling she was not only affects Emily of dr. Hayes's mind but also a replica of her physical form albeit at a younger age dr. hazy States in her journal that Cortana slightly resembles her daughter Miranda keys dr. hazley allows Cortana to choose any Spartan to soldier she would like and she clearly chooses the master chief on account of his neuro compatibility and his luck this is referenced in a voiceover she makes in Halo 3 Cortana can be transferred among various computer systems either by data crystal ship or through close physical proximity in the original halo she did a data crystal ship to move in and out of various networks including John 117 million armor in halo 2 she only needed to be touching another system access it however this is most likely a product of John 17 teens upgraded armor in halo 3 she reverted the data chip probably because Master Chief's armor was so badly damaged in fall to earth that it reverted to a backup system after she took in all the foreigner information inhalers control room katanas lifespan was possibly cut in half on account of the large task processing and storing all that in addition all the data stream absorbed on halo noticeably decreased her efficiency on the other hand it has been suggested that Cortana found a way to use all that information to prevent her own death from rampancy remaining stable when normal a eyes would have shut down Cortana has been recognized for her sex appeal obviously and director of halo 5 Frank O'Connor suggested that Cortana is not actually nude not because she doesn't have private parts but because she has kind of a holographic body stocking her not nakedness was an interesting thing to see progressing through the games as graphic technology were find she went from the block e aí in common evolved to a flashy haired still block e AI in Halo 2 to a standardized naked AI in Halo 3 to a rather voluptuous designed naked AI in Halo 4 though she did gain better defined fingers and toes the circuit pattern mapping all of her body changes between every game though in Halo 5 she appears to be fondly clothes and it's about time although the live-action series halo unto dawn doesn't have Cortana is a main storyline character that do have her briefly introduce herself before every episode which gives a really haunting example of what it's like well she slowly breaks down due to rampancy Cortana's first words was the italian phrase for when the game is over at the king and pawn go in the same box which was the words that Hayley's mother gave her after their first game of chess when in a different emotional state Cortana changes her color this is noticeable when she's embedded in the core installation of a forest control center once she was cured of a rampancy she modified her avatar to possess what appears to be an armored suit similar to the foreigners personal armor this is noticeable in halo combat evolved but not as much in Halo two or three only specific instances does she produced the color-changing effect one instance is right before John has rescued her bungie's first introduction to Cortana anza halo was sooo the Cortana letters for a series of cryptic emails sent during the production of combat evolved in 1999 although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be cannon Cortana does recite many of the same lines in Halo 3 in some of her messages and in the announcement trailer some of the lines are also said while playing the level court Jenna Taylor's Cortana's voice actor she also plays the voices of peach berto and Toad Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant Cortana it also voiced by Jen Taylor Cortana was originally the personal assistants code name but the decision to keep it was made as a result of petitions and polls asking for Cortana to be kept once the name was leaked Cortana or Cortana is more commonly said is this name of Oh gear the Danes sword which bears the inscription my name is Cortana of the same steel and temper as joyous and durand all this is a reference to the AI Durand all from the marathon trilogy another series created by Bungie who serves a similar narrative role in relation to the player character some speculated before the release of halo 3 whether the smart Cortana would follow marathons during dolls succumbing to rampancy a concept invented by Bungie in which an AI character becomes insane by getting too much knowledge halo 5 shows hazely explaining that Cortana's recovered from ramsey and obtained metastability by gaining access to the domain a forerunner database thought to have been destroyed after the firing of the first halo array Cortana was turning to do to action figures in order to promote halo the first to promote halo combat evolved the second term on halo 3 demo mcfarlane toys what they wanted to do was show Cortana is an older version of herself in game and they figured they would accomplish this by making her figure more voluptuous which isn't the truth there was supposed to be an alternate storyline to halo combat evolved in which Cortana goes matter of power and wants to take over halo in order to control the universe Cortana's creation date november seventh is a nod to john-117 service tag as november seventh can be written as 11-7 Cortana's voice is selectable in halo reaches firefight mode alongside of auntie dot can be through g0 and noble six is the only selectable female voices Cortana's voice is featured in Forza fours description of the m12 warthog which is featured in its auto Vista mode in Halo 4 Cortana spaces modeled after page a coffee and her movements are performed by Mackenzie Mason in halo grasslands smart AI BB thinks that Cortana is a bad role model and he believes it because she spent so much time around humans she'd become too human herself Cortana frequently jokes about having a relationship with Master Chief and it's implied that the Chu have grown very attached to each other in Halo the fall of reach she says to dr. hazley that Master Chief is attractive in a primal animal sort of way while examining a photo of him in Halo 3 his mere presence and reminder of his promise to her are enough for her to pull herself together and help him in Halo 4 she sacrifices herself to save John and one of the last thing she does is touch him with a life-size hologram something she's always wanted to do whoa I was an awesome load of Cortana facts I actually really like croton I think she's pretty cool though i think the waiting for was a little gender skewed but I mean that's just my opinion during the release of halo 4 a buddy of mine and I went on a big giant snowboarding trip and I just totally wiped out in the worst way possible well he didn't know is that I snuck up my xbox 360 and I brought it to our chalet and so during recovery while we were both just sitting there like lying back in absolute pain we beat all halo 4 start to finish it was in a total blast I really really enjoyed it anyway tell me your experiences halo and this is a good series for me to cover I have played mostly Halo games though i'm not a huge expert so please like forgive me for my absolute horrendous pronunciation of everything yeah and if you like what you see like comment subscribe because it's super effective Oh Oh
