 online personal assistance that's a thing Brett will you go sign me up for one welcome back to dear Veronica I'm Veronica Belmont there are many apps out there that claim to be your personal assistant like Clara Alfred Charlie Chloe Julie desk etc however these are still just apps they have a long way to go before they can match an actual human managing aspects of your life for you Dave Radel on Twitter wanted to know is a personal assistant online safe and worth the money I just so happen to know a guy that is used a few services that actually connect you with a real human being often in another whole country that helps to make your life a little less insane let's hear all about it from manish Sethi just like every question the answer is it depends truth is you have to be ready to manage your assistant the assistant doesn't just start off doing it for you so make sure that you first of all have a list of tasks that you want to have done secondly once you started hiring and testing out your assistance you have them execute on those tasks with you they're going to need your personal supervision for the first weeks of the job just like any employee and over time you can start to see if they're good or bad you don't want somebody who's coming up with ideas that's your job you want somebody who's going to make sure that your inbox is finished and complete to the end so make sure the kind of person who's uncomfortable leaving stuff undone thanks Manish some of the sites that he recommended to us include staff calm up were calm and searchable calm he also makes a very cool product called padlock by the way which shocks you when you do a bad habit that you predefine you can learn more about it at pavlo calm up next another question about visiting San Francisco this time in a slightly more permanent way dear Veronica possibly moving to San Francisco soon what tips do you have for quality and inexpensive short-term launching their gym Moreno oh boy inexpensive good luck San Francisco is one of the most expensive rental markets in the country to bypass craigslist pages I actually asked someone who lives in the area to post on your behalf to next door the invite only social network for neighborhoods people are always looking for someone to take a spare room and sometimes friends of a friend can get a better deal than just some random person from the internet if that doesn't work well you might want to consider east bay and just eat the commute time those rents aren't getting any better either though and Airbnb is probably not going to make much of a difference either for price good luck finally today a super fun one at Jeju knee asks on Twitter dear Veronica I'm moving into a new place how should I name my Wi-Fi network of course I took this one to Twitter because you guys are way better with coming up with this stuff than I am pretty fly for a Wi-Fi land of the lost I started naming mine something cryptic that sounds dodgy current one is csa surveil one tell my wife I lover I've seen that one a few times bill why the science by wu-tang LAN hide your kids hide your wife I it hurts when I pee error network everyone assumes it's a problem and leaves it alone oh my god the puns aw i love the pun so much you guys are amazing thank you so much and don't forget keep sending in those questions too dear Veronica on Twitter I'll see you next week at GG saguni jejuni jejuni G juni ok G juni will say G juni
