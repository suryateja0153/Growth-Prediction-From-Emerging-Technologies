 well hello there everybody welcome to day seven of the new business boot camp thank you for sticking with me this long I know it's only a week but you know a lot of people sign up for stuff and then they just kind of flake out so if you still live me I very much appreciate it and today we're going to be wrapping up by taking a look at how as business owners we should be working with virtual assistants to go to leverage our time now when I talk about leveraging our time here's my deal this is my take on it I think that as business owners our time is our number one most important commodity and if you think about it logically money comes and goes you know you spend money you make it it is what it is but with time once you spent that time it's gone forever so you must make sure that you invest it properly particularly when it comes to business growth so today we're going to be going over all the different types of things that VA's can do for you we're going to be going through how to hire them how to train them and manage them and then right at the end of the video I'm going to give you very much a real-world example of a particular project that you could do on your own trying to handle everything or then work with a virtual team to be able to get them to do fundamentally all the work you'll see the difference right in front of your eyes it's unbelievable when you look at look at it like this so that's how we're wrapping up the week I very much thank you for sticking with me like it said if you haven't done so already make sure you pop over to Facebook ducker on facebook com join the community there has been some really good conversations and people helping each other out and things like that over the last week and please do stay subscribe to the blog I promise you nothing but high quality content that is going to help you catapult your business into the 21st century every single week until next time take good care enjoy today's video and I'll see you soon a chris tucker calm bye for now alright so here we are with the last day of the new business boot camp day 7 today we're going to be talking about hiring and working with virtual assistants like i said in my intro a massive game changer for anyone that gets involved in it I've you know I'm not just saying that because I'm quite heavily involved in the outsourcing industry myself but I can honestly say to you that I have worked with 100 literally hundreds and hundreds of entrepreneurs in the time not being in the business and it's just it's it's a beautiful thing to be able to see people engage the services of VA's and then really start to utilize them they grow their businesses and that's exactly what we're going to talk about today as always if you chatting about the course on twitter via social media that sort of type of thing new business boot camp is the hashtag i've been getting some really cool questions pop up actually in a few little funny comments here and there so it's been great to be able to converse with you guys in regards to that on on the social networks so what are virtual assistants very very good question I don't get asked this question as much as I used to because people are getting more and more kind of you know engaged with them and the term is quite you used quite frequently now but bottom line they're professional workers that help you run support and grow your businesses simple as that now why do we as entrepreneurs need them why do we need to work with them a couple of really really good points first up to maximize and leverage our time I've always said money comes and goes but once you spent your time it's gone forever it's gone forever time is the number one most important commodity to any business owner so we can do anything the leverage our time and get more done every day then it's obviously a good thing it also allows us to be able to utilize the skill sets of other people that we don't have ourself to better help kind of you know elaborate on certain things or you know you know produce documentation or marketing plans and that sort of type of thing so you know being able to utilize a team of people whether they be right next to you or virtually out there is huge to the growth of any company you can't be the one man band forever it's absolutely impossible if you want to you know sort of grow and become more successful more profitable and so on they also allow us to be able to grow our business very affordably as well and it's the big question do we keep it close to the home do we outsourced overseas and I'm not really going to discuss that right now I've done so in blog posts and interviews and things like that before in the past but the bottom line is that working with overseas VA's obviously allows us to try out their services and what their services can bring our business and the growth of our business without investing any huge amount of collateral which is absolutely huge and it really does get to the point of creating a more enjoyable lifestyle for us as entrepreneurs as well because not only do our business grow but obviously we get to spend more time with our loved ones our family and friends and doing what we like doing such as traveling and you know all that sort of type of stuff as well so before we go any further let's just have a look at the four main types of virtual assistants or VA's as they're now sort of refer to more than anything else that are available for small business owners all around the world to start working with straight off the bat first up is the Holy Grail as far as I'm concerned of virtual staff and that is the general VA the general virtual assistant this is your gal Friday this is like your personal assistant although she can't make your cups of coffees or you know pick up your dry cleaning kind of thing this kind of VA will do your online research calendar management your audio and video uploading blogging and transcription work social media management they'll also handle all of your travel itineraries and on on and on the list goes every single entrepreneur on the planet must have a general VA fact if you don't have one you're already behind in the game trust me start looking into getting one immediately if you want to go to grow your business fast next up is our web developer VA it is what it says it is somebody who's very WordPress savvy they can do a lot of themed customizations they can build out membership sites and portals if you're looking at sort of producing online content to sell and share niche site creation landing pages squeeze pages and usually they can handle a little bit of light graphic design work such as icons and buttons and banners and things like that as well next up is our SEO or search engine optimization VA they handle all your on and off-site optimization as well they can do all your link building your social bookmarking create those link wheels at work so well they can also do a little bit of you know a press release link building and you know that sort of stuff as well so across the board they just end up getting you to the top of Google and the other types of search engines out there organically and nine times out of ten guys stay away from the you know the black hat or the bad SEO type tactics look for long term it's an investment for you and your business online next up is our content writer VA this is someone that can handle all of your keyword research your article content research they can do a little bit of internal link building and integration as well maybe work hand-in-hand with an SEO VA at the same time they'll handle all of your article submission and article spinning as well as all of your blog posting and commenting and that sort of type of stuff as well this kind of VA is you know very important in regards to brand building and that sort of type of thing because they're kind of out there doing a lot of this sort of written work for you so it's important to make sure that you get someone who truly enjoys writing and is very good at doing exactly that there's a couple of major areas that are sort of starting to emerge as well on top of those four main roles the first one is kind of encapsulated under the title of video and audio editors your rare that you can get one person do both every now and then they do pop up but ultimately video and audio editors are starting to come out of the woodwork quite heavily right now as well as mobile app developers to I also would like to mention very quickly I get asked a lot of time a lot of times rather over the last sort of six to eight months or so whether there's any good mobile app developers here in the Philippines and right now there really isn't yes there's a few people doing it but ultimately this you're catching on so if you're looking for mobile app developers go over to Eastern Europe and you know you'll be able to find them relatively easy on the job sites that i mentioned in a little while so let's talk about training a VA number one don't assume anything alright do not assume a single bloody thing you have to train them and work with them using video and audio is great because it means that they can play those things back and they get either a visual or an audio idea is to you know what you want and how you want it put together and avoid using long and boring emails as task sheets as well you know that actually they're going to end up missing things in that regard so I use a lot of video or a screencast and stuff like that it works really really well when training my VA's and things like that too when we talk about delegating to our virtual assistants let's be as clear as we possibly can on everything that we're doing for them you must must must set realistic timelines and deadlines in place for when for when you want tasks completed and do your best to try and get one task at a time they might have a few revolving tasks every now and then like you know at three p.m. every thursday update facebook with an image or something like that but ultimately try and give just one task at a time it just means they're a little bit more focused and you two obviously as well in regards to working with them and making sure you're getting what you want managing a VA talked about this so much in interviews that I've done with people when they've asked me to be on podcasts and things like that don't micromanage your virtual assistants they're going to quit plain simple nobody like to be micromanaged we've talked a little bit about that in some of the other lessons in the last week as well try and use a project management system if you can because it will enable you to sort of stay a little bit more regimented particularly the beginning of working with them and you know it just be a nice guy just be a nice person to work for nobody wants to work for the and you know just be a nice person and everything should go just fine with them reporting and and getting updates from them is just as important as giving them you know decent tasks and making sure that those tasks are delegated in the right way I like to start with getting daily updates from virtual assistants when I start working with them and then maybe move to weekly updates further down the line after maybe four or six weeks or so when we had a little bit of rapport built together and then you know you can always give my personal system a bit of a tribe which is literally just a bullet point email sent to me at the end of every day very quick and easy for me to be able to reply to whilst they're sleeping or I'm working late or I'm on an aeroplane or whatever the case may be fact of the matter is it works really well for me that's my personal system bullet point email find my responses back and on and on and on it goes every day so that's the reporting and the updating side of things we're working with your VA and obviously guys you know I'm kind of I know I'm skimming here okay this is something that I have been asked on numerous occasions this particular subject on actually producing a full-blown course on outsourcing it may or may not happen in the future it's not within my plans for the immediate future but I do talk about a lot on stage at conferences and things like that but ultimately I'm skimming here I get that the blog has plenty of great content as well as a YouTube channel as well so you can find out tons more on that sort of type of stuff in those particular areas now what I want to do right now to wrap up this little lesson is give you a very clear real life very much a real life example of what working with a virtual assistant or a team of EA's can actually do for you on one particular project and as we've talked about them a little bit in this week I want to focus on ebooks so when you create an e-book and you market an e-book whether you're going to be giving away for free or selling it regardless there's a lot of work that goes into that and as you can see from this particular cover this is the brand building personal brand building e book that I wrote which you can get for free I'll put a link below the video here today for you can check it out but ultimately it starts with the e-book and designing and creating it and writing it and everything then along to you know a mini site customization graphic design creating sales copy setting up your shopping cart your affiliate program your customer service your marketing your opt-in list email your press release may I don't need to keep going here you can see what's on the screen you see how busy it gets now here's the reality check you can go from this to this by working with virtual assistants on a project just like this look at the difference there it is again and this is what you'll be doing if you work with VA's you see what you're doing here you're a Content machine you're creating the book the sales copy your writing blog posts for the marketing you're shooting that video and then your launch posts for actually launching your ebook that's a massive change in terms of the sheer volume of work that you'll be doing there it is again that's without your VA's and that's with your VA's absolutely huge so today's action step is to develop what I call your three lists to freedom very easy list to put together first up put together a list of things that you don't like doing I mean you would rather and I always say this and I love it's a great analogy you would rather vomit in your own mouth and swallow again graphic potentially a little bit but what the hell we're on the last day of the week so number one list list the things you don't like doing number two list of things you can't do you don't have the skill sets to actually perform these tasks and lastly a list of things you feel as a business owner you shouldn't be doing for whatever reason it doesn't matter you're the boss then if you've not out sourced before start looking at some of those tasks and get on 20 desk or elance which is the two big sort of job project-based outsourcing sites out there where you can post you know job ads for designing a logo or putting together a landing page or designing an e-book or whatever the case may be these are the two sides odesk.com elance.com that you've got to check out just post a few projects up their work with a few virtual assistants get a bit of a feel for everything and I'm sure that by the time you've done sort of three or four projects you'll be able to make sort of maybe get on to the next step and that is if you have outsourced before to go ahead and actually hire a full-time virtual assistant nine times out of 10 it's got to be that general VA first up just like I said and now here's a little bit of a disclaimer involved with this i own a company called virtual staff finder that some of you may or may not heard of some of you may or may not actually worked with to find your VA's there's my disclaimer this is my company but if you pop over to virtual staff finder com will be able to help you find that full time or even a part-time virtual assistant to be able to help you run grow and support your business bigger and better than you ever imagined believe me we've helped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of entrepreneurs in the last couple of years on that site so as always guys anything that's mentioned in this particular video as well as all the other videos throughout the course of the week all the resources the tools that you'll need the tools of the trade you need to go to take your business to the next level here are over on the resource page Krista calm / resources again massive amounts huge amounts of you know
