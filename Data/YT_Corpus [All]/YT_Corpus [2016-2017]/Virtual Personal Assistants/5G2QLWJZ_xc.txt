 hound is a new personal assistant looking the best both Siri and Google now welcome everyone it is Andrew here from I downloaded log today we're going to take a look at hound this is a smart assistant that's looking to take on both Siri and Google now and it can handle some pretty intense questions like show me Asian restaurants within 10 miles excluding Korean and Japanese and sort them by ranking or how many tablespoons and teaspoons are in a cup and I'll give you both of those results back with just asking that one question now this is a free app available both on iOS and Android when you launch it for the first time it's going to ask for some basic permissions like microphone access location access and access to your contacts then we'll walk you through a short demo show you some of the features of the app and some of the questions that you can ask now what I was really impressed with was the speed this can pretty much transcribe your voice in real time as you're saying it and the results of returns are almost instant they're displayed in Google now style cards whether it's for something like the weather a location or even the news if you tap on the real question mark in the bottom left-hand corner you'll give you a large list of all the different things you can say to out they've done a great job of compiling all these different questions you can ask the problem is it still doesn't compete with the built in native assistant whether it's Siri on iPhone or Google now on the Android because you can't change this to be the default option you can't say hey hound and have this automatically pop up so you will always have to open your phone and find the application to use it on iPhone they did attempt to make it a little bit easier if you 3d touch on the icon it does give you options to jump right in that text search or voice search and it is really quick now there are a lot of features that can do even if you have to get into the App fully integrated whether it's calling your messaging to someone or the integrations with both uber and Yelp - halo ride and check information on a restaurant one little Easter Egg that I found that I thought was really cool was the ability to just say I want to play a game and it will actually present you several different options that you can play using your voice like hangman it'll actually pull up a word and you can guess using your voice all the different letters it's kind of monotonous especially if the word is larger but either way it's kind of a fun little thing that they've built into the system for the most part I got pretty good results with pound however a couple times I got some mixed results like if I say how many calories are in two eggs and three slices of bacon I get nice answers right here and I can see all of that caloric information that I'm looking for however if I add a third item so if I say how many calories are in two eggs three slices of bacon and two slices of toast I don't get an answer instead it falls back to doing a default Bing search found says they're looking to reduce the number of times they actually have to perform a web search and actually give you your answer instead in the end hound is a great alternative to both Google now and Siri however without that system integration it's never truly going to replace those built in personal assistants let us know in the comments what you think of how and if you found this video useful please subscribe I'll see you next time this has been Andrew for i download blog
