 thank you it's great to be here enjoyed Alex's comments very much I highly recommend his book it's an excellent book I'm I'm gonna be talking today about my notes I don't have my notes are you gonna put them up no okay I'm gonna get my note there we go thank you I'm gonna talk today a little bit about blockchain but mostly I going to talk today about the future of consumer banking Alex sort of laid this foundation of this core technology and that's a piece of the puzzle but there are a lot of other pieces that are affecting consumer finance and the transformation of how all of us are going to interact with money a few years ago Sean who's my co-founder and I founded circle and we looked around at a number of pretty significant technical forces that were happening that would change how money works in the world changed the user experience of money and would have ultimately pretty significant implications for the world economy and those were the blockchain the second was this the advent of at scale machine learning and AI and the ability to apply that in financial services and new user experiences new UX is for money primarily inspired by what I like to call social payments so the vision though for us was that money should work the way the internet works and that week we can send and receive content we can share information we can communicate we can search all the world's knowledge instantly globally without fees but for a whole host of reasons money doesn't work that way and we thought now it's possible and we want to build a global consumer internet financial franchise inspired by those ideas so you've got you've just gotten a relatively long lecture on the blockchain I'm gonna have a much more condensed one and actually I should also say I'm gonna take questions after about 10 or 12 minutes or so so as some of these themes kind of tickle your interest you know feel free to ask questions the so how do i define the blockchain it's a suite of open protocols and formats for exchanging value and settling a transaction globally instantly and without fees I like to think of it in very similar terms to other open Internet protocols that we just take for granted today so there's HTTP and there's SMTP and there's VoIP those are protocols that Unleashed distributed networks to exchange information data and communications in a distributed model largely peer-to-peer and it allows us to do all these things that we do today globally that we all take for granted so it's similar in concept to that more specifically I like to think of it as a public global record-keeping system that's incorruptible that's immutable no one can change it and like other open protocols it's it's an open network its permissionless anyone can connect to it and use it like today I can go download a piece of software and create my own mail server and it will work with Gmail and it'll work with any other email service in the world similarly I can download a piece of software and create a web server connected to IP and you know a couple billion people can then instantly access that without cost and so it's an open model so anyone in the world who uses these protocols has access now to this global immutable incorruptible record-keeping system and transaction engine that's that's really powerful and and that's what we saw a few years ago so some of this was alluded to in the prior talk but there's there's this distinction that people increasingly make between a public blockchain and private blockchains so the Bitcoin blockchain is a public blockchain it's open to the whole world just like a public website versus say a private intranet the example that was given earlier as well so there are private blockchains and I think those have narrower and narrower use cases but where people don't want a open model or they don't want to trust crypt agra fee and mathematics I'd rather trust people and so they build these networks that can do that but still involve a level of human trust but our view and what we've built circle on is public blockchains and we think that's actually where the really revolutionary things happen with money it's not you know banks improving their back office with this technology it's actually changing the way this actually affects every business every consumer every organization in the world the same way that the web did the key though to make this work for consumers is seamless integration between existing forms of money existing money formats and money itself actually if you dig in it's just data and text file formats that's what euros are that's what dollars are it's just data and text file formats we're gonna merge that existing formats of money with the blockchain and to do that governments around the world have started to say okay if you want to do that you can do that but you're gonna be regulated like a bank you're gonna have to meet a whole set of requirements to monitor transactions and know your customer and track and prevent financial crime and all this kind of stuff and that's where companies like circles been doing is working with governments to go get all the necessary licenses so that we can connect the existing financial system and all existing forms of money but to this network to this blockchain and so what that allows though is it allows consumers and businesses to get the benefits of digital currency instant settlement global reach highly secure and nearly free transactions but not needing to use a new currency I would guess that most of the people in the room here would prefer Euro or sterling or dollars to Bitcoin bitcoin is an interesting asset to invest in you're sort of investing in the network almost like an equity but it's not interesting to most consumers as a currency and so we want to give everyone the benefits of that network but do it with the existing system of money that we have today so that's key is sort of routing currencies over the blockchain so the second piece and actually just to close that out I mean essentially the the vision here is that you know just like HTTP and SMTP and VoIP and and on opened up a world of free and instantaneous global information sharing and communications that the blockchain is going to very much do the same thing for money and it's going to very much do the same thing for a wider variety of financial products not just currency value but lots of other forms of financial value structured assets so it's a significant a significant building block but it's really just an underlying infrastructure and protocol that we can take advantage of and anyone can take advantage of so as we were envisioning you know building a kind of consumer global consumer bank of the future we knew that this was going to be one of the things that we would build on now another another kind of key concept here with money is you know wire payments expensive we heard the example earlier of you know when you swipe a card or tap a card just using the most advanced form of electronic payments that we have today there's seven intermediaries that actually in the end takes days etc but you know businesses who accept electronic payments or consumers who share value with each other around the world it's it's actually quite expensive so why is that well what you find is that money when you peel back the onion money is literally just data there you know we have paper tokens but those are really references to a central bank ledger and the ledger is is a database and banks are effectively regulated database operators they're allowed to have a database that has records in it that are called euro or dollar and whatnot and that's literally what the case is if you go go inside a bank and you look for the money there's a single database and it's got records in it and they're allowed to have those records and they're allowed to transmit files back and forth to other banks that include references to those records they have access to those those files so payments itself is essentially just synchronizing these databases that's the technical task of going from point A to point B and so with blockchain protocols with cloud software we can run all this stuff globally scalable Eon the internet we can have the cost ultimately approach zero now there's a bigger issue though which is that banks are regulated because they inter mediate risk they take on social obligations historically you know those have been around preventing crime making sure you are who you say you are and they are acting as agents of government law enforcement in a sense and so that's not going to change these intermediaries are going to need to do that and that's expensive that's what we call compliance in in in Bank parlance and banks have huge compliance staffs and so they do these human processes to manage all this and they use software as well but there's you know JPMorgan Chase biggest bank in the world I think they brag about having 40,000 people in compliance and that's supposed to be a good thing so what if we could automate compliance and how and again by doing that bring the cost of value exchange and using money closer to zero and that's where machine learning and AI come into play here they make it possible to automate vast amounts of risk decisions enabling cost efficiencies and allowing value transfer to be free all around the world so in our case at circle we started building our machine learning and AI is a couple years ago and they've gotten quite quite good about 90 percent of the decisions the risk decisions about identities about transactions about all this stuff are made by AIS and when the AI isn't certain it feeds those decisions to risk analysts who have proprietary tools that we give them where they can make judgments as humans which then further trains the models and improves the learning and makes those AI smarter and so we're able to support an enormous range of customers transactions all around the world at a tiny tiny fraction of the cost so this combination of blockchain as a open transaction settlement network and ledger and AI when you bring those together really lets you reinvent a huge part of of banking and of financial services in particular in this realm of payments the final piece that's related to this is you know the bank of the future is just software when you realize that money is data and now that we have devices that are actually payment instruments literally money is just data and software and so the the sort of battleground if you will becomes one about what's the consumer UX of money historically it's been paper tokens it evolved to be plastic tokens but now it's just data and software on phones and in the cloud and using all these kinds of technologies what is you know what is the future of the of the UI of money and we've barely begun to scratch the surface of this just in the past couple of years so we've got this phase and our belief is that kind of consumer finance in the future and the use cases for how consumers and businesses interact with money are going to be radically different than than we think far different than we think just like in the early days the internet we couldn't imagine things like Facebook or we couldn't imagine things like Twitter we couldn't imagine things you know like snapchat or any of these metaphors for communications we could think about sending a message and a phone call and that was sort of as far as we could go in terms of thinking about communications so I think we're in the early stages of this so what can we learn from the history of consumer internet software about the future user experience of money in particular we were inspired and this is kind of going back when we started this a few years ago we were really inspired by China and so China is years ahead of the West in the in the future of money and banking in my view several years ago social payments became the new UX of money for a huge percentage of Chinese society and that's grown and grown and grown every year to the point where about 500 million Chinese consumers use social payment apps as how they interact with money that these are apps that mert like Ali pay and WeChat pay that merge messaging your social graph media and p2p payments into an integrated experience it's building on the user interaction paradigms that have achieved mass scale on a global basis saying money is just part of that and there's a lot we can learn from that that hasn't happened here it hasn't happened in Europe it hasn't happened in the u.s. in any meaningful scale so there's a lot we can learn from that but I think you know when you combine these piece is messaging oriented conversational user interfaces artificial intelligence BOTS that are actually driven by artificial intelligence and fun expressive experiences that's actually the future UX of money it's not your mobile banking application that you have in your pocket it's gonna be something radically different so you know just to conclude whereas I've emphasized we're in the really early stages of this not just circle the company but this whole movement to reinvent the consumer experience of money and you know will consumers shift their financial relationships to be governed by from being governed by banks to being governed by mobile operating system companies social messaging and social network companies or will new forms of global internet-based consumer financial companies emerge that kind of bring these together and we certainly think so and that's what we're trying to do those are my comments and happy to take questions thank you are there any questions there Amy is open I think I'm the first person who's asked for questions it's not just an interview on stage there's question I'm Erin kunuk I had some Bitcoin talk here some time ago Stephanie and my question is how do you see the role of government and the future in the blockchain future would you rather go for people like bit nation who think the government's would be obsolete and everything would just be decentralized or would you rather think like factum and these companies that they'd give those better service would just make government more efficient yeah yeah I mean it's a long discussion Tommy I'll give you but I'll give you a very brief answer within the realm of money and currency I think that what we'll see is that central banks will issued the cryptographic currency and they'll create architectures that are based on distributed Ledger's and block chains and they'll allow intermediaries to interact with that and they may even allow consumers to directly interact with central bank money in that way that's what the Bank of England is studying doing that's what the People's Bank of China is very actively studying doing there are huge advantages to central banks across auditability accountability monetary policy administration efficiencies financial crime enforcement just huge improvements that cannot be had if they do that that will take some time but I think that's what happens with respect to money and I think that intermediaries that provide financial services will still be regulated and there'll be laws and so on the longer answer involves sort of how can you apply blockchain to governance itself and to the structure of what government does and there may be places where things that government do will be done as software on block chains and it will allow for more global forms of institutions I actually think that'll be the case but that's a probably a bit of a longer road my name is Gary from semcon how does this affect the stock exchanges worldwide what you are seeing yeah I mean my focus is really on you know consumer banking consumer finance there's a whole nother realm of blockchain technology for securities and so just as an example Nasdaq is running trials where that you could issue equities as tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain and so the it's not a stock certificate anymore it's actually a cryptographic hash that is a record that is stored on a blockchain and if you want to move that stock to someone else you send a transaction message to the blockchain and it moves that to some other address so stocks how they're stored how their custody how they're secured how they're shared globally I think moves to that model blockchain technology is not really ideal for like the real-time exchange part of it those will probably tend to be centralized kind of real-time exchanges but I think it does it impacts any kind of exchange that it's that is involved in transacting and settling and sharing any kind of financial asset whether that's a futures contract or a stock a bond etc one last question yeah so the question was where do we see blockchain with respect to compliance issues and money laundering financial crime etc it's a huge area there's a phrase that's being used in the US now of reg tech and they're really excited about blockchain as a regulatory technology because for the first time you can automate and analyze and do forensics on transactions in a in a public way right if you want to go audit a company you have to trust that they have a good you know controls internally that the software hasn't been compromised you trust their books and records well that's what an auditor does well now I can just write a script that can analyze with permission through cryptographic keys to analyze all those transactions and and do a cryptographic audit just as an example another example and then I'll wrap up because any we're behind schedule is we work really closely with law enforcement because we're required to but what's really interesting is what they tell us is you know banks have to file what are called czars as you know suspicious activity reports so if we see something going on that we think might be criminal we have to report that to the government with within certain conditions certain threshold size scale etc but what's really powerful about public blockchains is that they create a public transaction history now it's soon anonymous you don't have all the identity data but there are forensic techniques and there's software and we employ it and automate it to allow us to basically know is this is this payment going to a black market is this payment been correlated and Rai helps make decisions about this has this been correlated with other forms of fraud or criminal activity and so we have an incredible amount of data that we're able to generate that you can't in the cash economy and and you can't really in the Opie with the opaque nature of financial institutions it's really hard so the law enforcement folks have told us that the data we give them is some of the very best data that they've ever gotten from financial institutions so I actually think it it opens up a lot of opportunities it raises other questions around privacy as well but but short you know short answer is it has I think it'll have a big impact thank you thank you
