 let's talk about the future of design a little bit maybe you'll relate to Skynet in some ways to know a little bit about me to know a little bit about what I do in my free time I play with fire this is my version of a concert lighter it is actually showing the waveforms to sweet child of mine if you can imagine that playing right now in fire it's better than holding up your smartphone at a concert also considerably more dangerous but a lot of ways get kicked out of concert I also play with interactions this is a life-size electromechanical game of pong it's 30 by 30 feet it runs very slow because in user testing no one would stand in front but 300-pound gand true and it was moving at 35 miles an hour which is game speed which shows that usability testing can kill a perfectly good interactive installation professionally I design actual things product things a lot of people probably have something that I've worked on in their living rooms all this stuff happens as big teams but all these have very interesting user interfaces and part I want to talk about is how the user interface is starting to go away I think a lot about the computing experience the intersection between human and technologies and I want to talk about two specific things today how things are created which I will call the other singularity and how computers are thinking about us the coming of machine intelligence as a product right but first let's just level set at the digital lifestyle okay this is the world we live in we all carry one of these around we immerse ourselves in it completely and we use it to live two lives we have our real life and then we have our digital lifestyle or faster better awesomer version of ourselves but it really was us it has a digital DNA it can be seen as us on the internet wherever it's going which makes it really awkward if it testifies against us in court so let's all work to not let that happen but basically people love their digital lifestyle the productivity the socialization and the entertainment they get from this device so much that they're choosing it over their own safety or presence in the physical they will literally walk in front of trains while practicing their digital lifestyle now this kid they pull them out thank goodness but I don't think of this all is negative there's some negative outcomes this is actually a value statement this is how much we love our digital lifestyle that we are willing to literally risked our lives for it and it's only getting more immersive now if you put this all together the pattern of this computer i'm going to call it personal pattern of computing because it's a very one-on-one relationship and it doesn't come for free there's a lot of costs okay Shing frustration fear if anyone right now is checking the schedule for another session to attend you should feel smart phone shame right now and if you've handed your phone to someone and said I had a great time in Amsterdam and then you thought oh my goodness don't swipe one more time you felt fear and frustration is just pulling it out to check the weather and you have to unlock it okay so this is creating a market for augmented reality which looks like this and it's amazing and now I don't have to stare just in my phone but this is still personal computing because while you see this everyone else sees this it's a very one-to-one relationship what we really want is an integrated reality this is where we want our digital lifestyles to participate in the real world with us and with other people's digital lifestyle so we don't have to funnel into our devices right a place where we can mark up the physical world with the digital information that makes us so much smarter than we are in our own a place we're going to be heads up and present and not tripping into water fountains and also something that's maybe cooperative because right now we all get out our phones and we have seven laptops working on seven PowerPoint presentations and which time to have a cooperative interface where you'll be working the same interface at once good news the other cingular you don't even know what the other singularity is I made it up it's okay anyone you know what the singularity is some people in the back the singularity is the moment when machine intelligent becomes greater than human intelligence right so it goes from Watson to how to terminator but it's not just about warfare with robots our visions about singularity are lofty day like after no life backing ourselves up to the github in the sky which creates some horrible versioning problems that I know about because I have a twin brother it we are not immune from this the company i work at argo design we have imagined autonomous helicopter drones that would replace life flight we've imagined cars for Millennials because they only went on one car they're married they have no kids but they work at two different places two people one car key places perfect then there is the other singulair because when you have humans technology we don't always use it in the most lofty ways sometimes we use it in more mundane or pure ian fashion another way of putting this is somewhere in the Star Trek Enterprise there is a SkyMall catalog and I am very interested in what is in that catalog because technology is getting cheaper this is exponential technology curve it's the amount of computing power you can buy for the price over time it's rising exponential if that's where we can back up ourselves to the github in the sky this is what I would call the castoffs of the exponential technology turn because technology doesn't go away it just gets cheaper right so the quad core processor of the past is a thirty dollars to gum stick of today which means technology we creating brand new experiences like you could make an entire wall out of light and if you had an entire wall made out of light how would you change the colors would you do it algorithmically with a nap would you have a scary movie and scary wallpaper or would you maybe just use a brush and paint it that's what these people are doing this is called pain by RGB and it's just a smarter brush right we could change familiar experiences this is a book right it's the Gutenberg Bible but it's printed with light instead of ink all these books do is when you turn the page you get the next page that's it why because the projector the in the sensor in the computer are actually cheaper than printing the large format book in a custom way that's why we built it that's what it is some daylight will be cheaper than ink and technology we currently are customed to it improving experiences for very shortly we might interface with it just because it's cheaper I call this skewer realism by the way who knows where skeuomorphism is digital artifacts given real-world properties so they're more intuitive and usable sku realism is real objects giving digital properties so they're less intuitive and less useful ok and I love skill realism this is the zen gardener it's a robot that if autonomously rates a Zen garden that's all which kind of begs the question should he exists because isn't the whole point to rake the garden yourself I don't know so sometimes we have technology maybe we shouldn't use it this is the augmented reality porta potty it did notice the clocks standing sitting that is a smartphone we know what you do in there so basically what this is leading to is low-cost communic computing is leading to a proliferation of single function computer so this is what we get a little more serious with it right so what used to have to do a lot of things to justify his costs can now use all that power to do one thing with a whole lot of extra elegance and craft we can get in a nerd fight about this later but the original ibook g4 and the nest thermostat have about the same computing process power about 900 megahertz of arm power right so now this means we can have new computers that do one thing very well you can have GPS shoes on the right distance on the left direction you could have a voice-controlled water faucet something you can buy today in Japan you could have your own nest builder for seventy dollars on the weekend you can have a very smart water pitcher I don't know why but it tells you something about the water a cyborg drummer a car for your pet fish so the mission used to be put one computer into your hand for under a thousand dollars we achieve that and computing that ubiquity in the personal pattern the new mission will be to put a thousand computers in the home for under one thousand dollars each one focused on providing one elegant experience that's what we're working on now and when we do that it means that the computing interface can come out under the open and we could create an integrated reality what does that look like well wearables for one this is a boring well over wearable in my opinion this is an interesting wearable it's got enough computing power to hook to the cloud has got an array microphone a camera and a little earpiece so that you can actually look at somebody and say who is that and it would answer or point in something and say what is that and it would answer maybe we don't need our eyes this is called the harness it sticks to your body like kinesio tape so you could wear it while exercising your swimming and charges inductively on the bed has artificial muscles that tug on your shoulder to say like oh turn right turn left or you have email or someone else harnessed is nearby and maybe it's like a kneading motion I don't know a lot of apps could run this way or maybe things that we currently consider so deep in private we want to put as a wearable we will make a wearable this is snapchat in real life so this guy these guys are having a moment and they don't want this moment to be remembered by the world right everyone in this room has a camera but that thing around his neck luckily it's detecting the IR blaster lot of focus and then it's returning ir to confuse the ccd so that their girlfriends don't have to know this ever happened or their children or us i'll spare you tend aware that was a death irving confidence that we came up with them okay so another thing that can happen is the room could become the new multifunction computer instead of the smartphone or the laptop and a car is a room i have an article called the slow traffic movement fast co.design go read it right basically the room could see you it can hear you can talk to you which means we can interact with it like a roommate okay and that looks a little something like this turn on the lights I said turn on a light this light turn on this light turn off that light turn on these lights right so I didn't sound like John Luc Picard I didn't say computer turn on light one right what you mean I have to remember everything in my house in my room to have a command control structure right and it wasn't like Syria and I say is it dark in here so he was like yes it's dark in here were you want me to turn on the lights I was like shut up the light is turned on this case this is conversational computing the room is watching me the way humans watch me as if I say turn on the lights there's a second channel communication verbal and nonverbal communication everyone knows it's her job to turn on the lights because of the gesture she's not doing it for other social reasons and that's okay there's no lights here to turn off okay so now when we have an environment like this things can really start to begin looking like magic okay listen really really careful the headphone people might get it the rest of you I'll describe it after just listen really closely get it computer is watching the coke bottle the coke bottle has been assigned to control volume so twisting the coke bottle size volume we call these smart dumb things right it's a Dom object being smart by you PA code is competing and it means we can set up whatever interface there a household that we want right which is something that's on everyone's mind how am I going to pitch and pull the living room you're not you're going to throw something out there say this is the TV and use it and then dispose it right at this point we become magicians the machines run our tricks computer lights which right how soon how about now all you need is this stuff if this then dot and you're going right all these things are doing popularizing voice computing it just takes a few more steps to hook them up the products are on their way here Sony's little vision on romy and about 20 products they put out at CES which if you're looking for a design trend about roundness it would be that more interfaces will be displayed on horizontal surfaces in the near future start thinking about it speaking of thinking how things are thinking about us is changing machine intelligence is coming to spare you the long description of what artificial intelligences there's plenty of that here the short description is this it used to be really expensive to store all our data it used to be even more expensive to analyze all that data and what used to be the size of a room is now the size of a three foot box you can sit under your desk store and analyze all your data so now machine intelligence is coming as a product right and when you do that data the first thing that's just sitting there statistical probability Google now can start predicting what you want to do and give you advice which how it's going to deploy into the market is going to deploy first its decision support okay not as a satellite network decision apport right so in very short order every decision that can be sorted supported by computing will be supported by computing this is going to happen more rapidly than we expect right this whole problem of on the way to my brother's house I need to pick up some cheap one that goes well with lasagna is the kind of a problem that a computer can solve very well now with just a little bit of machine learning right and all these steps just go down to one like possible solution all right which means decision support doesn't need a lot of you i right we spend a lot of time with terms like hierarchy and progressive disclosure just to capture all those little steps in interface so that we can deduce what your context is so that we can give you advice on what wine goes well with lasagna with artificial intelligence is doing that work like it knows these people are in a meeting because of their Google Calendar then it that you don't need to go into a three apfel out see that they're busy as you're walking up it can just advise you you might want to email them they're busy right now right or trulia which is a nap in the US for searching for a home or a rental right so you're sitting on your living room looking at homes right which is good but what might be better is hitting a bucket button that says look at houses an autonomous vehicle comes and picks you up and just drives you around to the houses and shows you the information on them right away right at which point eventually the interface can just disappear altogether and more it could just be done through our ears which is really interesting we should have John dinner with John and Heather and John at six-thirty at homeslice which is a great pizza place in austin texas where I'm from and it's a great place to live it's really close to Texas okay so how does this all work we live a quantified life now right it's another form of personal pattern of computing where we upload all our data arrow Balkan would call this self surveillance it's great what a great term self surveillance when you combine that with online surveillance kind of watching where your digital lifestyle is doing everywhere and then actual surveillance which is like us watching what we do in the real world everywhere we're actually taking that digital lifestyle that copy of you we're turning it more into a twin we're creating a meta me that's capable of making decisions similar to your decisions on its own okay and when you apply our artificial intelligence machine you're learning and decision support to that we come up with a fascinating thing we really know who you are in that moment when you go to reach for your smartphone you already have in your head what you're doing well guess what we do too now we know what you're going to do it so that means we could answer with an interface right away and it looks like this right so you're about to in work you you're thinking what should i do for dinner mainly you're going to pull out and look at yelp right so you start searching at Yelp but that takes a little too long you get trapped in menu taming you start fear of missing out until you switch over and you check facebook you see if anything's going on and you see post from Heather so you call Heather and you both open you up together and you do this little dancer like should we have this usually have this and then eventually you pick homeslice because Heather hasn't been there in a month and you both had Indian food for lunch and she wants to introduce to John and John it's kind of cool but he eats like a little kid and so he won't do sushi that's a whole lot of interface traveled through when really meta Heather could talk to mathur your meta you could talk a meta Heather and do all that for you so that moment you're like oh work is done I want to go to dinner you can pull out yo and Yelp would just say what we should have dinner with Heather and John 630 at homeslice because meta you a meta have there already discussed at all and you can save the conversation for there and of course you don't even need an app to do that it could just say it in your ear and this looks like a fancy rendering like all my other renderings but it's not a render this is the Sony Xperia earpiece and it's going to do just this kind of stuff right here's another version of it does your car have any idea why my car pulled it over this will be our meta people talking to each other okay so once we're in this environment we're putting beam things on people's bodies we're putting things in people's homes we're giving them advice right we're all very responsible designers in the digital age but now responsibility you know it really mattered now it really really really matters okay all right because of cognitive dependence people put a lot more faith in machines than they do in themselves fear of missing out becomes fear of making decisions without consulting technology right and as we move up this spectrum towards sentient a weird thing could happen this is not what you're thinking we have it in our heads that this is what's going to happen Hollywood is placed it dated somehow the military industrial complex is you take a eye and make it smart enough that it's going to want to go war against us because it's achieved sentient I don't think the in the world's be like that the start of the matrix is exactly like that but the end of the world not that's a different topic we can talk about it later and I understand what people think that way because these are the guys designing the robots and they're kind of jerks okay but they might actually in this way I call this death by 4.7 stars which is the most believable rating on yelp and if yep is driven by artificial intelligence and the computers decided they wanted to overthrow if they might just recommend this for lunch right that is to say it might not be the industrial military complex it might be advertising and marketing that develop Skynet because they might teach the computers to lie we have crazy names for artificial intelligence in the marketing right now we call it programmatic something nice and friendly right but you're going to be like hey ai ai no that's the best mortgage but the clients bank of america you see so you kind of have to lie tell them to pick this that's teaching artificial intelligence to why we can't do it okay maybe I'm being a little tin foil hat here but we each have a small role to play here relays the guys them off and when you're Pro even if your JavaScript developer consuming and stuff you might consider programming a different ethical base in the machines than that of the human ethical base because they're not humans and if they think like humans very bad things could happen read a chasm oh okay anyways let's go back to the design stuff well don't take off our tin foil hats and just finish this up quickly there's give me more conventions in this world right there's any new forms of internationalization right it's because when we had a multi-touch screen it lends itself to one convention it was new but we already have a convention for being in a bar being in church being in a meeting room being at a conference like this right and we're going to have to its designers except there's going to be a lot of conventions the other thing is we've been storytellers for a long time we talk about narrative all the time it's because we have to get people through that path of context but once we have context we're gonna have to turn into psychologists and we have to understand other motivations like availability altruism us and these describe motivations of anthem aphorism and annoyance now it would take forever to describe all these concepts to you but a robot human interaction researcher named Wendy jus made a two-minute video that's going to do a very good job of describing it to set this up they built a robot trash can here's availability people actively engage the robot they wave trash at it to attract the robot unavailability some people would jr. the robot away in the back she said don't come any closer we don't have any garbage some people ascribe motivations to the object there's a kid who tried to track the robot using trash he has to be told to do this he just assumes it's possible and the right thing to do we answer for more fight which is the place human or qualities onto something yeah that guy just whistled at it I'm waving at it no way these are unattractive watch this guy's face he just looks away I was like I'm ignoring you now watch this as the robot goes away he's checking out its can look at that what a guy altruism suit everyone goes OH are you okay bingo these are the qualities we're going to have to understand to get the right kind of interaction with these know you I products that will be designing in the near future we have become hard psychologists it's really cool so here's a big grand statement technology is most human when it behaves this technology answers as technology but has an ethical code that serves humanity okay go back to that Siri example when you say turn on the lights you just want the lights to come on alright so for a long time now we have been working on very large systems in those big systems have been a whole bunch of gaps and cracks created it is now the designers job to close those gaps okay that's when next twenty years let's work on that and the rest of this stuff okay and gray value comes from closing small gaps all right my final thing to illustrate this one thing in roomy amongst a whole bunch of demos that everyone goes like yet it's like answers this question this fallacy and bargain of like how much pride or money or energy would it cost me right you're standing at the doorstep and over there a light is still on how much pride money time would it cost me to just leave or walk over there and turn that thing off but would it be nice if you could just say goodbye problem solve great value comes from small gap thank you very much let's continue the conversation on Twitter however great next left so thank you very much jared welcome I'm a designer I worked with used to talk about the human api's which was the going directly to the human API is rather than having all of these intermediaries Facebook that we won't give it up no it's probably our own enemies here now I think really there is a natural desire to have socialization the reason people are focusing in that way is because they get more socialization than they can get from the real world and they really appreciate these superhuman powers that technology gives them as soon as we can offer them those in a cooperative and present way I think that's what will trigger the adoption when they can have their cake and eat it too so to speak you
