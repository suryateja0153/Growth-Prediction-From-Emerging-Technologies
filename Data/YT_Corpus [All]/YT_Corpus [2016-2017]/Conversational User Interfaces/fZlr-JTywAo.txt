 good afternoon everyone thank you for joining us for today's webinar with Columbia Business School executive education my name is Matthew monocle I'm the web manager here at executive education and if this is your first webinar we're glad to have you just a few housekeeping tips we're going to hold all questions until the very end our guest today is going to deliver about 20 minutes of lecture and then we're going to make sure we have ten minutes or so at the very end to answer some questions if you want as the presentation goes along feel free to leave your questions in the Q&A box at the bottom of the screen will make sure that we gather them up and ask the ones that oh that we feel we have time for at the very end as always too we are going to upload a full recording of this webinar at the end of probably about two or three days from now so keep an eye out for that and today I have the great privilege of introducing our guest Peter Bell peter is the faculty director of our digital literacy for decision makers program exact head he's also an adjunct lecturer at Columbia Business School and if that wasn't enough he's the CEO and CTO of wheelhouse I owe a company that provides software to teach developers new skills so thank you so much for joining us today Peter Matthew thank you so much just checking that the audio is coming through okay great so Matthew thanks so much and everyone thank you for joining us today so the goal of this session is to talk about some of the strategic implications of technological disruptions I've been involved day-to-day in the startup world for a number of years i ran the engineering team at General Assembly I've worked with lots of families of early-stage and later stage companies often to help them to build and manage engineering teams but today what I want to talk about are some of the implications of the changes we're seeing in the technology landscape and how we're seeing them starting to impact traditional businesses and organizations and we're going to be coupling a bunch of points so I'm going to go through these real quick and I'm looking forward to some openness and lively Q&A at the end so that the trail scale despite the sounds of unicorns dying in boardrooms and fields across the world there is still being more value created over the last few years by the early stage fast growth startups than at any other comparable time in history we look at even companies like whatsapp where they had a small team 55 employees 32 engineers and in a year and a half they created an organization that was acquired for sixteen billion dollars with an additional three billion dollars of glance to the founders and engineering team to keep them around when Facebook to the acquisition they had gone from zero users to half a billion users in a year and a half and while there was certainly some unsustainable parts about the recent venture cycle and I think we're it's quite clear over the last three to six months and that's been cooling down and that we're seeing a return to same valuations and the fact that eventually you need to have price to earnings multiples that can be sold in the public market as the IPO is open again there is still the ability to create scale and size in time frames and with very small resources that really just didn't exist in the past an important component of this is to start to think more orderly about competition because historically competition were the companies that were clearly and definitively the same businesses you but I think the best way of thinking about competition these days is using the jobs to be done framework that comes from Clayton Christensen probably best known for his work on the innovators dilemma and the underlying principle is that you should look at the job that your product or service is being hired to do what is the problem you actually solving in someone's life because often you'll find that other people are being hired to sort the same job without necessarily being in your industry there is some argument that creep whether you're creating a video game whether you're creating newspaper or whether you're creating a book or a TV series in all of these cases with least one of the jobs to be done one of the things you're being hired to do is to entertain somebody and because of that we're finding a much wider range of competitors kind of coming into our spaces just because they have access to a global scale and have access to to come up this in different ways we've certainly been seeing over the last couple of decades if not longer the battle for attention with TV viewership decreasing more people moving to the Internet and then this kind of X cumbrian explosion of apps and internet sites and games and other ways to to engage with our customers and we're kind of hitting this tipping point where it's always been fairly straightforward to build a website or to get nap built-in from twenty or fifty or a hundred thousand dollars or so on and now you have a new iOS app but unfortunately only so many apps are going to get downloaded and become part of somebody's everyday life so we're seeing this challenge now where the problem is not building something and in fact the we see even in areas like YouTube where there's now this explosion of content producers there's not the barriers that they used to be to content creation but now there is substantial barriers to meaningful adoption in terms of actually getting enough people to know about and care about the functionality or the content you're creating one of the trends that I think this is driving is a real focus on the importance of education it was interesting I was just rereading the Challenger sale which for anybody in responsible for b2b sales knows is this kind of new trend towards the idea that it's not enough just to meet with your prospects and ask them lots of questions about what keeps them up at night there's a kind of traditional solution selling and spin selling approach but rather you need to focus on educating or informing them potential solutions that could add value to their organization and then working with them to customize it to their specific needs if you're not telling your prospects something they probably don't want to take your call in a business to business environment and the similarly are in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer worlds the whole idea of content marketing is becoming a huge part of how you get meaningful attention from people in terms of teaching and informing them about things that were late to the products or services that you offer a trend that I've been seeing especially over the last three or four years which kind of pulls a couple of these elements the importance of education and the apples for attention together is the rise of the platform just take a moment and think about your smartphone how many apps do you have on it now it depends I I see people with 5 10 15 absence in Google with two or three hundred my next filter would be of all of the apps on your personal smartphone how many of them did you use within the last week for most people this substantially narrows the number right now we're coming down to five apps or maybe ten or possibly 15 amps on a regular basis and won't you bear in mind that we've got the kind of default apps that you expect the calendar ring and the email and the texting probably Facebook maybe linkedin maybe one or two others is not that much room left to get in front of people's to get their attention and so the challenge then becomes how can it's difficult to just go build your own mobile app and persuade large numbers of people to download and engage with it on a regular basis in fact many of the businesses we deal with we simply have no need to get an app from them or turn to check it on a frequent basis so the opportunity then and the threat becomes how can you leverage platforms tools like whatsapp around the world or Facebook would be the most obvious one in the u.s. how can you leverage the attention that they already have two better get in front of your customers obviously to things like Facebook Ads but especially with em a new conversational commerce interface that the facebooks working on how can you build tools well I have value to your customers and still allow you to engage with them through major platforms like Facebook that already exist it's been interesting to me that this whole kind of trend of user interfaces differentiator I remember in the early days what we started to see this people were like oh I want to use fresh Brooks not quicken for my small business because it's easier because it's got this kind of web 2.0 feel up to it as people would have said five or six years ago but that's expanded especially with the the move towards now more people are using most of the consumption of media and content now is coming from mobile devices one of them just desktops and as such you see things like uber which really a lot of the value proposition is its kind of the mcdonalds of Transportation right you know that whichever city you fly into you can probably pull up an uberx you're going to get a vehicle that has a possible rating you know it will take a credit card and it has gps so they're not going to ask you whether or not you want to take the loop to get downtown or whatever the details are getting driven around in that particular city I think you interfaces differentiator in some ways is going too far this idea that you know if there's an app for it then that in itself is an opportunity but companies that my favorite was washed on I all please feel free to check that out of your browser either during or after the call it's basically a venture funded laundrette now in the one hand that seems absolutely ridiculous it's like wait a minute so you're in this very saturated very well understood low-margin business that shimmer Li doesn't have as many large place the laundry laundry business and you put a mobile on it and something you can reads a few million dollars from venture capitalists but the interesting thing is there is a market which is more addressable by creating an app by making it easy to interface with and if somebody can do that within your industry or business whether to consumers or business people it absolutely gives them an opportunity to cut between you and your customer base and to disrupt your value chain the interesting thing about user interfaces differentiator is every time the user interface the predominant user interface changes there is a whole rash of new opportunities both existing and new businesses I remember back in the day when we were all talking about the the platform worlds Microsoft definitively beat Apple in the 80s and 90s by having the operating system that at least in those days was on the vast majority of computers or Google became incredibly valuable by effectively making the operating system irrelevant the Google value proposition is I don't want you care whether you're using a simple little Chromebook whether you're running Linux whether you're on Mac OS or whether you're using Windows I don't care I can still give you a lightweight office suite i can give you access to productivity tools information and pretty much anything else you'd need so Google's success was in many ways a change to the platform or user interface to say you know what as long as you can slap a browser on it I don't care what else is happening on your computer we've got you from here there are a couple of areas where we're going to see changes in user interface and the couple of the ones that i really want to mention federal who's not come across these is conversational commerce and then of course augmented virtual reality as you can see i was just skimming a book by our own design for voice interfaces but slack is perhaps one of the most intro testing chat based apps to blow up over the last couple of years we're seeing providers like X dot AI that will automate the process of scheduling if you've ever had to have a meeting scheduled and you're like can you do tuesday at two how about friday at four can you come to my location or yours now you can simply add this artificially intelligent barge that currently is human assisted and the extra day I team are pretty tight-lipped about how much of this is actually there are rhythms today and how much of it is something sitting fixing stuff by hand but they've got a business model based around automating the process of scheduling meetings there are companies like magic which was formed together on a weekend x a y combinator company of the idea of again it's a conversational commerce interface where you simply text saying i want this that or another and what they will do is they will determine how to find that they will get your credit card information and whatever problem you're looking to solve they'll solve for you it's going to be interesting to see how conversational commerce affects the ways that we interact with things like the web right now most of these NLP or natural language processing the prices are actually taking human input and figuring out what we meant it's still really in the fairly early days and to create a specific application using natural language processing or NLP takes quite a lot of engineering effort to use that said we're going to see increasingly over the next five to ten years there's a lot of engineering effort being put into simplifying this process and potentially this is going to disintermediate a lot of people that provide websites for apps because after all why do we go to a website typically it's either to learn something or do something and the chances are we're going to slowly over the next five to twenty years train towards intelligent agents we're in a searing or Amazon echo like way we simply express our intent I'd love to see if I could get away for the and somewhere warm because it's cold in New York and eventually we'll get probably through a text based interface because it's kind of laborious for a computer to just go speak to us paragraphs and paragraphs of information but probably through a text based interface we're then going to see a pre see with three or four special offers on our favorite airlines with hotels included so pretend what does that do though to the the travel companies to the kayaks to the hotels or the booking coms potentially it disintermediate them by creating another level of abstraction between the customer and the place where the supply is currently aggravated or commented and virtual reality it reminds me of artificial intelligence in that this is one of these domains where you've been threatening it forever and it's a little bit like the boy who cried wolf nobody ever believes is actually going to come I remember getting particularly excited about vrml the virtual reality markup language back in like 97 on ITA so almost twenty years ago and nothing useful came out of it but to anybody who's played with our one of the Microsoft solutions or oculus or who's seen the the discussions around what magic leap is trying to launch this is for anyone who hasn't come across it magic leap is a company that's raised over eight hundred million dollars with I think a 3.4 billion dollar valuation from smart investors and doesn't get even have a war game for it in the market and has no customers so clearly there's a number of smart people who believe they are automated reality solution adding additional information to the real world as opposed to virtual reality we're going to close out the real world and just connect to this virtual universe is going to be a real thing very quickly and again it fundamentally transforms the ways in which we engage and interact with things i think it was it was not at all surprising to me that facebook spent us stantial amount of money buying oculus because if you think about it in 10 years why would you want to be typing into facebook when you could be sitting in a room a virtual room with all of your friends from wherever they are around the world some other things I want to touch on is that I see as I look at the technology startups and the the successful traditional organizations who are doing well within this world the ones that are doing best for the ones with our grand or tonal attitude with a little bit of whimsy a little bit of attitude and I think it's becoming increasingly important to be less formal and less traditional both to access Millennials Anna and I think just to differentiate yourself is this kind of next generation of providers even if you have been in business for many decades one thing that's always challenging and it's funny and I accept the irony of me giving a presentation in which I'm about to say by the time somebody gives a presentation about something maybe it's too late my question for you is I look at all of these courses and evening classes and resources now to learn how to do content marketing as soon as everyone is teaching basic ways of doing content marketing it's too late for those practices to be successful it's the same with modern marketing or growth hacking the idea is as soon as people are teaching other people how to use a particular technique it's unlikely to provide you with a meaningful competitive advantage so a question I have for you is when you look at the teams that you're running the people that you employ it's great that you make sure that they get trained in the currently share best practices but my question for you is how many of your team are actually teaching because if you're not running the teams that are teaching other people then all you're doing is getting second hand innovation and that's not going to keep your company ahead of the game it's interesting as you start to think about historically when we look at the value si of a public company it's pretty straightforward it's it's based upon the likely net present value of the future dividends right so we're saying this is going to be this size and it's going to go a bit big when it's going to be around for a certain number of years so if we do a net present value calculation we can at least from a value investing perspective come up with a reasonable approximation of the value for any particular business one of the things has been concerning me a number of venture capitalists I've talked to over the last decade is what happens to that if every company starts to get disrupted increasingly frequently I think it's going to be interesting to see how we value companies over time as any given advantage sure there are some sustainable competitive advantages right our patents and plant and relationships but I think we're going to see that eventually the main sustainable competitive advantage that you can have is the quality of your team and so I'm going to argue that one of the biggest challenges to succeeding in technologically diverse complex and fastly changing future is building the team that is capable and passionate about working now one of the things has been most interesting to me having a lot of experience in a different in addition to running my own engineering teams i run CTO summits around the world where chief technology officer is connect from connected with and learn of my peers and as I speak to many of the top engineering leaders at successful fast growth startups there's a fundamentally different way that they think about attracting and retaining the best talent you see it already with things like top 10 of 10 * management now we're top programmers in addition to commanding salaries of a half million dollars a year or more also getting agents in the same way as rock stars or sports sports professionals and when I see unload the company site we're trying to attract the top talent the people who are presenting the people who are teaching and building innovation than just trying to copy from their peers it's not about the foosball table my pet friendly workforce but there are some things that I find as I speak to top technologists and knowledge workers that they do value how many of the companies that you work for is you think of your company how would you feel having an engineering leader running your engineering team who worked out of Minnesota if your team was in New York or Colorado how do you think about unlimited vacation or even work a wired vacation rather than tracking loans 12 days a year or even a results only work environment how do you feel about having a conversation on the day that you hire new staff talking about specifically what you're going to help them to achieve in terms of their career trajectory over the next two to five years so that then if they decide to move on to another organization you've helped them to get to the right place and maybe in a few years they'll come back and join you again etsy has career talks like that on a regular basis pivotal labs are very well-respected software development shop always sometimes feels like a rest stop for programmers where they go out to a start-up three years and come back for three years still adding value to that organization one of the the best books in and I'm sure most of you have come across this but if not if you want in one book that I think some ours is the best way to build a relationship with and connect with some of the top talents I love Daniel Pink's book called it live it's pop psyche but it's a very short and easy read and if you were to build it if you were to break it down to three words it's about creating an environment the supports of autonomy mastery purpose autonomy not Michael managing your team but rather allowing them to find the best way to achieve your business objectives mastery leaving them a little time to do a good job rather than always be rushing to putting out fires and chipping the maximum number of features per unit time and then of course purpose connecting to some reason why they should care about your mission whether it's charity water who's providing in water around the world or whether it's just providing more affordable insurance quotes for drivers in Connecticut whatever the level of the purpose or the mission is it's much easier to get the best value for your team if in some ways you can connect to them there and so I know that we're running towards the end of time and so if i wanted to give one takeaway you'll be that i would recommend if you want to get the best value out of the new technologies that are arising think about what you can do to create an environment to attract the most compelling team and I think I'll be a good pointer to break out and perhaps see how things happen in terms of questions and whether we can do some QA we do have quite a few questions so I'm going to go ahead and start in on those will let you know when we're out of time we're going to get as many as we can in the first one that we had talks about the knowledge firm service firms that offer expertise such as a legal or accounting field how do you think the technology disruptions will affect them and what might they do to make sure that they're not made obsolete so I think there's a huge challenge in terms of consulting organizations because the problem is much of what they do can be d skilled and automated and I think if one of the good things is it it's a function of the amount of data and the amount of variability people often talk about like big data and AI and machine learning the dirty little secret of big data is that it actually requires quite a lot of information if I was in the business of preparing wheels are corporate formations if we just take the the legal area or everyday IP agreements I would feel like there is some value to be to be obtained in terms of the interaction with a human but I don't think that necessarily needs to be somebody with a law degree so I would be very concerned about my ability to extract value for preparing whales creating everyday IP agreements knowledge and information one to be free and the value of these contracts and the preparation that complex is going to claim towards zero the good news is that especially where there are relatively small number of data points when a small number of people want very customized solutions I think we will over time see better decision support systems to serve as the the relative case law for example and similarly tools like Watson in the medical field but I do not necessarily see those companies being put out of business anytime soon so I think the technology is going to gain an a blow and a facilitator but you're gonna have to think very carefully about your your billing structure and which knishes you want to own because you're also going to be competing with companies around the world and to keep us-based billing rates I think you're going to have to be particularly good at something that somebody can't get familiar of the Philippines you a few of you are written in to ask about the the book that Peter mentions so I've dropped that in the little instructions box the name of that book is drive by daniel pink if you go to his website danping calm you can find out some more information about that so we you just mentioned talking about compensation innovations to attract top talent in a more technologically diverse field what are some what is some advice you would offer to make sure that you you have the best people that you need to get the job done so going back to the idea of education and the value of innovation I would stop by if there's a particular domain or area you're in it's often worth finding the people who speak the regional conferences if you want the very best talent go speak to them even if it's to the extent of goal if you wanted to hire a programmer take as an example and they program using Ruby on Rails a framework lawrence of startups use go to railsconf and hang out in the hallways a dress down a little this is not the place for the suit and just strike up a conversation with your speaker's everyone other than perhaps the kino der will be quite happy to chat with you and the best way of starting that conversation is we're trying to solve this in testing purpose driven problem whatever it is again whether it's freshwater in Africa or whether it's lower prices for consumers for their or tell if it doesn't need to be a mission with a capital m and then ask do you know anybody who might be interested or passionate about helping us to solve a problem like that and then I think about that do you know anybody is firstly if they're interested as a speaker they can come straight up to say well for me if I looking for a new job and if not it allows them to hand you off to other people who are also well networked because clearly they know some of the most successful speakers in the space so I find it's a really good way to get that first person or two and generally my experiences great at what they do and who is also a strong communicator and well networked they will be by far the best source of leads as you start to try to scale out that team and this is equally applicable to any type of knowledge work that I've come across today for just one more question and so I'm going to go with one I saw earlier which I liked talking about people that are already in your organization obviously adaptability to change is an important feature for looking at new people and new knowledge to bring into the org how do you go about opening up people that are maybe not as technologically literate or as interested in learning but still play an important role in your organization how do you kind of bring them into the fold and make them comfortable with innovation that's going on so that's a great question and there was an article in The New York Times about a week ago specifically about AT&T where had a little bit of human interest works like that the two brothers one of whom at a very senior executive position one of whom was still basically spooling wire and connecting buildings and they were talking about the fact that AT&T is really trying to invent itself and to say that if you're not continually learning you probably won't have a job and one way or another that in fact in that message and information needs to be conveyed I think it's hard because traditionally a lot of very large organizations founded that out of people educational learning well that's the stuff you do if you're not busy but if you're not busy we should fire you right the idea that we're going to continually invest in training and curiosity I one of the best things you can do is make it okay to fail I was speaking with Todd Park who used to be the CTO of America the city of the USA about when they fixed the healthcare.gov website and it was this huge challenge where they had had a number of large traditional government consulting shops do a horrible job of building a bad website which came online far too late and somehow he had to turn this around and take the exact same group of people and fix it very quickly and he said one of the turning points for him oh it's when they got at this idea of daily stand-ups wherever would kind of give what did i do yesterday what am i doing today what's blocking me and then any other business and one of the things one of the people came up with one day was they said I can't believe this but I've lost user data they've done something stupid in the database they had lost information and data which was a huge problem for the organization at the time or even Robert do I talk to he got everybody to give that person a round of applause and the reason he did that was because the fact is humans are going to make mistakes the only question is whether they are scared to tell you in which case is going to take nine months before you realize just how deep the hole is or whether they are not scared to tell you you support them and then you figure out what policies procedures or other practices you can put in place to make sure that that same problem does not recur so one of the most important things you can do is create a space that is supportive of learning but that also allows failure so that people can take the risks required to try something new time we have for today too just as a reminder to those of you who are asking we will be following up with the full recording of this webinar you should get that probably by the end of the week and we will send you an email if you signed up for this Web you'll get an email from us that lets you know that that recording is available Peter thank you so much for your time I see that you put your Twitter handle on the slide there is that a good way for people to follow you to get updates to see what you're reading and what what is a catching your eye and interest absolutely so there's two things I'd suggest both on the slide one is this my twitter handle at Peter bail the other is if you want to make a connection on LinkedIn which is the primary where management professional connections if you go to bit ly / Peter F bail f for Freddy Peter F bail that will take you straight to my LinkedIn page and please feel free to connect right thank you so much thank you so much and thanks to everyone for attending again
