 buongiorno Roma I don't speak anymore Italian I speak which is an expiry can a mixture of the two and I do that that everybody understands more or less what I'm saying so a quick introduction to to me yeah my name is Peter Gaston I work as a creative technologist a company called rehab studio in London if you want to write me tweet me rate me that's my Twitter and my and my blog address there I'm going to start by talking about kind of what's coming soon sorry I'm going to talk about what's coming soon back and give start by looking at the past a little bit this is called the ASCII read this was Intel's supercomputer it cost for 3 million pounds in today's money I don't know what that is in euro a lot of Europe it could process 1.8 flops and it retired in two thousand this is the PlayStation 3 was launched in 2005 it costs 425 puns and it could process 1.8 teraflops this is Watson we've already met Watson this morning Watson was built initially for one purpose and that's to go on a game show called jeopardy in the United States and to be able to take on the human contestants at this game show it took them 10 years to develop this system it's hard to get costs but we're looking at probably about 12 million pounds again and after that 10 years it went the game show and it beat the human champions of Watson by of jeopardy by a factor of three just white or with them that was in 2011 four years later this is the pog new toys Dino it caught 80 pounds and it's powered by Watson in 2012 Google used 16,000 connected processors to teach a computer how to detect a cat to teach itself how to detect a cat three years later the same technology could correctly identify this picture as a man using his laptop while his cat looks at the screen the reason I'm showing you this mainly is to kind of convey the point that things can change very quickly and especially artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is becoming very good very quickly basically it's a combination of things very cheap parallel computing lots of data better algorithms but essentially in the last three or four years there's been this massive breakthrough that's made artificial intelligence very very easy you probably saw last week the news that google's alphago beat the world go champion at the game of go so this was something that people predicted that computers were at least 10 years away from doing this mod of the most complex strategic games there's ever did way more than chess and people said the human champion would just wipe the floor with Google the human champion lost 4-1 over five games there's a lot of strands to artificial intelligence you'll sometime he referred to as deep learning machine learning neural networks as we saw this morning cognitive computing the big breakthroughs really have been in what's called the neural networks which I'm and we're kind of referring to artificial intelligence they work by you give them a piece of information there's a whole bunch of little nodes that do job they either if I what they think that thing is or they or they kind of analyze so they analyze or classify and then they pass what their result is up to the next node so if you give it a picture it will kind of keep passing up through various nodes until it recognize what a face might look like and then it will keep going until it recognizes that's not a human face it's a cat face etc it's like our brains it will give you a very rough result very quickly or a more precise result very slowly one of the ways this has been used a really nice example was this is from some from a university in Germany where they took the style of famous works by famous artists and then they analyzed them using these deep learning systems and then they gave them photographs so you can see at the top we've got a van Gogh painting and at the bottom we've got a photograph of the street somewhere and it breaks down each of them into its component parts and at the end can output the same painting in the styles of the various old masters this is not the same as just putting a Photoshop through on it it's actually learned what is sky and how van Gogh would paint sky and what is water and how turn paint water and it's kind of analyzed these things and can output and basically fake new works by the old masters so artificial intelligence can make existing services much smarter it can also create a whole bunch of new ones you probably kind of fail to notice in the last couple of years that recommendation engines are now kind of everywhere if you use pocket if you use apple news google news necks they're all built on these learning algorithms that learn what people like to watch learn what similar content is and then recommend things back to you also photographs photo services for hosted photo services have got way smarter if you use google photos it's really really smart the search without you ever telling it what senior photos you can search them and it will show the photos back to you and it can understand quite abstract concepts it can understand the difference between a bird and a painting of for example Facebook have got some really smart stuff that they're kind of hiding away from us a little bit at the moment they are analyzing your photos to learn what's in them but they're not kind of reporting that back to you they're showing it back to you in the form of more targeted classified advertising last year if you want to get really scared Facebook came up with this algorithm that could recognize who is in a picture even if it couldn't see their face just by their clothes and the similar to the clothes that you've worn in your other pictures where it does know your face even face is obscured it can kind of recognize that you're in there anyway with about eighty three percent accuracy and personal assistants are huge at the moment apart from the big ones like Syrian Cortana you've also got very targeted it's one on the left is a service called mode which is a personal shopping assistant it learns what you like and it gives you back recommendations that you can buy through Mona and on the right is Luca and Luca is a restaurant or food recommend personal assistant so again you ask it you tell it where you want to go what you'd like to eat it your suggestions you rate those suggestions at the end and it kind of reports back to you and keeps learning your tastes and will give you more targeted recommendations every time you use it the big breakthroughs has been in natural language processing computers are now much more able to understand the way we write on the way we talk this has been a difficult problem for years voice recognition has been around for a long time but the error rate has been so high that it's never kind of taken off until the last couple of years but now it's everywhere and I'm going to take a slight detour from what I'm talking about very quickly to to talk about this natural which processing is kind of shifting the way that services are going from the graphical user interface to the conversational user interface whatsapp probably a lot of people most people know what's app is huge it's got like nine hundred million monthly active users which is an enormous number last year they reported that whatsapp people on whatsapp sent 30 billion messages a day which compares through 20 billion SMS me is per day and the reason that Facebook bought whatsapp and the reason it's so valued is because this chart here this chart here shows the number of people globally online since 2012 and predicted up to 2018 the numbers on the left of billions so in 2012 there were about 2.6 billion people online globally and just over a billion of those we're using messaging apps in 2018 there's predicted to be four billion people using the globally about three and a half billion of those will be using messaging apps so there's a huge they're growing much faster than Social Work so I think Facebook sanja is on track to overtake the number of monthly active users from Facebook itself probably in the next two or three years as well and there's nothing you can't do in a messenger app a messaging app that you can do on the rest of the phone if you have video music utilities gaming you used to have a separate app for each of those but as we're seeing in the model of Asia especially companies like WeChat who are come on to in a second you can do all of those stuff inside one interface so everything that what a separate app or was done in a website will soon be able to be done through the single unified interface of facebook Messenger or we chat at an example of that we chat as you to the app on the Left shows a kindergarten you can the parents get live updates on their students process progress through we chat and on the right it shows their financial services so you can send money to people play the lottery order a taxi send pay your credit card and they've even started to offer banking and mortgage services all through the interface of a chat app it's a messaging app has become a messaging platform and this is a huge growth area we're seeing this through companies like Clio who now offer banking services through this conversational interface talk to you as if it were a person as if it were just a contact in your list and it is made possible by natural language processing in the past you could do this would be like phoning the PAP press one to do this press two to do that press three nowadays you can just chat to it and ask it the questions you want and people like this because most of the time people don't want to talk to their bank they just want to talk to their account they want a drip they just want the information not the graphical layer on top of it so we're seeing this become a huge growth area we're even seeing news companies start to explore using chat messaging Forbes the business paper they've just recently launched a bot for telegram and vogue have recently released a whatsapp interface and I'm sure a lot of you have seen or used slack slack is a massive massive growth company it's got about two and a half million daily active users at the moment which isn't that much but maybe but twenty percent of those have come on in the last three months and slack is not just a chat app it's a forum you bet you can use it to extend in multiple ways and it goes far far beyond the simple one to one or group chat that it started with so facebook Messenger are aware of this this is what they said at the beginning of the year threads are the new apps basically that means why use a graphical interface for most people that gets in the way when you could just ask it's cut questions and services through the medium of of messenger just talking to it directly so last year they launched facebook Messenger platform which started off quite low key with lots of kind of gift euros and pictures and just kind of funny stuff but we're starting to see it become much more powerful with shopping everlane at the moment is their preferred partner but you can buy and track your orders through a conversational interface through facebook Messenger and uber or taxi implementation if you have uber or lyft we could just be having a conversation between ourselves we talked about a place we want to go that becomes an active link we hit that uber sends a cab to pick us up and take us there we've never left facebook Messenger to do this at any point and kind of bringing it back to the subject where I started facebook Messenger they've recently released only in the u.s. at the moment what's called mmm is this personal assistant so it do you can ask it anything you can ask your questions about anything you can even get it things for you you can get it to all hours or order food you just ask it a question you have it as a contact in messenger and it does the stuff for you so could have been done a few years ago it was possible the technology was there but you would have to have a huge pool of human assistance answering all the queries what we're seeing now is this kind of hybrid system where at the moment humans are answering all the queries but all the copies are fed into their learning systems and they will learn what people ask for how they ask it and what the responses are and they will start training a system to do this by itself so over time the involvement of humans will drop and the involvement of AI will increase hugely so within five six years maybe eighty or ninety percent of the response of the queries will be answered by BOTS this provides this scale if Facebook we're going to roll this out to their 1.5 billion monthly active users they couldn't possibly do it with humans answering the questions they were have to do it with ai ai provides the scale that makes this stuff possible it also can actually take away the user interface altogether what they're calling know you I again this is possible through voice recognition between 2002 12 and 2015 google's voice recognition error rate dropped from twenty six percent to eight percent which is huge that's the difference from getting one word in for wrong to get in one wording 12 wrong that was in May last year and we probably think is probably hard again since that so it's probably about four percent rate which is incredible and by doing a Chinese company they say that they're that ten percent of their search queries are done through voice now and that's approximately 500 million voice search queries every single day going through baidu and it's enabled this series of interfaces where there's almost this series of services where there's almost no interface apart from him the result you've got Siri you've got google you've got Cortana and the biggest growing one the one to watch is Alexa or echo rather by amazon whose assistant is called alexa and this is just a fizzy object that sits in your house and just listens and you can ask you anything and it just reads back to you there's no UI to it at all they've recently released a whole new range of things that add on to this these little dots that can extend it there's a portable work you can take on holiday with you it's in your fire TV box and so you ask it questions and at first it was things like what's the weather like or play me some music or preferably buy me something from Amazon but nowadays they've started integrating things like uber as we saw before and even to do banking through bank of america you can do all this stuff talking to alexa ask it a question about your account it will give you back the information you work that you want and there's no UI involved at all and we're seeing a whole new range of home robot assistance coming out to do the same thing there's jebo or the slightly skanky looking open-source version called Mycroft but the point is that this stuff's now possible because of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence machine learning and having taken over now your home and your phone ai is going to come for your job there's recent research has showed that the more predictable your job is and the more it deals with numbers and words the more kind of open it is to being automated by services powered by a I if you deal largely with abstractions and there's a lot of variety in your work you're probably okay if you deal a lot with the pictures and people and your job kind of is sometimes sometimes variable but sometimes predictable maybe you should get a bit nervous but if you're down here and you're doing a lot of work that's exactly the same every day it's very predictable very easy to copy then there's a very good chance that you're going to become surplus to requirements in the next few years as an example of showing this in action in finance departments of big American companies since 2004 there's been a forty percent reduction in the number of jobs available because a lot of these systems have been automated already I asked the BBC how likely is it the I as a kind of digital professional would lose my job and they said well not likely to be honest that's about twenty one percent over the next 15 to 20 years my job could be done by a computer well they say not very likely but that means that one in five of us could see our roles automated within the next 15 to 20 years depending on what we I'm not saying we're all going to be fired I don't want to kind of alarm you that badly but we're going to see the job pool kind of shrink like the forty percent reduction in finance departments if you write copy that's very easy to write like this this is a report about earthquakes across the u.s. this is already written by a bot he used to be written by a person and there are services like automated insights which will jaques let you give them data and they will right port based on the data you give them we're starting to see this in news organizations kind of writing summaries Associated Press we're seeing those job start to go already if you're a coder don't think you're safe mit are working on a system called helium that can without having any prior knowledge of the code it's given you can understand how to optimize it and rewrite it to be better especially like old bad code they there is very experimental at the moment but it works they gave it some old photoshop plugins to look at and it increased the performance of these plugins between 75 and five hundred percent and we started to see rising services like these this is download me where if you just tell it a few things about yourself if you give it your social profiles your facebook address your twitter address whatever it creates a mobile app for you or app machine will create a mobile website for you given the same data or the grid will create a fully responsive website design for you just based on some in simple information that you give it and it doesn't have to be a lot of information at machine will just do something just given your facebook name and in 10 minutes you have a mobile site prepared for you people are criticizing this of course because you know at the moment these things are not great if you look at the sites that the grid output so far they're really kind of not that much more impressive than say a template a wordpress template but this is kind of where the mobile phone was 30 years ago this is one of the first mobile phones used in Britain and we're about this stage of using AI to lay out websites and things for us at the moment we can see the difference to what we have now we're going to see the difference between what's available in AI now and the same thing over the next 10 years and people say well a machine will just output the same stuff it's going to look identical to all every other website that's out there kind of like this but these are all designed and built by humans that to me looks like it could be very easily automated Travis that's right fantastic article the point is that he says we've kind of by just following trends and not really thinking about what we turned digital design into a human assembly line and to me a human assembly line sounds like it should fit right about there he says we've designed ourselves into an environment that's ripe for automation and you might be thinking well a bot couldn't do my job and I couldn't do my job and you're right but it can do bits of your job it can do little bits in isolation that eventually will start doing the job pool so at the moment you might be feeling like Lisa doll three nil down against alphago and without any hope in sight but there is a little bit hope in sight that's why I'm here I wouldn't stand up in front of you and just dash all your dreams especially the students amongst you're just starting your careers the big hope that we have there's a couple of things one of the main ones i think is that humans are unpredictable mushy bags of irrationality and emotion computers can never be that computers can never be subject to the whims of hormones and the whims of kind of i'm a bit bored today i'll try something different this creativity is a tool that we can use how many of you have seen deep dream before deep dream is like a visualization of what google's machines are basically thinking when they're going through this identification process it's a it's a tool for visualizing a neural network and while it's definitely clever it's kind of proof that computers do not have good taste good taste is essentially a human characteristic many of you have probably heard of this thing called the Turing test the Turing test is to see whether essentially a human can talk to a machine and not notice talking to a machine nobody's past it so far but people are getting close I think this is going to be passed very very very quickly because you can just game the system you can fool it you can haven't back it up with one of these learning systems are just having in there to make people think they're talking to a machine maybe you already do maybe if you go on to an automated support website and you're typing in something you might be talking to a bottle ready but there's another less well-known test called the Lovelace txt named after ada countess Lovelace who were some say the original computer programmer and then the Lovelace test the criteria is that the artificial agent has to produce an original program it could be music it could be a poem but something that it was not engineered to produce and it must be able to reproduce it and the people who hated that agent must not be able to explain how it did it so the idea is that this test is impossible for computers to pass under in who's a guy who's a major player in I in the development of a I used to be at Google is now by he says that teaching innovation and creativity is probably the best chance we have for the future this is fan huy phan huy was the European champion of go and about six months ago be a little bit longer he played google's alphago machine and he lost five nil he got the wiped the floor with him but instead of being kind of disheartened he said well I want to join your team I want to learn how to play against this machine I want to help him become better so he's now part of the Alpha go team when he was beaten he was number 63 in the world in the world 633 and after playing against alpha go for about six months he's now up in the high 300s so he's become a much much better alfa GO player by playing against this machine on with dips machine Miss Lee in 1997 Garry Kasparov played the IBM computer deep blue at chess again they said deep blue should never be able to beat the world champion sorry in 1996 he played it first and Kasparov won but then they asked for a rematch in 1997 and this time Kasparov lost they proved they learned from him and they program the machine to make it even better to beat the world champion but again instead of gain disheartened and giving he saw the opportunity in this and he created what's called advanced chess or sent or chess where it's like doubles of man plus machine against man plus Tina based on that there's now what's called a freestyle chess where you cup over from a machine from a you can use a reference team to help you basically against people who have the same advantage so since Kasparov was beaten in 1997 there are now twice as many chess grandmasters in the world as they were then so people have been made smarter by these they've been made more clever they've been made more able they've used them to enhance themselves an AI is a tool that we can use to provide better services to our customers we're going to learn how to do that we're going to have to learn new method frameworks new scaffolds new templates it's going to be challenging but the advantage is that i said earlier artificial intelligence is becoming very good very quickly the big advantage of that also is that it's becoming very available very quickly we met earlier again Watson and we saw the introduction about Watson this morning and we saw the introduction to Watson service now Watson has Watson has cost X many millions of euro of dollar and taking a long time to put develop it's now available to us using a web interface that we can access through node or Python or Java that will sit and make our systems much much smarter and as they said earlier i really suggest you go along to their booth and take a look and ask what Watson can do for you because it is very smart and it is very very surprisingly easy to get set up and running but they're not the only game in town Microsoft have project Oxford which sits on there as your platform does the kind of similar stuff so it has computer vision API is it has language understanding speech ap is mostly for window Android SDKs at the moment they were they're planning a JavaScript SDK soon and simply released their cloud vinton API which understands the images you give it they're probably leading in terms of how smart their system is for image recognition they've got the best hardware they've got the best people and they've got the best data I gave it this picture of me recently and it returned I give it to all the systems and they all correctly identified that it was a person in a forest but Google's went just that one step further and actually describes the type of forest it was to me so it's not forest it's a temperate broadleaf and mixed forest the reason google services are so much smarter as well as their software is they have so much data they've been indexing the web for what 20 years now they have loads of loads and loads of information data in the first century is like oil in the 18th century this is what drives our systems and we've barely scratched the surface of using it yet google also is this thing called tensor flow which is not so much consumer-facing it's very low level it's what powers all their learning services and they've made it available for nothing just go out there and download it it's in a docker you can run it in Python they giving it away for nothing because it's not this that's valuable it's all of the thousands and millions hot thousands of millions of pieces of data that they've been indexing for the last year's that's what's valuable in this not the software but you don't have to use any of these big services if you don't want to there are a lot of smaller startups that encourage devs to get involved and to use them things like a meta mind has really good image recognition and text understanding tools clarify have been around for a few years they're probably of the kind of Independence they're the ones that have the best machine vision tools at the moment they're also working really well on understanding the content of videos not just photos so if you want to upload videos to them and actually see kind of live analysis of what's happening in the videos these guys have got good tools wit are used to be an indie they got bought by Facebook recently last year but they're still free and open and available for you to use they're not kind of been adopted into Facebook services they're still an open service I like them because they're interface is so simple and because they've got really wide range platforms they work literally everywhere soundhound does anybody know SoundHound they're like a music recognition tool you can if you play a song and downtown little song is playing well they've been developing this for 10 years and they're using that technology now to do speech understanding and do it very very very well they could excuse me they can understand really complex sentences you can speak to them for about half an hour and gets pretty much everything apia I also really easy to use text understanding and voice search tool again lots of different tools whatever platform you work on you can use these guys they've also recently introduced a published to slack but so you can just create services that extend slack just by using these guys and Riaan fer are a new service just set up in London which do allow you to set up these conversational interfaces and it powers the dialogue below it emotion AI I haven't used these yet but they've just got this really simple drag-and-drop interface to build this stuff there's not this there's not even a lot of coding skill and quite required to get involved in doing this one and the best way for you to learn about this stuff is the best is the way I think that I learned about to just play with it just give it a go there's loads of people out there doing fun interesting stuff with these things this guy took Google's tensorflow and he fed it the script of every episode of friend has ever been and this script started learning how to do episodes of friends this is an actual extract extract you can imagine Chandler's well I proposed to my shoe I'm all the dinner enters and Monica says happy Gandalf you know it doesn't make sense it's writing it you can recognize it as kind of in the structure that is working on if you kept feeding this through networks finding it it would start making some kind of weird since been working on recreating the voice of Shakespeare and recreating the voice of famous authors and poets by just feeding them everything they ever this is another funny man this guy took kind of two systems so he got one system to try to understand the content of a photo and then with the other system he fed it either the text of romance novels or taylor swift lyrics and then he got the text to tried to describe what was happening in the image this image of some romantic camps was described like this by Taylor Swift I mean oh you i'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan but you could imagine a probably something writing something like that and it does kind of it recognizes that there are animals and that they're definitely that one loves the other very much it recognizes that well do what we did and just build a bot we used Watson's dialogue system and we put it into a telegram interface telegrams another messaging app which has a really good open API a lot of the other ones have closed api's telegrams really good for experimenting with and we got a t-rex or what we got information about a t-rex a Tyrannosaurus Rex from all across the web and we kind of created this bot with the personality of a Tyrannosaurus Rex or rather it answered questions about Tyrannosaurus Rex the fact is it's not you know I'm not trying to impress you with the fact that we made this because it's really quite them the thing was we got the software the software was in place in one day and then the next four days we just spent kind of tweaking the results that it was given it's so easy to get this stuff up and running the tools are there right now for you to go out and start building and start implementing it we're seeing a lot of sites experiment now we're using things The North Face have kind of created this conversational interface for personalized recommendations you can do this stuff on their site already you could do it through like a drop-down menu by highlighting a load of different links and filters but they've just made it really easy by asking you questions or how about what's empowered dating so there this is kind of really trying to learn people tell it much more herbs and what some builds a book highly detailed profile of the person and ice to match them together ai is going to be coming to a lot more product soon it's becoming a cornerstone of the things we built this is going to be interesting for us and the cool I think of all the kind of arms of design we have to consider at the moment visual design motion design into design experience service in motion I think we're going to have to start adding intelligence design and we have to have to start adding conversation design if we're creating these systems that talk to you in a natural way we need to make sure the tone of voice is right imagine going up to your back and kind of ordering from your bank it starts asking you about the football and then goes yes so listen Sorry mate we're not going to be able to do that mortgage it's not the way you want your bank to talk to you get that wrong it's going to make people very very very annoyed and it also needs to be appropriate and happen at the appropriate times we've seen before what happens when someone tries to interrupt you at the inappropriate moment and the same problems we've had in the past trying to build the things we do now will still be there for the new methods of interaction old problems still a plot as well as new ones this was quite funny recently NPR public radio in America did a program about the Amazon echo and the people at home who had an Amazon echo when they were listening to that program echo got activated by the person talking about it on the radio and turn up the thermostat and all kinds of other weird secondhand effects because it being mentioned people who buy samsung tvs samsung have like a voice activation voice control what people realized after they started using that everything you said got sent off to Samsung's servant and then evaluated by human operators so although most of the time you were just saying quote you know change the channel you could say something like change the channel oh by the way my bank account numbers one two three four five six and it would pick up all that stuff at the same time and people would be reading that if data is the new oil then privacy is the new climate change this was a big one recently mattel launched their first AI powered barbie called hello Barbie and it would listen to your child and it would speak back but again the same problem that things that you were saying the things that your child said to Bobby would be sent off to third-party cloud servers and they would be evaluated by other people and when people found this out of course they were shocked they were appalled there's kind of no way to do that stuff at the moment without this cloud power behind it we have to be really respectful of the things of people's homes that we're putting these things into people's homes and security as well this is a doll called my friend Kayla my friend kayla was a kind of a smart doll and it was attached to your phone via bluetooth connection and people worked out you could hijack the Bluetooth connection and you could make Kayla say things that she really wasn't supposed to be saying at all so just finishing up so this is a guy called Jeff Dean who works at what's called the Google brain Google brain is Google's AI that's powering everything they do now he says it's going to enable us to build new and interesting products that wouldn't have been possible before and maybe in areas that we're not really working in today the kind of the ready availability of deep learning happened so quickly that we haven't really had time to stop and think about it it's all happened in three years it's been incredible a year and a half ago I wouldn't have been able to build any of this stuff where I would have had to build custom services and spend a lot of money on setting up the stack find it that now these are consumer facing products and they're very very very cheap or in some cases free it's happened it's improved suddenly and it is going to take some jobs at the industry I think unless we adapt to it but it offers us a whole load of new opportunities and it can make what you do better I want to finish just wouldn't one more quote and this is from Lisa dole the former champion world champion of go and he said playing against go made him question human creativity when he saw the moods that alpha go was making he wondered whether all along he'd been actually playing it right maybe he'd been approaching it completely the wrong way and it made him realize that he has to study go more and I think that's what we have now at this early opportunity to get involved in startling start you know what it can do for us and allowing us to make kind of new and interesting services thank you very much for listening I don't have time for quest do we have time for questions I don't think so if not i'll be around all day come up and see me in buy me a coffee and I'll talk to you for hours about this stuff it's not a problem at all cheers
