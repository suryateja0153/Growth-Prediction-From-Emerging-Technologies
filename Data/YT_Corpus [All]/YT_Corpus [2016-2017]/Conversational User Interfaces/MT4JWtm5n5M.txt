 how even going 18 months 18 months and now you're all this it's crazy do you ever imagine that 60 people in a month and you're growing still we are yeah so where we'll be at a hundred and twenty people by the end of this year needless to say Toronto startup connected lab is doing very well plunging into the world of virtual and augmented reality and chatbots seen as the future of messaging like Facebook's M introduced just this week it's a chatbot don't worry if you don't quite get it yet we got you covered there's a lot of tasks that we do every day that it would be great if artificial intelligence was at a level that it could help understand what we want before we want it it knows where we are it knows what tasks we might be doing next Siri what's the weather like in Toronto think Siri Apple's talking assistant but way more advanced it doesn't just know about stuff he knows about you don't try not at home I'm David common this is world report let me give you an example from my own routine it could start with something as simple as a message to my producer hey Sean we should chat about thoughts sure but I don't have much time now here's where a bot could actually enter the conversation it knows my calendar knows how much time I have knows where I am and so it could pop in here with a question would you like me to preorder your usual sure and tell Sean I'm on my way now she's also see what's on the agenda for today you have a meeting with the National at 11:00 a.m. today is also your anniversary oh okay well I forgot about that one but that's okay because the bought actually can learn it knows your habits it knows what your friends are knows what they like because it watches their social feeds bots are made by and represent companies so that flower story it has one so does the restaurant the board also stores your credit card information so all those transactions will they get paid for like the tea thanks very much Sean from a man nice shirt ah it's not this again like we need but coordinator wardrobe oh yeah probably anyway what's exciting about pots is actually that building a chatbot is faster and cheaper than building a full-fledged application and so in a way chatbots helped democratize the playing field so that a local grocer or a local business can quickly build a bot and have new types of conversations with our customers and the folks here at connected lab can help that small grocer or Google they're clients of all sizes and challenged by how to get a computer to understand what humans mean when we talk so translating helping to understand you know how do we break down a sentence that comes in either by by a text or via voice how do we extract kind of the important parts of that sentence to understand what what's the user trying to get at is there a world in which the bot takes someone's job bots are absolutely going to be replacing some jobs but we believe that they're going to be creating other jobs newer jobs and more interesting less clerical jobs and that's really the promise of bots and chat BOTS for not just employers but all of us for connected labs own employees a bot is also the gateway to employment many of them are the young veterans of Tesla and Facebook seeking out the big opportunities that come with such a fresh firm step one to get hired he's an interview with a bot on top of that I would add that by having a bot do that first screen or test it removes any bias we might have when we first look at a resume and that's it's really hard to not have bias so the Wake word is Alexa so you say hey Alexa and then you can just make the team also works with Amazon which makes the echo this one is called Alexa it has a built-in chat bot to run your calendar write a shopping list even listen to the news here's your flash briefing in NPR news from tuning NPR Alexa you're broken you need CBC sorry thanks for telling me I want to get used to this soon she'll know you even better than you know yourself David common CBC News Toronto
