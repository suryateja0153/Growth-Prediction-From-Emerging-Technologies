 hi guys I'm Ron and today we're going to start working on the new product we're developing at the new school the designers proposal tool so I've been sharing with you over the last week our Provost so far on working on the new product doing customer interviews to validate that we're working on a real problem discovering that proposals is a really major point for designers when working with clients so we're going to try to create a tool that's really going to make it easier and create better proposals for them and yesterday I've been doing some competition research to see how other companies are trying to solve this problem and today I'm working on the user experience thinking about what is the right process and gonna try to do some mock-ups so that next we can show them to potential customers and get the feedback from them to understand if I'm going in the right direction so the approach I'm going to take with this new project is called conversational UI it's it's a new you know thing that's been discussed in the design community that the future interfaces is actually a conversation something like Siri or something like text messaging where you don't have to learn a new tool you just write or respond in your natural language and the computer or the software understands you we kind of did something similar with two that we've created last year that's called how much should I charge we've asked you a question about the project and the client and therefore helped you understand how much money you should be charging on that project and I'm gonna try to evolve that approach into like food proposal creator so I've been thinking about the flow and process this morning and I'm gonna try to start moking it up in sketch this part of the process I'm usually not even taking care of you know fonts and collars and stuff like that I just want to get my ideas down and when I'll show them to you know perspective clients next week and see that this direction is even valid then I'll start really refining the design anyway we're gonna take a lunch break now all right back to work you can sketch alright guys I want to share with you how things turned out so again this is not by any means a complete design it's just the first flow to give a concept of how the tool would look like so I can get feedback from people to see if they would use something like that and get the a yaller developer into you know a frame of mind of how this tool would look so he can start you know researching on how to build it or do the infrastructure so let's get into it has I've been saying I've designed the interface to kind of look like a chat or a conversation so and I was chose to go with Lee or my partner and he's saying hi my name is New York I'm here to help you create the best proposal ever we have about seven question we need to go over it will take about 55 minutes cool and then you say yeah let's go or no I'd rather spend hours doing it alone so if you say let's go he tell you wait I don't even know your name that's awkward what's your name and you type your name so you see in a conversational UI you get a lot of personal tone of voice and that's it makes it more personal rather than having just you know like a field with what's your name that's like generic so I put in my name Ron and he tells me nice to meet you Ron what is the project you need a proposal for I can choose from a variety of project that was supported in the first version I will choose a web design and it'll tell me cool what app type website is it it's a blog ok give me a little bit let's talk about your client who are they their private person of a small medium business or large court in this case in this example small medium business what is the company name don't worry it's a private and you enter company name who is the contact person name you fill it in and then this a little bit of an interface he tells you okay it's time we talk about the money here's what I'm thinking but I don't know you very well yet so feel free to adjust this how long it's going to take you to complete the project what's your hourly rate and the base price around that it's not the final price because we have other you know variables we take into consideration what we're pricing but that's a base point to start with we're going to build pricing packages around that so once the user finds something that fits he clicks looks good let's continue then he chooses some characteristics we call it superpowers to define you know how he's unique I'd say I chose three looks good show me the proposal and then we are going over to the proposal again the main value of our tool will be that we write great content for you and then you can you know edit it customize it but the heavy lifting of writing the copy is done by a so obviously I haven't written the great copy today this is just for demo purposes but we will write the great copy here so you'll be able to either you know edit stuff like changing your logo and fonts and colors export the proposal as PDF or send it directly from the tool this is kind of you know you can close this chat and a sidebar to really edit and work on the text so basically that's it that's what I've been doing today I have an interview coming up I might already show it to somebody to hear what their thoughts are I'm going to send it to my partners to get feedback from them and next week we're gonna continue working on that love those days when you create something from enough you know in the morning and yesterday I only had this vague idea of how this is going to look like now it already exists obviously there's a lot of things missing from the design yet I even didn't touch the visual language yet but it doesn't matter something already exists in the world and that's very exciting that's all for today I hope you had a great day catch you guys tomorrow
