 our next speaker is Adrian Adrian comes from Zurich he is a UX designer UI designers a speaker a writer he will talk about animation which perfectly fits with the pneumonias talk Adrian works as an independent designer and currently he he is designed thinking at Google and works on projects such as Adwords and Google Maps Adrian the stages are so dope I've done Novi Sad or as we say in Switzerland with the talk no be salt so today I'd like to share a few things with you that I learned about designing micro interactions among others I'd like to talk about how we can use motion in meaningful ways so let's initialize this presentation we animate yeah right so so you know ever since I started in its field I had a complicated relationship with animation because on one hand I always really liked it but I never quite understood why I liked it so much so I started asking around and I asked why do you care about animation and most people would tell me for them it's about creating delightful experiences but what makes an experience actually delightful is it when it's effortless like loading new tweets on Twitter or is it when it's seamless when data is automatically loaded so I think it's when people experience flow when they are involved in an experience as a whole because when you think about it interaction models like pull-to-refresh they really just keep us in the flow of an app so a lot of research has been done on the concept of flow and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi a great man with a great name defined flow as the holistic experience that people feel when they act with total involvement now when I read his book he also write about how people feel when they experience flow and it turns out that those people find this mental state extremely rewarding they find it highly enjoyable they get a sense of inner clarity and ecstasy and when I thought about it the more I realized that pretty much sums up how I want people to feel people who get in touch with my design now unfortunately not all animation contributes to flow a while back I was looking for plug-ins for sublime text my text editor and as I started scrolling to find great content I saw this I called him social media buttons on crack it's a bunch of hyperactive jerks they're waiting to be clicked and if you think about it it's a really evil technique because we are evolutionarily programmed to look at things that move so we can't help ourselves but look at those funny little buttons and then we have this article by the verge and the verge talks about fanboys of different brands and in this very article it's about Apple and as we soon as soon as you start scrolling you get these animations here you can see how these bubbles animate in and at first this is a really interesting experience but at some point it becomes really predictable and as soon as it becomes predictable you will not focus on it anymore so let's do that again as you can see in the beginning it's interesting but then it becomes predictable so much in fact that you probably didn't realize that I had a bar of chocolate here with me so you know we also have questionable animations animations where we think what did the designer think about what was his idea here for instance here on credit suisse you tap on client login and then you have to show more button show more show less let's do this again throw more show less and this interaction should probably be illegal now and then we have the other guys who tell us that we should use the twelve Walt Disney animation principles and apply it to UI design and what initially looks like this certainly looks like this now I don't know about you but imagine you would have to enter your credit card data in that window it's not exactly trustworthy it feels like this interface is made out of soap and bubbles will turn up in something so I'm not saying that knowing those principle isn't a good thing but it's also really about asking yourself how far you really want to go so animation I find is it this example here really interesting because it shows how much animation animation can actually convey think of it as body language we're not necessarily aware of all the subtleties of body language but it still communicates so much so aiming for delight is not even enough because today's delight is tomorrow's expectation I think it's about creating smart interaction and that what that's what creates the light in the first place so I believe that in order to build smarter interactions we need to start thinking in spatial terms when we navigate websites or apps we're often taken from one screen to the next from one context to the other but during this whole journey of navigation we rarely consciously think about how these different screens are actually related to each other and when it comes to designing digital experiences it's alluring to think that we're liberated from the limitations of the real world but as it turns out nothing could be farther from the truth George Miller who is one of the fathers of cognitive psychology already observed in 1968 that we perceive our surroundings in spatial terms so when we navigate places or cities we build mental models just like when we navigate on screens so when you're visiting New York for instance you orient yourself on the Empire State Building and then you can basically find your position on the map relative to this building and the people people do the same on screen so in designing when you design on screen a landmark that's what they call it could be a logo it could be Cirque it could be navigation and if those different things are too different from one break point to the next it often creates a disconnect and that's why responsive design it's so important that those screens are not too different but the most basic example that probably comes to mind it's connecting your screen your Mac basically to an external screen now when you connect your Mac to an external screen and your Mac is physically on the left but you configure it to be on the right I hope I got the directions right now because this is the other way around it becomes a completely irritating experience even though you know that what you technically did is possible you can't make sense of the information anymore and that just shows how much spatial thinking is ingrained in our minds when we look at our phone we see a screen filled with apps but what's happening in our mind is different we see a finite number of contagious screens that are aligned to each other and we know that you can swipe through them so now it would be technically easily feasible to restart this interface when you scroll when you swipe to the right then you could always create a loop and start over but Apple didn't do that now why didn't they do that because that's not how reality works no matter how much caffeine you had you will not just arbitrarily skip a place and go back to the beginning you have to do a conscious effort about it and that's what makes this interface work so well now Apple took the concept of spaces to the extreme when they introduced Mission Control and Mission Control made multi desktop so much more understandable because it's highly visual but it's not always easy to get it right let's take this up as an example one of the many imitations of I a writer and as you start writing here you can see it's pretty simple in the beginning so let's tap on that hamburger icon in the upper left corner cool we have a side panel okay wait let's do that again oh there's a second side panel oh there's even another one and another one and there are two others so as you can see this becomes really irritating because you don't know where these information lives where do those information spaces live we kind of lost connection so I came up with five criteria that I believe makes animation both functional and delightful we will talk about orientation about responsiveness about time easing and eventually about personality so let's give those icons some meaning let's start with orientation so motion establishes relationships in an interface imagine this simple page here with the navigation on top and let's imagine someone would now tap on contact as you can see something happened but we also don't really know for sure what actually happened and the problem is the blessing and the curse of navigation is that it can literally take it from one instant to another - to somewhere else and you have no idea what just happened so moving from one information space to another takes a certain amount of time and in interaction design we can represent time with motion so really motion becomes the glue that connects those different information spaces so let's have a look at the same example again but animate it this time so it happened contact and now you see what happens you know that this is a scrolling interface you know that you just missed out on content and when you miss out on content it's not an accident anymore it becomes a decision because you can see what you're missing out so let's have a look at the real world example here this is Ryu Finn one of the most popular WordPress themes at its time and when you obviously it has a hamburger icon so when you tap on that hamburger icon let's see what happens and and just like in the example before we don't really know what happened so I played a little bit with the JavaScript of this theme and I just and did some small adjustments now when you tap on the icon this time you can see what actually happens the website Scrolls down so in order to leave the menu you actually have to scroll now is this a good interaction model that's another question but the animation definitely makes it on in btris so you understand what's happening so motion is in many ways mais not just the detail it can actually make or break the experience more feigning morphing an icon from one state to another isn't just the delight detail it's crucial to understand what's happening next when you tap search on quartz comm you get this huge blinking cursor and this huge blinking cursor is kind of like a friend saying hey come type something and friendly and that's not bad for a blinking line of pixels right and it's just because of this simple animation that it communicates so much so motion creates orientation through relationships we've come a long way in interaction design if you think about the early days we always use those nasty pop-up windows for everything whether it's a Settings panel or an update panel or whatever and then we started to understand that there is a better way to do it a way that maintains context so today we seamlessly transition from one state to the next like in this example tapping on the watch opens up its detailed page and you cannot observe it that's something that Google material design guidelines strongly encourage and these concepts have become more and more refined the more we learned about them for instance this example here is from the first material design spec and when you tap on an image you can see how it opens that image from a side panel this was later replaced by this one as you can see the new screen did you actually see it okay so the new screen now appears from the origin of the interaction and that creates a much better connection between the users action and the next screen so animation can also be used to change to fix change blind as for instance how do you create a relationship between this item here and the item in the upper right corner so what the guys here did is you add this thing to the brew list I'm a huge coffee geek obviously and then it goes in the upper right corner and it establishes a relationship even though you wouldn't necessarily know that this goes there you can create this relationship so lately everyone is talking about conversational interfaces chat BOTS everything is everywhere right to the point where it'd actually be kind became kind of scary so I asked the question on LinkedIn what's your plan after chatbots takeover and UI designers are no longer needed and then Rafa leader its director of product management and Google simply answered fire you and you know that wasn't exactly the answer I was hoping for but it really had some truth in it right where is where do I fit into the picture when conversational interfaces would take over and that's so instead of being worried and scared I decided to try an experiment I made my website conversational and this is how it looks so when you go to my website you will see this scroll if you don't feel like talking and if you don't scroll it will actually start talking to you so in this case you can see how those bubbles animate in and those animations were incredibly important because those animation made the product feel like an actual conversation whereas if those things will just pop in it wouldn't feel like a real product you would think okay nice idea but it doesn't really work and so in this case what can you do here so you can now choose from two options you can show you can either choose tell me more or you can get in touch so let's tap on tell me more let's tap on tell me more so this is actually really interesting what happened here did that animation here was incredibly painful to build it was really tricky but it turns out it was also really important because this very animation changed the way people felt about the conversation so lots of people ask me which natural language processing technology did you use to build that chat bot which was ridiculous because it's just a scripted conversation but as users were able to observe how their interaction affected the conversation they believed that those were really their own words and that's why so many people ask me that question so animation cannot just create orientation it can literally change the way we feel about an interface all right so let's talk about responsiveness so in UI design a responsive interface is an interface that immediately reacts through a user's input it can take advantage of motion to do so now Microsoft recently announced their new anticipatory design technology this technique uses proximity sensors in the phone to make the device more responsive so let's check it out and actually I'll apologize in advance if it's too loud and I also apologize in advance if it doesn't work which clearly seems to be the case but we have a back-up plan so let's do that here do we have any sound here hmm gotcha I already did it still doesn't work let me just audio audio device HDMI yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so let's see if that works still doesn't work all right he started off so well I was so hopeful and then it just didn't work yeah all right you know what okay let's do this that's pretty awesome I think I think that's pretty awesome because it allows us it will allow us to build new kinds of interfaces once this thing actually becomes available and so let's see how we can get back to the presentation so technology in browsers now enables us to do crazy things we can now have access to ambient light sensors and change a website's design based on the user's ambient light condition and technology in general allows us to do all those amazing things but sometimes we can get away with simple tricks which have just as much impact for instance if you have incredibly bad signal and you send a message on Twitter it always happens immediately now how do they do that now the reason it works so well is because they will always animate the mesh the message just like it would actually have sent already but what's happening in the background is actually a different story is this playing yeah so what's happening in the background is a different story because the interface only interrupts you if the message actually fails to deliver and that creates a much better flow because you can already start typing your next message and that the interface will not block you but animation can also be dynamic scrolling through an interface can adapt it to react to changes we see this every day when we scroll through Safari for instance when you scroll down in Safari the interface becomes smaller and as you scroll up again the interface becomes taller because it indicates a changing context you want to do something else now and all those small little adjustments can really add up if you go to techcom they have a similar pattern as you saw as you start scrolling down you see the video in the upper left corner so if you want to read the comments or the script you can always have a glance at the video so you can keep the context so we can also use animation to progressively show content when needed this is the float label pattern which is pretty famous by now but what's so interesting about it I think is the way it works because one of the problems of placeholder text is that once you start writing you actually overwrite the placeholder so once the user is finished typing in his data or her data she has no more way to control her own to validate or her own inputs so in this case what we do we seamlessly animate the label in and the animation here is really important because it reinforces the model that this is the same data without the animation you would just think it's nice but this actually creates a seamless connection between the label and the placeholder and then we have this last example here which I think is just amazing it's from whatsapp and when you want to send a voice message on whatsapp the interface is incredibly responsive so you tap on the voice icon and you can see this subtle slide to cancel animation that explained to you how the interface works so let's do that and then you have the microphone icon which goes into the trash so this animation we just saw is not just an animation it's a tale of a voicemail message a tale we remember a tale will tell to our grandchildren and then we have time animation and movement is all about time and ironically we perceive time to be something special as well when we talk about time we talk about it like it's something special we say things like oh that's still in front of me or uh that's behind me or when we think about days we say yesterday was here whereas tomorrow is here and today is right here right so when we draw a timeline Dover's those of us who speak English will put the past on the left those of us who speak Arabic will put the left the past at the future the past on the right and those of us who speak Chinese will put the past at the bottom and so since we perceive time as something spatial it also has a few implications in the way we design interfaces for instance when we move from left to right in an interface it subconsciously communicates that you're progressing towards your destination and that's why most really navigations work that way because you can feel that you make progress if this will be the opposite around for most people it would feel strange so but there's more to it duration can also affect interpretation so research shows that we perceive duration in different stages for instance 100 milliseconds feels like something is reacting instantly one second feels like you could still feel the delay but you're kept in the flow whereas ten seconds is the users average attention limit so what's the ideal duration in terms of animation then the sweet spot for most animation will usually be in between 100 and 300 milliseconds and if you go higher you better make sure you have a good reason because if motion slows down the experience you're really doing it wrong there's nothing more annoying than a designer that forces you to look at their little animation over and over it actually makes you delete the app but it also depends a little bit on context for instance when you go to New York 90% of all the walk signal buttons there do absolutely nothing but they're all still there now why are they still there because it feels good it feels good to be in control or at least it feels good to the idea of being in control feels good so motion can do the same thing motion can affect time perception for instance frequency variation is known to affect people's perception of time so when a Brock when a progress bar is animated it can change the way we feel about it ribbons moving in the opposite direction of the proper progress creates a very intense illusion where as people think that the application is actually loading 10% faster than it really is but time can also change the way we feel about features when bloggers relaunched their site they had the classic traditional signup flow and at the end of the signup flow they had a create block button and people are obviously very excited to push that button right so what happened when people push that button well what happened is that it would immediately create the block and then people were really unhappy well that was so fast how is that possible something must be wrong here so what did they do they introduced nothing but the page that would show this animation for a couple of seconds and then suddenly people loved it people loved it because they felt like ah I'm really glad blogger is doing the heavy lifting for me I could never do that so duration can in many ways add significance to our interfaces so easing is another crucial ingredient of good motion design the way you staged and easier animations can change the way what they express but somehow this always reminds me of what my friend from ia once set he said that out of all hand throwable out of all hand throwable things socks have the most unpredictable trajectory that's from Lorien greedy greedy no creative technologist very wise tweet and I think what you really wanted to say is that socks is interesting to throw around because it follows the laws of nature the laws of gravity and physics their trajectory is always different now unfortunately computers couldn't care less about gravity so without some love animation will most probably look like this robotic boring and most of all unnatural and that's where motion curves come into play so what are motion curves so motion curves define how an animation behaves over time and my friend is Aurra who is an After Effects instructor always told me that I should imagine that the motion curve is like somebody snowboarding down a hill and I'm from Switzerland so I really like that idea you know so let's see how this looks like let's send someone down the hill with a flat motion curve so what happens here yeah that was terrible it's it's linear it feels unnatural it's pretty bad so in this way what what do we do and that's when we usually start fiddling around with the with the animation curve right so we will pick this and we probably want this to be faster in the beginning and slower in the end so we just drag this down and see how this looks now let's look at the same thing again but with a different motion curve now as you can see I cheated a little bit I created this zoom in effect for the extra drama but you get the picture and the animation is still not perfect but it takes a lot of time to do this and that's exactly the point because good motion design takes time there's no way that we can great create great animation without investing a lot of time so if the motion curve isn't right the animation won't delight now I'd really like you to repeat this if the motion curve isn't right awesome Thanks so why is is important because in the real world things don't move in perfect unison all and not all animation grabs our attention in the same way so these two squares here they have the exact same animation duration but let's look at this for a second and see what happens as you can see you first focus on the right square but then at the end you can't help ourselves but be focusing on the left square why is this happening because the left square motion is more dramatic at the end and we can use this knowledge to orchestrate animations on the screen so if you have many things that need to move around in your interface when you go from one state to the other always make sure that the last element on the screen that is animating is where you want the user to focus it's a simple trick so again if the motion curve isn't right the animation won't delight I really like that so and then we have personality and personality comes at the very end of the design process when you start thinking about personality you really want to think about what you want your brand to say do you want your brand to be playful or do you want it to be very serious I was really fortunate to having met Don lincei last year and Don lincei was the senior vice president of Apple back in the days when they released the very first version of OS 10 and he told me that the the idea of always 10 aqua was that it should feel liquid that it should feel like water that it should be lickable as Steve Jobs would say and what's interesting so let's I let you check it out yourself here so you can hear the audience reaction and that 16 years ago so when people saw this animation for the first time they didn't think that was possible that was huge developers developers must have hated the designer who had the idea about this animation imagine you had to write this that's it's insane but it also shows how much Apple already at the time invested in motion design so animation can also be used for rewards for instance every time I have inbox zero in my inbox app I get rewarded with this very animation it's a small animation it's just free maybe four seconds long but it creates a delight it creates a lot of delight and every time I swipe through my last email I'm looking forward to seeing it so each time I see it it reinforces the fact that I should keep my inbox low and that's exactly what animation can do I actually use this quite a lot in my work so when you when you have like difficult things that users need to accomplish you can reward them with animation it can make the experience more delightful and when Facebook paper and I was announced people went crazy Facebook papers motion design made it stand out from all the other apps at its time it was extremely fluid it was extremely responsive perhaps even a little too responsive sometimes um and paper had good intentions with its motion design however we all know how it turned out it wasn't exactly a success and if an application looks beautiful and even works well but there's no substantial benefit in using it then animation will not save our asses so animation can support the experience but animation is not the experience and then we have animations we just won't forget animation can be really emotional in this case when you enter your password on orede middle IO you can see that the owl covers its eyes so that you can safely type your password well then we have the art quest the art quest is a proposal for an app that I found on dribble for for boats and the loading indicator here works perfectly fine in the context of boats so personality isn't the experience it enhances it so we've covered a few points here today we started to talk about orientation how spatial the spatial perception of our environment can change the way we think about animation we talked about responsiveness how animation isn't just static but that it can be dynamic and dynamically improve the experience we talked about time how we can use animation to change the perception of time we also talked about easing how we can use easing to grab users attention to orchestrate focus and then we finally eventually we talked about personality how we can use motion to give a product a soul so I think combining all of these principles allows us to create animations that support rather than break the experience animation is still a relatively young topic but it's now happening with browsers tough to have a really sophisticated animation engine today we can create all sorts of things we always ever dreamed of but it also comes with a lot of responsibilities so hopefully some of these principles we discussed here today where is useful to you and hopefully you'll think about them the next time you add motion to your project thank you so much okay thank you this is really really awesome so let's start with the question who will start first first question gets a bar of chocolate okay come on I don't want take that chocolate yeah it doesn't count probably okay questions okay can you just you don't want the chocolate okay that's great the next that creates a lot of motivation for the next person so I just repeat the question let me know if that if I understood that right when do you add when do you draw the line to add motion to your project yeah so that's actually a good question so one of the things about adding motion to your project is that it's also really dangerous because when you add motion too early and you show this to a project manager they were like oh that's awesome and they completely forget what this is actually all about so they will not look at the data anymore they will not look at the navigation anymore they will just think that's awesome that's a great UI designer so don't add motion too early I think I'm actually really glad you asked that question and but to make it a little easier I think like tools like keynote for instance the presentation software is really a great start to to animate because it forces you to make animations that are not like incredibly detailed you can get the basics right you can communicate the basic idea of the animation whereas you get into detail later on with more capable tools like framer like principle like After Effects even if you want to go nuts but that's pretty much the idea was that more or less awesome you deserve it I'm glad I'm glad that's the first role I would have - it is I will I will come and get it back so a friend of mine runs the design studio in Zurich and he actually got the exact same question about research when do you how do you do you show the client that you do use a research and he said no we just do it it's part of the process it's part of the budget and whether you want to tell the client that you spend a lot of time animating and interfaces it's your choice I think but I also think that you need to work with clients who want to who want you to create great work and if those clients are ready to if you get a budget that's reasonable it allows you to do great work if you don't have a budget that allows you to do great work then you have to ask yourself whether you actually want to do it right so in my case I really try it very hard sometimes you know like it's a freelancer I think it's important that most most people they they build by the hour right so billing by the hour is really simple because you can just as you work we send an invoice at the end of the month everyone is sometimes happy but what's intercept do sometimes is if this project is important to me and hopefully that's always the case when you're working with clients then I actually sometimes just spend time working on these animation things and I don't even I don't even bill it I don't even write it I don't even note it down somewhere I just do it because I care about the project but there's I guess there's no best answer to that too much animation yeah okay so the question is so the question is the gentleman here is a developer and he has to work with designers and he has to argue with them how can you stop designers from going crazy about animation it's a good question it's a good question I guess one of the things you could do is you just keep asking them why you keep asking them why as long as you can until they run out of arguments because asking them why as long as you can will force them to come up with really good reasons why they actually chose to animate this interface in the first place and if they don't come up with great answers it's a really destroying process because they can literally feel how they're running out of arguments and I think that's a technique that works really well and another thing that you could do is to tell them are you insane but that's my approach I don't know it probably doesn't work for anyone let me know how it went maybe start with the first approach I will ask the last question I guess I'm interested so when you finished with your animation it's not like you have to look at it a thousand times and you'll be sure that that's the good animation how are you tested how are you how do you get to that point that you're sure that that's a good animation are you letting other people give you a comment or or how do you say this animation is is great it's awesome it's useful it's not too long it's not too short I mean are you testing it alone or you're letting other people to test it yeah so so when I work so on my project at Google Google has an extensive like testing process where we test like where all the interfaces get tested so obviously this is a really nice situation to be in because you can test your animation you can see if it works now as a freelancer what I often do is what I call socially awkward research so you go to a coffee shop somewhere and then you ask some people for an opinion and they don't have any background whatsoever about what you're actually trying to accomplish but they can see the animation and they can learn how it works and then they can give you feedback from an aesthetics point of view so this is real that this works really well to see if people like animation from an aesthetics point of view but for to find out if the animation is actually useful from a functional point of view you have to test it in a real user study that's the way I do it but it also depends on the animation if your animation is extremely experimental then you obviously have to do more testing but it's just if it's just a basic fade in fade out if it's a less dramatic effect you probably don't even have to run the user test so it really depends on the motion design that you have in mind okay one last question maybe does anybody have it sorry I didn't because it was an experiment and that's actually yeah that's that's interesting because like usually when we build things on the web right we have tons of examples where you can copy from basically what we do is steel right and then we call ourselves designers that's what we do but in this very case it was really hard because I had some inspiration I had quartz as an inspiration I had what's up and iMessage as an inspiration but then I had to figure out how will I make this conversation to feel like there's an actual person behind it like there's that very state that people actually feel like they're talking to me and for everyone in this room I can really recommend building your own chat bot because chatting with yourself can can really you start learning a lot about yourself and what happens so in this case what I what I think what I learned is basically that you when you build something new but it that hasn't been like replicated thousands of times you just need to explore and you can't really test it in this case I didn't really test it because it was also kind of an experiment it was a joke in a corporate environment that obviously wouldn't work but as a joke I think you can get away with it okay no more questions sorry about it thank you very much this was really awesome
