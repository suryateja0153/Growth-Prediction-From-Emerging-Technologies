 okay everyone just going to get started here really excited to be joined by some of the members of our cloud team for this webinar why a fast responsive user interfaces and personal productivity good for joining us I am connect Sharma the proudest product marketing manager for aqua cloud and i'm joined by corey the product manager for profit club we're both we excited to have you here and for us to talk to you about how we redesigned our UI we're going to be launching our updated user interface as a public data on April fourth available to you via your aqua subscriptions if you don't have an aqua subscription you can create a free account via aqua calm / free and the link is going to be available later in the presentation I'm also going to include a link to the UI or to the web page where you can access the UI if you already have a subscription one thing I'd like to sit before we get into the heart of the presentation is that we undertook this project keeping you in mind we request you to provide your feedback good and especially the bad our goal is to capture and continuously iterate on feedback from our users and provide a user interface that you really are looking for so having said that the agenda for today's presentation is we're going to talk to you about why we built it I talk to you about what's new who benefits from the new features and then Corey is going to go into a a demo of the new user interface and then present to you some resources and end with a Q&A section so why did we build it our UX team our user experience team conducted a massive amount of research spent time talking with hundreds of developers and we identified that our users wanted to simplify their day-to-day activities they wanted to utilize new technologies and have a faster more responsive interface have complete access to AP is in order to enable automation and workflow customization and they they wanted to increase visibility into applications to clear monitoring and activity stream tools having said that I want to talk to you about what is new so we've revamped the information architecture and nomenclature of the cloud user interface utilizing the most common task of our personas what does that mean we basically minimize the number of clicks to access frequently perform tasks and Corey will show you how we've done this we've reduced the amount of page refreshes providing more real-time asynchronous updating updating of data and actions within the user interface we are providing a consistent experience across all channels namely desktop and mobile this is something that really sends out to me something that will benefit our users some of the features that will be highlighted in the mobile section mobile UI is monitoring drag and drop and quite a few others but the drag-and-drop piece in my opinion is is of high value we've also utilize the front front-end framework of styles components and patterns that are consistent and strategically designed we've improved onboarding experiences so that developers can get both their new and existing site up and running quickly an aqua cloud and if you are a if you are devops resource you can get new developers on a team up and running quickly as well we want to make sure you can get up and running without any additional support from having to contact aqua so we've tried to simplify onboarding as best as we can and then we've expanded and completed our public API and completed our public API ice attorney full use of the most common functionality that is possible through the user interface to be done via API and in addition we've also identified this new user interface this new framework to be the foundation of integrating the user interfaces across all aqua products those products being aqua supply-side factory a good cloud lift and a clear content hub moving along so who benefits we in the research that we did we found that our daily users are the ones who benefit from this from this updated UI and and those are mostly developers we broke the developers into three further subcategories the first one being the Drupal Enterprise Architect Dave these primary goals and needs are stable and performing website they was passionate about reliability flexibility preventing data loss outages and security breaches and they've also wants easy intuitive tools which allow for speedy development testing and deployment so how does the new UI help Dave the new UI helps they minimize the number of steps in accessing inside score insight is how you look at the health of your website not just for a website but also for involved and application and the new UI also minimizes reception monitoring application uptime the new UI helps Dave eliminate full page reloads to provide faster access helps day by filtering and searching for specific applications and environments and again all of this Cory will show you in the demo the new UI helps provide api's for almost everything that Dave is trying to achieve and lastly it helps in onboarding other developers to get started in aquia quickly the next type of developer is the senior developer Rachael and Rachael's Prime primary goals are to improve the performance and stability of the platform and easy intuitive tools which allow for speedy development testing and deployment of her code so how does the new UI help Rachel on board rachel is able to onboard new developers quickly she's able to minimize the number of steps in deploying code applying new security patches accessing in sight again the health scores for applications and environments it also helps Rachel to provide faster access to tools that help monitor server and platform health databases and web performance it helps her filter and search for specific applications and environments and provides a breadcrumb trail to quickly navigate within the UI within the user interface to go from one action to another and then the last developer is someone who's new to Drupal or a new developer in total Freddy and how does have any primary goals are to have a simple stable hosting environment with simple with a simple user interface and the new UI helps very quickly on board understand what aqua cloud does and get his website up and running quickly within op we allowed having said this I'm going to pass it on to Corey to do the demo of section of the orientation so as you can see spear this is a new cloud you up that's it a calm new revamp experience us we can feedback from users and all left strips like initial talking about and really put use and making it new frontier WI as you can see here this is a disc replacement for your applications list rip shins lists notice that many of course you know use one subscription for multiple application to a little bit to execute you know applications you actually get a look at each site individual some additional functionality as well so each of these applications you can actually view a real-time three and shot of what those sites look like so if your site's you know me Allen like so my situs it doesn't have any content currently so I can actually that real-time and take action on it if I need to there is also you know quick access to seeing exactly what your insight scores are for each of the three categories in your overall application right now this is currently a placeholder graph but very soon we'll have our uptime monitoring and statistics live right on this this page to so as soon as you jump into your applications page you're going to have a real look at what each application is doing and how it's doing performance security best practices overall up time that kind of stuff and be able to really just get a quick glance at everything you as I scroll through my applications i could performances you so what we've done is actually created sort of a passion if you will so every page will hold more of you know 2520 actually 24 application you so six rows of four location filtering more intuitive so if I want to you know view a couple applications or just one and it loads in as soon as i'm done with the filter my applications go back to the way they were we also have a quick list view so if you're not really overall interested in in all of that information on one screen and you just kind of want a list of your applications and a quick look at your insight score you can actually load the list view as well so its really user preference at this point from there we're also going to be able to as we're moving along it's going to shut we are iterating and making this what our users want so we've actually had a call for more granular ability to filter application so over here you can see that the application list is currently all this is our current filter for all applications at the moment but in the future we'll be adding sort of a recent as well as a start or favorites for your applications and then and then later on the goal is to actually add sort of a labeling tagging mechanism for all of our users to tag their own applications and set them up in a way that makes sense for them we know users particularly you know especially our partners and those users working on multiple application groups you can group them as they make sense for you and that way your speed to actually taking action on those applications is much faster so with that I'd actually like to dive into an application here my barlowGirl application is a test application loading in my development stage of production environments as you can see this is the typical workflow that we've you know come custom custom to with our current you I allowing for you know quick look at performance and security and best practices those inside scores which are very important for you applications are actually broken up / environment now so you're not just looking at one overall application score you're actually looking at all three to see you know if you have something in staging that you're working on and looking to push it to production well you've got an extra insight score there to actually tell you hey look you should probably take a look at this before you push to production because there's quite a few more errors here than you know your production is very stable and looking very good but your staging is not so much for users with many environments the filtering is the same exact way here so all the filtering still applies and there's also the the quick drag and drop interface so I want to move some coder database simply just click and I can drop in production or development the site is currently a test site so I can move my database anywhere but as you may know may or may not know moving a database to production with a live sites kind of a no-no so if you is that is the case this will actually just drop zone over here will turn purple and it will show is it it is protected to prevent any overriding of the databases that are live which could cause some pretty big site errors so I'm going to quickly move a database for you just to show you what happens so this will actually bring up the workflow staging currently on my my current tag moving it into dev which is currently on master showing me that what's going to be overwritten giving me that really this is what's going to happen making sure that you you're actually doing what you want to do and then I can make that copy so that will go away as you can see it'll give a live update that it's actually doing something and then up here you may have noticed my little kind of refresh symbol this is actually my activity stream so something that we're working on right now actually building out more and will be from a much more granular activities as we move through the public beta in the coming months I would really likes more feedback on what activity would be useful for you to see in this activity stream I would notice that kind of the task log thing that we had before with insight users it didn't really give the granularity into tasks and visibility into the applications what the users were looking for so we'd really like to build this up to be everything that you need it to be in telling telling you in real time what's going on the applications and application group not only for yourself but for other users eventually this will build into kind of an SMS email notification as well and we'll build it out to also tackle not just task things that you're doing in the UI but also site issues so if you've got enough time alert if your insight score you know suddenly drops or something's going on with your application through one of our monitoring services we'd also like to use this to notify you of that to you know kind of bring it right up to the forefront so you know what's going on at all times so with that you know this is this is the current environment look as you can see you know we're missing some of the things that you're used to over here on this left-hand side you can take care of your SSL and any environment security but in order to get more granular we're actually going to dive in a little bit further so now we have this environment we're actually in in the staging environment I've got my broken out code database and files as well as my environment information IP PHP versions might as well as might get URL for quick access I also have some quick actions up here so I can configure my environment I can clear my varnish cash and can also install a new Drupal drupal base on this environment so this will actually take you right to brand new freshman drupal install all the same functionality here but in a lot more of a granular way so instead of actually having to go to my databases tab and setting up a backup or anything like that i can do all those actions right from this page switch and deploy so i can actually switch code in this environment from any environment that I have and I all the same filtering works here so all my tags are date driven so I don't really have any filtering mechanism but if you'd like to you know employ your own sort of tagging if you have your own set up this filtering is very good for you then you simply select continue and again it will give you a breakdown of what what you'd like to do set that to switch and then it'll quickly switch over so I have my activity stream again showing me what I've been doing now you know we talked about kind of reducing action reducing clicks hear something that you know we kind of tackled bringing into this granular granular view it's important to have this you know deep look of information and be able to access these environments at this level but you know having to go back out and come back in did those other really make sense so we've developed a new kind of bread crumb if you will so I've got all the way back up to my applications if I want to go to a new application but I can actually just click this down arrow here and that'll actually give me look right into I can go into my production or development environment very quickly and this is a single page application so no large reloads of everything I've switched my dev and I'm right back into the action here I didn't have to wait you know a minute or so for that for all that information to reload we've got several items over here as well that I'd like to go through something to note as kind of said this is going to be a public beta as as it is in that way some functionality is not complete what happens if you you know enter into an area that's not complete well we simply send you back to you in hi doc we calm so current workflow that you're used to I want you to continue with in workflow may you can return to the beta continue the to use the beta you live in and to give feedback that's what I want to enter do a new work and watch will be everything used to using so we complete that allows you to redirect and then come back when you're ready to this is our servers look so giving you a little with more granularity into I on your application I have a single set up here I me to filter out what I I don't want to look at anything at all I want to look at the SATA basis this Web I can quickly jump through also working on the penis or reusable in terms before this information as a as a following for me so we're tackling a few different way that but this is a more granular look at each server than not the most are used ever databases page so being able to manage my databases here I can see my backups the details for the database so SSH username password things like that as well as my PHP connection allowing me to connect right to the database I can initiate a quick back up here if I'd like to again these quick actions everywhere allowing you to pretty much do whatever you want wherever you are and initiating that within the top clogged so you can see what's going off with time we also again an action bar up here allowing you to add a database very quickly right where you are without having to switch we have our domains page so I only have one domain here but you know many of you have had many sites many domains this will allow you a quick look at all of them eventually we'd like to allow you to set your default domains and things like that so any feedback here on what would be useful is very important this is kind of one of the next pages that's going to be built out in more detail log streaming is not complete but we're actually tackling it in a new way allowing you to really use the log streaming as a intuitive you know troubleshooting tool you know we did give you a log stringent and so we'll be back in that log streaming but we didn't but what was going to really give you the information you needed so we've come about in a new way so once that's launched I really like to hear what you think about it we're also going to be kind of giving you an application analysis section through a third party vendor once that comes along i'm going to be very happy to announce it too so so keep an eye out for that as well and then the final section is simply your schedule cron jobs that's actually being developed within the next couple engineering sprint so that will be in there how it should be in there within the first couple weeks of our public beta that's the main what's going on here in our public beta we're going to be working on the next steps of teams and permissions subscriptions and add-ons but as going to said this is a fully api-based you I so everything that I've done here today every button click every action that I've taken you can actually go in and look at the API for that action and implement it in your own way we actually have the API documentation here if you to go this way key to our I'm going to tell you the syntax of the use the notice one built out when your features so every new feature that comes in bad back to it and we'll be able to you for your own workflow in terms of feedback simply click this feedback so when you're using UI it's always right there so you don't have where else to submit feedback here in the UI give me a quick some quick description of what's going on and then we even allow attachment if you'd like to take a quick video of whatever you do whatever I you know if you issue something you'd like to see ch different you'd like to see you can quickly add that and then submit actually submits a ticket rate to us right to our user and steam and then they get take a look at that immediately we get notified time of your issues so that workflow seems to work has worked really well in the past and I'm looking forward to hearing all of your feedback in the future that kind of concludes the demo portion of this webinar so please let me know if you have any questions we'd be happy to field them at the end but I'm really excited to have you guys jump in here and test this up great Corey can you pass the screen check back to me please just great so having gone through that you may have noticed the flow within the new UI is much simpler much faster for tasks that you may perform on a daily basis I'd like to stress that this is a public beta that we are launching on April the fourth if you are an existing Acquia user to log into the new UI simply go on to clock we're calm and this website will be available to beginning April fourth if you're new to aquia and if you want to kick the tires on this new UI that we use presented you can sign up for a free account at aqua calm / free with that I'd like to say thank you and entertain any questions if you have any questions please type them in the chat window or in the questions window at the time you so Cory the first question that's come in weeds with all these new pictures and tools and content available on the home page how does that impact load times solo times are actually quite fast as it is we've done a lot of work on performance with the new UI even having tested users with hundreds of applications you really haven't had a problem with the low time however we do give you the option to ignore the pictures and and the insight scores and the uptime grass if you like like I showed that list of you will allow you to really quickly kind of ignore all that put it into the end of the background and give you a quicker load if you'd like to but as I said the performances we're doing a lot of work to make sure that this is a highly performant application you know speed and responsiveness of this application are the most important factors so now and in the future will will continue to improve performance for our users great another question that's come in is that's the new UI introduce anything new for business users or day-to-day content editors or is this a separate webinar so another thing is that car you yeah absolutely so as Chris was talking about this is kind of the framework for future products you know building out a base for our for the look and feel as well as the content of our U is for all of our products so this is kind of the base we're moving in functionality from our previous you I so from our legacy you I inside that aqua calm to make sure that you can do all the things that you need to do to move forward with your applications as you're used to as we do that as we iterate on to the future we'll be adding in new features for your day-to-day content editors business users will be adding a new products so we've got some other things coming down the line including CI pipelines builds that some other developer tools that you'll you know you'll be able to use within the same UI within the same perience so that we are not jumping between different UIs and different places to use those tools so i guess to answer your question this new UI in the current beta form doesn't really introduced a whole lot of new things kind of a new look new feel new way to go about them but not a whole lot of actual new features what they are coming those are that's a future look for us and that's something that we're looking to do to make things better for you that's why we're doing this any iterative way we've decided to do this to add to that what I'd say is that this new UI what we built thus far really focuses on the three developer personas that I touched on before Enterprise Architect senior developer and and new to drupal developer so this new lies mostly geared to the developer audience we will be coming out with a new you knew and simpler UI user interface for content editors down the line and it is part of our roadmap awesome cool any other questions we didn't take offline and now we can get you those responses I do want to thank everyone for joining us for the 12 RNA and look forward to seeing you on the next one thank you
