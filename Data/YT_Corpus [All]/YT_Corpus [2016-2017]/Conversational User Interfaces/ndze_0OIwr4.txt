 we're a mobile transformation company that means we do strategies we do products we do media amplification and we do that across a number of different content plays so we've worked in various different capacities with the economist with New York Times with wall street journal with condé nast in our history so a lot of experience in this and what I want to talk about today is a it's really just three things hopefully really great working so I want to talk about what's changed what have the last six seven years of mobile done and how has that changed consumer behavior and then i'm going to talk sort of generically industry-wide as to how the industry has reacted to that and talk about five strategies and clear strategies that we see coming out of the content industry and then at the end talk about five ways in which i think we can win we being industry can win in this of course it's all personal opinion but i hope to back it up with some facts and some thinking about this that gives some insight to this now the first thing to talk about what's changed is that ultimately probably all of you are approaching that mobile tipping point whereby traffic is fundamentally now on a mobile device rather than on a desktop and we talk about now these platforms as being you know devices and we talk about the small screen and everything and it's not about that at all actually the most important thing that changes consumer behavior and it's changed it's changed it it's intertwined into our life right and become a major foundation of what we do in our lives this mobile device this thing that we've carrying our pockets the whole time it's changes so much that physically we are changing you know now the most popular way of being able to know to to move is like that amusing three news feeds that's a physical gesture which we never had before if you're young it might be swiping left and right but these are gestures that we've never ever had before and it's not just the gestures which change is the very fact that no Mobile's always been talked about we've talked about mobile it's about oh it's about being out and about well no that's not really a mobile is opened up a whole new set of interaction points that we never had before so you know as you can see sitting in front of the television at at nine o'clock at night is the most popular time to be utilizing mobile using mobile in store in retail environments using mobile in your car all of these are new interaction and engagement points that we never had before so ultimately we've got to think about mobile as being a behavioral change for consumers not about being a platform sitting there as an individual device yeah so within that I also think that's really important because that set us up to talk about things like what happens with wearables and other devices moving forward that's the first thing that's changed it's a behavior the second thing is that it is demanding of context right because this is with us the whole time context is absolutely crucial and what I mean by context is not just as we talk about mobile like location all right locations very important where we are is important but that's not the killer application of mobile often it what we are doing on this device and who we are and what we like on that device which is the contextual environment we have to work within so I'll give you a good example the type of signals that consumers give out that we can start to understand and start to pick up on I was working with a sports brand and I was talking about the very fact that you know understanding people who do sport is so much easier now with mobile so we can understand the very fact that if you're in the vicinity of a gym that you could well be working out if your mobile is fixham a locational perspective we can understand that if you're on Spotify and you are playing a fitness workout playlist that the chances are you going to be working out we understand that if you're using a fitness application that you will be doing something like running so all of these new contextual opportunities arise and mobile gives us the opportunity to be able to harness them the third thing is that mobile is all about blending the digital world and the physical world and this is very very important because we see mobile is becoming the remote control for people's lives and it's not just a case of what happens on the screen so we're moving from what happens here in its interaction to the phone interpreting the world around us and we can see that with technologies such as augmented reality and the ability to be able to blend there a digital world with the physical world we can start to see it with the rise of the Internet of Things the connected sensors you know in terms of the connected car or the connected home or they know the connected city itself how the mobile will interact with that so this is not just about looking down at the screen it's also about holding this device up and interpreting the world in a different way so that's a behavioral change as well the next thing that's changed I think this is probably not just a mobile thing but it's probably brought on by social media to a certain extent but as all social media is now mobile first I'm going to claim it's being mobile and the point is that your competition is now your customer now what that means is that there is a finite amount of time that people have to consume content and of course all the content that is consumed is created by friends and family and colleagues takes up a percentage of that time so to a certain extent you've got the content which you'd normally be producing versus the content that is created by by friends and family and everything that cuts down the amount of time you'd normally have for the content you're producing but more importantly is that the the costs of entry and production have fallen to such a low level particularly with this device particularly across you know platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest and YouTube that people are now being able to access and create content with large amounts of followings without having to have any other traditional infrastructure that the content industry has had to build up and if you think about it the content industry is basically five things it's about the the creation of content the hosting of that content the curation of that content the monetization of that content and then the distribution of that content and what we're talking about here is people you know which we call influencers but with massive amounts of followings on youtube or Pinterest or any of these social networks whereby they are doing all of those five things and it's been facilitated in the cost of entry is 0 for them it's their time and that means that the people that you were talking to and now having dialogues amongst themselves and that's all being facilitated by this device and the final thing that I want to talk about in terms of what's changed is I think that note that there's a clear view that the user interface has become a key competitive differentiator and what do I mean by that I mean that the best experience you have on say a mobile device anywhere becomes your de facto expectation everywhere so the very first time that you use uber and the simplicity of uber of getting this car and walking out the cab and not having to pay for it and everything being located around it and I can see whether Carla that experience is quite magical for customers customers expect that absolutely now everywhere so the problem is is that it's not about what your competitors are doing it's about what the whole sector is doing in terms of the quality of the user interface and that's really important because particular mobile the level of frustration that people have when things don't work is magnified by a hundred times so where is on a desktop people might you know spend three or four times trying to do something that they can't do it then give up on a mobile it's literally three or four seconds and I can't do I give up and I toss aside so the user interface is incredibly important that's really important because what starting to go we've started to move towards on which I call zero user interface and I don't have any of you see this is Yoakam Phoenix in spike jonze film called her I don't have any of you've seen the film her if not yet brilliant have you seen it great if not go home and watch it's a fantastic film it's about spike jonze rockin Phoenix's character falls in love with his artificial intelligent personal assistant now that artificial intelligent personal assistant is to garlic you're handsome so you can sort of understand that but in doing so the whole of interface in that film has changed because what he does is he talks right he doesn't type he doesn't use a mouse he doesn't use touch he talks and voice is becoming the absolute zero you I out there at the moment user interface so here's a snap for you fifty-five percent of Millennials right use google search via voice every day my son does not type into google search he speaks to google search what does that mean when we have a legacy a history 20 years of hierarchical navigations and faceted navigations and everything that's all blown apart because we're moving towards zero UI and if you haven't seen I mean to a certain is that you can see stuff like um it starting to come out through the personal systems like Siri and Cortana and extra AI and all of these type of personal systems but you haven't seen viviette VIII IV viv it's by the creators of Siri and it's possibly the most intelligent personal assistant I've seen and it its UI is completely about voice and a chat type interface and return that's the way we're moving towards things and that's going to come up very very rapidly on the principle that all phones have got a personal assistant built into them now be that a Google now or a theory that it's going to get better and better and how do you begin to start to distribute and to think about content in that perspective so those are the things i think the behavioral changes as now talk about how we as an industry have reacted to that we happy face or a smiley face are we you know kissing face with closed eyes emoji never had to use that five different strategies i think which had come out of we've reacted to this mobile opportunity the first is what i call the porter strategy right and the porter strategy is basically take what I've done in a different medium and port it directly into mobile now this is a strategy is about having universal access to the same content no matter where no matter what platform and not changing that content to affect the the format or the type of content that is produced right this is very very much a strategy which is sort of mirrored in the web world by responsive web you get the same content the same or the same sort of functionality no matter where you are across a device be that a tablet or a mobile or a or a desktop I'm gonna say too much about whether I think that's good or bad because it's not for me to judge whether things are good or bad but it does feel to me that it's an interim step within this device when you start to look at the other ways of creating different strategies the second strategy is the strategy of aggregation and now aggregators have always existed right we existed on the web we had things like Reddit we have things like you know the much departed google reader and mobiles has brought that more to the forefront so we get a lot of different aggregators now coming out you know we have Flipboard we have news we have up day you know lots of different a gradient some reason they're all seem to be shades of red maybe red is the aggregation color i'm not sure but um they're becoming very very successful you know you've got things like Flipboard you know 400 million downloads 100 million monthly active users utilizing it now after seventy percent mobile operation running through there 10 million plus magazines which it has on there it seems to find a real niche because what it does is it takes all that volume and huge fragmentation of content and it provides users with the ability to be able to navigate the things that they really really interested in so it's more of a service than anything else it's a curation and distribution service I think that's coming to the forefront I talked a lot about no zero UI as we start to move towards more messaging and bots and other types of conversational user interfaces which is returned your hear bandied around this is for example on slack which is the internal productivity network and messaging network of them businesses CNN have a service which allows you to be able to follow and unfollow news this is an aggregator service no matter what you look at the third strategy which we see people taking up is a strategy of summarization yeah and summarization is something that is basically about taking content and respecting the user in a different way not expecting them to have to read through pages and pages of content because what we've what they what the summarizes think is that snacking on your mobile device having very short very very quick interactions with content is what the device demands now yeah you can find all sorts of stats to be able to pick that up you know do people watch 7 second videos 11 second videos or do they in fact watch half an hour videos in the average time spent on YouTube on mobile is 40 minutes so you know summarization plays a different role than actually about just creating time for the customer but what it is about is about getting news and content to people really very very quickly and we can see a lot of the players in this space you know women we helped know Nick D'Aloisio build some Lee which was which went to yahoo and became the basis for Yahoo News nyt nyt now economists with espresso we built Wall Street Journal's what's news this is about creating a different experience for customers outside of the main experience that they have with the deeper content either or desktop on a mobile device and again you know these things have been incredibly successful I'm sure you've had the Economist talk to you or I think already or maybe there's also today I think they're speaking today an earlier fantastic nope they're going to give you much more insight than I have but from what you can get out of press releases now they've had a million downloads of espresso and they've got 200,000 weekly average users that's earning fifty dollars a year basically everyone keeps a subscription up you know it's a double-digit million business straight there that wasn't there before hand never mind about anyone with the advertising and sponsorship which they do on top that's a real success within mobile mostly because the con tent is very exclusive but it's completely different contents with data which appears in the magazine I'm court and I'm sure you've heard from court yesterday I believe you know our constant references quartz again their their application in a conversational UI interface even though it's not an intelligent artificial intelligence will have bot it's a summarization tool it's again about respect to time delivering content in a different way you know the use of emojis pictures videos those type of pieces of content to bring the stories to life in a way I don't know gate again going back to a film called Starship Troopers where it's they do you want to know more button which you keep on pressing distributors a lot of talk that's what the polls about basically um you know here's a clue eighty percent of buzzspeed traffic sits outside of BuzzFeed's owned properties it sits within distribution networks but speed does about 180 million monthly active users it probably about on target for 250 million dollars of revenue okay yeah again it's a massively successful strategy but as you start to look towards things like no Facebook instant articles and as you start to look toward snapchat discover annie's type of distribution platforms you start to question again this whole you know create host curate monetize distribute because of those five things Facebook and snapchat are hosting curating monetizing sometimes probably more on Facebook than maybe on snapchat and distributing and so what does a Content producer do your part and create and maybe monetizing themselves and if they do monetize and things like snapchat they have to pay a big down payment minimum guarantee of course to snapchat itself for the advertising so it's not an easy strategy to go forward and then we've got innovators is it the final strategy I think innovation is one of the most interesting things because it you know it gives us little small signals of what could happen in the future as being reality I think you know as a Cuban quick reference in court his app i think is incredibly innovative because it talks about conversational you I that's really important but no that's happening everywhere so content being on messaging platforms happens everywhere you know online I picked for exam line which has you know what is it half a million so half a billion downloads probably about 250 million monthly active users Wall Street Journal's got to 2.1 million users online economist has 180,000 after a few months these are big audiences Wall Street Journal said this is the fastest growing platform that they have this is an interesting on Pinterest this is cosmopolitan this this particular post on pinterest garnered 227,000 views over a much longer period than it would be in content I think it's really interesting using Pinterest to be able to communicate with people but not it's a continent consumption because it has an e-commerce aspect to it as well has a Commerce aspect to it as well it is vitally important to think about different revenue streams coming off the back of that virtual reality is really interesting ways of telling stories the Guardians six-by-nine which talks about solitary confinement is an incredibly immersive engaging heart-wrenching view of a particular area that we could not be brought to life in the same way unless you were immersed in that experience and you'll talk today about New York Times and virtual reality but you know it's a big play by those guys to know to give out a million cardboard headsets another 300,000 going out looking at episodic content with envy are you know this is a big play by them to be able to say this is another way of telling stories that hasn't existed beforehand so where do all these fit together I like to draw one graphite draw a power curve with everything that I do I'm a very simple strategist on one side you've got an axis which is about engagement in revenue and the other one is about reach and it basically looks like this what it basically says is that I've got loads of pointer I'm both but well it basically says is the engagement in revenue is that a few people are really really engaged or produce the most amount of revenue and there's lots and lots of people who you might reach you don't produce much engagement in there in frequent or that much amount of revenue it's the 8020 rule in play right where do things sit on this distribution is a strategy which is all about reach but because you're looking at a single article play it it's not about massive engagement not about massive revenue aggregators and summarizes they sit somewhere in the middle of this somewhere in the middle of this where it's good engagement good reach but you know they're not trying to do the same thing of reaching the millions upon millions and hundreds and millions of people that the distributors are the innovators are really starting to work out what that core audience wants that is the most engaged and as I said before hand the porters I don't really know what the porter strategy is in this because it's neither fish nor fowl when it comes down to it it's neither about reach it's neither about engagement it's about just having universal access to it so those five strategies sort sort of sit in that area as far as I'm concerned another thing as well as you can use this curve for everything I mean literally you die do one thing that we've learned from every single piece of work that we've done is that apps are about engaging a loyal highly frequent audience and web is all about reaching a much much larger infrequent audience in doing so it's not an either/or it's an and strategy for app and web so a couple of minutes just on how I think we can win okay five things I think are really important the first point about this is please understand what problem you are now solving for people if the conversations are happening outside of the normal dialogue that you once had with you're consuming your audience you're in a position whereby you now have to understand what that audience wants that audience might not want content they might want a service they might want the ability to be able to engage in different ways with you don't suppose understand and ask then build business plans around that otherwise building a business plan saying we did this on desktop or we did this on mobile and now we're going to do this is like taking a square peg and bashing it into a round hole it does not fit it will break so understanding your audience is more important than ever now on our graph I think that you have to think about with whatever property you're going to do it whether you want to be what I call a stretch sure a thing in this case no but the Fantastic Four stretch is all about getting a maximum amount of reach but a minimal amount of revenue per user thing is all about having a few very very engaged customers and getting a lot of revenue out of those guys you cannot do both you have to think it doesn't mean you can't have two products doing both but it can't mean that the same product doesn't everything so you cannot have something saying I want to get a massively engaged audience and I want to reach a hundred million people with it because it's just not going to work on that basis you have to think of either and I think that's really important you know exclusivity of content creates things yeah the more exclusive your content the more likely art appear to monetize it in a different way because you're talking to fewer people and services in particular are creating stretch so those are two different ways of being able to look at either of those angles obviously you can go anywhere in between and I'd love to book you know yeah Johnny flame on there as well but I can't but third thing is about platforms not sites or apps gone are the days where you can think about building a site or building an app what you do is you build a platform of content meta tagged up to the to the hilt which has different presentation layers depending on where that content is going towards this is a fundamental technological restructure that you need to do as content owners is no longer the ability to be able to go and create a product and put it out there you have to think about how that product might change in the rapid velocity of adoption by customers we weren't thinking about conversational UI 6 months ago now it's the number one talking point how does my content and how does my services fit into that now and how do I take what I've got from a technological platform viewpoint and be able to port that the clever guys can turn around it like that other people have much much difficulty with legacy systems so this is about a technological aspect of things fourth thing is that it's my fundamental belief that if you have an innovation lab you should scrap it immediately innovation needs to run throughout the whole organization an innovation does not sit in an ivory tower or silo it's far to kickstart the process but it's not a long-term solution because if all of your staff and all of your organization are not thinking innovatively about how to solve these problems and thinking about these different business models you're not going to get the effect on your bottom line of your business and finally for those of you don't know this is this is a Michael Caine in a very very famous film get Carter 1960s film and it has one of my favorite sayings in this which I often wheel out to CEOs which is you know you're a big man but you're out of shape to me it's a full-time job so behave yourself well that means is that organizationally most most businesses are not fit for purpose for their consumers today it is not about technology technology is the easy thing to solve it is about the processes that impact that technology the work processes the workflows how that content or how that product reaches a consumer and those process changes have fundamental cultural changes in an organization and if the culture does not change right to embrace those processes you hit a buffer right so you have to think radically about organizational structural change that does need to come from the top it needs a very clear vision and I think you can look towards the New York Times as being a great example because they played that out a lot in the public about the organizational change they've had to take the process change they've had to take and the cultural direction of where that business moves towards those are the five things that I think that are important for how we win thank you very much indeed
