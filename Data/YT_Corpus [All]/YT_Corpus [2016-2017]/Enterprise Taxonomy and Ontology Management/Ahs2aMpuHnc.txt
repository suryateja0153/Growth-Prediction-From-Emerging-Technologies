on the web and basically get it ready for tomorrow's technology next slide please dcl services help you refine your document conversion strategy identify document redundancy extract metadata and transform legacy and future documents for real needs today and in the future next slide please we serve a very broad client base next slide please standing oil industries next slide please today we are thrilled to introduce Rob Pannell president precision content authoring solutions rather is an expert in structured authoring and content management he holds a designation from a morgue as a certified enterprise content management specialist and as a named fellow of the Society for technical communication rob is a member of the Oasis diddid Technical Committee an executive member of the first Canadian chapter of aim in Toronto Rob's company employs a team of skilled information architects and technical communicators that how organizations make their information easier to use without further ado welcome Rob thanks for watch at them and welcome everyone thank you for joining me today so just a really quick introduction into who precision content authoring is that was a good introduction Thank You Adam we do provide full service in terms of helping companies with their information right from content strategy straight through to publishing solutions but at the core of what we do we are content transformation specialists so we have a little bit of a latency it seems on the slide deck so please let me know if if I'm getting too far ahead of myself but core to who we are is is our content strategy and how we help clients understand the depth and breadth of the problems that we're trying to solve them so part of our content strategy consists of three specific spill pillars around content utility in other words how useful is the content the form that it is content maintainability and in terms of the process around the the content and how it needs to be maintained so that it stays sustainable and and accurate over time and then fine finally the key part for us is the usability and that's where our precision content writing methodology fits into our overall offerings for precision content and our content solutions working with our methodology and adaptations and specializations to the data XML framework so enough about being about us and on to what exactly it is that we're talking about so today we're talking about metadata and how it's how it's related to content and I myself AM my qualifications for this particular presentation are that I'm one of only a handful of people in all of North America who tend to get disproportionately excited about metadata so I've been working with it for quite some time it's very much part of what I've been doing is the big part of my career is a technical communicator and and information architect over the years but first of all let's put this into context so we're talking about metadata what is it applying to it applies to content and what are we talking about when we're talking about content so we look at for instance information within the enterprise we look at at data as a single point of information about something that's that's managed within the enterprise as we aggregate more data together we could we compile information and information is what the company uses you know it's what's produced through its information systems for information intensive businesses but content is how we interpret that information and we package that information for our customers internal and external on how to interpret that information that that we that we producer that we manage and then from there we're able to to make this content or our users our readers are able to take that content and apply their own context to it in order to extract knowledge from that content so really what we're talking about today is metadata and how it relates to content that we produce and we managed within our within our enterprise so meta data as defined was coin back in the 1960s and it's a textbook definition right now as as simple as data about data of course that's about as useful as stuff about stuff really isn't it I mean it's not very descriptive as to what it does so maybe a more elaborate explanation would be e to say that it's essential properties usually structured within the context of external content to identify and define information about that content so metadata is information about a resource and it's as simple as talking about the resource a metadata property name and a value this is in essence what a piece of metadata is for for intensive purposes that were that we're talking about it today so metadata it's applied to all structured and unstructured content within the corpus it can be visible or hidden from view so by definition we like to think of metadata is always being under covers and behind the scenes but a lot of times this metadata needs to be surfaced and it will be published it'll be visible of course when this information is published a perfect example of metadata that's also visible is for instance the title of a document or a web page where the the title is metadata but it is also content so it serves two purposes within within our within our content as metadata it is both the machine driven or it is manually entered so the best metadata is the metadata that we don't need to rely on authors or users or contributors to actually enter into the system but they can be derived from the tools and the systems in which that user is operating this metadata is internal or external to the content meaning that either the metadata is stored in the content itself or it is stored externally in a typically a relational database of some other database that is then tied back to that content metadata can be mandatory optional or conditional in nature so where we force a metadata and we force users to enter metadata it's obviously mandatory optional metod metadata and then conditional metadata is where it starts out potentially is optional and then it becomes mandatory as a piece of content moves through a workflow or through a process or it meets a specific condition where metadata is required to be entered so in many forms of metadata and of course it is structured data about content it will be the relational or hierarchical and can take many different forms so it anything from rich text or binary or even images through to syntax and coded values where we provide or where the system provides additional validation of metadata upon entry by matching up with a specific type of syntax encoding whether it's daytime or its social insurance or a social security number or it's a zip code or something to that effect where there is a specific formula or template for entering data so many rules of metadata of course the primary role of metadata is to facilitate identification retrieval and processing of content that's its primary goal but it also has two other secondary but very important rules which include content and acting as corporate structured data and we'll talk about that just a moment so we talked about already how metadata can be content such as title or even author or other pieces of information about the content that you're looking at it's also stored as metadata and used by other systems for other purposes for retrieval search etc so one of my favorite metaphors for meta data to really understand what it is is a soup can where metadata is the soup is is the is the soup can and the content itself is the soup so there's a lot of information of course that we can get from the from the soup can that we obviously can't get from the soup but that it helps us to identify and also manage this particular product through its lifecycle and of course metadata isn't the message in fact what we're looking at here is the metadata behind a Twitter message so while the Twitter post is only a hundred and eighteen characters the actual metadata message itself is almost two thousand characters in length now when we talk about why metadata matters this was a there there are some nefarious aspects to metadata and how metadata can be n is used by organizations and we think about what metadata is and how it's stored it as we say it's highly structured and it's it's very reliable data about content and so therefore metadata is easier to manipulate easier to store search filter and and and organize then the content itself so sometimes we can get more information about the information from the metadata then we can easily define or derive from the content itself and in in a recent presentation by the Electronic Frontier Foundation there were concerns in Australia where there were talk of there was talk of capturing and storing metadata about cell phone messages whereas the the actual messages themselves are the the actual voice messages were not to be stored but the metadata itself was to be stored and to be retrievable and used for anti terrorist types of activities and and other types of policing activities and it really opened up a severe can of worms so some of the examples that they they pulled out were situations where for instance they know you rang a phone sex service at 220 Ford spoke for 18 minutes but that's not incriminating as that you they certainly don't know what it was you talked about or calling the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge of course the actual call itself nobody knows what you actually talked about and then this one where the phone metadata shows that you spoke with eh ITP texting service and then your doctor and the health insurance company but probably nothing to worry about there right so now we get into the actual classification and definitions around metadata itself so at its highest level we look at dividing metadata into three very distinct categories of descriptive metadata administrative metadata and structural metadata so script of metadata is the metadata that we most often work with whether it's as authors or contributors or information architects this is metadata that we need to be able to set up so that we're able to identify and quickly retrieve information based on what the information is about and typically only an author or a Content contributor can apply this descriptive metadata appropriately so therefore the systems and how we work with this metadata is is as a very it's very important to understand the various systems on how we gather and manage and deploy descriptive metadata so one of the first one we've got one exercise here that I'd like for you all to walk through with me and it really what it is is it's about thinking about how we classify information on a daily basis and by the end of this I hope you'll see that you know how we set up and how we establish metadata is very important to the effectiveness of the metadata we're going to be working with so if you would all consider that please just take a pen and a piece of paper and we're going to go through like I say a quick exercise and what you're going to see in a moment are a series of 21 words and you'll have 20 20 seconds to just stare at the screen and try to memorize as many of these words as possible please don't please don't start writing down the words until the words actually disappear from the screen once you're done we're going to count and see how many words that you actually remembered correctly from from this screen so I'm going to just click if you're already now pleased with your pens down I'm going to click this button and you'll have 20 seconds you you you okay so if you all pick up your pencils please and take 20 seconds to write down as many of those words as you can as you can remember please you you you okay so for our a question I'd like for you to add them if you will bring up the the survey I'd like for you to please enter into the pool how many men how many of the words you were able to recall from that list so Rob with about sixty percent the attendees are voting we have forty-three percent of said six or fewer 39 thirty-eight percent said seven to nine and eighteen percent said nine to twelve and what about well eighty percent of the attendees even voted ok excellence and sorry how many were in that first category again forty-four percent at this time indicated they've memorized six or fewer words okay then thirty-six percent at seven to nine and nineteen percent say nine to twelve great well that that is actually really quite typical of this particular exercise where people will remember and it looks like about 75% of the folks remembered you know around seven to nine or or around seven or eight words from a list so what I'm going to take you through now are the processes in which we use to try to classify that information in order to be able to work with it and retrieve that information so first thing that our minds try to do when we're looking at these words is that we need to try to filter out all of the noise so you're going to look at those words and you're going to say wow that's a really nice font and why is that red and this one's bigger than that one does that what significance does that have in the word when of course there is no significance to the fonts or the or the colors or or the size or the the boldness of the words it's the words themselves that are important so the first thing we have to do in order to start to work with this information in store and retrieve the information is to filter out all the noise the next thing that we do in our minds is we try to break this information out into smaller groupings visually so that we can retrieve this information and work with the information and then next we're looking for relationships between these words how do these words relate to each other and can I sort them into oooh similar by similarities and once we're looking at how they're sort of by similarities then of course we go about attempting to label those similarities so that we can better recall and work with that information so here are the words that were presented to you earlier in that first in that earlier slide so have a look and see of those words that you wrote down how many of them were actually did you recall correctly from this list okay so probably a couple of the words at least that you have on your list if they're even on this slide you may have had a memory recall error even in in some of the words that you did recall so now we've taken this information we've categorized that we've filtered out all the noise we've put labels on it to make this information easier for you to recall so I'm going to we're going to do this exercise one more time except we're going to have already put this together for you in and let's walk through this one more time 20 seconds and see how many words you can memorize now from the next list starting the so once the words disappear from the screen start to write the words down for me okay so pens down at the moment and here we go you okay now take let's take 20 seconds or so to write down as many of those words as you could possibly can remember and we're going to run that pole again you okay and Adam can you okay so here in here are the words so pens down here are the words let's let's go through the next survey question and see how you did this time Adam would you please pull up the pole once again so Rob with about a little bit more than half of the attendees voting we have forty-one percent indicate nine to twelve thirty five percent seven to nine in twenty percent I 11 to 13 and we're about seventy percent of the attendees have voted wonderful so we can see a very very obvious difference in what our brains do to try to work with and organize this information so all of those four specific steps of trying to filter out the noise break into smaller groups categorize and label this these are all things we do every day when we're working with information and it's no different than when we're working with metadata and trying to organize logical metadata schemes for our users being able to anticipate how the user is going to be able to work with and work with and remember data and work with data is critically important to creating good metadata schema so it starts with controlled vocabularies coming up with a proper of controlled vocabularies or even adopting existing controlled vocabularies for metadata is essential to success so with controlled metadata with controlled metadata of course we can create pick lists for values lookups for values for when users are entering metadata to reduce or eliminate errors or inconsistencies that would otherwise be introduced through free text fields for metadata collection so metadata controlled vocabularies obviously a list of terms and controlled vocabularies actually are quite common within industry where you can either get controlled vocabularies free or for a fee you can pick up massive actually massive controlled vocabularies that you can adopt and use within organization rather than having to try to reinvent the wheel so we see problems with controlled vocabularies in the workplace with metadata all the time where there are ambiguous terms or multiple terms meaning the same thing coming up with a way to be able to distill this information into a single piece of information that we can otherwise then relate data to so and their men different ways to manage and control these controlled vocabularies starting with of course controlled lists and looking at increasing complexity through authority files taxonomy and eventually to the most more complex or most complex of the controlled vocabulary schemes of the source where we can relate similar terms and even antonyms two words within our controlled vocabularies such that when similar terms are used we can create associations in linked content together by virtue of both the source and also using a source to not only link content but to bring together content through full-text search next we look at moving into different types of classification schemes so the three primary of classification schemes are by subject by organization or by function so subject is probably one that were most familiar with and tends to add the most value and when it comes to being able to organize and retrieve information unfortunately it's also one of the most difficult and most expensive to build and maintain once it's done however the stability of the subject taxonomy is far more stable than the other two of function and organization so this an example of a type of subject classification where we can relate different terms are different print in this instance different types of beer how they relate together into broader categories and into subcategories next organization classification now this is one of the easiest types of classification scheme to develop there's there can be very little argument as to how your organization is structured so therefore there's very little is required in terms of gaining consensus and when implementing an organizational classification of course within our workplace most of our shared drives and network resources are all based around an organizational classification rather than subject or or function so while they're easy to make they are also very very easy to break and change very frequently so they're not as reliable certainly in the long term as our two other types of classification schema so functional classification is really your happy medium all right where it's sort of halfway between subject and organization where we're really talking about organization by function activity and task within an organization so hopefully your company or organization have repeatable processes or repeated repeated functions that they participate regularly with and that even if the company becomes or reorganizes that these functions remain stable over time it doesn't give us the same depth and and concise retrieval as subject based taxonomy but again it's it's a easier and less expensive to develop then subject based taxonomy so taxonomy there are several different types of taxonomy zeeeee that we see writing work with on are different information systems and so let's walk walk through some of them so at its most basic level you have your list style taxonomy where it's simply a black file of controlled words that often can be organized into alphabetically or otherwise to organize data or controlled vocabulary so this is by far the most common type of taxonomy that we use for metadata of course we'll all be familiar with these simple tree style taxonomy of course this is how our shared drives and network drives are structured you can think of them as a tree style taxonomy and I'll show an example later on about how we use these simple tree style taxonomy to create a managed metadata within CMS system then we start moving into more complex but rigorous types of taxonomy necessary for managing highly complex information for more accurate retrieval and processing of information so we move into something such as the classical hierarchical style where there are very specific rules around how information is subdivided as it moves deeper into the tree type of taxonomy so with a simple tree type taxonomy how information is subdivided or metadata subdivided into categories can be rather arbitrary and you can in fact have the same term showing up in multiple classification areas within a simple treat I'll style taxonomy now with a hierarchical style taxonomy the idea here is is that every piece of data has a single home and sent a single facet than in which it can be classified so you won't find the same metadata or the same data being classified more than one way of course this gets turning to turn on on etsy a little ear a little bit way in the real world where we're forced to look at information through a different lens where in the real world data isn't simply able to be classified along a single branch where we're talking about poly hierarchical style taxonomy now while these reflect the real world they also present real problems for information systems and for architects to try to implement meaningful taxonomy 'he's more typically will see a matrix style taxonomy where we create multiple facets in which to categorize information to be able to more accurately search for and retrieve and process information in our enterprise and probably one of the more obscure but still classified as a taxonomy type is your system map style taxonomy so here for instance I have a system map it is a metaphor of subway system representing different types of CMS systems and vendors and how they relate to each other but we could just as easily be looking at a map of the human body or human anatomy showing the different parts and relationships and classifications of the different types of organs or tissues or muscle groups within within the human body as a form of taxonomy so those are all descriptive metadata the next type of major classification of metadata is the administrative metadata m in large part administrative method it is metadata that's applied through systems whether it's automatically applied by your file system or by a CMS or its metadata that's triggered through a workflow or processed by a CMS system so as content moves from one state to the not to another state as it gets approved or becomes archived or while something moves from being unclassified to classified we rely on our systems to apply and manage this administrative metadata in in large part so the administrative metadata is metadata it's necessary for managing the content through its lifecycle ensuring that it's handled problem properly and only the right people can see this content at any one time so a lot of times we'll find that administrative metadata is not embedded or attached directly to the content itself and it is in fact the external to the metadata and linked to the metadata through a CMS or through other relational databases where that status metadata is maintained and finally we get into structural metadata structural metadata really is the defining the structure of the content itself so at a at a very broad level we are talking about how organization or how content is organized into a book a document or even a website but more specifically we're talking about structural metadata where it has specific meaning to us is in the structural metadata that we find within structured content itself so many of you may already be familiar with what XML is and how XML works but I just want to walk you through what it is that we're talking about and develop a deeper understanding what we're talking about we're talking about structural metadata so of course XML has been around for quite some time and it is an open standard managed by the good folks who bring us the world wide web and it is everywhere and everything with its under everything we work with today so XML itself we would find is of course under the covers on our cell phones and smartphones and tablets and websites and it's even under the covers with Microsoft Word access excel everything uses an XML under the covers but most of the time this XML is a is concealed we don't see it it's hidden it is truly metadata but necessary for having content flow from one point to another so we talk about XML its extensible markup language so you know what are what are we talking about really when we're talking about markup language while we were certainly thinking of the electronic age they really predate electronic publishing and what the markup does is it tells computers how to handle a render data of course free desktop publishing we use markup to tell desktop publishers how to lay out our manuscripts for publication so in distinction that I want to make though is between the two classifications of markup that we refer to so we have presentation markup and semantic markup as being a two broadest categories of structural metadata within xml so with presentation markup we're marking it up for how we want it to be published so in electronic terms we might mark it up such that we're identifying a paragraph of information and we want to italicize certain pieces of our phrases or words within that within that paragraph or presentation so this is very typical of how the web-based content works we lay content out for presentation purposes and then our web browsers take this HTML and they apply a style sheets to this presentation markup to know how to render it on your machine the next one however is semantic markup and this is really where I start to get excited about metadata is where we're not looking at content and how its marked up for presentation but how it's marked up for meaning so in this case we take that text and we identify what that content is rather than how that content needs to be presented so we've taken that previous paragraph and we've identified it as an introductory paragraph we've identified that first ring as a citation for a4 magazine and then of course where we had the italic before we wanted to italicize all what we're really trying to say there is we want to emphasize all so we're marking it up for meaning rather than for presentation and of course we can we apply style sheets to it and the rendering engine renders it much like it did previously as italics so it looks the same but it really isn't the same it's got so much more behind this now because we can identify content for meaning rather than just presentations such that we can take this and we can do all sorts of different things with this semantic markup as an example here I might take that citation and link it to a magazine database which then returns a URL that will take the the reader from this particular page to a subscription page or to a library page where they can look up a specific article on the web I can change emphasis from being at Alex to to being bold there's many different things I can do because I've marked up this content semantically so with semantic markup we can easily disambiguate content search based on meaning connect to other content and reuse or substitute new text because we are using semantic markup and with this semantic markup of course we also get the benefits of potentially multi-channel publishing where we can take content and we can support all different types of output from this this one source so here we're talking about did XML specifically as we move forward and what we're really talking about here is intelligent content which has been of course the staple for technical publications now for quite some time really this has been brought to light in a you know by by an Rockley and really adopted as gospel across many public technical publication organizations but more recently other parts of the enterprise have started to take notice of what intelligent content is and most recently the content managing sorry that the content marketing association has purchased the rights to an rockley's intelligent content conference and adopted it as their own and now they're espousing the virtues of intelligent content for marketing content within the organization where they're only now starting to learn about the power of semantically rich discoverable content and the value of putting that effort into semantically marking up the structure of that content early when the contents created rather than trying to enrich the content afterwards which of course leads to all sorts of other other problems so so I've walked you now through the the three main types of metadata from descriptive to administrative to structural and now we have a few minutes so I'm going to walk you through a couple of examples of how we need to better manage our metadata to help facilitate accurate metadata and exchange of metadata so first thing i want to show you refers to the interoperability of metadata and tools within your organization and just with a quick demonstration we're going to start with a word document here so I've set up a bit of a template here and I'm going to go ahead and just start so you're asking why am I writing a document this is a seminar about metadata what's going on hmm well you see momentarily all right so I'm using features within word very normal features of using fields which of course then take this metadata which I've written as content but take that metadata and apply it across the document so we see the document title day that i'm going to put status in here i'm going to change the status here proved so while as an author i think i'm just offering a document i'm doing more than that i'm also entering metadata about this document that the system can now use so when i go and i look at the the properties in this particular document I can see I've got the title I've got the author which was written in by the system got the subject company so a lot of really good metadata it's been picked up by the system so administrative metadata descriptive metadata which is all well and good and of course many of you have seen this many times before but let's see what happens to that metadata as we start to move it through different systems so when we move it into for instance PDF you so here we go here's a PDF that we created let's see how much of that metadata actually got moved over to the PDF so we see it brought over the tie brought over the author brought over the subject which was the the the the subheading in the the preview thought of previous document so it doesn't look like it quite brought everything over although I did bring over the company name precision content and the date that it was modified which is which is very good so we can see that it brought it over it relabeled some of this metadata interestingly I brought over some metadata that we didn't even necessarily expect that it would bring over so that was very good so now what we're going to do is we're going to take our content and we're going to push it up to SharePoint oops I'll stop that sorry I love live demonstrations all right okay so this is a great document got pulled up that's great that's what I wanted to see and I just have to check it in and now let's have have a look and see how much metadata came across from this particular document this is a great document here alright alright so when I can what I can do in here is I can actually go in and I can change what I can see in this particular library so I need to go to the documents library here that's right all right where I can now see the different fields that have says come across and from here I can see the approval state has come across the titles come across the authors come across but not all of the other data has come across interesting so when developing metadata it's important not just to come up with the proper metadata fields and and processes that also it's important to consider what tools you're using and what tools are in the chain all the way from content creation to management to publishing to ensure that metadata persists across all of the various systems so that it's it's consistent and it doesn't become disconnected or disparate from the original single source for the four for the artifact or for the content so understanding all the tools in the chain and how they handle it is is important an important consideration next when we look at so we saw how SharePoint manages metadata and actually SharePoint handles metadata very very well with its its term store and other features you can develop very sophisticated metadata management schemes and of course some very excellent plugins but we look at for instance the CMS we look at our easy data CMS we're looking at the next-gen product from easy data here we've got the ability to get deep into working with complex taxonomy that we can then use for classification of our content so I haven't got a very big one in here but just for demonstration purposes we can see that we've broken information down into different types we build a essentially a treat style taxonomy that we can then apply to content within our repository for retrieval so we go back to the repository and we go and we start looking at some of the content in our repository we can do things such as apply filters based on these these facets to be able to easily search and retrieve information within our repository so you know what's very important here is that we've we've got tools in the chain that we can use and pass information into the CCMS and then pass it through through to publication as well so that we can maintain consistency of our metadata across the chain and with that that that concludes my presentation and I think we're ready to go to any questions if we got any questions lined up Adam well thank you rob very informative webinar indeed um if you have any questions make if you saw you're welcome if there are any questions please put them in through the chat area right now in the meantime while we'll wait for some here's the first question Robin the first question is for word document that has embedded visual drawing any idea what metod Adam happenes get associated to this embedding and if SharePoint search that's two gets to pick it up embedded drawings and word documents what metadata gets associated with it I think it would depend a little bit on what the object is it's being embedded because different objects are would it would have different metadata behind them what gets picked up specifically it can be extracted and SharePoint natively I i don't think that data can be extracted natively by SharePoint itself but i would think that it's likely that there would be utilities that would be able to extract a certain amount of metadata from embedded images but if you'd like to follow up with me after the session i can have a look to see what i might have to be able to help you with that great thank you rob the next question has come in is what about keywords is metadata mm-hmm keywords very interesting so without a controlled vocabulary keywords are very difficult to manage so in most census instances keywords are not controlled so they they have somewhat limited value in terms of being able to search and retrieve content so I think so long as you can create a controlled vocabulary for your keywords you know you'll get what what you expect when they're uncontrolled it turns into more of a almost a folksonomy where content is classified by by various office so better than nothing certainly but not nearly as powerful as of working with a controlled vocabulary thank you rob the next question is I've been reading lately that XML is becoming pase on the web can you comment passe on the web uh well certainly html5 there's a lot of talk about how it is the semantics in html5 or supplanting semantics in XML schema such as as data but I wouldn't I would hesitate to say that it's it's passé but yeah I couldn't comment beyond that well thank you rob for that just give it a couple more seconds and see if there's any other questions that come in that will come in in the meantime I just wanted to let everyone know our next webinar will be wednesday September 16th at one p.m. eastern time title destruct introduction to structured authoring it's being presented by Rob Hannah who's doing who is presenting today and with that the internet laughs question has come in is can you address the different differentiation between internal metadata SME memes and external metadata keywords I'm sorry to read that again please sure can you enjoy a dress the differentiation between internal metadata parentheses SME SME names ok fantasies and external metadata parentheses keywords close parentheses internal external metadata so I think the question is being asked is metadata it's used for Smee names which is almost administrative metadata used for managing the content life cycle and content metadata that doesn't get passed through necessarily to the end consumer so the end consumer would have no means of seeing speednames as men the data on content whether it was content to pass through workflow or CMS versus keywords which are intended for publication in other words are intended to enrich the published content to facilitate easier of a search and retrieval so I would really differentiate those two as being more descriptive versus administrative metadata great thank you um then next question has come in is any thoughts on ontologies and data model standards I got a minute and a half so yes ontologies of course are the are a monster they're they're really related to taxonomy 'he's certainly but but very very specific now there's a lot of power in ontology they're difficult to build and and and maintain and you know there's just not a lot of information systems that easily integrate ontological data into into publishing others I know there have been a few tools that have attempted to merge rdf an owl on based on tala geez into xml content very very very powerful idea but with just not a lot of consumer buying in the in the marketplace so I think there's a lot of room to grow into ontologies and particularly as it comes to associating anthologies with with structured content but it requires a lot of processing power and a lot of sophistication and not just the tools but the people creating the content and managing that content and assigning values from an ontology to to content so a lot of power but I think we're still always away from seeing it leverage effectively great thank you rob and the last question the last and final question is out of curiosity what is is synonym ring it was on one of your slides okay all right a synonym ring is simpler than a thesaurus but it basically it does not establish a preferred term simply that relation to other words that are synonymous so synonym ring simply does exactly as it says it says this word is related to this word as it's related to this word as its related to the other word you know as we move into more levels of sophistication we need to define what the preferred term is and how those other synonyms are related and with the source we can add in other types of relationships other than exact synonyms so words that are similar in meaning or even ants the Nets up that helps
