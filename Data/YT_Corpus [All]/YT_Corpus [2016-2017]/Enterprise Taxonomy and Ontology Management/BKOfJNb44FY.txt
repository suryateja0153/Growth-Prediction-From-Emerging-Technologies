 this is the workshop about ASEAN plus database the idea is to give you an overview what it really is actually but then in a second part also to use it and see whether it can be useful to your research and see if you have feedback about how to improve it and what we could do better to iterate in the future because this is really just a quite early back version but we're working on improving it so my name is Manuel de gars most of you who know me already I've I'm a senior researcher here at SCC and I'm been leading this project here but also on the team have been wrong chunk win for the last few months working on on the script for spidering and meta tagging all the data and also setting up the the technical infrastructure and also Rashad Patel actually on the has just signed recently for the front-end design and for the user experience so thanks a lot you guys for for working on this project with me and thanks for your good ideas and also thanks a lot to everybody else who in the course of this project has given me feedback while we were just iterating and collecting ideas this is basically just the overview of the workshop we're going to i'm just going to briefly introduce the database what it actually is then i'm just on the very very surface i'll talk about my data quality research because i've been talking about it a little bit with some people here i can just formally introduce it but i will not go into depth it will just be an overview then we'll we'll start some use cases so i'll give you the address of the database later if you come here you can use your own computer otherwise we run through a few use cases here on this big screen and then I'm also talking about the future development of the database and then wrap up so what is this database what is our universe of the data it's basically the ASEAN all the ten countries is basically statistical data that's publicly available from the ten countries of the ASEAN plus also China and India so when we talk about data many of you think it's about maps or other things here we just talk about statistical data so these are the data sources that we considered here in the better version eight data sources in general we have over 100 data sources that we would like to include but here for the better we just basically had to narrow it down a little bit and the type of Statistics that's available basically it's the economic indicators the socio demographic data some vital statistics and then program related statistics something from you and habitat World Bank or 80b now so far we have it's a little bit less actually the 24 thousands maybe 18 or 15,000 I guess we have data sets from these countries in the database you see China as a lot because they release a lot of data about their statistical in their statistical yearbooks and some of these countries we couldn't access directly so we spider data from the World Bank or from a DB basically I'll tell you in a little bit how this actually works how we route which data fits to which country so here you see the years it's also actually quite interesting this is India you see there was a census in 2011 that's why all of a sudden the number shot up the data sets available but in general you see that most data goes back to the year nineteen ninety and really a lot of data we get here from 2000 we have a really broad broad selection so some data are available but they're not so easily accessible so that's why so far they're not yet included but this is what you can expect when you go on the database so I briefly want to talk about the ontology howdy how the information is organized in the database so basically here's just your plain old data set and this is something actually that function has been working on to write scripts to extract the metadata from these data sets and then write it into a database so it can be easily found so it can be referenced later so basically we took the name we took the name of the data set the name of d just the basic the basic description then all the years he extracted all the words eliminated the doubles sorted them so you can then find the database at the data sets then we also needed to know where does the data come from because I'm sure you've had this problem you downloaded a whole bunch of data sets then your honor then they're on your desktop you have no idea what they are where they come from with the database you don't have this problem anymore because everything is tracked every single data set we know where it's coming from and you can always access this information why is this important one is of course to find the data but another one is also for citation so oftentimes it's a little bit tricky how to actually cite a data set the way it's done in the in the publications that I work with you make a footnote and then you extract where does it from when what is it what's the source and when did you access it and you make this neat little citation you can automatically generate this now with with this database because whenever you download data sets it gives you a catalog of what you download it so you'll have immediately an easy citation reference that so far was the overview just really to keep it short because I know the fun will be when we actually use it so just a very brief introduction now here I want to talk about this data quality research that I've been doing basically most people will agree that the data are not always that accurate that we get here in the region and also everywhere else for example in Greece so that they lied massively about your GD so but what is really the problem we don't quite know you know it's easy to say oh it's not correct and you can't trust it but then you do because sometimes it's the only data that you have to work with so I looked into some of these data quality problems where I took basically the numbers of the gdp the nominal GDP of the National Statistics Office and compared it with what's available at the ASEAN step that's the statistics organization from ASEAN and here you basically can see that there are some discrepancies you see the Philippines if you go to their website their gdp was twenty-one percent higher than the same number for the same year reported on the ozzaen stats website so i was interested in why why that is that happens with everything even you can say well i don't trust the individual country i just go to the UN but even there you have issues you know they're not all the same these these numbers for the same things and then many people use the World Bank statistics and surely those can be trusted they think but actually also it's not really the case because there's huge divergences everywhere some countries are very consistent in just having the same method but here this could be because maybe they change their methodology maybe they you know report a different data we don't quite know so what I did is I looked into these dimensions of the data quality basically the institutional environment what what is the framework who's collecting these data and what is there what are their the laws behind the data then I looked into the processes that that they use for example do they have a standard do they have standard methods or can change that will whatever fits them best and of course is the statistical output here is just one example I'm just really quickly going through this if anyone's interested in this in more detail i'm happy to explain you more it's really just a brief introduction so basically if you look at one dimension it has several indicators what I did then I look all these texts you know the statistics acts the releases themselves the yearbooks also standards boards that there are members of maybe the IMF and etc etc and you can find a lot of information about how countries actually put together their statistics then I asked some questions and I rated them with on a scale from 1 to 10 and with that you actually then get a rating for the statistical quality of a country now now here it gets interesting because now you can basically compare what what is the quality of these countries in comparison with with each other so you can see if you just add up all these dif different dimensions you can see that there's some clear laggards that have very very low quality according to this method and some are quite high countries if they they could just not care they could say well okay that's just how we do things but with statistics you want to work internationally and then if you if your lower here than your peers in the in the international comparison then you basically lose in trust you can never really work on with the data to gain deep insights with with these ratings you can group the countries into different groups that are more advanced or less advanced and then you see where the problems are you can see you can quite clearly pinpoint in which areas these countries could improve to produce better data quality so you saw a group aiders there some issues Group B there's very similar issues in general they still have a lower level of statistical development and then in in Group C that's the lowest the least developed least developed countries they're basically just everything is really lacking and the quality overall is quite poor so if one goes on a website downloads some data about myanmar or Cambodia it's very very it would be advisable not to trust it one for one okay good so that was the introduction to the database that was the introduction to the data quality research now I would like to actually use the database if you have your computer then I can give you I can give you the address so you can login yourself this is an intranet web site so it will not work from outside of this building if you go on the website go on search because if you just go on the main that's just a placeholder site this is remind you this is really just a better version it's very early but I want to introduce it nevertheless and see where we stand at this point so basically go here go to search and then you see the overall search interface so with most of you have discussed this idea with these topics where we said let's think about statistics that would be useful for individual research projects and some of you have come back with ideas for example i believe link on you sent me something about your your research this morning the the group about bamboo wanted to know about GDP in different countries where bamboo grows so our idea is to make to produce topics that use this database that can then basically be accessed by everybody so we have a common ground we know what is the position of fcl or a sec in general on the population up to the year 2050 or urbanization prospects so we just have basically a general main statistical baseline so yeah I mean we can just run through one example and otherwise the database is always up so you can use it anytime with the address and of course I'm very happy for your feedback yes GDP okay okay get GDP so basically search title and content this you should keep enabled at all times because then remember how I showed you in the beginning the ontology how it extracts the metadata it will search in the table but also it will search all the words that are mentioned in the data set itself so you should always enable this we basically made this box to just see what happens if we search just a title or just everything so now here you can select which country so what did you say link on everything right all country so i want to know gdp for all countries in the ASEAN plus okay year here we just leave it because this also is a somewhat experimental feature at the time being we found that most people aren't really interested in years because you have two years anyway in the data set itself so if you restrict it then you just you know basically restrict your universe of data sets do you have available for for searching so this basically then you hit this little icon here and you'll see it found for the query GDP it found 13 1334 data sets so now this is from these i think approximately 10 different sources some of the National Statistics offices of the country's I believe Indonesia also China and then we have the UN the UN habitat the ADB the World Bank so basically with with one search query it searches all these data sets and basically you see here some statistics about the statistics where are they from in this case most comes from from the ADB from the asian development bank but some also from there from the world development indicators that's World Bank and then you have some individual ones so basically now if you go if you scroll down on your page you have a list of all the data sets that it found so if you just want to quickly see what this is you go to this icon here this one this little icon it gives you a screenshot of the data set so basically now if i want to download any of these data sets then I can click here you see on this on this box I scroll down and I say download you see this folder here it will create a folder where ever you I mean here in this browser it was setup to automatically download into the download folder but if you have it set it up so it asks you for it for a destination then you can type in where you want it saved and so now you have this folder here on your database on your hard drive it's it's an archive so it's zipped so you can you have to unzip it first extract so now here this is basically what you get this you see this is the GDP national accounts from the Asian Development Bank this one was just the first or the second that I selected but it basically the returns that I got on that page was basically a query into this description of the data sets and the names so every single data said that you should get should somewhere in the data have the word GDP and basically now let's look at this citation guide with this file that's automatically generated when you hit the download button you will see which name which data set basically is what what is the name of the data set and how can I make a citation to that data set so here you see you have to name a few of the source the year and you have the that the title of the data set and the the address and the date when it was spidered so the date when we downloaded it and put it into the database so with this you can basically you can work you can write a paper with this you can work with these with these data and and collect data through the database and you always have a reference shall we do another one or is it is it clear so far yield okay crop yield for grain like the date range right now I don't really want to use it because it's still experimental the date range but yield maybe rice yield okay good rice yield philippines singapore rice yield in singapore philippines or i sealed in philippines and sources which sources should we use all or basically we can say we just want a DB or we only want World Bank or we don't only want you n sources maybe for now let's use all because I suspect that maybe there's not that many right now so see now we have five returns for rice yield and it did you see here this is interesting because you got some from other countries too why is that because both names basically it said Philippines and China in the same data set maybe it was exporting rice from or importing rice from or to Philippines with China it's maybe something like this so so it will also give you just the countries that is it will give you returns that these countries have relationships with so here maybe we can use all right shall we try select all let's say we want them all we want to see what's happening and now I have these five datasets you see for from ADP one from the world development indicators then we could go here and I'm quite sure we would find rice yield somewhere but let me show you again the comma based that overview file because that's really powerful when you have of course more than one data set so now you see the database the data set names you see where they come from which year they are for what the official title is off the data set and the source of course and also the date we accessed it that's basically one one other example and then of course you know it's up to you what you're doing with these data it will not do all the work for you but at least you can access data from very different sources quite easily and conveniently and the way we think this is helpful is as an entry point to research of course if you have very deep data that you collected yourself in the field then of course you know this will not be all that helpful unless you want to see relations or you want to get other data that is maybe not related but the data here is mainly on the national and on the sub-national level meaning provinces regions so we don't have cities right now there's no village area I mean it's not very disaggregated it's still quite course but it's everything that's available publicly on these websites and then of course you could you could use this as a starting point and then build on it with your own work and does anybody have any questions about this so far yes so have the data sources for this last query so the world development indicators that's the World Bank and adb that's the Asian Development Bank the data sets that we downloaded are exactly the same that are also on the websites of the World Bank on of the Asian Development Bank so you know it's it's as reliable as you believe these institutions have done their homework and I personally think that the ADB and the World Bank are quite trustworthy institutions definitely more trustworthy than going to you know some aggregator website I mean there are some aggregator websites that query all the sources of publicly available data but there are often times you lose the source information so you don't really know where it's from you definitely don't get a citation guide and you also don't quite know what they did with the data because oftentimes they work with the datasets put them in a certain format so none of has been down here we basically just aggregated the data may detect it and put it into the database itself which window the pop-up window aesc ESC Escape yes well it wouldn't happen unless somebody tends to it it doesn't automatically update because you have to think about it like have you ever been on a website of these of these statistical National Statistics offices maybe the Indonesia you've seen so basically you have a whole bunch of menus you go there and then you can search maybe or you have a table builder you can create a table and then you can hit download and you download the table what Roman did is he wrote scripts that do this automatically it's basically simulating a user doing this and then we let it run for a few days and basically aggregated all the data that's on these sources and to update it you have to do it again but of course you know one one idea is now to basically have a process for more frequent updates it's very good point this is really this for us was one it was a feasibility study can this be done and if one wanted to do it how can we do it automatic you can get you can always have a whole bunch of people sitting there and download a lot of data sets but that's just not really scalable so we wanted to try to find a way with with programming to to try to aggregate all these datasets organize them in a way that they can be found and so far our universe is that big you know we only had I think eight to ten data sources but if you have a robot doing this work you could have a hundred data sources and that's that will be the next step for now we had to really iron out the problems see what the issues are for example some of these data are really not easily accessible you know you you have in some countries you need accounts to even see the data to even download the data then other countries they don't make excel files available they only make pdfs available others they only have HTML websites and then the tables are actually images in in the website so it's very hard to analyze these data and and you know it's it's not straightforward so this basically is one way how one could approach this think we have a pretty good road map for that yes the way work properly you mean there's some scaling it goes beyond the window yeah yeah that you know we're still ironing that out let's still a problem well this one is chrome and this is on on windows i used firefox on the macintosh yes firefox you can use well whether the sources that's up to the source but we think that the data that we have in the database is a mirror of the source we did open the database the datasets to make the screenshots and it may be that maybe something happens there you know it's never foolproof one hundred percent but that's exactly what we were very careful about that we have the original data sets because if you go on an aggregator website most sometimes they take the data the data sets that they find somewhere and then they put it in one format so you already have a conversion a risk for conversion errors and here we did not do any conversion basically we have a library that points to these files yeah but see for example the data quality it's not clear-cut it's not black or white you can never say this is great and this is always really horrible for example the World Bank the World Bank has very poor data on Myanmar you know a lot of gaps a lot of holes I don't know why you know for example the UN unka tats that has really good data on Myanmar so you know the data are there they're available some some bodies they report them other stone then the world bank also they oftentimes use their own methods so let's say you have data in the World Bank indicators about GDP what happens you know the world bank doesn't make their own research into GDP they basically they they make a data request from the statistics office for raw data and then they feel they sent them a table they have to fill out the table send it back to the World Bank and then they work with this and make their own calculation so the World Bank has some proprietary ways to aggregate data and that's not always comparable with other way so the World Bank if you just want a quick one is definitely trustworthy if you say data source World Bank what you will question it but then again if you really want to drill deeper later I would not necessarily work with the World Bank yeah but happens is then your term was too wide let's say you search for GDP okay so you search for TDP all you get 1334 but we had you see basically we searched countries all data source all then we can narrow it down here we can say which countries do we really want you know maybe maybe you want all of ASEAN and maybe let's just go to the ADB let's say what they have you know and you can narrow it down then and okay it's still a lot 700 but you can start to whittle it down then you can look into individual countries for example if you go to let's say you say gdp I just want the gdp for Indonesia from from the Indonesian statistics office you know just the official data that's out there let's see what that is 24 datasets sure it'd still be more than just a few numbers but I mean you can you can manage that and now you can download them you can say select all or you can inspect them before like we did you know with the with the screenshot and now you see you have your ID for Indonesia you have your 24 data sets about GDP in one in one way or another it's very very hard to find cities data that's consistent usually it's point in time data somebody made some project about you know benchmarking 50 cities in 2008 and that was it you know but there's very little data that is continually updated on the city level right now the granularity is sub-national so you have provinces regions so then you have you and habitat data but it's also point in time you know they didn't update this over time so we you know we looked into descent if you remember we discussed how we should approach it and I think the city level data would be the next step because you will always in one way or another need the overview data to put it in relation you want to see you know does this even make sense we basically have just the basic menu of statistics that you would get in a statistical yearbook so you have T the population your demographic indicators economic indicators like GDP income things like these and then also some vitals that is experts deaths you know these kind of things and then you have program related for example if you have a un habitat where they looked into the quality of life of cities then you have that but I can make a list if you like I mean in the beginning I had these remember at these eight sources and then I showed which kind of data is available okay future development of course right now we have quite a limited number of sources the idea is to broaden the number of sources and also add more data sets that we have already for example we have all the data from the Open Data Platform India I believe but we didn't meta tag it yet it's not in the database yet but the India data we actually have a lot so we're now I'm thinking how can we put this there there were some issues how can we target how can you organize it so they the idea is just more of the same then also I want to work on these topics and use cases so some of you already had some feedback but if any of you have ideas that is research specific where you say look I would like a comparison of gdp in all the ASEAN countries for example or I would like comparison of gdp versus population in all the ASEAN countries then we can make this and it will basically then become a topic that is accessible also hopefully on this database website to everybody also right now we're working on the front thing front end and the user experience so right now it's still you know it's it's really technical but the idea is that it can be easily accessed also from paths from mobile devices then also one thing that's quite interesting I think is the AP is because right now we have a my sequel database running for the library but if we had a rapper that would basically create a data stream out of the individual data sets and access this with AP is then one would never have to download the data it could always stay in the database and you'd basically program an application to analyze the data directly on the API so that's also something right now I'm looking into then there's also finks finks is a really elegant search engine where you start typing and it will in google style already populate your results page so you never have to hit search and then it gives you you know your your returns it automatically generates this all the time on the back end it's also something right now I'm investigating then this also would be interesting I think some of you have collected data that of course you know many of you work on your research or your PhD so its proprietary you don't want to share it but other data is actually available for sharing so I would like to explore ways to take the data that that from research projects are available to put in the database and that I think would be really interesting that also I want to address in the in the coming months then another big topic is open data open data platforms there's right now six open data platforms in the ASEAN and they all have AP is so maybe we don't have to spider the data sets on our hard drive may detect and put it in the library and then download them maybe we can directly use the API from the open data platform to query the database and then r-mo we would have this update problem no longer because we would basically outsource the updates to the open data platform we directly directly query the distance and the interesting thing is then to take this and mix it with data that we have locally because already you can use open data portal but the idea is that you can use everything at once at the same time so and then of course linked opened the LOD that's also really interesting I think this is basically a way to do away with the whole database structure in a sense to say let's just tag each data set in a certain way and then publish it on to a certain on to a certain server infrastructure so it becomes part of this linked open data cloud so i'll talk about open data and linked open data just a few minutes because i find it so interesting this is the open data a issue that i just brought up there's already six portals here but again you know like always in these countries and elsewhere to the quality is not that high some of the open data portals have very few data sets just you know less than 100 some of them are really poorly organized others just have PDF files they're just libraries but it still call themselves open data portals so that's one thing i'm looking into right now how are these day our reliable are these data sources are they useful for us and if they are how can we access them and put them into the database and now linked open data some of you may have seen this nice graphic here this is the linked open data cloud let's briefly just say what is open data so there's these five identifiers what actually linked open data is one is it's of course open then you have these URIs that identify the data precisely they are published on the Internet of course you have RTF format and then you use sparkle to query them I think we could have in the long run SEC as one of these nodes in this cloud why is this interesting because then we could query all the data sets that other parties have published into the cloud and mix it with our own data for very rapid finding of correlations find other relationships we can make mashups very quickly I think this would be really interesting right now most people just make their own data they make their data tanks I'm on the on the hard drive but this would be really really powerful thank you very much thanks a lot and does anybody have any feedback any questions what person is our data do you think we're missing out by only looking at an English data in it easier or China or India you may open data or just any general of data sources that you look for like I know that the Chinese statistical organisation they duplicate their data from Chinese and English yeah correct really missing anything there yeah say there's a lot of valuable rice data in Thailand but it's only yeah Thailand's the problem yeah yeah well that's that's part of the data quality research as well Thailand has has barriers to accessibility and one of them is the language barrier and also the date format they have a really strange buddhist date format so you never quite know which date you're actually looking at and sometimes sometimes they're converting it sometimes they don't so you have two year 2557 and so it's quite hard but I think the more specific we get the more we miss out you know once you go on the city level below the regional below the national and then the regional level most data are not translated into English but hopefully I think because many of these statistics organizations are opening up and also now when once day because they want to make this asean economic community they are actually quite open i think to feedback so maybe if we had an interesting data solution we could approach them and try to work with them on some of their data issues but but you're right we do lose the more granular data we need the more the less accessible it is it's it's a problem yes yes this in March and funnily enough we started off trying to develop an index for the sustainability of City consumes on long way back that actually the discussion was not to create a database exactly like this but to see whether it was possible to use publicly available data to collect and indexes City sustainability right and it's been a remarkable ride since then I mean we've learned and you know particularly Manuel has learned an enormous amount about the kind of data which are available the pitfalls the problems of interpretation and so on we've also learned that this ambition but that nonetheless the were very good data available at the national level and essentially this is what the database has been built on so really in a few months I think it's quite extraordinary how much we have learned I say we mostly Weatherly but the institution has learnt about the nature of data and I think as this process has gone on we've also become more excited about what a powerful research tool this is because all researchers have this need for data if the there's a incredibly complicated Google out there of data you go into the internet and you can get tables and they may be wrong they made may be right so Manuel has put an enormous amount of effort into trying to understand the origins of the estate which data you can rely on and so on and so what we felt is that although there are a number of competitor organizations and individuals who are collecting large databases of open data and open data is almost a sort of mantra now there's a big difference between opened a tote and access and data which you can actually believe yes I think although we started off wanting to have a database about cities we've gradually understood that that is perhaps too ambitious but nonetheless having a database of the highest possible quality of data which are available at a national or regional level gives us a tremendous sort of research advantage with in sec and the point I wanted to make really is that this is not simply a project that Manuel has been doing for his own interest or for a small group it really is intended to be a tool which is useful to all researchers in mrs m fcl and therefore we really do want you to use it and also to contribute to it it's it's to some extent it's a collective project that if through your research you find yourself accessing data which are not in the database then we really do urge you to put in that little additional effort so that it becomes part of that database yeah so that is really what we're trying to do we've got a short term sort of one year project that Manuel has been driving with great energy to turn this into a database to make the data accessible but we hope the database will have a life beyond them you have and that it will actively grow because of the yet the various researchers yes yeah I think that's a very good point but you know to just to come back to that initial goal of the sustainability I mean it was about the SDGs the sustainable development goals we thought how can we make a database that is on the city level and that that reflects the problems that have to do with SDGs namely the urban sdg number 11 but the issue is just that most of the city data if you want current data that's continuously updated you have to go to the city government and these data are not necessarily publicly available you need to gain the trust from these governments now how can you gain the trust by showing that you actually work responsibly with data that they give you and by creating relationships and that I think we can do many of you already have contact with governments you already have launched a data request from governments but I think it would be great if there was a platform on which these efforts converge because otherwise it's just little silos that go up and and one research group may have really good data but in other ways as I cannot access it has to start at zero so once we have a platform on which these data initiatives can live I think we have gained a lot and the city level data and the sustainability data I think we should still aim for but we knew I believe we needed to do this this groundwork first because otherwise we started from nothing and we already wanted to 100 and now we have something we're a little more advanced that so the gap became much smaller to actually get really high quality data directly from city governments any other questions any other feedback yes heaters or index before i move to a sale I've been working for four years in on us on the project that is benchmarking sustainable Urban Development so we are working with 160 indicators and we tried to benchmark Singapore against other 12 cities and that's really a four years project we were 20 researchers and it was such a painful process because we have so many data but the problem is we have not really compare because for example that waste indicator in Japan is really different from the way they counted it in Indonesia or other countries so I think this kind of project is a research project could be very interesting but it's a different nurses all together I think it's really like three hundred percent commitment for this kind of project yes i agree i mean it's it's it's one thing to say we want this but you also have to do it and it's very very it's very tricky tricky but i think i'm very glad that wrong tune was available to help with acquiring the data with organizing it with writing the scripts automating a lot of the processes so basically i think it's really possible to do to make such a platform it's absolutely possible but you know we still have to do it and it will not create itself in our experience finally because it was so difficult to get the data yes and then the people started to get so possessive because they had to clean the data sure the data and finally they want to share him correct yeah I understand it is quite silent the other this sad and that happens all the time but see I think that's why I'm so excited about this open data namely the linked open data approach because there you don't have that anymore you know and you can already release something that's quite dirty because it doesn't matter if it's if there's gaps and errors you can analyze the data than with machines if they have these tags you can you can really query them you can query millions of datasets very quickly and it's very painful to go through every data set and clean it manually but once you can have a computer do it on a large scale then I think maybe that goes that's a little bit less you know just being possessive about the data that they got because all the data is available publicly anyway would like to add the timeline of this project so we will close this project in end of March so it's idea could be done but to see if there is a single user or to users who would say yes we need them who can create the case that we can understand that is actually full and better than simply just go to one of these sources directly to justify that we actually need such a software at the moment it's a proposal that something like that will be useful for if I was now in the shoes of a research I would I can come up with all kinds of features that the city should be visual like in the picture which we see and then we should have different slides but it's not about coming up with ideas for features is coming up yes what you've seen today I didn't really use it because I want to do this or that and can you help me to use the existing beta version to show me how I can get these or death and these are the cases I think shimano L asked for and that has a time dimension to it is not a five-year project which started and we will continue it will end next March so if you have a cake he will be here in tomorrow no monday december but then when you ramp up the project that is the whole februari or march so i think for those who have no cases it's also important to say we have no cases and we will never have a case or for those who have a case which is not yet also clear to say yes we have but we have not yet had time to look into the specifications but it's very clear that we need something like that in the near future so to figure out whether this project has a future beyond a march so I added this timeline yes yes and that's very important it's a very good point because it's very important that we now get feedback from you guys you know if nobody uses it then you're right you know then maybe nobody needs it but so many people told me personally that they would really like to have something like this so I think this is now really a chance to start using it and then also try to improve it you know then you can also say it's not useful because of this and this and this and then we can think about what what could we do with you know the limited time we have to actually make it more useful but in general really i urge you that's why i also handed out these addresses please use this database and give feedback doesn't matter if it's negative it's no problem but i just want to learn how people actually work with data yes yes issues is how with the licensing of the data the lion king of the Dead all all open data license to be used freely are they're strict II what did open data that's not the quality of course yes you mean open data or publicly available data actually I was asking about the open data open data and answer because because open data is the term open data means that the data is for free for freely available and do you don't have to pay to get it and also that you can use it for anything you want because there was a issue like that was going on online about the most of the publishers they were not licensing they were not giving a clear license yes data correct yeah but why yes i have taken by styles and all you okay the case on what we can use what we cannot use whether you have to give a measure for some 360 data set up do you have to list all individual 16 sources itself do you not also this time many colleges so that is one case which we as a pending small the station to the local boy they also accepted that they know what they will use it that we are not that cheap high-risk topic series at that issue ASAP as long as possible credit they have lunch at all so sweet it is stated which you most like at the meter data exactly publication yes but see with open data I mean opened a dose really definition and many countries say oh yeah this is open data but then they don't really follow this definition and so one really has to look into it and I think that's why I you know I'm excited about it because they're you don't have that problem anymore if you really see it through then you can solve a lot later related problems and for us I think it's really interesting because that is issue you have data by special request from the government they say you can never use it for some anything else than this and so you know that's really really hard what can you do with it but the others just many questions still and it's it's a you know a wide open field really anything else like I said you know you can always ask me things we can always discuss things also maybe I'll follow up with you in the next week at some point whether you know how how you couldn't imagine yourself using it using the data etc etc so i also want to learn what you're doing with the database and to see whether we can make it better thank you
