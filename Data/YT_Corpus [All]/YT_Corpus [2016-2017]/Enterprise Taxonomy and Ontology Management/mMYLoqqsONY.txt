 you you alright so a couple of announcements before we could go are there will be a lot of poses particular block the rubber bug not a mob engine running low so stay tuned we're never basically when we try to capture aspects of the beating itself in that aspects of what happened in requisitions in here just have a reference so to speak will set up length to be free for that and secondly I'm Collin Klein um Aquarian Sydney is or editing when I was in editing a special issue of the journal philosophical explorations on these issues I don't know when the ad will be for the notice of Jersey but it's a few months out yeah probably six o'clock my papers and we send that around as well this if you have a paper on this topic and you have a place to send it that's a good place alright so when we go into middle stopping on the hour too much yeah thing for that where it will end up okay so what we going to do now is just do a little bit of a summary for each of the groups um and people should feel free to pitch in as and when so I'll kick off with what we talked about in our group because I can't think without writing i'm going to write um so i think we our discussion focused on three issues well let's don't talk about the pluralism you rolled one thing we sort of finished without reason so that there are coral taxonomy 'he's multiple taxonomy of power in the psychological realm so we talked about relationship between three subjects on basis as it were and then don't we here so i'm going to be simplistic there's the text on your books psychology there's what we might call scientific psychology and then there's my discussion focused on on the third text me dead of psychiatry and taxonomy that dsm works with and our doctors looking to improve on and that is questioned about the relationship between these three taxonomy zand questions about the degree to which we should expect want to be answerable to each other whether they have some kind of autonomy an initiative background here is whether they're in whether they should we should expected any different jobs for us whether they should be article two different norms so discussions of folk psychology traditionally got going with thinking about put physics and when it comes to can scenario relationship between visits and photophysics people tended to think that there's they're in the same business in the business and describing us in physical structure of the world and you might think of a folk psychology scientific psychology are in the same business in the way the physics from the same business so there really shouldn't be we should bring them into alignment with premature exciting exciting goes in one direction we should change our clocks are cooking another way think in a different kind of business it's not in the business of articulating the structure of the mind in the same way it's a way of understanding people for the way of predicting the behavior and that doesn't require articulated structure mine in the same way designs that scientific psychology does so I mean that's important issues because the way which you might eliminate construction science and scientific psycho you might not apply directly to a way which you might eliminate construction frozen so there are big issues there we just touched on what might be worth people thinking about in more detail we'll talk about relationship between psychiatry and psychology and some people were suggesting that maybe the constructs of psychiatry are not possible to quite the same knowns that constructs a scientific psychology are and some people in our group that they really ought to be a very close connection here which is sort of the approach that our dog seems to be soon so the question about what kind of jobs these technologies are doing is important for a related question of pluralism the thought that each of them might be legitimate not actually competing vs kind of a competitor conceptual where one things that if they ask where our odds with each other one who's got to go villains construction one has to go the other one so that's one set of issues another set of issues that we talked about concerned issues that you might distinguish between internal ism and external they go over action question at least as I see it as whether our categories are individuated in terms of environmental relations or whether they're as it were simply categories that ought to be answerable only to brain structure from the New York neural structure so we saw that some of the talks people are as if we're assuming the taxon amazing ought to be done only in the basic internal information other people in the talks during the weekend and suggested that at least some constructs are individuated in terms of relations and there was an interesting discussion on a group as that some people focus was obviously there are critical role as a group psychological constructs and other people seem to think that this is obviously the right way to go another think one could be a pluralist him in maybe some psychological constructs are as it were only individuated generally some money externally so you it's not a case of them one model fits all but there is for each construct you can ask which type of construct me where their environmental relations are constitutive of that on the contrary and then there's a knock on question which we touched on how does that debate relate to questions of revising taxonomy so one way to think about what some people are doing is they're requiring a mapping between brain tax online taxonomy neural taxonomy in psychological tests on me that seems to bind the kind of journalism if you're established about tax on amazing and the 11 mapping it's not necessarily a given so that's one reason why this is important to methodology copy taxonomic division second set of issues of the third set of issues that we talked about was how to think about novel constructs so one way to think about novel contract formation is to have a few minute he rebound so terms get defined normal constructs get defined by their role there inferential role in a theory so you want to know what someone so means about X will look at the theory of inferential connections that talk about X place but some of what is finally done here is looking to define novel contracts in a relatively theory for your theory neutral way being quiet istic about theories and not being and not making a lot of theory or commitment so if that's the case and one can certainly see the attraction than that then how do these constructs get their interpretation we didn't come up with any answers that question but we did I think you agree that's an important question to be addressed so yeah there's anyone in my group no takers want to chip in things I left our you want to move on to the other groups now or just anyone want to react or respond with you we're making this up as we go home jack abrams made report so any good to believe that okay but maybe you want to tell you out the russian illegible thank you thats this is useful because some of the things we talked about were identical we started with different started from a different starting point however we were asking about issues surrounded the quality of taxonomy so how do you think about well things were better taxonomy and what kinds of evidence you would be fine convincing as it were to make revisions to tattoo taxonomic entry so organizing it in the way that Paul did in his talk for the various kinds of moves you can make in a taxonomy for loving and splitting and tree tree jumping and branch jumping all things you can do what specific kinds of evidence would count towards motivating those groups and one that we came to a villa discussion is a different sense of coral taxonomy that played a role he answered a question where the taxonomy is where there are psychological taxonomy right but the roles of violent at times there are ways individuating psychological phenomena and then ways of individuating biological mechanisms and then there are similar but also distinct issues if both of those levels and then of course there's the issue not just the mapping between those levels but what rule evidence plays between levels right how is it our tectonic categorizations at the psychological level should change or inform the way we divide both mechanisms and then then the reverse how is it that when we identify mechanisms how should that play a role of changing or inform categories that we have a psychological level so that's that's a topic a deeper relationship than merely napping we're putting them to correspondence in this case it really is a question of how across those levels and so some people thought that once you've identified a common underlying mechanism even if there are apparently districts like a lot of categories that should be sufficient evidence for for combining those categories that's maybe a little bit too simplistic as was pointed out because there is sense in which there are mechanisms that if the same thing that underlies everything took like hebbian plasticity everywhere all right so so if a bit more sophisticated than that but they're less there might be a sense in which I want to identify the mechanism at the right level that underlies head would've thought to be destroyed then you might that might be evidence for psychological categories with the same oh and likewise the opposite memory is our case in a point here once you have identified mechanisms that differentiate which in processes that have and these superficial psychological superb that provides that interaction splitting of enhancers so and so in this this or if you have in general so what exactly what a role sort of evidence of plays and grounding yeah and justify grounding to justify psychological 1.2 came up in that regard was you might think that expenditure power especially explanatory depth favor of mechanistic a categorization favor of letting the psychological categories follow very closely the mechanistic ones though the mechanisms it was however pointed out that there are some kinds of categories that are really unified by functional considerations they might still be useful even though they're not necessary those functions are going to unify across across levels nevertheless the functional categories can play a role in helping us understand how ID is at the same level fit together so that seems like legitimate scientific role even it's not strictly explanatory one and then we certainly also came out of oddness questions about this initial investigation largely by my own reallocations so another phone thought this was the speaking she was i but there's this issue as well for us right which is what exactly is up for grabs what do we have to keep fixed to not go totally off the rails how do we choose what to keep fixed and to what extent as we move forward on this are we always constrained by theory the way the Tim pointed out right where typically novel concepts get elaborated in the context of theories try to extend them or to alter them to fit data and to what extent can we actually you know in a more theory into a fearful be fully possible but come up with novel constructs for which then we will extend theories and I don't know the internet question and the sale group wasn't clear on whether it was a real issue there some seem to think that no actually this is just business as usual you're always going to be a mixture of theory of data and there's nothing new here I'm not convinced that that's that's tribute speaking for myself I think that some of these analytic methods may actually be giving a new epistemic tools that could drive consulate so this might actually be sort of one of those moments where something genuinely new is happening I don't know that's true options i think to question worth considering and what else and whether it was told to keep it as a single tear or whether we should split it and then we spoke about the usefulness of the concepts that we have Andrew text on me and then the question came up useful to who in cash wish r but I think I think one of the things that unified the discussion across the whole one identified was a reasonable discussion was this issue of discriminatory and what kind of discriminability are appropriate and what certain audiences and in terms of thinking about all these relationship between stuff for various levels just as you can discriminate something doesn't necessarily mean in every case that that's gonna be useful and one question by the way and I know there's a lot of work and the philosophy of science on this question but if it comes up here I think particularly pointed way which is what kinds of news when this account is legitimate because there are folk kinds of usefulness that name again this kinase backed into this right there are both kinds of usable as that may actually dip it from scientific or clinical mental distance and and insofar as usefulness so pragmatic considerations as opposed to more strict explanatory on them especially multi-level very ones to what degree pragmatic usefulness considerations are always just placeholders for eventual scientific replacement with with mechanism and to what extent day actually always retain legitimacy so I mean like that leads back to somewhere else to make some philosophy science comes up here collaborations from members of the group in the context of the novel prospects up there was this question about the degree to which you we can get away from the relatedness of our observations right that's our current autologous now baked into everything to be measured yeah absolutely and nnz in the question along those same lines of when we do those kinds of our analyses what actually are your premiums like how much are we inherited from the conditions under which we took those metrics how are doing Erin just from the enterprise in general and how much it is it belonged to Oh okay so um so the end of the discussion yesterday on his talk had mentions that you know when we design scientific tear any kind of tax on the meeting it always comes terrorism but it comes sometimes with certain boring spots and so then the question becomes if a pluralistic perspective is what we want as a corrective what's the best way in which people from different disciplines may come together and interact to answer this question I mean clearly disclose with this comment the end the conference was and one of the things that came out of how we can engage in more fruitful interactions is that in within these individual taxonomy the individuals who use them you know I mean first of all what is folk psychology is a mixed ontology is everybody carving that up in the same way it's important for people who use that taxonomy to be conscientious about what the terms actually be and there's consistent across the board same thing is true in scientific psychology some people thought that we made progress in moving from talk about states like memories to talk about processes but is something lost in that transition but scientific psychology are is processed talk consistent across investigators in terms of helping to deploy terms and he probably operationalize those Turner's similarly similarly and duros that's right i mean i don't know we're putting different things but any given time I mean a lot of session now Parker you know at any given level there are certain concepts that people are deploying and people aren't ossining with conscientious about the way they're deploying those terms or the way that they're investigating and I think everybody here that is if this conference is in the camp that is very thoughtful about these things and I guess the question as well you know how how we move forward and I think in individual disciplines one of the comments was that the training should be that we train people to think carefully stance and of course you know we might sometimes philosophers think that they are really great great at this and I'm not saying that they're not but sometimes they have specific blind spots that there it bent too and so there should be the claim was that there should be within each is discipline some conscientiousness and some training of new investigators and new scholars coming to be thoughtful about these things because if ultimately what we're trying to do is talk about how different acts on amis relate to each other or a device a new tax on we ought to be clear about what kinds of things we're actually talking so that's sort of a paraphrasing and certainly can capture all that came out of our discussion yeah I do since there were the two other things that seem to have come up but the one was being the way that it taxonomy gets its powers through it's being used and such as if different disciplines and different subgroups within those disciplines use their taxonomy ins two different ends and so the mean one of the ends is through this interdisciplinary work employer taxonomy but it's not the only time that attacks on this deployed we saw the story of the DSM where this is this group gained enormous power for successful deployment of the taxonomy that you know was in French for three years and then his middle return so the notion that the taxonomy aren't just conceptual structures but actual practices that engage in was it was a thing that we serve talked about with respect to both the training of how the taxon is used but also in terms of the ways that taxonomy can canary in non open ways that other ways that attacks on you just as a missing structure of here and then there was a lot about that there's the question of whether we want to revise attack something there's also the question of how you translate across tax on so you could wait and how we get to Google concept what grown one taxonomy to another and what does it mean to take a concept out of its taxonomy and then place it in a different context how how is the meaning of that preserve change or get to the other things we have and anyone else who has better memories than us well sort of locating the cognizer the way most was this this notion that we really need to give categories there do i really respect them and really not were simple either but also be willing to be grateful of them right so it's a balancing act of me of perspective and he criticism of categories right it's our analysis difficult 18mm i was interested representing me taxonomy this folk psychology that makes taxonomy I was wondering GG well I I don't know that anybody actually color expense money they said that it's not I came to it was out I was just saying that this is not me some people think there's no such thing as a book psychology that mean after years of reading and science fiction and scientific literature that's infiltrated people are just thinking about these in all sorts of ways and even in philosophy like lots of debates about a little psychology is and it's very different ideas even move on to better to get rid of some of the things that theory at all just said practices yeah so to say that there's a stickball psychology and then we've gotten away from it and even when we do think we're just away from their awkward is reapplying exact same concepts and there was some sort of comment about but it is sort of a way of othering something that we're kind of dismissive and we're kind of moving but sometimes black critical reflection and we're still using those exact same categories to be read categories things that are tweeting now biscuits so it does not matter on ecology I just meant that I think some of the process talk has filtered back to the folk remember the football can you think about you in the audience up in front so everyone was thinking about their world and they're now like just in other words that we use and how it's been influenced by science and that's how people talk about we brainstorming and all these sorts of things are just pedagogical things that education will use for their fourth and fifth graders that's clearly influenced of the bulk thing and the diversion of the tactic now it shows before purchasing combat terms of oppression what seemed to be having now is kind of why do you do this in psychology so mindfulness and meditative practices changing vocabulary and there's some this is something i didn't think the idea and its development other disciplines and you've got to do something external and this is a very Keller is professor of physics and at Harvard and he works on me and he's done lots of stuff about generating chemical stuff using quantum mechanics but he also published a book a few years ago on how to hear music and it's an amazing thing I'm looking at the first the details of musical how the vibrations work itself where it turns out their stuff about where and the year of different levels you can get things and it seems to me that this sort of detailed scientific stuff about how waves work and how they can be picked up in various parts of my body how the complicated interactions make a difference should be something that could very very well if you inform and help guide work using brain scans and stuff to find out about appreciated music and the idea that you can do one without the other whether you should just ignore the stuff that Erich Callison finding out is ridiculous in my opinion is that this fits back to something about train there are some issues here you can't go and it's not like we may have mistake necessarily it's just really hard yes because we aim time we specialized training specialized knowledge we also need to that cross it's just hard to do you know frankly especially if it is like Western grip but other other places represented room philosophers plus or design too often actually really well placed do that so I'm hope that people that challenge sirleaf across disciplines just because the opportunities pressure of different time philosophers that they are gives you the greater opportunity to do that sort of work there's there's a shoes for she driven anywhere but Patrick when you sell fire someone needs to do is our interdisciplinary translational workings in my senses and if they went almost lost respond so I think the we talked a lot about institutions actually and it is really important because being interdisciplinarity is just like buzzword at this point and other one had its really like we all been is important on the other hand it you know hate just a pretty cool nulling of everything is is not to be pursued umm so so it's I mean to Saracens just proximity Reza so you know since as long as you generated argues I can think of biggest businesses that I've seen you know just institutional on settings fostering different you know fostering the productive interaction not not fruit brute forcing or dictating you know you and you need to you know do the thing right now we're just sort of you know this is more proximity of people allowing the horrid updated abuse of interacting categories and I mean that's a really broad is as usual institutional things may seem like it seems like it so there's one who didn't maybe different places but I don't conversation with people the last few days which which is models constraints on levels so particularly constraints I think that's very very sensitive collaboration is historical that there are a lot of taxonomy xin science and a lot of them had deeply thought at some one another and i think we do ourselves kind of injustice not looking at his you know history contemporary taxonomy and just what counts is rethinking a taxonomy in chemistry or physics or in the social sciences that's the rci struggle with in this case with whatever you worry what are you really after you our cycling psychology and what are we really trying to change and whether the neurosciences means to do that or at any second wish to achieve I think that's one thing that the elaboration need speakers it's nice to hear from people say chemistry would really gone through a revolutionary attacks on commodification past six years I guess what are twice revolution so your sunset physicist but there's a braver yeah I have my own psychology that have in cycle 2 and so to what extent we have problems where their courses is lovely to have folk psychology existing lines scientific psychology if principal they should be able to speak to another and Angela purposes but ty centrally need to to be careful everything that has specific examples that were actually grasp on to talk about okay this is a good way to revise our technology this is a bad way vizor taxonomy now ya think my Sciences which not that fun there's me a few tackles but I mean there's three flares one thing I wanted to just mention here in terms of power dynamic sorry I think one that didn't mention much was the Eclipse of behavioral research had a good old-fashioned like cognitive science and the increasing kind of cycling or apportioning of funds it's like that so there's a disagreement on you know aggressive it might about whether you need to do things in a kind of popped out way you need to notify our current atlas of constructs and happy and test those kind of Mike's why we should sort of throw that ll do production of readings from the bottom up but I think in a way if the top not brokers right if we sort of have to refine the concepts no way that sort of hole to psychology we don't really understand the brain except through behavioral psychology then you might actually think they're kind of clips in your behavior or circle we were that bad things are the wrong that the place insiders think that's worth another power dynamic discussion about how russ's the country I mean if philosophers could do something similar to achieve a similar end and talked a bit about crowdsource whether or not those or see that when we started declaring that was purposely taking book indices of a bunch of psychology textbooks and write down all the concepts and then went from there to say you divide are they measure so they're certainly there's a coma model sorry I ideas and feedback I think they mostly use it to find information about tasks I don't think a lot of words using it to understand concepts or using FTP will use it for daylighting but I think most important it is sort of like a slightly more focused version Wikipedia stories clearly there are other tax topics explicit ones in biology chemistry obviously but there are 10 zombies of entities are there other instances of taxonomy of tasks lovely update entities with that struck me Buffalo they have what they call the national ontology project it's actually the philosophy department is Smith behind so they've got things like apologies for emotions which they didn't happen to talk to anybody to do anything about emotion that's the bottle of that singers basically we know better than everybody else we're going throughout the ecology do this to me sorry is basically looked at their emotion of healthy it's basically folk psychology or emotions which we should take us a good at all to it's an interesting that they did it at least other things probably psychological processes also pretty ignorant of psychology but there should show so there's a methodology they think that the way to do it is to find things using logical formulas of which I doesn't doubts about at least that's one attempt you to see how he does couple detector yeah yeah I guess I wonder specifically in another science historically there was an instance where people want to try to formalize not just the entity they think they're studying but also the processes by which they study so the experimental procedures and things like that structure try to be explicitly that Russ is trying to explicit about what is it this particular test measures maybe that could be tall enough listen yeah i was just looking around here is it's actually surprising you're like I don't know about it will say ontology of you know biological techniques and I just really browsing and five minutes religion it during our discussion that some members have been discussing the possibility but Rosellini that tie dye see terms such an experimental procedures there's a lot of curiousity about wonder when people say that they were testing for a conscious perception it's really what they're testing for me in that builder is some discussion about like leaking to the concept of burning testicle with particulars on another sake of talking about I can give you a little bit in you explaining and with centripetal forces so this is a set concept introduced this concept and one of the things that it turns out if you have a body moving around the center that it's maintained by a central force that's all its operating and it will move if it's an inverse-square force with the variation of distance is inverse square and aluminum lips and we go about 11 the very same ellipse if it's falling off faster than the inverse learning about forward procession of the employment and it's falling off less fast in the inverse square law backwards procession with the orbit so he's getting he's got a concept it's a kind of power this idea but he's got a way of getting features of it from the motions of bodies in a very systematic way you're actually measuring the information from the behavior of the orbit and you can apply to planets where you have pre section that's due to interactions you get rid of all the free session due to interactions and this if you had got zero left over then that's another convention inverse square of reputation of course but there you have read at the beginning of modern physics you have a exactly this of the power or the thing that's making the gap and you have features that allow the behavior duplicated across terminating so also if you're interested in specifically a taxonomy of techniques I think they can look at the kind of pedagogical materials that would have been published in the 19th century an era of rebels geology of wild right hand books medical materials because I mean it's we had a very specific theory overview about how what was going on geologically and yet lyrics good to do about how you test for that meth illogically and he partially a kind of problem he would write most of how you how all these techniques where that would be problematic and where and that's something approaching that attacks on the scientific methodology that's what you mean by packaging process music he's also you know trying to do something else a prostitute in terms of geological processes and not simply the entities that result thereof maybe that's because it's a hard science in a similar way insensitive its historical and these things are difficult to get to and if that access and you have to be somewhat bulkier mark apostle where the observables rhetorical yep same comedy mental processes there are lots of things that are generalizable across large parts of the human population brother and sister like we're going to get mental processing speed processing tired said depending on our tasks they get experienced social environment looking like they're one of the I guess basically look took the rod problem is this feedback problem right where the brain very much reflects cognition that very much reflects its environment and you become an expert in something years to be different some houses and your mental processes are also be different someone else's and so they howl tired well it made in fact there's a whole tradition in psychology of sort of like that was called to purchase psychology which used to do basic evasion people across many things and use the presence of those individual differences to actually get further blood the taxonomy what so you know partly a problem it was like the basis for building that's on me it kind of failed by the illicit bill because you know there's so many ways to do the houses that you can ever come up with rotate the video by the different that time the first thing was guess I was thinking both about expertise cases and lesion cases but also in cases where they people are born without sir no other non sarà girl abilities there's lots of studies into it to know and fascinated by these kind of different ways building systems but i find it actually curious more trouble incorporating into the taxonomy given exactly how challenging the art my holistic rephrase and people say oh maybe it turns out that readable processing isn't just about like visual stimuli on spatial processing but how can we can do that you know I asked pocketed hospital can make through that or really is it the case that the system has totally adapted and it really is performing the propulsion for that individual than it does for someone with vision maybe it's just the structure happens to be good enough for spatial orientation I guess that's the question is being tested we actually are essentially put the concept out there and let it be I think that's really what I to get out before I especially like this girl is the guy both psychology in psychology and the Iroquois me all these people folks I call TT scientific psychology and should graduate says that we demonstrate should make you define such a way that makes clear predictions that can be tested to be falsifiable and it's not until I'm looking what has been demonstrated in demonstrating these wild that should actually accept that's cold so I know people grab some lunch and have planes and trains before we go both in general and specific figure the generals paper is please don't let this just a do whatever your visual differences dictate to try to solid eight and capture this these are these charms some things the specific layer is in reminding there's a female bear sigil reason so as you come across relevant literature but in particular as you write relevant literature and wonders to email this mug book on that and we will over and you probably already know on the rocking website we have a list of the literature already we're going to try to maintain that just as a community on the other side so it will be a reference this generation yep and just one final thing we need to do my name is on the committee but I'm actually doing on the work Michael Jackie did all the work enjoy
