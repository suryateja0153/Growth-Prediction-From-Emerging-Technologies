 hello and welcome back to hot topics the dura space community webinar series my name is Christy Cyril and I will be facilitating today's session just a reminder that the chat window is available at the left side of your screen at the end of the presentation today we will be taking questions from our audience and we'll ask you to post your questions in the chat window at that time we are pleased to have you with us today as we conclude our 11th Hot Topic series integrating orchid persistent identifiers with dspace fedora and vivo the curator of this series Josh Brown will get us started with today's presentation enhancing early career researcher profiles vivo and orchid integration thank you for being with us today I will turn it over to Josh thanks Kristi and thanks everybody for joining us today it's been a real privilege to curate this series Ford your space and this is our third and final webinar in the series recordings of the previous two are available on the duros face site now today we have three we have three great speakers we have Christie homes from Northwestern University we have John Corson Rickett and Simeon Warner both from Cornell University i'm going to start us off today just by talking a little bit about the background the work that really led to the prevalently the information will be sharing with you today being created it's been an interesting story working with vivo and we've worked well with them for several years now so it's great to have this chance to showcase some of what we've been doing so let me start by talking a little bit about what walk it is I'm sure many of you do know but for those of you who don't or kid which stands for open researcher and contributor identifier is a community-driven not-for-profit organization that issues unique identifier numbers much like a social security number or a credit card number or a driving license to anybody who's active in the research scene now the question you may ask is why so that's what I'll start by talking about our colleagues at the Australian national data service did an analysis of the names of authors in a major journal citations database and as you can see from this highlighted section of text in the middle more than two-thirds of them were not unique so this name ambiguity problem is colossal if you think about 6 million authors more than 4 million of those shared a name and that name could refer to seven other people that's that makes it very very difficult to identify people definitively in the growing world of scholarly communications now another great exact use case that demonstrates the value of having this unique identifier as well as your name is that people's names change sometimes they're married sometimes they're they use professor or doctor as their career changes sometimes then journals choose a different model so in some journals I might be Josh Brown in others I'm Joshua Brown in someone Josh a brown in some I'm J a brown and it's all me but how does anybody know that looking in from the outside so or kid is a hub we have a central registry of all our identify as linked to information about those researchers api's connect researchers their works the organizations where they've been educated or where they have worked and other identifiers you can imagine ISBN s for books and do is for journal articles and so on and so forth we link to publishers we link to repository systems we link to profile systems like VEVO we link to funders grant management and application systems we link to a whole range of information resources and we provide a way of moving information between all of those since the registry was launched in 2012 we've got a hundred and ninety five members we're slightly over now it is pushing 200 we've issued close to 1.3 million identify as two researchers and we're witnessing really rapid growth there are and the level of adoption is enormous as you can see from this graph and the way that it breaks down across the world is that we have twenty percent of our twenty percent of our members come from the repository community forty-five percent come from research institutes sixteen percent from publishing so we really are embedded in every aspect of the research ecosystem this graph just breaks down our adoption rates globally we are the majority of our members and adopters are in the Americas and but and we have a good good chunk in the European Middle Eastern Africa and Asia Pacific is actually our fastest growing region now the background to the work that I'm going to present then we're going to talk about today starts in twenty thirteen when orchid was awarded a grant for an adoption and integration program by the Alfred P sloan Foundation and as it says on the slide here was designed to increase orchid adoption and integration in universities specifically and if you click this link at the bottom of the slide you'll find our final report which describes all the work that was done i think we interacted with we were ended up with orchid integrations in more than thirteen different software systems or platforms worked with universities scholarly societies a whole range of fantastic fantastic work came out of that and part of this was this vevo work you'll be hearing about today now this grow these charts are possibly a little dense for you to read on your screen but well I think they had to illustrate very clearly is that the this approach to boosting up taking universities and research institutes has really really paid off the graph on the Left shows new members in each year new integrations and you can see that we went from a fairly small proportion of them being in universities this is the blue bar you can see there in twenty twelve to the majority a huge majority close to seventy percent were from the university sector in 2014 and the rate of growth you can see in the graph on the right there tell that story very vividly and we're accelerating in universities more researchers are becoming involved and this is the point where all can i think is emerging as just part of good practice for scholars and researchers and that's why the theme for today's webinar talking about early career researchers is great because we get them while they're young and we get them used to using orchid ids we get them used to best practice we get them used to maintaining a public profile thinking about how they're visible and how their data is used and shared and that's going to that set of skills and that knowledge is going to help people throughout their whole career that's a really valuable lesson to give people so the outline of today's session is I'll pass over to Christie homes in just a second and she'll talk a little bit about the connections and relationships between vivo and orchid then we'll pass to John will talk about orchid IDs specifically and vivo profiles Simeon will talk about some of the challenges and some of the confusions that people face in integrating orchid IDs working with their vivo profiles understanding the difference between them will go back to Christie homes we'll talk a little bit about the landscape in which orchid operates and then i'll just put things all of the preceding a little bit of an international context then there'll be some time for questions and answers so please make sure if you think of a question is that there's webinars progressing to put it in the chat box we will answer those at the end and so without further ado I would like to pass over to Christie Christie if you're ready over to you thanks very much ok Thank You Josh I appreciate that so thank you everyone for having me today it's the particular pleasure to speak about vivo and orchid in this venue as both projects are near and dear to my heart and I think that there are amazing opportunities that can be found as the two projects intersect in this scholarly ecosystem so I think that probably everyone on the webinar today has heard about the concept of research networking and the process of making information readily and publicly available about the scholars and their efforts and activities at individual institutions vivo is one tool which enables this and vivos approach really kicks this up a notch vivo enables information about scholars to be optimized using web-based infrastructure of standards and technologies this allows for a distributable machine readable description of data and smart web applications and linkages across many universities agencies societies and so on both within the United States as well as abroad so for everyone who is not familiar with vivo I'd like to present a short introduction to the software as well as to the many ways that we define vivo vivo certainly is that open source semantic web application and we'll take a look at the interface of the application here in a moment but it's also an information model so the vivo is f ontology allows the representation of research information in a standard way so that it can be interoperable exchangeable and really open up the possibilities of what we can do with data and finally and perhaps I think most important to me is the vivo is a wonderful open source community you'll see here a screenshot from the douro space wiki for the vivo project that there are a number of different bits of information about vivo that can be found at the wiki we invite you to take a look at the wiki or a Viva web org for more information about the project to find resources and to find ways of connecting so as we see here on the right there's a screenshot from Michael Conlon who is the vivo project director and which was recently announced you can see that there's lots of information here about Mike's activities and roles at the university of florida as i mentioned vivo is an open-source semantic web based application this enables it to be able to facilitate discovery of research information within an institution and across multiple institutions um vivo is housed at the institution itself and harvests information from verified sources so this allows the content in vivo to be authoritative it provides vivo data as structured linked data about the investigators their interests and activities and this can help to facilitate science or other collaborative scholarly activities by enabling discovery so allowing people to be able to find resources or individuals or opportunities and also to be able to highlight those things for discovery as well and again just to highlight the open source community again you can see the various places where you can connect with the vivo project and we encourage you to follow us on social networking as well so there are a number of things that are happening at the local level where a research networking application and particularly something as open as VEVO can help to facilitate so for instance being able to highlight areas of expertise connecting with colleagues highlighting activities within specific geographic areas creating biosketches and CVS and so on so all of these things can be administrative Lee can be a burden to individuals as well as organisations and solutions like VEVO can help to facilitate that process so I want to talk a little bit about how orchid in vivo are a complement one another so as Josh mentioned vivo and orchid have had a long and productive working relationship the orchid identifier has actually been part of the vivo ontology for years and I think that John will probably mention a little bit of this the orchid team did some wonderful work as part of the vivo collaborative research projects program which were awarded back in 2011 and and this long history has perpetuated itself most recently to the sloan projects as well as to other projects happening at vivo sites around the world as they integrate llevo as they integrate orchid ids locally within their vivos and i know john will highlight a few of these so when we think about Viva an orchid what are you know how do these two concepts connect with one another well we can think about the orchid identifiers as the permanent global identifier with enough information to aid in the disambiguation of a person vivo is typically an institutionally managed profile of that researchers activities and outputs and so we can understand that having an open data exchange between these two entities can actually promote a number of activities at the institution level as well as on the individual level so let's think about the career pathway of an investigator vivo you know as we start to think about vivo and orchid and their relationship with one another vivo stays at the institution well as orchid stays with the researcher so when we're thinking about these younger investigators are junior investigators there are a number of points in their career path where they may have changes in location changes in name and orchid IDs allow for the connection between different profiles at the different institutions as the researcher moves or as with some of the different name variants as Josh discussed earlier this connection is incredibly important because this will allow you to be able to follow individuals over time and longitudinal tracking of people is a tough nut to crack so we're not only looking at tracking individuals like our junior investigators our students scholars and trainees but we're also interested in keeping track of our distinguished alumni visiting scientists key administrators and their activities because they are often a very high profile as well as trying to connect mentors and mentees so this is a draft from the working group at Northwestern and it's only a draft but what I wanted to do is to highlight some of the ways that orchid intersects with some of the local systems so if you look up at the upper left hand corner we can see orchid IDs could be minted by the p.i or by the individual institution or orchid and they flow in from orchid org via a service-oriented architecture if you look at the upper right we can see in formation vendors and the orchid ID is entered on published content work flows from the vendors when we begin to look at the institutional content repositories the orchid is entered locally and then finally the green arrow at the bottom represents the opportunity for profile updates to be exchanged bi-directionally between orchid org and the institutional profiling systems so again you know let's think about this longitudinal tracking orchid it plays an important role in this space it allows us to be able to consider these individual local research information systems as the source of authoritative data and then to tie them together through orchid okay so let's take a look at the longitudinal tracking some specific examples one institution has a behind the firewall vivo to track their alumni for a period of three years after graduation which is a requirement for their particular accreditation as you might imagine orchid IDs would help reduce this effort and allow them to be able to track individuals I'd also like to talk a little bit about the things that are happening at our own library the libraries recently launched a metrics and impact core which is focused on leveraging library resources and other sources of information at our institution em bond for impact and justification for for activities such as grant submissions and renewals support for faculty research impact and reporting out comes to funding agencies and we provide a number of services for that are this metrics and impact core houses the evaluation and continuous improvement work of our clinical and translational Sciences Institute or new cats continuous evaluation and continuous improvement program so for those of you who aren't familiar with clinical and translational science it's Awards it's a large funding opportunity from the National Institutes of Health and the the mission or the objective of of this focused effort is to speed discoveries from the research bench in to improved health of our communities in an effective and efficient manner and a big part of that is is aiding discovery and so that's one way that research networking systems like vivo really play an important role but looking at the intersection of orchid with vivo we can see that there are a number of activities around evaluation where we can really benefit from the intersection of orchid and vivo so along the right-hand side there are some sample common metrics that were identified a while ago by the CTSA consortium and you can see the ones that I've placed a star B side really you can imagine will benefit from information that can be current and that can be updated as individuals move from institution to institution I'd like to focus a little bit on the return on investment of these different scholar programs the TL 12 32 and KL to scholars so those are individual training grants for junior investigators but you can imagine that all of these would benefit from a single point to connect outputs and that's what orchid can help to provide so other outputs such as activities around data curation a development of software tools and so on so what we're really interested in doing as part of evaluation and continuous improvement is seeking good data to be able to get a better perspective of the scholarly outputs for everyone that we're thinking about and we all know what good data is you know we're looking at multiple sources mole subjects and disciplines and we needed to be disambiguated and deduplicated and orchid can be a good way of going that information in so we also want to be able to track this information moving forward and so that we get a better perspective of scholarly outputs and also the influence of these wonderful training opportunities on the careers and success of our junior investigators so orchid obviously allows longitudinal tracking across diverse outputs it can be a real compliment to survey data so we do have a qualitative redcap data survey that we provide for our scholars but often it can be difficult to make connections with people when they leave our institution and the unique orchid identifier that's been worked into our workflow for each of our scholars through new cats is really one way that we can stay connected and then I'll just put in a plug in for also tracking our more distinguished alumni so its alumni weekend here at Feinberg School of Medicine and we've also been thinking about people who left northwestern a long time ago and trying to be able to collect a better idea of the things that they're doing so orchid is it can play a very valuable role across the career trajectory so with that'll turn it over to John Corson records hello this is John and I'm a developer at Cornell University of been working on vevo for a number of years and I'm going to be speaking about some of the more mechanical the mechanics of connections between orchid and vivo so I'll describe briefly how orchid is connected through the vivo i an't is f ontology and also through the vivos extensions to the vevo software and then I'll cover for quite different examples of how orchid in vivo are working together in practice at four different universities so the ontology connection is really quite simple there's a property and orchid ID property which is actually an object property that supports linking vivo persons and orchid records in the link data web and the the object of that property is a resource in the form of an orchid ID in the URI form so that actually operates as linked data and then in the application software application before displays the ID is a direct link to the person's orchid record Cornell was a recipient of one of the 2014 orchid adoption and integration grants funded by the sloan Foundation and that enabled us to release vivo 1.7 last summer to that in a manner that supports communication between vivo and orchid and we recently upgraded that for the changes to the orchid API and the basic idea is that you can create or confirm an orchid ID directly with orchid from vivo and there are actually a dual outcomes anticipated one is two so that the orchid ID is added to the profile and is available to the institution and is confirmed as being the orchid ID of the researcher who has actually logged into orchid and the process of confirmation so the university can be confident that they are indeed that for that orchid person and then in the other direction vivo request permission of the researcher to provide a vivo their vivo you all right to orchid so in terms of how this looks in the application on the identity tab in vivo there's a the orchid ID is listed and then there's a confirmation button there if the sometimes the orchid ID may come in from another system such as symplectic and it may may be valuable to have the researcher just confirm that and on the orchid side then that vivo URI shows up as one of the external IDs that may be optionally listed included on an orchid profile so the examples we have four different examples of how this has worked in practice Kona house Cornell has quite a simple approach through vivo George Washington University is piloting some profile population for market records texas A&M did a quite ambitious project of creating orchid ids for graduate students and adding them to vivo an internal facing vivo and the university of colorado has a very well-established program for creating orchid ids for faculty members that's becoming quite central to their fabric of research or information the low-key approach at Cornell has been basically to offer the opportunity to create a confirm an orchid ID through Cornell vivo this has been a little complicated by separate separate faculty reporting path for part of the campus where vivo is not actually used for any data entry and to that extent we were hoping to as we move the whole campus to using symplectic elements for the reporting side behind the firewall we can also leverage their orchid integration but in the meantime we've set up a site called simply enough orchid cornell.edu and that site is available for anyone with a Cornell net ID to log into and create or confirm an orchid ID so this is a way to promote orchids for graduate students or for other people staff members who conduct research who may not have a profile in vivo George Washington University is exploring this as part of a larger 5 University vivo pilot organized by the southeastern universities Research Association which is a group of 70 universities with the ambition of linking researchers across their 70 member institutions using vivo and Justin Lippmann that George Washington has pulled in up publications and other information from orchid as a proof of concept for an alternative to self editing for researchers who aren't included in their faculty reporting systems so that's seeming quite promising and he as an example of no 54 publications being brought in for one of their researchers Texas A&M was another recipient of the 2014 grants they minted over 10,000 orchid IDs for graduate students and added them to an internal facing vivo I think one of their motivations was to to aid in the kinds of accreditation confirmation tracking that that Christy alluded to it's important for accreditation but believe there's a requirement to report on the research publications of former students for three years after they they leave the university and receive their degree so Violeta ilik was the researcher there who modeled the data using karma tool from USC and adjusted it into vivo and they have developed an orchid management app that supports minting of ids and some email notifications related to that managing existing IVs and automating the publishing of the orchid IDs so and they do the same kind of exchange of permission information that that'd be those supports are through people itself the University of Colorado Boulder has probably the the largest most extensive program they were a recipient of the grant between their office of faculty affairs in the library and they intend orchid IDs to be used in a number of campus systems and to be shared with other University and affiliated systems in april 2014 they did a pre-registration communication with their campus focusing on the faculty and then in July last year they created over 3,000 new registrations focusing on tenure-track instructors and research faculty but not temporary faculty it's in resting statistically that they received three opt-out requests and they found the 210 faculty already had orchid IDs twenty-two percent of the faculty had claimed their orchid ID within three days which in july i think is quite impressive and as of earlier this week they've had just about fifty percent that have been claimed by researchers they've had 12 deactivation requests and they've they've increased the total number of ids they've registered to over 3,300 their ongoing implementation includes a new orchid module in their internal reporting tool for the annual merit process or faculty and it shows the status and helps them get information to claim or use their orchid ID and they've added a link from the VEVO page to orchid as it's been done at Cornell here's an example of a professor's the Vice Provost page and that later down further down the page below the sort of highlight highlighted areas of research areas and other activities the orchid ID is directly linked as a as a URI their ongoing an implementation will including creating a view for department heads to see orchid ids for their faculty and whether it's been claimed they've been sharing claimed orchid ids with their medical school to show up on colorado profiles which is a medical research network out of their medical school based in denver and they've renewed the orchid membership which is of course very important for continuing the effort internationally they have some more to do's they're going to be rerunning the registration process and estimate about 550 new orchids being created this year they're going to be leveraging the new functionality and simplistic elements they're looking at new options for managing registration for new hires and they're trying they're considering whether they will be pushing or ingesting data to and from orchid as sort of in a longer-term perspective there of the heads of the flagship 2030 effort at the university of colorado and they they hoped as part of that to develop a collaborative research extras enterprise among regional universities businesses government and federal labs in which they a number in the boulder area and they see orchid IDs shared across vivo instances that are being all right already created a new nav go edgy Odyssey research network at NCAR the National Center for Atmospheric Research and CU Boulder they see these or that orchid IDs in common as being a way to enable that vision and just one final comment from list homage and the office of faculty affairs and it has been a quite a time commitment for a small technology team roughly three to four months of a developer's time over the past year or the past year and a half but it is greatly expanded and accelerated the campus conversation related to scholarly work and research metrics we now have a reproducible structure in place in more than 3,000 orchid IDs to share with our data partners and vendors so I believe it's a pretty impressive story hi I'm Simon wanna and I seem to have got the section with maybe not the greatest title but I'll be pleased if I can help clarify a couple of issues so the first one is perhaps the the most frequent question around an orchid record how much information should my orchid record have or perhaps in the context of this webinar I have a VEVO profile already so why should I maintain one in orchid to the bottom line is that with orchid it's a researcher choice they're in control and there's a question about you know they can answer themselves how much they want to put their however I'm going to argue that a certain amount of information and linking is very helpful so say I want to create the minimal record registration really is very quick and easy it we say 30 seconds and that's probably not far off the truth you have to enter a name and email address a password and agree to the privacy policy and conditions now a minimal record is already useful in that you get an ID and that's a permanent IDE you can use and you can put it into work flow so if you're submitting a journal article or something you can already use that ID however the webview is really not very useful which which John Smith is this as I said it's already useful to use this ID but for someone who who finds that idea and resolves that they don't get very much information now if this ID is used in workflows then potentially works will be added later as they're published through integrations with publishers but let's say John has a VEVO profile we just created a confusion of ID's here because there's a VEVO profile with one ID for John and an orchid profile with a second these two should clearly be connected so let's think about what a helpful awkward record might be I think there are sort of two aspects to this the first is provide enough information so that someone who follows a link to the record however they found it or searches for you can understand which John Smith you are so you might want to put in any alternate names you go buy something about where you're at perhaps a few works now it doesn't have to be a complete set of your works but most people like to highlight a few of their their popular things this already means that someone who stumbles upon your identity can work out whether that is the right one or whether you're the person they were expecting potentially how to contact you if you want to add that the second aspect is really linked this orchid record to other identify as perhaps places where you do maintain a more detailed set of information so in the case that i have a VEVO profile at cornell that is perhaps more complete than my orkut profile i would definitely want to link through the sort of integration john was talking about to my VEVO profile I might also choose to link a scopus author ID or research your ID and his knee and there are wizards to help you do all of these things so is a slightly more useful profile this might not be complete but I'd argue that this is the sort of level of a profile that's helpful and perhaps doesn't have a burden of maintenance of the complete record which I perhaps maintained on VEVO so I have other IDs on the Left there's hear this record has a researcher a Deanna scopus author ID some education information and employment information this record have doesn't happen to have any publications listed now of course it's someone's choice whether they want to make it a really expensive or kite record that tries to describe everything they do and there are a number of import Wizards from services like scopus research for ID from individual vivos that can bring all the information together and a key feature of the orchid UI is that if you're bringing information about works from multiple sources that will end up being different slightly different descriptions of the same work and the UI groups this information together to present 11 work and allows the user to select which is their preferred view of it to present in the way they want so to sum up this idea of you know how much information should my orchid record have it should have the amount the picture I choose it really isn't necessary for orchid record to present a complete picture but you can obviously link out other systems such as VEVO that do provide that and that's then an efficient way to to maintain information so switching topics a second VEVO is grounded in the Semantic Web and orchid is not as fundamentally semantic web as VEVO but the orchid ID is a URI so it works in that way as an object as John described there's limited support for rdf output and more work is on the roadmap we recently saw a wonderful little report published by the w3c to suggest some clarifications on the subtle technical distinctions of the orchid ID for the person and the URI used for the page and we're extremely pleased to have Ivan Herman Yvonne Herman on the orchid technical steering group who's from the w3c so I think watch this space for some changes there so then orchid is one of many personal identifiers we have an acronym soup of possible person identifiers and perhaps the bottom line here is that there is in the near future going to be no single person identifier for all uses however let's go back to think about what orc it is what is the 0 stand for o stands for open and it's open in the sense of open standards open membership and open for use and reuse orchids are remarkably unencumbered in that sense and therefore play very well in interoperability the are and the sea of orchid stand for researcher and contributor Orca has academic focus but we know that it's contributor not author the scope is is beyond just the authors but everyone involved in the academic process whoops that's right so there are differences of scope here or kid for example is not designed to provide identifier for people publishing CDs with my favorite piece of punk music but it is designed for ever and academia is need for example is focus more around rights management so there are clearly large overlaps here but there are definitely use cases for both so I'd like to highlight two things about orchids one is that orchid requires a small amount of activity from the researcher so orchid is only for people who are living is not for the back catalogue of works catalog by libraries which for example the the app is doing work to pull those identifiers together and the second is that orchid IDs and their api's are designed to be used in workflows so the phrase I've I've come up with and like is an ounce of ambiguity avoidance is worth a pound of disambiguation the idea of using orchid IDs in workflows avoid naming ambiguity at the very source when we have the researcher engaged and then finally while orchid is being used in these workflows this hub function that I think Josh mentioned first is very very important so the idea that here's my orchid profile and on it I have an is knee that was assigned to me my vivo con el ID and some other IDs that's really key and I think facilities such as the one described that link orchid IDs conveniently and effectively interview go systems are critical okay thank you simian so that's certainly I think is a is a good foundation for a few of the topics that I want to cover in this next short section so I think that we all are aware that there is an unbelievable amount of work being done in this space of unique identifiers and I think the real the real interesting work happens as we try and pull together this information across all of these disparate sources so I think what I want to do is just provide some food for thought and some areas of possible work and contemplation and certainly this topic is of great interest to many of us on the webinar and certainly all of us in the vivo community and would encourage you to consider even submitting a paper poster for the upcoming vivo conference in August in Cambridge so the increasing number of these unique identifiers can be really challenging and one thing that we're considering or that we've been talking about is that perhaps orchid provides cross walking services and can function as a global same as registry so that is you know when you consider all of the diverse sites that are providing information about the same real-world entity there needs to be a single point that can help to enable that cross walking across the different sites and as simian pointed out in his comments orchid already allows researchers to be able to supplement their records with additional external resource identifiers and I think that this is a key use case for orchid I've just taken a screenshot from mine and have linked to a few of my IDs as well as other websites so you know I think that this really does provide an opportunity for orchid as well as connecting it with the vivos certainly the temporal aspects of this space are important as we begin to think about the movement of investigators or the change in their career path and the influence that that has with the information that's stored within different data sources and then I think it's important to also recognize that there are specific goals of linking these different data sources and consider how these can be achieved in concert with other groups that are dedicated and working in this space particularly the library community a number of efforts are around disciplinary repositories and so on so this is a hot area lots of interesting work happening and I am optimistic and excited about the activities that will be happening in the months and years ahead in this space so I'd like to turn it over to Josh for I and hope that he can place all of this into the international context Josh thanks Christine pancakes and thanks everyone for some a great series of presentations there so we've obviously with the panel of presenters we have today we've had a fairly North American focus so I just wanted to talk a little bit about some of the work that's being done elsewhere that I think is of relevance here and just gives you a sense of some of the other things that might be in the pipeline or kind of evolving as thing as we speak now it's just a very brief kind of overview of a few interesting developments and some ideas that are coming up so all calum vivo have been working together for a while now we've been working in partnership with other international organizations and one of those things we do is we work with other standards bodies to help to make sure that the applications of standards are consistent that they are ubiquitous and that we're working with things in real in the real world you know Simeon mentioned our engagement with w3c now that's very important to us it really helps us to make sure that you know in the world of linked data in the world of the world of web based cold scholarly communications we're actually really working with to the very highest standard another of our recent collaborations is with Kaz rang that that consorcio advancing standards in research administration information that out of there a really great body who do data dictionaries as been the core of their standard to ensure that when an Englishman talks about a lift and American knows that he's talking about an elevator and that you're essentially talking about a vertical mechanism for moving goods and people within a building and so that's a great project we would be working with them and the Wellcome Trust and others on project credit which is about unpicking the different types of contribution people can make to the research process now if you think about if you contribute to the creation of a data set if you review project application or an article before publication these don't necessarily end up in your orchid record or your VEVO profile and and if they are appearing multiple data sources they might be defined differently so you can see all sorts of ways right away I think that you know this the 14 roles that were pulled out by a project credit will turn into a taxonomy you sure um thanks Josh that's a great question so I you know I think ultimately the when you think about impact and tracking I mean we're very interested at the institution level in knowing what kind of training programs and interventions if you will help to facilitate successful research careers but from the individual level I think it's it's really important for those young scholars to consider how they best or how they can put their best foot forward so a huge amount of the impact of one's scholarship is directly tied to the dissemination of that scholarship and so by engaging with orchid and making sure that you are curating that orchid page to the utmost of your ability listing your institutions keeping everything together I think that's really important also having your scholarly activities available in vivo which presents open machine readable data that comes back with high hits on the search engines and and making shine keeping that profile as curated as possible all of that works together to really elevate your presence to the next level so I think i would add us out that's really persuasive go ahead please oh sorry I you know I'd emphasize Christy's point that you know the need for a good publicity and doing that through your local vivo is is very important for young researchers but one of the features of young researchers is that they really do move as well typical you know physicist is going to do a PhD is going to then do probably two postdocs each lasting one two or three years and then hopefully get a faculty position so that's four institutions probably before they're up for tenure so connecting these things together is very very important and that's I think where orchid comes in actually brings me to a question that I wanted to ask John as well actually which is very related to that which is about this idea of sharing vivo URI via orchid record and my do you think that that is a function there the services that could be built linking and using the profile possibly with you know future and past vivo profiles as simian says you could have 4 profiles attached to your name in a very short space of time at the beginning of your career you hey John sorry to interrupt if you are speaking we cannot hear kit you okay apologies for that it looked like we lost John are you there yeah you you I'm sure so okay relationship and roles between Cybele experts in vivo at Northwestern so yeah that's a great question so I think that probably everyone on the call em knows that institutions often have multiple solutions in this space and I think that they all fill different needs we have a have had a long-standing north western scholars instance which is the elsevier Cybele experts platform and it's being were upgrading to pure i will say for us or for the way that we're thinking about it there are challenges because not it's not a complete snapshot of activity that's happening on campus some of our clinical faculty aren't in it certainly we have a number of junior investigators scholars postdocs and so on so you know I can see at our institution as well as that others that the different platforms fulfill those needs we we have several I think there's also an exciting you know there's an exciting space when you think about certainly something like Cybele experts presents a you know really polished beautiful a snapshot of the activities or outputs that are within that system but when you're looking at trying to accomplish that activity as well as highlight a more dynamic picture of research so looking at core research facilities datasets the integration of these things across institutional resources and so on you know that's maybe one space where then a vivo can step in and do something like that and I should also step in one with one additional comment oh sorry I was going to offer to you know if anyone would be interested in additional information I'd be happy to connect you with the folks doing those projects fantastic thanks Kristi so I think my audio is back this is John so i probably lost some connection to what what question am i answering now yes absolutely on that this is very important for the vivo community and I we're also hearing from a library community that they want to start including vivo you arise in library catalog records and or in order to do that they want assurances that the vivo your eyes will be stable so normally one thinks is a vivo is being kind of a current awareness service of people who are at the institution now but we're looking into ways to to maintain he were your eyes also the longer term so that someone who has moved could still have information from that time period available and that i think the crosswalk in capability of orchid in this regard is going to be very important only that I think I believe justin is a hoping that he can share that work as soon as it's mature enough so the other rest of the vivo community could could adopt it if they want to it's behind the firewall now and I think it's still being evaluated for how it what the workflow role will be at George Washington um I think my piece of advice would be think of them together that two important pieces of the infrastructures of play nicely and work better if one imagines the most part of the larger ecosystem so I would chip in with a comment that the most challenging part of technology projects are often the conversations that need to happen so I would encourage people to sit down with stakeholders and understand their needs and motivations so that a more comprehensive thought-out solution with lots of support can happen at the beginning and this is John I jump and say that we've had very positive we've had very positive response at Cornell in mentioning orchid as we reach out to our colleges here and encourage them to provide data to vivo they understand the need for orchid because they've had to work with the challenges of disambiguation so I think you're working together makes a lot of sense right thank you very much Josh and a huge thank you to John Christian civilian as already mentioned you provided us with a lot of great information this has been a very popular series as Josh mentioned in the beginning the series is being recorded and will be made available to you at dura space dot org slash hot topics later this week so thank you all very much this concludes today's session enjoy the rest of your day
