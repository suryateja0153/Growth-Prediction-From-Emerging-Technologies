 we're gonna talk about big data modeling today and the really funny thing about that is there's no such a thing as big data modeling right because there we go that's a better one because we're doing schema on on read' we don't have any models right so right no nobody wants to raise their hand I thought the big advantage of Big Data was you didn't have to have models no modeling right data modelers dead seriously come on you've never heard this yeah so so there is no modeling in Big Data so we can all go home now right oh okay doesn't work that way maybe there is something called modeling for Big Data maybe there is there's something about context we'll figure it out we're going to jump through some slides then we're going to do a little exercise so if you're sitting at a table you'll already have a nice place to work if you're not maybe move up and join some of the guys at the table when the exercise starts and also there's two of these flip charts so I'm thinking we can have small packs of wolves working in each one of these five seven eight people could work in one of those that probably work out okay all right important first slide welcome welcome big data modeling we're gonna talk about a couple topics today big data data modeling big data modeling make sense the thing is if you don't have time to get to the third point we'll just do the first two right no okay it's it's not directly after lunch so it can't be that bad right session objectives components of big data structure and schemas tools and architecture you've seen some of this so we'll go very fast through that of course right how many people have not been ever to a big data presentation okay ever you know big data presentation at all okay the five of you you're fired whatever jobs had no it's not true no I think it's just because there's so much of it in the last four or five years it's hard it's hard to to avoid it but we're gonna cover that anyway just to give us a little recap of where we are data modelling we're gonna talk of course a little bit on the data warehousing side that's that make sense but data modeling as related to the the challenges of integration in history warehousing bi conceptual versus physical and then a big data modelling and we'll talk a little bit about this focus on the meaning nothing like taxonomy is build up everything like taxonomy could be the case and then also a little bit of ensemble modeling techniques and I'm sure how many people went to heard or saw some datavault by now during this yeah and prior to that heard of it so pretty much that's ninety-three percent on a quick assessment there so there we go okay first thing is just big data so why you know we by the way just does before I start this does does anyone here want to take the challenge of providing the definitive definition of Big Data bill does do it yeah with the who senses okay so elaborate yeah okay so huge stay at a cheap hardware and it's unstructured right and then your I couldn't hear you last one the Roman census okay so you must what provide all data or you do it in in general batches so close enough take a section yeah okay yeah so you do some guesstimate based on statistical analysis of the portions you take okay well could very well be I think that's probably true I think I love that one by the way I think that's great I think that one ends up happening like with a lot of key terms these days is people will say I'm a vendor either providing a consulting service or a product or software and big data is trending pretty heavy right now so I'm big data and so then it encompasses more definitions I think certainly on the unstructured side you know there's a lot of argument there that probably the true form of unstructured doesn't exist as soon as we capture anything we have we have some as you would say context that can be tied to some kind of tags even like the idea that if we captured just freeform text flowing around the room here today even your thoughts in your mind and everything thrown together we do know the location and the date and the time and profile of the people and the weather outside and all kinds of cool things like that so we know some things but let's say that you know looking at the characteristics I think one of them is huge data volumes for sure right I mean huge state of items has always been there and structured or very complex okay so in structured meaning it's not necessarily fully unstructured but the structure is not based on a modeled schema like we do and it already beyond us so we have some kind of a free form text component we have some kind of an unknown component and then also we have streaming and shape-shifting data which means that it might be arriving at huge burst rates or velocity right and getting it down to the V's it might be some kind of velocity issue right coming down really fast and also a shape-shifting means that the schema may change so for example you're receiving a feed today into your warehouse and then tomorrow it has three more attributes than it had yesterday well that's would have been good to know in advance for thing right but the other thing is is that that data that comes at you may not stay true to a known structure that you've already had from the beginning so its shape shifting along the way and I think you know volume velocity variety you've heard probably veracity so some if you went to larsa's session on on anchor there's there's some talk about the reliability or the trustworthiness of the data as well where does it come from how what is truth what is accuracy when it comes to those things so yeah volume velocity variety veracity value I like somebody added value on there I think that's probably pretty interesting too because we should probably have an assessment of value and bill you can help me on this one because I think you were saying one time the the percentage of downstream marked deliveries that were based on the kind of higher level business view or another way to say it what percentage of warehouse data is is ever utilized I went yeah oh no no I like I want hecklers but I can also pick on you at the same time so that's good yeah and most of what we have today is is primarily repetitive and most of what we have in traditional warehouses today is primarily repetitive data yeah yeah so it's fair to say less than five or ten percent of that data ends up really ever being utilized and I think one of the things about that ends up being what's the assessment of value there's probably still an important factor to add on to the discussion on any kind of data management big data for sure and like in your case the non repetitive data should have much more usefulness so that should be assessed to higher value as we get into this discussion so okay a couple other things then right Big Data architecture and this is one of the things that I think has happened today is that we've kind of decided that big data is Hadoop or MongoDB now you heard Bill's definition we looked at the three V's from IBM the expanded five B's whatever all these different ways of looking at it but let's let's think about it for a minute if today the conversation is really oh oh are you doing big yeah we got a who do ya we're doing Hadoop we got HDFS for hive and using yeah guys are doing JSON Docs now everything's cool we're big data now I think that's interesting because certainly that is useful for vendors and providers of services and software around this is tooling but that's a tooling thing and as it turns out we could actually apply this tooling to more structured data right it doesn't have to be unknown unstructured or close to it for it to be useful to apply some of the technologies that we have here the technologies are useful because they can accommodate things that are loosely unstructured and they also allow for just distribution of data so that it's a lot easier and cheaper to process your number two point okay here's a couple interesting things if you look at the hardware solutions and the software solutions and things that are out there today all big data is is being valued pair right now I can see Bill chomping at the bit now he's going to be smiling in just a few minutes when we go through the slide so the thing is if you think about it everything that happens that can be put into an in structured world or any kind of a database management system that does not include row column definition right by nature has to have some kind of a name value pair corresponding architecture whether it's stored in name value pair and this by the way a row ID or ID one name first name value hunts row ID one again cuz it's the same row ID name last name value Hultgren row ID one name address value 1285 or ID one name street value Snowberry drive okay everything's paired up well that's fair it's just a transposed schema if you took any anything that you have today for record layout you can transpose it to just the name value pair and have a row identifier that's fair if you're using something like a or any other form really of the major tools you might have a row based doc based whatever something and in that you would have some kind of a row identifier and inside a series of name values all right let you do in a JSON doc or similar to what you're used to in XML right next Mel has always got a tag and a value some kind of XML tag and some kind of value combined to it the question comes down to now predictability right what names are available in this doc that I can choose from are they predefined are they known are they modeled are they assigned those are questions you can ask yourself another one is on the key value construct now cute keep mind here that the reason I'm saying key instead of a name right is that I may not know in this case the row I may just have more of a blob of data but it comes in some kind of a delivery and the delivery idea is some kind of a key whether it's a sequence it doesn't matter but that would be true of like us capturing all the chatter in this room and then sending it to a computer it would just be a big blob of chatter but it has a key the key says here's an instance of this thing I collected what is it it's a box full of chatter okay and there's no names in that box there's nothing to say the prefix before each word what does that word mean for each thing that could be a concept what does it mean there's nothing in there and that's the that's ties very nicely to the prior session with Bill because in that case you need something to go in there and says you know hey Portia is a car by the way it's also a German product it's you need something to go in there to provide some idea of what kind of tags are associated with those things but really it's a stream of values and here's the point is that those values can be atomic compound right you know the compound primitive attribute concept or just strings or blobs of data just freeform text it could be anything in there right so we don't really know much about it other than there's some kind of a key and there's some kind of a blob now you may receive deliveries from sources that give you a very flattened structure if you're in insurance or if you're in commercial banking or something like that and these things you know inside there is values for ten different concepts but now you have to parse not just the name value but you need to figure out the row for what key the row for what key right so if I have for example a huge blob of an insurance application you have to go through this let's see this birthday name last name whatever age whatever things are here relates to the policy holder this set relates to a dependent of the policy holder this one oh boy this record has to depend no three dependents the other ones had only one so there's a possibility here where you can have recursions inside right recursions inside from multiple things that are values at different levels of green the point is that everything we're doing in this world fits to some degree into this kind of a schema right makes sense so here's an interesting question for you right we need to model and that's first question today modeling is dead right very few people would ever agree with that so turns out pretty much no one agrees with that why why and what are we modeling well we're we're modeling understanding what is the meaning of the thing we're working with so schema on right is what we're used to okay fair enough we're used to a world where we create a schema through whatever means it is you know mapping to a reference model or creating it from scratch through concepts entities whatever we did we decide what attribution is is relevant we create a fixed hopefully agile though right respond to change some kind of scheme of known things to expect and we write to it schema and read says well know we'll figure it out when we read it what it is okay we'll figure out when we read it what it is but for the most part that doesn't mean and getting back to the slide prior that doesn't mean that we went right down to this where we have a key and a single value that's a big blob of a string it just means that we don't have adequate information or we don't take the time we're reading for whatever reason we didn't go through to see what all those things were but if it is something that has a name and of value for example if I'm gonna go and look at it I can figure out what it is based on that tagging value if I don't I run it through forum tech software first and then I get a bunch of tags and tell me what each element could be based on a taxonomy oh there's something known but at that point I can start to use it right so the schema on read is really like a latent it's like a late binding of schema but it's still the idea that the schema for the most part could exist one of the things I like to talk about because of all the hardware or software tooling vendors identifying big data as a platform is that if you're running and mate how many people here are doing anything with Hadoop or or something like that today I really am proud and I won't call on you okay how many people are doing it but are too shy to raise their hand okay I see you virtually I know you're out there okay what about how many people are thinking about it right now you're like yeah I think we're gonna bring it out it's um I do cluster anything yeah okay definitely it's it's it's coming right so one of the things to consider is the fact that you can use it for the benefits of agility and for the benefits of distributed processing and efficiency like cheap costs of processing even if you have an own schema when you start with so let's say I receive something and it's in a structured form it actually has rows with attributes column headings and I know what it is but when I load it I load it into a big data platform and I strip away that row column and I throw it into some kind of a say JSON or something like that um why would I do that and by the way I call that dismantled schema on right kind of like that so I gotta have a skein of I'm gonna dismantle it just write it or you can say flattened you know like whatever um why would I do it well okay one thing is is that that would help you if the things that you're loading are things that are now going to change one of the issues with big data right is that it's rapidly changing form shape-shifting if it changes the attribution with every other record that's a pain to work with if it changes the attribution with every other record when you do dismantle schema I don't really care that's that tag values in there it's not a new one shows up tomorrow okay add it I don't really care because it doesn't really impact me if I do it from that perspective if I want to pull it out to understand it I still have to do something with it which brings up two more concepts up there which is schema and focus right one of the big benefits here is I hope really trust hope believe wish for all of you that as you're looking at your data platforms today you're thinking agile and by virtue that you're probably thinking incremental hopefully you're thinking incremental built right if I have this vast flow of data and in the beginning there's 5 or 10% of it that is really useful for me to use I can start contemplating the schema for how I'm gonna leverage and use that data when I start to focus on it that's kind of schema on focus and also you can tie it different slightly different wording schema and leverage and the reason I say that is that a lot of this stuff goes into the mining exploration area right if you're in a mining exploration area you could be working with data that has trust coefficients of 90% and it's close enough and you can explore that without having to actually pull it through fair enough okay but once you say wow this is really some interesting great data I need to get that into my warehouse now what you're saying is I'm gonna start to leverage that data and use it in a more definable way so you need to have a schema now right so now you have to have schema and leverage so there's a few other schema on considerations here that we need to talk about I think one of the interesting things is even if we were only limited to the first two there's a common word it's still says schema ie some kind of modeling ie data modeling I you know our jobs right I mean we haven't taken it away although the form may be changing so now we have our model load the data explore it apply it as we go to Big Data world we can load it and then explore it and then from there maybe model it and apply it okay fair enough I think again the question here is when you load it still you should think about that when you load it what is really the structure what you're loading is it a structured than dismantled on right is it fully unstructured is and structured do you know key value name values what is it actually you're working with right how what's the realm of structure you're looking at okay so a friend of mine a friend of a good friend of bills Len silverstein has I put the link down below it's a the hidden elephant in big data modeling but I just like this part of the quote and I paraphrased here I sliced off a little bit but if we don't understand the data okay it can only be less useful that makes sense so big data's great it's got all this great stuff it's you yeah but if you don't understand it it can only be less useful and if you continue on with a quote it says or even dangerous right depending on what you're working with here so obviously we need to apply the understanding and that is really what the job of data modeling what the job of data modeling is all right Day tamale cute it right up right the job of data modeling man's search for meaning as it were yes it's plural not it doesn't own that term just all mankind search for meaning conceptual modeling logical modeling information modeling physical data modeling there's some some components here deployment modeling whatever here's an interesting thing if you're in a prior session or if probably you heard most of what people are talking about here and even Bill's concerns that the technology team isn't involved in this process that has to be business all of us has data modelers all of us is data modelers wherever we are on the spectrum between IT over here notice it's in the dark and business over here in the light where all the action is right wherever we are in this spectrum if I'm a business analyst if I'm a architect modeler if I am a ETL developer all of us are standing in row between tech and business all of us have to take two big steps this direction just the whole crew right that's that is our new world we can't get around that we have to now say our modeling which is a search for meaning and understanding can't be housed in the technical arena it has to be driven and part of an encompass in the business itself so what's happening now is there's a person who works with skills in accounting or something becomes a data scientist to better learn how to leverage that data you're working as a modeler architect you get more involved with a business to understand better how to leverage it for them and understand meaning right make it useful and pretty soon you're gonna converge well pretty soon might be I don't know 2025 2023 who knows but the point is that's more what's happening here right who are the business people that really understand the value of data and how its meaning is critical in order to use it who are the people that understand data that understand that the meaning is everything and how we understand it is the key to everything that's how we have to see ourselves getting back to here all right I told you we can do an exercise I don't know if I told all of you because some of you came in later but we're gonna do an exercise the exercise is called Colorado sales and I'm just gonna keep saying bill a little time bill and I will appreciate that because now how many people know what happened in Colorado over the last year year and a half two years besides you Remco know it's something that was happening in Amsterdam for quite a lot what's it yeah yeah all the people that went there have to now go to Colorado right right so now we have legal recreational marijuana in the state of Colorado so yeah so now that's interesting because we have more pot dispensaries than we have Starbucks in Colorado now okay and we actually have like you know Rocky Mountain High Tourism now people coming to the state tourists to take advantage of this this legalization but what has happened is a bunch of these you know dispensaries have popped up and wow they you're gonna find this shocking they're not experts at IT or data warehousing just gonna put that out there they're experts in other areas so what they need is they need for you guys design for them some kind of a data management system that can handle the sales of their product all right sound like a challenge right I can tell you one thing that's going to help you with the scope of this quick modeling assignment that is that these businesses are all cash-and-carry so you don't to worry about things like credit cards okay why is that do you think anybody want to take that one why are they all just cash yeah yeah so the federal government the broader US does not have this lacks attitude towards the sale of certain products so it's not legal from the broader government perspective it's only legal in the state but of course the banks are insured by the federal government so then there's an issue with the banks being involved at all with this stuff so cash-and-carry does that make your life easier I just say yes yeah just say it'll make it easier alright what I'm looking for in particular if you just look at this example this is just names I mean okay this is just a thing of me tracking people I know in my family just has nothing to do with it the sales case quick thing is just a concept model so if you in your group if you just say well hey what is it we really do here right say well we sell this product to customers that we get from growers and we have shipments you know whatever the thing is you have those are the concepts right and there's a good reason why we want to have their actual business concept not don't try to get fancy abstracting to you know party and IP and all this kind of stuff just go the actual concept and then consider the natural business relationships between them what are the natural business relationships between family and friend well the friends belong to a family and the friends have activities and the friends are have a contact in my family so that's that's my daughter's friend she belongs to this family they have these activities whatever it is it doesn't matter you guys will figure this out and then the last thing would be start to consider the couple of things you use to describe them what are a couple things you use to describe them well I want to know their first name and their phone number whatever it is just a couple of those things don't get carried away so those of you that sitting at a table just sit at your table you hurt you're fine okay what we could do is have let's see the three of you work together as a group the table behind you work together group the three of you guys here work together as a group you two over there you guys are split three and three two groups right there okay you guys can't have both groups of four in these tables now I got rid of all the table people now the good people right the people that don't have tables right you guys can all kind of pop up and I would recommend just all the people in chairs on that side just actually that's good number swarm over to this standing flip chart over here and work there okay and all you folks sitting in chairs on this side wow it's gonna start getting crowded I would say swarm over to this one see who can take over that board and then the rest of you kind of join some of these tables okay we'll take about seven eight minutes right yeah we'll take about seven eight minutes just do a quick run of what are the concepts how do they relate naturally and then we'll get back to our C's it's good to stretch come on let's go come on up I'll even bring it over for you does make it easier lar she won't drive oh you're fixing bugs you want to drive all right sounder you drive I'll get you people want Jose come on it's an important project oh yeah oh thank you so much for give you that yeah yeah yeah perfect so of course of course yeah yeah yeah yeah and then us spelling your first name yo just Gan Gan okay there you go and then do you mind thank you that's perfect well you did home already guys let's go drawing good put them into boxes and put some lines in there relate them to each other yep now if you have some experts here that are familiar with the different product types and categories and attribution yeah yeah exactly you could like the data around the product woof yes I could there you go you you you are the industry expert here that you should be oh that's good that's good all right yes please alright alright so most most people have the core concepts and relationships now look for some of the descriptive properties attributes context we're approaching our last 2-minute window some final attributes first name last name product sight all right final minute so you don't you don't carry the blackmail list exactly perfect order stunner right maybe their Mon excellent good all right everybody let's finish up maybe grab your seats again sorry to say we're on the 15-minute timer to get out of here and we have a very important appointment after this coffee house break okay all right if you look down at the papers in front of you if you're at a desk and you compare look a little bit at these models we have here right how similar do they look to you guys quite similar so how many people have some kind of a sale entity okay some kind of a product entity okay you got to sell something right how about a store yeah supplier yeah good everybody everybody's doing the same thing okay some kind of delivery or shipment yeah most I think I saw that here too yep yeah okay how about order when people added an order uh over here okay yeah so a few less people into the order what about customer how many people had customer in there model was there anybody who did not have customer in there model you dropped it and then yeah yeah so that's one of the interesting thing about sales in a store right is that if I come in and pay cash and we know that a hundred percent of these people are paying cash unless I specifically asked for their identification or their name I probably don't know them right as it turns out in Colorado there's a there's a rule that says if you're an out-of-state person coming in to buy you can buy less quantity than if you're in state and state you can kind of buy what you want so if you're out of state you have to buy a smaller quantity so they need to at least know what state you're from that's that information is there yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah it's very difficult to do I mean you really have to capture all the all the information and create a unique instance for the customer yeah yeah exactly so let me ask you a question the thing about the Colorado ruling on what we need to require the driver's license and some of these other factors how do you know about those from a technical perspective how do you know that on the cash register have an attribute okay all right but how do we get that information right so what it comes down to is that for us to create a proper meaningful data model we have to interface very closely with the business to understand what they do so as it turned out several of these groups had subject matter experts right on this topic which turned out great now not having anything to do with their habits but their proximity to living in certain places but my point is they're the business users here that can define for us what are the business assumptions the rules the characteristics what can I capture about customer what do I have to capture about customer what's available to me those attributions that things can only happen with are walking into the business and saying what do you guys do here what's happening here how does this work right it's also important that we don't at this point we're not creating something called involved party and saying well we have customers and employees and and distributors so they're all some kind of a party you know let's make one thing and do role playing that doesn't really connect well with the business the business connects thought better with customer and employee and whatever this situation is okay so moving from this model right actually I'll just show a couple quick pictures here but this color state example is a quasi third normal form representation right a little past logical and later I will also show you an ensemble form representation but right now I want to get back to the three slides here are the three columns here if we talk about I'm going this over a little bit otherwise when I walk over here I'm gonna hide behind you guys there's three paths primarily there's probably more but three paths for modeling when we consider kind of the big data world one of them is the structured known world where I'm actually modeling with the intent of deploying leveraging some kind of a big data hardware or software platform but that's my only intent I know everything about what's coming so there I will model my core business concepts exactly what you guys just did today core business concepts product store employee customer right from there I'm gonna model my natural business relationships again something you guys all did interesting this group over here had a natural business relationship that tied the customer to the store only through a sale but then they had a relationship that kept a list of customers by store and they eliminated it now that could be because they want to keep track of that it's not a business driver it's not legal I doesn't matter the point is the natural business relationships if they exist should all be modeled so could be whatever they are you model them then you consider attribution and you guys all did this as well well I want to know the product name the product class the product weight whatever strengths color it doesn't matter I want to know the name the last name the phone number I want to know something about the people as it turns out for customer I need to know what state they come from because that's important too for legal reasons those are all attributes and in the known structured world I create columns for the then I say okay now there's a field for that attribute create a column and I and I make that work and that results in a backbone model with attributes and defined columns that goes into traditional RDBMS but can also be deployed in a big data world the one is n structured name value pair where I say the same thing I still have to do the core business concept I still have to do the natural business relationships and I still have to think about the attribution but I'm not going to be creating columns in an our DBMS here I'm going to be creating a list of available usable tags like in annex st if you had tags defined for XML you didn't have to say these are the expected attributes that could come from the source concerning this this key so results in a backbone not modes model sorry mistake with no unexpected attribute name tags names or tags whatever you want to say the last one is in structured key value pair which is results in a backbone model right with capacity to capture unknown attribution or either either stuff that's named tagged or is not named or tagged could just be a blob and that gets back to one of the earlier slides it could be I'm receiving it right but I don't know what tags I might receive but when I receive it I do get first name Hans last name Hultgren then I would get something else that says Biogen 17 code 43 what the heck is a by Joker I really don't know but you just throw it in there right that's that's this possibility or it's just a bunch of text just says on 6 2 to 13 lots of interesting things there but we don't know what they are so I put them into some kind of a key value situation because at least I know I'm receiving a record and the record is a key about me now again like we said in the very beginning it could be worst case scenario I received record and the key is a delivery the delivery ID inside it there's lots of known unknown concepts being described that defines a lot more work for me to have to do but I like to point out in this case for a modeling perspective we're all data modelers big data means more awareness means more work and it's kind of a boon industry for us because now there's more for us to do that's good news as data modelers the first to become the real critical ones I would argue the first two and the third one are also really important right and they all work within the big data platforms and the ones towards the right work more on the big data defined as n structured or some structure in some of the way multi structured let's go through the models again real quick because and forget about the specifics of this model for a moment just consider its form the interesting thing about this is if it's unstructured or key value pair how does this model absorb that I remember conceptual logical physical right conceptual and logical models that were working on how does it absorb having the attribution baked into the form of the entity probably not really well if the attribution is unknown right if the attribution is some other form doesn't really work quite as well if you look at a data ball model which is in this case a example of ensemble which is really the the modeling forms that I think most new projects are trending towards with some kind of a decomposition of forms we take the key the known key that we're working with so I know that it's a customer I know that that's row is going to relate to that customer and then I separate from it the context that describes it in this case in a satellite if you're working with anchor modeling it would be an attribute it's called right I also have relationships in the form of links and all relationships are jettisoned from their form of their cept in other words every relationship is many-to-many that's true also of all the forms that we work with in ensemble okay well what does that mean that means that the backbone that I described right erased the attribution for a minute the backbone that I'm describing for this model is core business concepts plus natural business relationships which are true in all the forms of modeling we're going to do whether it's big data structured unstructured or not right so our modeling of these components what you did here and even the identification of some forms of attribution are a common and usable form for everything we do now that means that satellites which don't have their own identity but just take the identity the key they're going to describe can take any form it can be a json doc in sure because it has a key that says I belong to the hub key store ID or sale ID but I'm now currently being described in a JSON bracket name value name value name value name value bracket that's I'm currently being described if that becomes important to me I may do a schema on focus grab those things and create an attributed satellite in a more traditional warehouse fine because it really still doesn't impact my back bone does it now my back bone can support satellites that are fully attributed they can full support fully just text blob if they want to be right the missing component in this whole model you're gonna find is the delivery that comes in with a delivery ID that says all I know is I was in Germany on this day and here's a bunch of stuff that is in my bag but I don't know which concept that could belong to right and from there you'd have to apply some kind of a taxonomy some kind of a meaning to at least get to the point where you're talking about known instances best Czech keys of things that you're gonna be working with but if you look at what's going with big data today whether it's in the unstructured or it's in the processing world for efficiency and distribution this is always pretty much going to be true I don't know of many or any cases I've worked with where it's delivery ID and everything unknown I haven't worked with that yet so not to say I'm looking forward to it I'm just saying I haven't spent any time in that world yet and I would argue that if it's not 99 it's 95 percent of everything we're doing in this arena fits into this categorization yeah yeah yeah I think the thing is that this also goes into the discussion on ensemble modelling and it's different forms so if you look at anchor modeling and focal point for example they separate the business key from the instance so in a big data world if I know it's a customer and I have an instance I can create at worst case scenario some kind of a sequence for the existence of that instance and in the future as I'm trying to see if there's some kind of deduplication to consider right I can now go through and say are these attributes that's defining the same instance and in which case I can fix it but that's going to be true of all warehousing and data management no matter what you either know when it comes in that the key is based on a so well you have some kind of a key that can provide uniqueness from a business view or you don't and when you don't you're gonna end up with multiple records and that's always going to be true and I think it's true definitely in this case for example if you have very softly structured information on what the customer is for you to get customer habits right how often does this customer by not just how often does 6 foot 2 tall person from Colorado boy you're gonna have to find out is this customer the same as the other one and provide some logic on that and that's part of this part of the loose structure the really important thing there is when you're working with ensemble methods or things like this I can support it you don't have to know in order to start using it but whatever you do know can be captured so it's that it's the two parts that fit together yeah so applying the ensemble methods really brings you the the idea of integration across platforms you know without the specific tooling like the whole unity platform interrogate or something it's not so within that sound same realm but from our modeling logical perspective so if I want to get data around the customer or data around a product or a store across all my platforms structured and Big Data I'm able to do that through this kind of a backbone model so will it change for us I think that's that's pretty true so big data modeling again we're going to end up with those three categories of modeling possibilities core business concepts will always be true we're over time but I'm going to just last two three slides real quick this is just a question for you and I'll try to answer it because the Big Data platforms are based on some kind of a distribution across nodes and because in samba methods separate things especially if you look at like a anchor model even in third normal form we separate things right by descriptors in different entity classes but does it double the effect or give us half the effect when we load decomposed models into a into a Big Data Platform and the answer is it's probably half the effect or one-tenth the effect or just a horrible effect because as it turns out the way we want to manage things distributed over nodes in a big data platform it's much better if we give it something much flatter which means that our modeling will be impacted a little bit when it comes to the deployment so as we're moving from logical to physical to actual the deployment model when we go to the Big Data Platform but when you look at it it's gonna look much more flattened across that key it's gonna have to right because we can't take advantage of the power of that platform without doing that that doesn't mean that our logical and conceptual models shouldn't be based on on doing it this way one of the key drivers by the way is integration so yeah you can use big data for operational systems mm-hmm doesn't really seem to fit the bill there if you look in the warehousing world it's useful but where you really have to consider this idea of applying concepts and ensembles is the fact that we need to integrate data in order to integrate data we need to have some understanding of what it is at least at the instance what is the thing is that a customer what is it from there we can leverage the heck out of it but we at least have to do that first part so we can effectively integrate data and I could stand to you know otherwise we end up with silos and data kept in silos is again less valuable we can't really apply it in the same way so summary slide for all of us into the world of the future and especially concerning big data modeling conceptual modeling absolutely take those couple steps into the business and get more involved their logical modeling absolutely as you go from attribution to further defined attribution information modeling in all three of these you're still getting down to that level of identifying the attribution required to describe this thing this name this person place thing event that we're describing physical data modeling not so much all right and the Big Data platforms it's going to be pretty much a job to combine and flatten before you load into that world and an integration platform absolutely and actually and I would tell you that ensemble methods are very uniquely capable of being able to handle the integration of data across multiple platforms without a doubt because of the separation of the content form from the table that contains the key and the relationships it's critical to have that separation for us to continue our work going on there now and that's pretty much the summary myself Genesee Academy we do a certification for data vault so you'll find classes pretty much all around the world then funds coming up in the nearest time window I think are in Australia so if you should like to be in Sydney or Brisbane or Melbourne come on down you know that's a great place Helsinki is coming up thank you that's in two weeks thanks from Coe okay two weeks for Helsinki and then after that as we get into the first week of December Stockholm MoMA thanks Amsterdam and there might be it down there not sure anyway you can check that out also I've got a copy of my book here modeling the agile data warehouse with datavault long title I'm sorry also you can catch information on this kind of topics at my blog sorry it's a little hidden but if you go to the blog console Chrome WordPress comm there's a list on the right download presentation white papers and there's a whole list just there PDFs you can just pull them down that's pretty much about it yeah
