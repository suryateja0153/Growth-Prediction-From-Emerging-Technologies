 let's start with a simple word orange it brings to mind a number of possibilities a fruit a color a brand name a place or perhaps something specific to your organization like the orange meeting room understanding the context the meaning of words is the science of semantics search engines are greater indexing words but they're not so good at understanding the users information seeking behavior for example what's he used thinking about when they type in a one word search simple searches for orange returned millions of hits wouldn't it be great if the system ask them what they meant say by adding it did you mean or suggesting by predictive type erred something that makes sense to their domain or perhaps by providing an intelligent set of filters on the left hand side to allow a user to narrow their search to the specific topics but when we say intelligent we mean that these filters don't just throw more search terms in but actually return a set of pages that you'd be confident are about that topic having found a topic of interest what if the subject matter experts in your company could suggest other related areas you might want to explore and suddenly a whole new user journey has become available that's where the semaphore open semantic platform comes in we provide a set of services that knowledge manages information architects or user experience designers need to capture the context and meaning of the language used in your organization and integrated with any application that helps users create manage find and use content in this screenshot you can see the orange is a type of company that operates in the telecommunications sector and was formerly known as France Telecom orange in our domain is now in context from the model we create a classification system here's an example of the process orange and FTE are mentioned on both documents but clearly only one is about France Telecom we use a rule based classification approach that understands both of value of the concepts in your ontology and the contact structure so because this document contains more concepts which map to our concept of orange the company we can give this document more wait this process is one of the most accurate and transparent automatic classification mechanisms available our semantic enhancement server provides a high speed index to the model so it can help with navigation data linking faceted search or any number of user interactions semaphore is unique in the way these elements are combined so that a business analyst or information scientist can easily create and manage the semantic layer our integration with packages such as SharePoint Apache Solr and MarkLogic deliver end-to-end solutions so back to our simple word orange semantics can be complex the solution you need must be flexible enough to deal with the structures and language specific to your organization and the outputs must be of the highest quality poor classification or misleading topic suggestions don't help the user go from search to find from find to discover semaphore has this depth of capability and that's why you need the open semantic platform from smart logic
