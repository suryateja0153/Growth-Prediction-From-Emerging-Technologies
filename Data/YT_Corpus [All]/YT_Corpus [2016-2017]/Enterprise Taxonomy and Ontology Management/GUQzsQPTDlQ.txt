 how is everyone today I usually don't speak through a mic so I apologize if I get a little loud I might need those those of you sitting next to the speaker might have to actually movement in the middle I get excited about these topics so just out of curiosity I want to find out who's here real quick just a couple of you and what you're here for anybody want a volunteer nobody wants to speak up all right I will do my best then to cover the topic at hand this presentation I built in conjunction with Scott Ambler this is discipline agile delivery and data warehousing so here we go how many of you know what agile means or discipline agile delivery is okay so bottom line disciplined agile delivery or the things that Scott Ambler talk about Scott Ambler is the original father of the agile manifesto how many of you know what the agile manifesto is okay Thank You Kristen so Scott Ambler wrote the original agile manifesto and I'm proud that to say that he's not only working with me on date of alt but he's also a big supporter so what we're going to talk about today is this no question is out of bounds as long as it's about the presentation be more than happy to talk to you about it why can't my people deliver in an agile fashion so what does that mean right what does that mean that means why can't we have training why can't we put put people in that understand the processes that understand how to execute on agile so we're going to explore this a little bit what does it mean to have an agile delivery mechanism right how do I get from zero to agile how many of you are involved in an agile project today or what you might call an attempt at an agile project today all right how many of you have been formally trained in agile okay so some of you if I get something wrong those of you they've been formally trained please correct me we're all human I make mistakes so there go technology how can technology enable agile delivery and this is a big one how many of you have bosses that say oh we have to automate we have to automate and they don't understand what that means right so automation you can't get there from here without being agile in your processes but in order to be agile we got to start with the people right it's all about the people being agile means you've got a team that is engaged a team that is capable of running your project in an agile fashion you know you've got you've got these folks I don't know if you've had these folks but I've been on some teams where we start to move towards an agile fashion and all of a sudden this one person or these two people say well we're not going with you we want to be the superstar we're gonna drag our feet we're gonna deliver the way we've always delivered we're not going to follow whatever new thing that you're doing and it's an agile fashion that we're trying to accomplish anybody have any of these people on their teams right these are the kinds of people you have to remove from your team you either need to fire them or you need to move them off onto another project because they will keep you from being agile they will stop you from succeeding star players on an agile team don't work okay everyone is collaborative so one of the agile manifesto principles is all about collaboration okay collaboration is a big part of it everyone plays a role and everyone on the agile team at least from the perspective of the implementation side is a backup to everyone else on the agile team that's generally the way it works so if someone leaves the team or goes on vacation the backup can fill in maybe not as good or as well or do it as quickly but they can fill in and help fill the role and get the work done so being agile is about people that's where it starts it's about people and if you don't have the right dynamic you will not be agile if someone says I'm the star player I always do the work I do all the work none of you get it done you don't understand it those kind of people can never be agile well they can if time softens them and they come back to the team say I'm ready to be a team player but you need team players in order to accomplish agility so let's explore the foundations of agile if my clicker will work okay there we go I might be running out of battery so why can't my people deliver in an agile fashion what does this really mean well the first thing you need in terms of delivering in an agile meow my clickers not working I'm sorry I I just first thing you need to be agile is inspiration inspiration does everybody understand what this means inspiration you've got to have an idea you got to have people who are inspired to be agile and this is what I was just talking about you can't have someone on the team dragging their feet saying I don't want to go that way I don't want to do this I don't want to create a solution with you I want to be the star I want to maintain my own Kingdom that doesn't work you got to be inspired to be agile you got to have a problem that you want to solve in an agile fashion you got have people that want to contribute to the solution in a rapid fashion the next thing that you need is motivation right you can't have motivation without inspiration right you got to be motivated motivated to participate motivated to go to training motivated to learn new things anybody in here on a team that's been doing the same thing over and over and over again for the last five years right and it's tired of it don't raise your hands it's self-incriminating yeah that's the nature then you need education this is the major part that the business management seemed to always forget oh we got to wake up one day oh we're gonna be agile today when was last time you heard that we're from now on we are agile how does that work right with no training oh you're just gonna deliver faster better faster cheaper anybody ever have you tell you that right that doesn't work so first you need inspiration then you need motivation you've got to want to do these things and this is all about people and then you need to be educated this is the next piece you have to get the proper education in agile it's just like anything else we've been doing for the last 20 years how many in show hands how many of you have at least 20 years of experience in high tea or data or systems 15 15 years or more 10 years or more okay the point is this we've all been around long enough to know better right an education is the key to new things to getting new things right there's no substitute for good education and Scott and I have talked about this over and over again we run into customers that say oh we want to be agile and as I said you don't wake up one morning and just say oh you know what today looks like a good day the Sun is out then the air is fresh and it's nice and crisp I'm gonna do everything Angela de well without knowing how to go about that process it's not going to work it's pretending you know let's say you buy a new Ferrari everybody liked Ferraris if you don't like Ferraris maybe you like Lamborghinis how about eggs eggs right these super cars maybe you don't like those maybe you like Mercedes right or Audi or whatever it is but it's like getting a brand new car and never looking in the owners manual and saying gee you know I think today I'm gonna be agile I'm gonna modify the engine and you've never had a mechanic's class in your life so you end up putting a carburetor where the air filter should go does that work no in fact the car probably won't run so this is the point right then the last piece here is tooling and unfortunately businesses get this completely opposite where do businesses normally start in this paradigm anyone too late oh we bought a new tool that says you gonna be agile so here it is go read the manual how well does that work or you're gonna generate for your warehouse now are you going to generate for your bi solution now no that doesn't work tooling is the last piece to the puzzle it's the last piece of the puzzle okay so this is where it is tooling and enablers are the last component to being agile so let's contemplate something for a minute frameworks versus methodologies anybody ever hear these terms before if you're going to consider agile you have to think about frameworks versus methodologies so let's change gears here frameworks are a little loose how many you but she'll hands no John's a cleaners equity framework FRA t just a couple doesn't mean you need to know it okay but it is something that is a reference framework under which we all do our work usually within a cell data warehousing or business intelligence is one cell inside of the Zachman framework and it might bleed over into a couple of other cells so it's a much larger enterprise IT focus framework but frameworks are loose frameworks are loose data warehouse 2.0 my good friend bill inmon is here if you don't have a chance I haven't had a chance to talk to him sit down and talk to him the man is brilliant he created the industry that we all earn a living in at least in data warehousing today so I'm very grateful for that but data warehouse 2.0 is a framework for data warehousing it tells you the pieces that you need in order to get things done you do need a road map anybody out here ever travel to a new place or a new country and not have a GPS and then try to find your way around how well does that work come on you guys it must be lunge kicking in or something right that doesn't work very well especially if you have to travel a good distance through the city and the city's full of one-way streets much like it is here at Humber right if you don't know your way around you're going to end up doing circle after circle up the circle trying to find your address anybody done that or the construction around here yeah of course even if you know your way right so frameworks only give you the what the pieces right they don't tell you the how how should I build what are the best practices how can I be agile how can I be rapid and successful and quick so methodologies give you the approach to doing something the standards the best practices and this is what data vault methodology our date about 2.0 brings to the table so if you're looking at data vault 2.0 it is actually supported by both my good friends bill inmon as well as Scott Ambler in terms of being agile everything we've baked in to date about 2.0 is is approved by these two individuals okay so let's move along so let's take a look at what this means so contemplate the following agile equals framework and date of all 2.0 method ecology frameworks vs. methodology so delivering in an agile fashion requires a solid design principle a solid design principle you have to have the right roadmap and the right instructions I can give you 53 different ways to get from Hamburg to Munich on a bicycle on a walking trail on a hike through the forest and down through the woods or whatever you want to do or by car by Autobahn different cities on the Autobahn I can route you through three different ways right so this is the nature of it being agile is the most direct route but it's only the most direct route if there's no construction going on in the middle of the Autobahn everybody understand this ya know maybe it is this helpful for you because I've got other places to go I could be I'm just kidding I'm just kidding all right so delivering in a cell faster requires a solid pattern based repeatable methodology and this is what date about 2.0 brings to the table you need to have a solid plan for executing for implementing and designing and building and getting your team on board so let's take a look at what that means okay clean standards before we go any further let's explore the definitions right a lot of people get up here and they talk to you about agile lists and methodology that how many of you are using scrum yeah lean initiatives Kanban right okay my favorite term don't tell Scott I said this this is a strange story I said Scott you know I've got customers who are using scrum and agile hybrid and I said is it okay if I call it scratch I'll anyway don't do that it's not called scratch ow it's actually called discipline agile delivery that's what Scott calls it so it's a modification most of my customers are not running scrum rigid and most of my customers are not running agile solid or straight so let's take a look at this agile agility is the ability to be quick and graceful sounds simple enough right but let's take a look at what else this is scrum is a simple framework a framework there it is a framework doesn't tell you how tells you what you need doesn't tell you how right for effective team collaboration but it's only focused on team collaboration it's not necessarily focused on work in progress so what is Kanban right people tell me oh I'm implementing Kanban I sell really are you in the manufacturing business no well then you're not building stuff just in time but it doesn't have to necessarily just be the manufacturing business Kanban is a nature of just-in-time delivery that could be anything that you're building okay Kanban leads into Six Sigma and measurements and all those other things so agile is an evolutionary process you must get trained in order to become an agile organization okay you must get trained and you must understand these basic definitions so let's continue on with this what's the next piece nearly as many definitions of lean initiatives or lean as lean practitioners and consultants okay how many of you remember function point analysis from the 70s am i dating myself here again I've got white hair here my wife says you should go get it colored you're showing your age they call it distinguished these days right isn't that what it is but anyway the point is lean initiatives was a way of measuring anybody in here familiar with capability maturity models key process areas key process indicators anybody ever apply these techniques to data warehousing and the process of building your business intelligence solution okay here's the deal if you truly want to be agile or successful at agility then you need to understand what it is you're building you need to know how long it takes where the problems are in the process of building your BI solutions otherwise how do you go from a seven week turnaround cycle to a two-week turnaround cycle so everybody get this you can't optimize what you don't measure okay that's just the start of it so capability maturity model otherwise known as CMM is a way of handling these components in an agile fashion so this is what we're trying to look at lean initiatives is a way of eliminating waste how do you eliminate waste in the process of building enterprise bi solutions or data warehouses or even within a sprint a two-week sprint how do you eliminate waste that process didn't work well for us we tried it and it caused our build-out process to be three weeks or four weeks how do you eliminate that process or reduce or remove or do better I'm sure you've heard better cheaper faster well that's the business way of saying mature the process of building your data warehouse this is all part and parcel of being agile the word agility is just the cream of the crop it's the icing on the top of the cake you still have to bake the cake underneath and you better understand what the recipe is for getting into the cake so this is the nature of it so let's take a look this disciplined agile delivery is a hybrid framework now this is not my definition as you can see here this is straight from Scott Ambler builds upon the solid foundation of other methods and process frameworks now do you begin to understand why training is so important now the good news is my buddy Scott Ambler has a two day training class it's only two days team work team-based work and he gets you off the ground quick so you can understand this fairly quickly but the whole nature of this is that it's more than meets the eye right we've all seen that picture with an iceberg in the tip of the iceberg and then the big iceberg underneath the water that's kind of what we're looking at here with agility to be agile is a learning curve to be agile is an evolution when you start you're agile journey your team delivery cycles or your Sprint's might very well be seven weeks or ten weeks until you can manage and measure and optimize the process you need to understand what the process is you need to identify the key process areas of how you build before you can optimize and shrink it down to give you an example I've had a customer in the Netherlands using data vault 2.0 now for two years and they're going from two-week sprints down to one-week sprints but they didn't start there it's a team of five people supporting a thousand people in their organization so before you think oh you know well that's just a small team a small company no they're fielding lots of requests they probably have 30 service requests almost every day or once a week so this is important so the data ball to methodology is a group of implementation directives it tells you how to implement along that the dad framework the other piece that we talk about in terms of being agile is understanding TQM so everybody understand I just up here earlier I mentioned total quality management does everybody know what total quality management is everybody on basically understands term total quality management is one step past data quality and this is where organizations fall down why is this part of agile and I'll answer that in a minute but total quality management is basically the feedback loop putting accountability for the data back in their business users hands why is this important because you don't want to be in the reporting business you don't want to be building reports when you should be building value out of your sprints for the data warehouse for the business you want to be exploring new information systems and new deliveries you want to be delivering constant value over time this is what agile is about it's not just about being fast or cheaper right better faster cheaper as a part of it but better people forget this whole thing about better it's not just about data quality data quality is improve the quality put it out on a bi solution and off it goes into the Netherland of business that's data quality total quality management includes not only the feedback loop of the business user not only accepting accountability for that you heard my story about the CFO this is where this comes from this organization is it is a massive bank and they own 53 subsidiary banks underneath and they're running real-time their development teams are agile now and they have over a hundred and fifty programmers on cloud era Hadoop alone and they have teams of 20 running around in their business intelligence solutions building parallel team paths being agile two week deliveries this is after two and a half years they did not start there they did not start there but in order to get there you have to understand the total quality cycle total quality management accountability where accountability belongs why is this important because the last thing you want is your IT people managing the data and fixing the data on a daily basis that's not your job who owns the data IT or business come on it's not a trick question business business owns the data so why are we fixing the data on a daily basis this is the question and if we're stuck fixing the data on a daily basis how do we become agile and answering business user questions and what happens when we aren't agile and don't answer business user questions what are the business users do well I can tell you what I've seen the business users will go around us the business users will say IT costs too much IT takes too long IT never delivers on time or in budget why because you're fiddling around with their data you're not answering their business questions just make sense so to be agile is to clean out the process total quality management includes the quality of the processes and the accountability of the data set back with the business users so this is very very important thing for you to think about Six Sigma does everybody understand what Six Sigma is well you do now right it's a it's a way to measure errors it's a way to find out what's going wrong okay this is a management technique it's got proven mathematics you've all heard the term at least four operational systems nine nines uptime or six nines uptime they're referring to a Six Sigma number a very specific number that refers to the amount of uptime and operational system has to have well data warehouses guess what in order to become critical path for the business they are becoming a system of record in order to become a system of record they must become trustworthy in order to become trustworthy you have to put the data back in the hands where it belongs and you need to make the end-users business users accountable for that information so this is all part of it now Six Sigma what does that do for our path of building and enterprise data warehouse RBI solution Six Sigma allows us to measure the defects in our ETL or ELT routines the defects in the process of getting the requirements and building the solution that meets the business users needs that's what Six Sigma does okay it allows us to find out where the process problems are this is the business of building data warehouses how many of you in here like to make more money Wow that's how we have just a couple okay the rest of you see me after class right so the point is this how many of you like your jobs right well okay and maybe don't answer that one but the point is this if you want if you like what you do and you want to succeed at it and you and you're like me and you want to do better then you're going to think about what kinds of problems that I have in the last time I iterate it and that's what agility tries to focus on if you're in a three week sprint why is it a three week sprint what caused it to run beyond two weeks that made it a three week sprint was it a process problem was it a business requirements gathering problem there's all sorts of things in the agility curve what were the errors did we spend time after we delivered to production that we spend time going back and instead of delivering new value we were fixing the stuff we just put out that's what to Six Sigma is meant to help you identify right and what did I say earlier I said you can't optimize what you don't measure well if you don't measure then you can't you can't measure what you don't identify does this make sense to you so you got to identify the measure to optimize this this is the premises of maturing the process of building data warehouses or BI solutions okay so Six Sigma is a measurement technique that you need to know about and the end of this or the capstone is CMMI capability maturity model framework now you don't need to go out and read 30,000 page tomes this by the way comes from Carnegie Mellon CMMI and they are thirty thousand page tones they're much like the Zachman IT framework they're wide and expansive you don't to know all of this you just need to know enough in order to get the job done in order to be agile okay so this is how these components and these methodologies fit together so let's take a look at discipline agile delivery goals if you're looking at discipline agile delivery this is the nature of it right you've got an inception phase form initial teams and all that I'm not going to read this slide because it's all up there construction phases ongoing phases transition phases but what I want to point out are the components where the methodology tells you how to do this how to do this okay let me just stop and ask are there any questions so far is this what you would hope to get from this session yes no okay ah okay anyone else want to know a little more about the date about 2.0 methodology okay so I will stop and segue for just a minute about the date about 2.0 methodology the date of all 2.0 methodology is not extremely new it is based on all of these principles it comes from the best practices from CMM it comes from the best practices of Six Sigma which is why I'm talking about them it comes from the best practices of PMP or project management practices everybody know about that right the PM bak the project management body of knowledge all of these kinds of things I was formally trained in Six Sigma not sorry in an CMM at a company I used to work for a US government agency and I spent probably five years working with CMM principles and best design practices out of that I realized what we're doing when we build data warehouses what are we building well we're all tamera building software how many of you ever looked at your data warehouse build and go well we're building software do we have a production release do we have a test release do we have a development release do we have unit tests all of that stuff aligns with software development how many of you know about SDLC software development life cycles how many of you have made the connection between SDLC and building data warehouses this is the missing part right so CMM the date of all 2.0 methodology is surrounded with these concepts and the best practices in order to enable your teams to make this work now what you get when you when you when you go through the the sorry the data vault to methodology is you get the best practices I'll wrap together and you get it basically a guidebook on how to navigate through these principles the brand new book that I have that's being printed as we mentioned before it's called building a scalable data warehouse with data vault 2.0 687 pages took us two years to write is full chock-full of implementation details and specifics about where CMM is integrated where TQM is integrated where sei and Six Sigma work and has all the mathematics that book is also soup to nuts or end-to-end it includes all the components that you need for even a hands-on project so you can download the example datasets the source is there the it's built on the sequel server stack it doesn't mean that a sequel server specific but we have the SSIS jobs the DTS X jobs and all that the date of all 2.0 methodology is a comprehensive design paradigm that builds on these best practices and principles it makes the assumption that you understand that when you build a data warehouse or business intelligence solution you are delivering software if you don't agree with that paradigm see me after class I've got slides that explain otherwise but obviously we may use software to leverage right to leverage production or to leverage generation we might use it informatica or datastage your talent or ab initio or power design or whatever but in the end we have all the same software development life cycles that existed in the SDLC so what agility brings to the table is this idea of doing it better faster cheaper but then the question becomes how do we get there from here we don't want to be stuck in the old waterfall from an enterprise perspective that's the whole nature part of agility says I'm going to design or be able to design once I've been trained a project that works in a two-week time frame and then if I go along let's say I go along and this happens customer sites frequently I go along three or four days and we talked to the customers and all some we hit a roadblock it's not an IT roadblock it could be but most of the time it's a business roadblock like for instance there was one company I was doing work for and they wanted us to load data to a chart of accounts in a data warehouse and they wanted the data warehouse to figure out where all of the financial information fit in the chart of accounts does that sound like a data warehouse job to you okay so here was the issue they had at the end of the day we did some digging and we found out they had no less than seven different sources for chart of accounts only one of them was trusted and it ran close of our end of month closed books so how do we enable the business to be more agile and more rapid and how do we deliver now the other flipside of that story was they've been trying to do this in their data warehouse their existing quote unquote information model and data warehouse for the last 15 months unsuccessfully I'm a dad so what we ended up doing was saying to the business look as part of the agility we had to stop the project which was a deliverable goal in two weeks and say we're going to refocus the team on another project you have to be willing to change direction that's part of being agile this project or this Sprint's now on hold until the business comes back with an answer here are the options business that you need an answer for the option number one you could choose to do nothing and it will take another 15 months and we probably won't have anything in the warehouse for you you could option number two you could hire a programmer that understands the Java code that does the chart of accounts in the closing of the books every month and you could change the code on that operational system that feeds finance and give us the intermediate tables that it was not dumping so this is part of the data quality and data initiative and so the warehouse would warehouse the results of that operation that was trusted we ended up saving the company and that's what they chose but they took two or three weeks to make that decision and make the change meanwhile we were off on another sprint delivering so this is kind of what it means to be agile but with the date of all to methodology what we bring into the fray is in addition to just the methodology of all these components but we bring into the we bring in the date of alt modeling and we bring in the the ETL paradigms or the e-elt Paradise by the way in case you hadn't guessed and I've said this before publicly ETL is dead ETL is dead if you want a scale ETL won't do it long live ELT now what does that mean that means the paradigm of design of moving something out of a database and through a stream and down into a target is dead and gone the only way to scale now I'm talking hundreds of terabytes here if you say to me well Dan I've only got a fifty three gig system and you can still use ETL and get away with it but when you get into scale this is also why you see with no sequel and they say move the processing to where the data is that's another way of saying ETL is dead so that's my soapbox but this is the nature of the data about tube methodology we come in and and help you understand how to be agile how to make this work and how these components fit together does that help you understand the question yes I will get to that near the end of my presentation I have one slide in this presentation on that I go a bit further in other presentations on that but let me see what I can do here we might be able to play with time are there any questions so far okay some good questions all right so here we go people say well how was date about 2.0 methodology agile is it agile and not just Scott Ambler but one of my customers okay this doesn't look so big a structural change to every single table in the source system and in the data warehouse is 40 yard tables so what is the impact of being agile of using data vault methodology this was the impact from my customer queue super we automated the change in packs and they were dealt with one developer over a period of three weeks one developer all 40 source system changes when was the last time you were able to make a change to your data warehouse because there were 40 source system table changes when was last time can you do this today if the answer is no that's because you aren't properly implementing agility in most cases okay there might be other outstanding circumstances cause this but this is the nature of it most of the work was used now you start to see metadata to drive changes they had gotten to the point of optimization and what did they leverage to get here a tool a generation tool an automation tool okay you can't automate what you don't optimize and you can't optimize what you don't what come on you can't optimize what you don't measure right next time don't be so afraid to speak up right because you're right that's the way it worked so this is the whole nature and I've got more quotes at the end of this show beyond the final slide if you want to see them that talk about this specific project and how they got there so why can't my people deliver in an agile fashion because they require a solid methodology and this is where people get off the boat well you can go learn agile all day long but unless you have a standard design best practice for data warehousing to build on you're not going to get there it's like walking in and say I'm going to build skyscrapers today has anybody familiar with the proper building skyscrapers it's much different than the method for building houses right because you have different weight distribution you have to worry about wind and the height of the building and the footprint of the building and then the components of security and what if at least in in the United States you have to worry about earthquakes and now airplanes crashing in so lots of different things that have to go into consideration of a skyscraper right so lots of different things but you need a solid methodology not just a framework in other words you can have blueprints for the best house in the world but unless you have specifics that tell you what to build first how to build it and then how to check it for errors what is the job of an inspector for your home before you can purchase it or finalize it with the city what's the job of an inspector anybody ever had a house built I don't know about this the inspector comes in and says yes or no this home is safe for people to live in that's the bottom line right so in this case being agile me being able to provide a home in a proper well-built and and timed approach so this is the nature of it so another key people inspiration motivation education culture datavault 2.0 brings the standards it brings the methodology it brings the best practices and a pattern based model and repeatable implementation so these are the components underneath the methodology that you would use to build your data warehouse successfully just to show hands how many of you are working on data vault in any shape or form 100 or 200 today just a couple ok that's good how many of you are curious about date about 2.0 if you want so you're gonna be able to as I said by the book you can pre-order it on Amazon I'm I'm not trying to sell it to you but I am it's cheaper than the class it has everything let me just put it this way the book has everything I've been teaching in the date of all 2.0 certification class for the last four or five years for three years actually three years for the CD bp2 so it's got all of this stuff in there so anyway it brings all these components together so what does it mean to have agile delivery let's talk about them okay so agile delivery objective the objective you hear this all the time a two weeks bran - three weeks sprint what does that mean well does that mean I'm going to build an entire end-to-end solution in two weeks the answer's no and especially when you start when you start your business requirements acquisition phase might be a two week sprint in order to learn what's wrong with the business acquisition phase how long does it take to gather requirements and where can I do it better remember it's about monitoring measuring and then optimizing right that's all part of the agile component tree and then your next phase might be a design phase so when you begin this process you might end up with a four or six or eight weeks sprint cycle for one deliverable or one set of deliverables but it's very very important that you measure this up right you've got to take a look at this from a delivery component so what makes an agile process what makes an agile process an agile process really is comprised of scope simplicity and automation but remember you can't get to scope and simplicity and automation until the people are trained you could have the best tools in the world anybody ever had tools sitting on their shelves and their company that is just gathering dust the company bought this tool shoved it in your face and said here we bought the license for you and you went why right yeah well all seen that but what purpose does the tools serve so you can't automate the best automation tool in the world is not going to serve you if you don't have a good practice to implement it with if you don't have common standards to build from so that's the nature of these tools so let's let's move along here so agile process build this is what it looks like right I'm from discipline agile delivery initial idea envision hypothesis you build a little don't build a lot we talked about this up here on the stage scope scope scope scope scope which brings me to the next point you want to apply the proper scope in your agile process build or you're not going to get there all right does it do me any good to walk into an enterprise ago you know what you're a large corporate global enterprise a banking solution and you have 53 different banks all over the world I can build you a warehouse in two weeks how well does that go over right that doesn't work it doesn't work okay you need to do it let me ask you this when you have a large problem in life in regular life to face what's the first thing you do with it do you compose you break it down give the man a thousand points see it scene whose line is it anyway the points don't matter if you haven't checked it out so on YouTube is really cool there's something called scenes from a hat they're just my favorite anyway the point is this you've decomposed it why then do we go into whitey and wear a different mindset and decide to try and tackle the entire problem all in one project it's ridiculous apply your common sense to what you're doing in your build cycles and you will succeed so scope is a big big part of it process agility the cleaner the simpler the integration and we go through each of these components and datavault land but you want a clear delineation now these are some of the artifacts that we build and date of all 2.0 methodology so that's what you're looking at we look at the business case but our business cases are one page to one-and-a-half pages long and I'm not talking about six point font printed sideways across the axis of the paper no not unreadable junk we're talking about 12 points single line spacing right so business case is well-defined you've got to have a well-defined business case and if it's not well-defined then you need to have a defined objective right what kind of computation are we doing what kind of star scheme are we producing what type of metric does the business user want right been from the business process now the business processes have long been ignored in data warehousing build-outs which is a problem you need to focus on the business process why how many of you have one and only one source system in your entire application and your entire company to deal with anybody you'd be lucky it's very very rare that I run into an all s ap company but even then you have to ask the question well wait a minute you've got s CP in Germany you've got s AP in China you got s AP in the US now you've got global problems because they all implement it s ap slightly differently now the data doesn't jive anybody ever done this yeah that's a praying so you've got to look at the business processes because the business process is Thai the data as an asset back to the business by business key and this is the focus of the data vault componentry ok you have to look at the business keys so the nature of all of this ultimately you want to look at the process boundaries between each DS but the size the size of these circles is really the scope that you're focused on ok that's the scope so you're going to cut these down vertically and implement them in two and three week Sprint's and that's what we want to do try to cut these down and look at them in that regard ok so what you're after small scope quick release how many of you have been in data warehousing situations where the the change requests keep building and building and building and you never finish the q yeah this is a problem you can't have that in an agile fashion or if you do you can't claim to be agile agility also means being able to scale your teams don't forget parallel teams is part of agile process so if your scope grows or your requirements grow your work backlog or you sometimes they call it backlog sometimes they call it a work in progress or a whip this if that grows you have to be able to scale your team now I'm not talking about funding that's a whole different issue to be able to scale your team and that's something that politically has to be taken up but what you want is an implementation paradigm like this the scope is the size of the circle so when rules change when source system changes when source systems get sunset when new systems come in you want your data warehouse to keep up with the business users changes this is absolutely vital to being successful in agile oh and this little note at the bottom little to no reengineering of existing queries in the old processes this is what the date of up model brings to the table you have to have a solid architecture in order to have a solid implementation yes no not for you know of course sure the metadata is managed through a governance process when when you start working down the agile process path you heard me say this earlier on the stage governance is extremely important okay governance becomes paramount in a company in order to maintain agile or agility so if you don't have anyone watching governance and that includes metadata metadata is a big piece of tying the business and the logical models to the business process in the business case a huge piece and I wish I could jump the gun and show you the slides that my friend is prepared from q super on this that will be at the IBM conference in Vegas in a couple months but I can't I don't have time but governance is a big part of it so there has to be someone there workin the metadata angles alongside of all of these processes it's a separate job stream they're agile in their own right and they work with the warehousing team to help get that done good question okay I don't have a conceptual model yes my comments earlier we're talking about conceptual models this stack is changing I haven't updated this slide conceptual models in my opinion sit somewhere between the business case and the business processes the scope of the conceptual model may vary depending on what you're doing now I do use a technique for agile requirements gathering that captures the conceptual model it's it I use mind mapping tools do you guys ever ever know about mind mapping tools you know what they are right they're really really good at conceptual models and hierarchies I haven't found a use for them until or except that I looked at mind mapping back when it was huge and coming out in vendors were like you should do this you should do this I'm like why but then when I got into conceptual modeling it all made sense conceptual model and layout ontology and I can do it on a presenter a screen overhead and I can do in front of the business users making my process of business requirements and business understanding agile because I can modify the conceptual mind map as they tell me that's wrong this is wrong this is right and I can add definitions to it not just terms so if I don't have a business glossary to start from or I don't have a common definition or data dictionary and I'm trying to understand the business these are fantastic tools for agility to make things move ahead yes Danny yes well again you want to automate as much of this stack as possible but that only comes with maturity of your agility stack okay so let's move along here I'm sorry I'm running out of time I apologize we're closed but we got to get there okay I do have slides at the back of this show if you can download them for anything I don't get to I think Steve allows you to download them on on his website and whatnot or that he may have given them out but anyway simple processes well trained team manage reengineering you have to manage reengineering how many times have you heard of customers say you know what we built this for the last five years or six years and this is what I hear all the time we can no longer afford to build more we can no longer afford to implement changes we can no longer we have to Greenfield it and they think I'll throw the old out and just bring into dupa to solve all the problems no that's only one piece of the problem okay Hadoop doesn't solve all the problems there's people there's process and technology and that's what's often forgotten by management in order to be agile in order to be fast in order to be efficient you have to have all these components ok so how can technology deliver agile in an agile way well technology must automate the standard processes if you don't have standardized processes if you haven't optimized your data warehouse build to the point of standard processing you cannot hope to generate when was the last time you were able to generate a fully conformed dimension load completely business object anybody I have yet to see it okay but data warehouse loads different story especially if you're in the data vault and those of you who are building data bolts know the source the stage is a defined standard a well-defined standard the stage into the vault is a well-defined standard real-time trickle feeds directly into vault is a real as a real standard these things can be automated they're pattern-based they've been optimized already so how do I do that well if you've enabled all of these things what's best but focus on Automation you have to adapt to change why do we have automation is a big part of agility anybody okay once we get to automation the business user comes in on the second day of an agile sprint and says you know what we change our mind can you deliver this instead of that you need to do some impact analysis and hopefully the business users going through a prioritization queue right we only respond the higher-level sea-levels director levels so there's a whole bunch of training on getting your business users to not be noise makers come to your queue there are certain types of business users I'm sure you have them they call you up every day interrupt what you're doing and build me this you can do this just it only takes you five minutes anybody ever had that call yeah you got to stop that you can't serve those people that are making noise and be agile it's not going to happen so to make adapting to change as cheap as possible you need tools but you need templates metadata and rules and there it is you need standards you need standards or automation tools won't help you right and it ends up being generated code for a software bill so how does the date about to work with this patterns everybody should recognize this is a fractal pattern right you know what a fractal pattern is you can zoom in in an infinite level and you can zoom out it in infinite love on it all looks the same all looks the same so it is infinitely scalable right so that's a fractal pattern but patterns we have patterns in the data ball for hubs lis satellites facts stages cubes processes deltas all of this stuff is written into the new book sorry I'm going quite quickly through this I'm almost done bear with me I'll open it up for questions I think how much time do we have for this session I think we're out of time actually aren't we supposed to end right about now yeah all right so here's the deal automation tools there are a couple tools I like in this market space and em ID is here I didn't put them on the slide but they're also helpful in automation from a business perspective and a stack perspective there's a brand new tool in this space called date wrangling as I said on stage earlier data wrangling is known by lots of names there probably 20 different acronyms that you can call these data wrangling tools it used to be called data exploration if you've ever read Bill Inman's book data exploration and these data scientists anybody in here a data scientist yeah you should read my blog so you want to grow up to be a data scientist but anyway the point is this the point is this this is a great tool data mirror is for the managed self-service bi is for data exploration it's for power users only okay how many of you know that once you have a log into Hadoop Hadoop is a file system once you ever log into the server where Hadoop lives that you can see everything all data in Hadoop regardless of who loaded it when and where yeah there's a lot of security issues in Hadoop so these are all things that need to be managed okay and then analytics des is a partner company full disclaimer I do earn some money from them as a sales fee so take it as you will I'm not trying to hide anything here but I do believe in their tool so much so that they actually generate data of all patterns okay and we're working with them on that so a good good piece so some conclusions let's talk about this this was a question asked earlier what's the difference between date about one and date about to date about 1.0 is focused on the data vault model the hubs the links and the satellites in other words known as hub-and-spoke modeling for those of you that aren't familiar with data vault did I also mention the data vault one is relational only I may have missed that point date about one uses sequence numbers by its very nature the name sequence is not scalable it means sequential anything that is sequential is not parallel anything that is not parallel is difficult to scale make sense data well two uses hash keys and there's a whole bunch of arguments as to why hashes for uniqueness and what they cause and yes there are duplicate issues to worry about but it is highly parallel hi scalable and that is all written into the book as well as in my classes so let me finish up here and then open it up for questions data vault 2.0 is a complete package of system of business intelligence a complete package a methodology architecture and modeling in order to be agile or work with discipline agile delivery I'm gonna give you the components of how to make that happen the agile delivery methods will tell you or teach you how to enforce the people process of that but we've got consistent and repeatable designs in the implementation side we've got multi tier scalable and datavault 2.0 addresses no SQL now here's the thing you may have heard this - no sequel does not equal no modeling so if you come to my next session on advanced state of all design you're gonna hear all about I did in all fairness those of you who haven't looked at the agenda in the last two weeks probably missed my update I changed the definition of the session the next advanced state of all session is actually all about data vault on no sequel and what it means so it's going to be interesting so if you're curious you can you can come I'd like you to come to that but anyway so this is the nature of it and it's a complete system of business intelligence and data bot 2.0 provides for you to build a hybrid solution a hybrid solution you can buy hybrid solutions some of them are out there like green plum which is now I think called what's called something else is owned by EMC anyway there's a there's a number of hybrid solutions out there they are still nascent technology or emerging technologies so they're not fully fault-tolerant how many of you know that most Hadoop systems are eventual consistency eventual consistency that means when you insert data it may or may not show up in your query for 4 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes I had a customer say well when is it going to show up there's no way to know the engine determines when it's going to propagate the data over to a node and the reason he was asking when was we inserted it in the US and it was propagating to a node in another part of the world okay so that was kind of something to think so in case you're wondering I have CIT oh very interesting title but it's the it's the CIO and the CTO mixed together data ball 2.0 brings the assurance that we can cope and so this comes from an executive level so if your business users are curious how does data well to work with agility here are some quotes you can use increase velocity and change without falling behind quality improvement right although big words and so on this is how you contact me but what I wanted to show you worse behind what's behind the quotes just some interesting things how much time do I have anybody Danny do you know you don't know okay so here's the deal so what has been the biggest driving factor of data ball 2.0 that assist with your agile practices I'm over we're done five minutes or we're done Steve just poked in and said five minutes so I guess we're done but anyway I'll just finish with this slide and that'll be it okay there are more slides I'm sure you can download them but this just gives you an interesting thing what I really wanted to do was show you this one these are the metrics let me get to the metrics here ah here we go these are the metrics that I'm thinking of okay this particular individual gave me a lot of quotes for their enterprise and people always ask me what are the measurements well look at this the ability to ingest new data sources on demanded the data vault is a massive boost okay Imperial empirical as empirical or disciplined as analytics is it's equally oppositely impacted by perception and emotive drivers comparatively in their organization what was quoted by IT is four weeks and at fifty thousand dollar price tag to adjust for new fields now takes them under date of all 2.0 system a thousands of fields in the same four-week period that's when you know you're succeeding at being agile for your business user I thank you for your time I hope this has been helpful to you I know we kind of wandered all over the map I appreciate it thank you you
