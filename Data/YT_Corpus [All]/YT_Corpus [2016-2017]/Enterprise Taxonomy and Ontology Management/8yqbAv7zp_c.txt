 many classification schemes use tax on amis taxonomy czar a way to order the classes into a hierarchy this eases maintenance and reporting for instance cats and dogs are both pets cows and pigs are farm animals a taxonomy allows you to report on farm animals versus pets while also drilling into each class to see the detail samandriel allows you to put your existing queries and categories into a hierarchical structure called a taxonomy you can have one taxonomy / configuration when you submit content to a configuration containing a taxonomy the results will include the taxonomy structure for which the content matched I will demonstrate some Andrea's support for taxonomy creation and maintenance by using Samantha a web or s web found at online datsun man Trillo calm here is a taxonomy that I have created and to get here you would start from the default page here of online dot samantray com which lists all of your configurations a new option here has been added taxonomy and so I will demonstrate the hotel's taxonomy here and click on the button and it takes me back to my taxonomy which I've already created the left pane here shows you the structure of your taxonomy while the right pane here shows the queries and categories currently available in your configuration since I'm in my hotel configuration based on our hotel industry pack there are quite a few queries here on my right hand side each of these entries here with a triangle next to it represent a node in the taxonomy nodes can contain other nodes such as these nodes can also contain queries or categories here my water node contains a query accommodations bathroom water you can recognize it's a query because it has a Q next to it here if it was a category it would have a C for a node you can edit the name of the node here you can delete the node or you can add another one underneath if you wish to add a query to an existing node simply drag and drop the query from the right-hand side into the node on the left hand side to remove a query from a node press the X button next to the query once you have a large taxonomy it can be hard to remember where everything is positioned so you can search your taxonomy in this box here I know I have a query about audio somewhere in here and when I type audio it tells me it's an accommodations features audio and then I can delete the note i can edit or i can open the taxonomy tree to the node that i was searching for similarly if you have a long list of queries and categories it can sometimes be hard to find them you can search in your list of queries and categories here by default searching only searches the name of the query which is controlled by this checkbox here for instance if i search for audio here i get accommodations features and audio you can also alphabetically sort your query list with these arrows here there's also infinite scrolling so when you reach the bottom of this it reloads and keeps scrolling through the list I have 198 queries in this configuration by default we display 100 but if you get to the bottom it will keep scrolling the taxonomy manager shows you the queries and categories you already have in your configuration but you can also quickly add a simple query from your taxonomy manager because you so you don't have to flip back and forth between the queries editors and the taxonomy manager here quick add quick out a query put a name in here quick query and my query is quick and query I hit add and it's now been added to my list and I can use it in my taxonomy nodes have an additional property be called parent matching enforced a node that has a parent will have this icon show up here which looks like a little paper clip it is by default set to off if you click this it will turn it on parent matching and forced means that in order for this node to match the parent node must match as well this is useful for creating contextual queries that can be enforced on all the children for instance in my features list here I could have a parent query just about features and then the individual minibar kitchen and windows so forth would only match on parent and matching enforced if my features query matched as well
