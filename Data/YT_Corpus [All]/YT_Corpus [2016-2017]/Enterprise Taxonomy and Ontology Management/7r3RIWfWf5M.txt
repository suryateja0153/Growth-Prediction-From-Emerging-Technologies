 yeah hello everybody who is already here in this webinar happy to have you here my name is andreas i'm the CEO of the semantic web company and this afternoon or this morning depending where you are we will take a look on latest developments around pool party semantics sweet there are a couple of let's say hot topics I'd like to discuss today with you some of you might be familiar with the preceding of a pool party webinar so in the first 30 to 45 minutes um I'd like to present you a new development around our product and keep the microphones closed but I would be happy if you stayed the whole time to spend some minutes together with me later after the first round to discuss I will open up the microphones and you can also leave questions if you like it's there's a questions sector in this software built in so please type in questions if you would like to get them answered and you will also find for files is in hand out mainly the slide deck I will present and then you will also find a video I will talk about a later and dedicate it slide deck about Scott's XL you can also find so yeah that that was just for the beginning some organizational matters and so now I will start with the actual presentation so that's the agenda of today's webinar in the first session I will talk about use cases for taxonomies based on score score and mainly Scott Excel which is the latest addition to the modeling module of Archie I will give a live demo on that so we will see how that works concretely within our software then I would like to give you a deep dive into pool parties corpus analysis especially the late one of the latest developments we've made is about the coop currencies analysis which offers nice ways to extend taxonomies and these are I see me automatically so i will show you how that works then i will give you a big picture about the pool party semantic integrator so how that works what's new so that did this configuration level is our since a couple of years on the market but we have added some I believe some exciting new features I'd like to introduce you to them and at the end i will also give you a quick overview over the roadmap 2016 some upcoming events and other hopefully interesting stuff around our product suite so let's start with Kasich cell what is it good for and how does it work just a quick reminder most of you most probably will be familiar with cos square so it's cause is the one of the semantic web standards based on RDF published by the w3c and it's quite simple as the S is standing for the simple knowledge organization system so we've got concepts we've got many concepts and we can organize the concepts by putting relations in between non hierarchical relations and also hierarchical relations so it's obviously good for the economy management and every concept each concept can have a different labels and other literals attached so that's all standardized so of course the most important labels always the preferred label and then you can attach synonyms so-called alternative labels so that's really simple that's already quite expressive of course you cannot do many many things you might be interested in only with costs and that's important to know pool party is much more than justice cause editor but in reality whenever you take a look on let's say practice related projects on the semantic web we've seen it's a good way to start first with scarce and then extend the knowledge graph step by step by ontology is by custom schemes by mappings to other linked data sources and now there's a new way to extend your score score model and that space tons costs Excel so what is cos excel first of all it's again part of the standard provided by w3c it actually was published together with cause a couple of years ago there's a myth around scoffs excel on the web when you look up scoffs Excel some people argue it's not good for anything it's everything you can do is call sex al you can also to be scarce or with other means and that's not true so let's take a look on the anatomy of scarce excel and then I will introduce you to a use cases and then it becomes obvious that that's a very interesting way the model knowledge or in a clear extension to what's already in place so again you've got the scores concepts but now and that's the main addition to score score you get scotts XL labels as a resource and that's why it's also a blue circle now so you see every label can now be used as a resource in your knowledge graph so you see the basic relation between us cost concept and the label now has kind of an intermediary step but you will see that that makes a lot of sense very quickly so in this little example you now see the United States dollar which is the preferred label of this concept has got its own identity and has become a resource so what can you do with this first initial structure then as you can see I transform that into scotts XL labels all of those are now resources you can attach further information and that's the first use case you can introduce attributes to your labels so for instance you can now say that USD is an iso code for United States dollar or you can say that this literal here is it isn't symbol for the dollar and you couldn't do that here of course because you cannot attach any additional information to a literal in in an RDF knowledge graph so you cannot really say anything about the labels anymore the only knowledge you've got probably is that that's the preferred label and that's an alternative label nothing else can be expressed with cause only so that's what's the first use case whatever it is good for you can classify by that your labels and therefore they become specific attributes the second use case what if labels are used in in a different context which have probably different relations so here's a little example here we introduced by the way also already 50 I will talk about that later that's a custom ontology mainly used in the financial industry so you will also see how the Rick's ontology is with Kasich cell but what I like to a point to here in this example is this currency here again is mainly called the United States dollar you've got again this label which is a as we already know an iso code but then there are kind of nicknames for major currencies like dollar for instance Coco Coco is the name for the US dollar mainly used in Peru and in Peru only so you cannot say that that's in general a nickname it's rather a nickname in a special geographical area and you can express that by this scoffs Excel construction so you say okay it's an out label it's a hidden lado you can make a decision on that and it's called Coco and it's a nickname in Peru so here I introduced a custom property and I will late to talk about that how you can do that and I will show you that very on a concrete example within pool party so I will log in in a second into them software itself but first I guess it's important that you see the use cases of Scots Excel what else we can introduce any kind of property between labels so we could for instance say ah that a certain label in a certain language is translated by another label so for instance with Switzerland it doesn't really make sense to make a direct translation between Switzerland and charades arisia aitken olsen shaft or swiss confederation and shreds because that's not actually the translation it only takes place between those two labels so that's what you can see here with this property called translates or another example would be his predecessor off a label could be the name for something not used anymore but it was the preferred label in former days most probably so you could say and that's the case with Switzerland actually the Swiss Confederation is not really used anymore it's the predecessor of the new name of this country which is Switzerland and I can express that by this relation type i introduced here and of course again you could not do that with any means when you use cos only so that's another use case and then of course if you start thinking about combining all those things or combining us Cossacks always text mining facilities you could attach several linguistic properties on each label and so on and so forth so Scott Excel offers quite a a huge variety of new ways to make use of of knowledge crafts let's take a look here maybe on this on this other example you can reuse labels in a multiple way which means Switzerland probably is a label you would like to use in two different contexts so there's a financial center financial place called Switzerland which would which has it in its center Zurich as it plain geographical entity you could also named it Swiss Confederation which is not in use in this context when it's a fiber class location because then we talk about financial services in the financial industry and in this case on this Switzerland would be used so what what's very important men you create the knowledge graph of course is that all your labels stay consistent in a way so and probably you don't want to have to change them at several places if we use them in it for different for different reasons and as you can see here Switzerland actually you really used in two different contexts here as I've said the financial services industry in here in a more general way but the label here will always remain the same okay so that that was just a theory behind Kasich sale um it's something which is not really new actually when it look at the date issued but what's interesting for me to see is that more and more of our customers are now asking for Scott's excel and other ways to extend that this cost model and that's a clear indicator also that it's it's more and more let's say going into a into into a more mature stage where you could say okay people have been working with several ontologies for a while and now they'd like to integrate that with other modeling para teams and we will see also in in the next section that it's very straightforward also and intuitively possible to create Scott's excel in combination with on ontologies or use them in combination with ontologies I will also show you that so how does it look in pool party how can you create is cause XL label for instance that's quite straightforward so here i just woke you quickly through that screen shots and then i will login so here for instance you see the view on ask us XL label you can create from their labor relations you could see here very um as a very convenient dialogue how this label is used or some metadata around that and now I will show you how it looks like in pool party so I login and I will open up this model I've just showed you in theory so that's the cause view this cost 3 here on the left hand side you see three different concept schemes there are currencies like the United States taller so here you've got the relation types and do the labels and now let's take a look in contrast to the US dollar we go to pound sterling and you see here that's a simple scoffs preferred label so i can add here maybe a synonym like pound and if you take a look on the united states dollar here that's not a simple label it's a scause XL label and that's why you can click on this resource so what happened now is I this United States all I just kicked on was now put into this quick link bar as we call that so here you can very easily access all the scots XL labels you've used recently if you want to get the whole overview just click here on this note so here you see all this cause XL labels you've recently used you can sort them you see when they were created when they were last modified you can search over it and filter it should be so he here you see you can traverse also the network of Scott's XL labels here and you see how they I use two veins in Switzerland I just showed you the example is used in two different contexts so it's it's used as a geographical entity or label for a geographical entity and as a label for a specific entity which is of class financial center so how to make a scause XL able so one way to do that is simply click on the edit button and convert this cost label into its cost XL label so that that's one thing now from now on it's a Scots XL label and you see it has received the UI now you can do all those things I've just showed you before so for instance those are the relation types i created which for instance is nick name in or its predecessor off translates and so on is iso code is symbol so that's not the case with that but I could introduce here for instance alternative label gpp and that's an iso code for pound sterling so I can transform that into is cos excel label go here to the label types you see here those are the standards cause Excel relations like with cause you've got your predefined set of relations and attributes in this case with Kasich cell Labour's it's not that many you have here labor relations and literal form and here in this case you see in this box in which context this label has been used so far so now I can go to my own custom properties and attributes and here I now set that to ya is I so-called true safe and now it's a hear that it's it's not just any a synonym but various cific one okay so that's a little bit about the handlink I will come back in a second when I show you some advanced features so which advanced features do we have first of all Scott's excel is fully embedded into the workflow engine of a pool party so it always has been used as a workflow engine for us cause label management and relation management but now it was also extended to include all this classic sale label management so here for instance you see the dashboard you see all the draft concepts which are asserted to my user account since I'm here as a administrator locked in I would see also all the traffic concepts of anybody else so I can monitor that or can assign trough concepts to other experts working on this knowledge graph and taxonomy and the same is a valid for discuss Excel level so here you see all the traffic scoffs Excel labels which are attached to my account and so on so that's the dashboard and you also see here for instance this costs XL view you could see or you could keep from here could you could assign the label to a colleague you could prove that if your role allows that so let's take a look on that how that looks like there were I open another project in which the workflows are already activated I can do that quite easily here in this workflow settings dialog I could whenever I like it can initialize workflows or disable the workflows and a couple of things I can I can set some rules for instance here if all the proof concepts are should be set to traft or if all this caustic sell it should set set to status draft you can also say okay if some labels orders labor-management should affect all related concepts or not or just excel labels should be affected by the workflow engine and so on so there are a couple of things maybe that goes too much into detail with you you can set some rules but in general here's the workflow dashboard so you see here craft concepts you can look up for instance the history first and see what happened when the concept was created there was a customer relation attached and sound so you can really make a decision if you would like to now approve that or assign it to a colleague or not you can also say a proof of concept so let's approve that one I can put your note and say okay all done and save that and from then on it's an approved cause a concept and the same thing is valid for this cos Excel labels so I could do the same thing here okay so that's the workflow engine which is now fully integrated also with this Cossack cell module here are the setting of the workflow rules i was talking briefly about and now I would like to let you revisit a little bit our ontology and custom schema management a couple of things turned out to be very let's say convenient for the daily work with pool party but others probably stayed a bit confusing for clients and therefore we made a clearer distinction now between the ontology layer and the custom schema layer and that's one of the things we introduced in the latest release and I'd like to explain that to you how that works let's take a look here on an example pool parties ontology management is I would call it a three layered approach on the on the basic layer you will use ontology s as a library as a basic knowledge layer in which ontology is and their classes properties and attributes are maintained to be propagated one layer on top which is the custom schema layer in which you most probably would mash of create a mash of several classes you defined in your ontology layer so the custom schemer than is finally the schema you apply on your text on me and that's what you see right here so for instance here a custom class is applied on this scoffs concept and you can do that also on on whole sub crafts so you think that will be attached or I apply it recursively and you see here for instance here now this this node in your knowledge graph which is a scause concept still is now also a fiber currency by that you you get some additional ways to make relations between your classified notes in your knowledge graph let's take a look on that so for instance I might go back to the other project which hasn't got the workflows included so let's take a look for instance on the United States solar one once again you see here it's it's a it's a currency you see here we reuse of course the original URI of this of this class which is done here it's you know fiber is a ontology mainly defined by the EDM Council and partly also supported by OMG and it's a very would say extensive ontology which describes several entity types in the financial industry and one of this is currency so the currency in the fiber model as I've defined it or as it is it's defined I could for instance be related to locations fiber locations by the property is tendering right so the US the US dollar is tender in not only in the United States but for instance also in El Salvador so how was that defined let's take a look on the on the ontology first so that's the these two tabs here you can create your own ontology is you can import ontology from other servers or you could add them from a predefined library so you here you see a couple of broadly used ontology which are available by default and of course this library can always be extended so too ontologies are always on a pool-party server of course that's this costs ontology in this cos excel ontology do is on the server that's uh that's the precondition so here the fiber ontology for instance currency you see here for instance is the main off is tendering or is a range of has base money unit and here for instance you see the relation i just showed your currency standard in location and location again is a class you defined further down and now with this plus sign or you can do that also as a whole you can create a schema or a new class out of this ontology and that's not propagated into the in this case it's the same name it could be another name into the fiber schema right so the fiber schema now has here also currency but you see here this little symbol in front which indicates okay that that's actually linked to this class defined in the ontology but now you can mash it with with other ontology zor classes from ontology so that's the nice way to propagate consists in a consistent way your ontology throughout your knowledge crafts and the last step here really is that you you can classify nodes right by saying okay attach a certain custom class to this node or you can apply it on the whole sub tree or if you do it on the concept scheme level you so in that case it's already attached so everything here is a currency so what does it mean from also from a modeling perspective it for instance would mean that I kind of put hear anything like let's say I couldn't put there a simple gon TT it's not possible because it's attached to a fiber location and therefore it can be linked with such only otherwise the engine doesn't allow the linking the same thing I can do is cause Excel labels so let's take a look on that um for instance Swiss franc here i defined label types ontology and that's what I just showed you before so that that's again its own ontology we can take a look here it's a it consists for instance of my labels here a couple of things are defined for instance attributes like is iso code and in the corresponding schema which is here you see again you are the corresponding attributes but for instance i also introduced spatial thing from the Geo ontology and I say okay this classic sell label can be linked to any spatial thing why uses nickname that was this Peru example as you might remember so as you can see you can match your custom schema from several existing ontology of course also your custom-made ontology s so that that's the summarization on that principle you've got the ontology layer could be from a library which is pre-installed on pool party you could most probably have imported it from some other resources or it's a custom-made ontology now you reuse classes properties attributes from there in your custom schemes so that's why this symbol here is that's the custom made ones that's the cannot change for instance the ontology from the library and the custom schemes last but not least are attached to your tech sauna me and by that pretty simple approach you can extend your taxonomy which originally was based on scores on this step-by-step by Scotts Excel my custom properties custom classes custom attributes and so on and so forth so once again as a summarization we've seen here for instance the example that the United States dollar has got in that case a classic edge called currency that's what you can see here I derived that certain example from the five ontology then we can attach your custom properties between the labels you've seen this for instance is predecessor off for a successor of translates and so on and you can use your custom attributes to express bit of which kind a label is for instance so here I created my own label ontology and by that I can now express for instance if a label is an iso code or not yeah and as the last part of this cos Excel section I'd like to talk very briefly about what's there who is using that already and so on so I mean one of the most probably widely used taxonomies at least in the European Union but also by governments around the world is the Euro walk the multilingual disorders of the European Union and it's mainly based on Scott's Excel and so you can of course take a look on on it and reuse it on your own that's an obvious use case it's it's a of course very well developed these are owes it covers 23 languages another example which is of course also broadly adapted is the accra walk which was issued many years ago but constantly improved by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations it includes quite a lot of I would say very important topics like food and nutrition agriculture and it's available in 16 no sorry it's it's it's available in not only 16 languages but it's a link to 16 other multilingual knowledge crafts from the linked open data cloud and it's also mainly based on Scott's Excel and another source I'd like to point to is probably probably not that well-known which is the esco dissolves the European skills competence qualifications and occupations disorders which can be reused for several HR and recruiting tasks by yeah many different organization types i would say it's an extensive to sorrows also which is mainly based on scott's excel so I'd like to invite you of course to give it a try on your own so you can get your own test account on our website I just would like to indicate that that's quite easily possible to give it a try ok so that was them I would say the first round and now the second biggest improvement we've been working on in the latest releases which is about how to how to support taxonomies by let's say semi automatic mechanisms to extend a taxonomy and controlled vocabulary continuously so that's the main principle of pool parties corpus management as you can see here there's a reference couples you can build reference coopera for any domain there are several tools for that i will show you could be derived from websites from from PDF collections from dbpedia and pool parties going to analyze those reference corpora and what the result is looks like that more or less so it calculates relevant terms and phrases and also the relevancy of concepts you remember a concept is part of the taxonomy and of the knowledge graph in contrast to the term a term is not a concept yet but of course it could become a candidate concept first and then an improve concept and the let's say that the size of the funds also indicate to kiss we can calculate with pool party the significant so that the importance of a term for this certain domain model and also the relatedness or the co-occurrence between the terms and the terms in the concepts so that's basically what's stored in the RDF triples store so you know this pool party we store everything virtually as a triple and therefore also these this linguistic model or statistical language model we derived from the reference corpus analysis is stored as an RTF model and as a next step with some sophisticated sparkly queries we can calculate some interesting let's say attributes automatically around terms and concepts which helps the taxonomies to extend the sorrows that's the basic step so from the reference corpus your derived terms and from the terms you can decide whether you want to make a candidate concept out of that and last but not least you can attach it to a scause concept or make its cost concept out of it and then of course from there you can further extend it as I've shown you is custom schemas ontology scoffs Excel and things like that so how does it work first of all you most probably have to create the reference text corpus so there are several ways to do that you see a couple of things like upload documents you can crawl websites you can crawl RSS feeds you can crawl dbpedia but it could also add your own way to create the reference corpus by creating a connector to your lets it document management system you most probably don't want to upload or crawl everything you've got in your company or in your organization but rather you know a representative bunch of documents which are the basis for a reference model of your language from their pool party is going to calculate statistics as I've just shown you like Co currencies about concepts frequencies and some other things distributed pneus and so on and as a result and you can do that for every of your domain models you can calculate as many proper as you like and as a result it produces first of all lists the first list is the list of the most frequently used two concepts in your text corpus that's a nice indicator of which of your let's say arts and segments of your taxonomy are most representative for your actual content basis but you could also look up okay which concepts were not found in your corpus which is also interesting most probably a synonym is missing or it's misspelled or it's probably an outdated of label you've attached to your concept or it's just not important and you can probably leave it as it is as another next step you most probably look up some again representative documents and from there you could assign new candidate concepts by just clicking on the under + sign like in that case by the way we did an analysis over descriptions of UNESCO cultural heritage sites you know that a couple of hundreds of such heritage sites and what you find here for instance are things like Khmer Empire or city or seam reap insan so from here you really can see ok which concepts are used in which potential new candidate concepts could be derived that's done per document or again you get a list of candidate concepts these are us of course sorted by relevancy that's done by pool party automatically you don't have to go through all of these candidate concepts you really can work step by step two most important ones and go down and further down and you first of all you put them here into this candidate concepts area and from here you can now start to include them into your d'asaro so here for instance I edit a Buddhist as a candidate concept and what's calculated as a next step are the co currencies so for instance potential synonyms like Buddhism Buddhism could become a synonym for Buddhist so you just dragged and dropped it here is the next step you could derive from the co currencies once again our candidate concepts to make them relate it to other candidate concepts in that case Hindle for instance so put hindle here into the candidate concepts list and make it a related to Buddhist and so on so I you really start to create kind of a sub disorders from the text analysis and then step by step you can include them into your approved approved part of your disorders so you see here for instance we've got already structure like sites by type so there are cultural sites which are cultural heritage and they're also natural sites and mixed sites that's a classification I've done by the UNESCO and then further down you see okay for instance spiritual places temples Buddhist temple and i would like to assert buddhist as a sub concept of buddhist temple therefore i only have to put that as a broader concept and now you see an integrate button appears so now you can think about integrating your micro sub tesoros and you get a dialogue like that and since i've attached buddhist to hindu it will ask me also if i wanted that also the related concepts and say yeah why not and now i've got two new concepts in my desires and that's some valuable new information which i could for instance reuse for my semantic search engine i have generated in the background so as you can see here there is a little example again on this some descriptions of them cultural heritage sites and I've got a new facet called Buddhist I wouldn't have that before let's take a look on that on the live server so that's the as we call the pool party craft search module based on an annotated document collection and you can see here there are different facets which are derived from the disordered structure I can look up for in this case Buddhist I've now introduced and you can see now there are 50 such Heritage Sites in different context once again it could be a tempo it could be a mountain it could be a monastery it could be even a river let's go to mountain maybe and then I can further drill down only those in Japan and so on and that's one way why such an addition to your disorders is of value because your search most probably comes more facetted more specific and that's something which can nicely be supported in by this Co currency model calculated in a background and most probably when you look at let's say larger projects pool party will be to create it in your content workflows and you can push such new new new documents instantly or continuously into the coppice analysis while at a pool party API so it really helps you to keep your desires up-to-date and somehow aligned and sink in sync with your actual content workflows so yeah that was the second part of my webinar from a little presentation about what's new with pool party 5.2 and 5.3 and now we come to an end of the webinar more or less it's going to be the last sec section of this presentation in which is rather short to than the other two and please feel free if you have any questions put it into the questions section of the gotomeeting software or i will open up the microphones after the presentation and please stay with me and we might discuss something interesting so here is one thing I'd like to point to it's a new video first of all it's not about the software only when improvements and when innovations should be done or the technology itself it should be always about services around that which are important to understand and then make the best out of the software and one very important cornerstone of that is of course how to explain how the software can be used so we tried our best to put together the main functionality of pool party in a video which only takes three minutes I'd like to invite you to watch that video after maybe that presentation or some somewhere later so you the link here is included you will get the link of course sent after this webinar also or if you have already downloaded one of the handouts you will find the link also or just on our YouTube channel so I'd like to invite you to watch that and enjoy it briefly describes what the pool party can do for you and it's mainly about in semantics integrator and here I want to wrap up once again what is it at a glance so of course its gear pool party is a knowledge graph management environment it can support taxonomy and the ontology management but if you look at the horse platform at the whole suite you can do much more than that you pool party is a tool which really helps you to put together various data sets and bring up a consistent view on all of the data you have analyzed it could be unstructured data it could be structured data and here that's probably something you might not be that familiar with a a new component has been integrated into the pool party product family and it will be integrated more and more in a couple of next month's so by the end of the year unified views will be more or less fully integrated within pool party at the moment you can use it already very nicely as an integrated bundle of components one thing we want to introduce in the next couple of months also is a more integrated graphical user interface you then don't have to switch between the two tools that's one thing which will happen but from a functional perspective it's already everything in place so unified views as a RTF based ETL tool helps you to schedule different transformation tasks some of them are many of them most probably will be fulfilled by by pool party extractor and based on the ontology and vocabularies you've created or you are continuously update as I've shown you and as a result all your data from different sources will be transformed into a linked knowledge graph based on rdf and then there are two ways more or less how to make further or make make use of that in the further step in the next step so we now work together with our for craft database vendor vendors or partners which are craft database vendors so those four systems are fully integrated with pool party semantic integrator and those four partners with their technologies offer a really good and very excellent basis to do deep data analytics based on w3c standards so that's the one application type which is supported or yeah provided by this architecture and the second little type or class of application is i would say still more or less in the following the tradition of sim search therefore you know you most probably don't need necessarily the RDF craft database technology under the hood but probably some other very well developed technologies like for instance marklogic or Apache Solr or elastic search as you can see marklogic is a technology which can really be used for both of these scenarios wait let's let's rephrase that it makes sense to use marklogic for both of those scenarios for instance with Berto so stardock or on to text I see a lot of opportunities for deep data analytics in contrast that for instance in a patches soul are most probably is not the right based technology to do such kind of application so that really create technologies for let's say document-oriented semantic search but not that much when it comes to let's say analytics around business objects and business entities so therefore the rdf data model makes really a lot of sense so yeah that's more or less the flow from your rotator sources to a linked data warehouse and unified views is the layer in which you schedule all these transformation tasks and you can monitor what has been done in in your pipelines and that's how it looks like from a user perspective so you can really define your transformation pipelines and like also to say welcome hun sacando dommage cannot be joined recently the Semantic Web company team the pool party team and he's the core developer of unified user has been the core developer for many many years so unified uses has been developed by several organizations in recent years and has now really mature status so it can be used for for enterprise data transformation and enterprise linked data warehouse projects very well and I'm proud to have Thomas in our team now and some upcoming and I would say also major events in the the link data industry I'd like to point to an upcoming event is a webinar which is in a couple of days only it's a webinar we do together with our partner marklogic two cornerstones of semantics please find some time to watch this webinar you will see how pool party has been integrated with MarkLogic in different ways and what's the benefit by this approach for for the end users we will show concrete examples how that can be used in tune there is marklogic world in london we will be there with a booth so if you're around please mix where you come and visit us sep tember there's a 12-time is semantics on its most probably the largest linked data and semantic web conference for the industry oriented people of course there's still some academic conferences on in that area but semantics really is step place to come when you see how you can use this kind of technology and meet same minded people there that's
