 yes Hey so I started to interrupt your problem-solving just wanted to talk to you guys about something the client has asked us to drop the data flow for the models we're going to build and I wanted to get your guys take on it before we go too far into it so Brian I know you've been working with some api's can you sort of help us out a little bit yeah nope I need some data from social media so Twitter and LinkedIn are we using firehose for Twitter did we get any of that set up already so that we can get the dedicated port and ditch stream in as much as we want I think we should cool there's no two days are the same there's such a variety of things that we work on right so I used to do much more in the product positioning and now everything I do is really about saving lives right now I'm working at a public safety setting the way that this started I thought was very interesting so I was actually working on another study and I built a network pretty strong network with a director at the firm and we had a conversation just briefly about how he wanted to start using advanced analytics at his other clients and so he just introduced me to the team that he's on the ground with and I just gave them five big ideas about things that I thought they can do differently and you know four months later I was on the ground actually getting to do all those things that I talked about right I'm still there helping this client really transform the way they work McKinsey analytics really represents a small start-up within tour the comfort of a much larger organization we have the opportunity here to experiment quite a bit so if there's an interesting topic we bring people in to speak about it that may trigger a pretty cool insight that you realize maybe I can deploy this in my client situation as long as it's something that McKenzie needs and there's a no need for it it doesn't really matter if it's outside of what you're doing you know and so for example like I'm very interested in IT security because I was past military doing kind of intelligence work it's nothing new my role really but they've I've worked with the guys in that practice to do stuff because I can just wanted to talk to you this public sector client I have wants to use sensors sure we have plenty of sensors in here as you can see it's right now set up mostly for home but we also are adding an couple manufacturing a couple different use cases that could be applicable for public sector as well you can say I work as a fixer I work with seems to be able to source solutions through startups analytical products gadgets whatever it is I look for these solutions in startups trying to find the best one for our team the firm gets a lot of very difficult problems to solve and as somebody that's done a lot of quantitative modeling in the past it was really appealing to me to try to bring my skill set to bear on real-world problems I feel like I have more impact than I did working as a professor at West Point because in academia everything is related to Theory here everything's related to practice people are starting to realize how much data they actually have and what they can do with it if we really dig deep into it we can find new ways to apply it finding new patterns in the data analytics hits every person within an organization that means it hits strategy it hits operations it hits obviously information technology but then there's also a lot of organization and change management where it becomes so interesting to be a part of of this team and a part of this changes that you're seeing it evolved before your eyes you guys have any idea of which type of models you'll want to use during the actual production based on the size of the data set number of variables etc we're looking at considering a radial basis support vector machine we're also looking at things like logistic regressions I'm just sure how much we can dice the data and still have enough power to get a robust estimate I'm a type-a personality so I always want to work with the best and work with those who are at the top of the field and to me that's what McKinsey is and that's kind of where I felt most comfortable to be able to work with people who know exactly what they're talking about there is no single type of person that works at McKenzie it's very diverse place both in terms of background educationally socially but everybody shares one thing in common and that is that they are bright and that they are motivated our defense and security analytics group presents an excellent example on that team we have a PhD physicist a statistician and engineer a signal processing guy and I have a doctorate in public and international affairs so we have a very wide range of different disciplines they're able to see things through different lenses and that allows us to find the best solution to a problem rather than solution that everybody has agreed upon because they share a very specific framework in terms of their background and skillset if you're interested in a place where mentorship pintura sponsorship are part of the deal I'd say that's like part of McKinsey spread and butter McKenzie is one of the best places to work if you want to constantly reinvent your skillset in spite of being here for 11 years my job has changed five or six times there's always going to be someone here who's going to ensure that you can grow here as person nowhere else do you get that kind of support to do whatever it is you want to do it's a place where you can sort of chart your own path
