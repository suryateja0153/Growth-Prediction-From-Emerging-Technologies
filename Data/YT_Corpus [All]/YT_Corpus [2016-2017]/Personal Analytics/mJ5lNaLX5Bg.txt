 now there's light now so welcome today we're going to be talking about data processing and open source in particular how Google is helping shape the future so my name is Francis Perry and I'm a data processing infrastructure geek I love figuring out the right way to take a really complex and powerful data processing system and make it extremely intuitive and easy to use good evening I'm James Malone I'm a product manager here at Google I'm fascinated by data because data is everywhere I'm also really passionate about open source software because I think it shows what people can do when they work together to collectively solve really challenging problems what's really interesting to me is when they can work together both data and open source so today we're going to talk about the next generation of data processing and we're going to go boldly but where many have gone before with mixed success what we want to do is we want to lay out a meaningful vision for open source next-generation data processing we'll start by looking at now challenges today the challenges that exist today that should not exist tomorrow well all then launch into MapReduce and it's influences on the challenges of today and how it sets the stage for next generation data processing tomorrow next we'll look at solutions that exist inside of Google right now that can help you solve data challenges and finally we'll talk about something that's new and exciting Apache beam how Google can bring its experience and work with the open source community to solve next generation data processing problems first let's create a foundation let's frame the discussion of next-generation data processing so I work in Seattle and Francis and I were given a template and the slides may look somewhat familiar at this point the day and I had one thought when I saw this slide I don't have enough vitamin D and I am definitely working in the wrong Google office I absolutely want to work there it's gorgeous but if I were you what I would be wondering is we're talking about next-generation data processing what things specifically what challenges do we need to solve for in order to end up in a space where we can say we are in next generation data processing we think there are three specific things now infrastructure can sometimes be hard now creating unified batch and streaming data processing pipelines can be challenging now the portability of those data pipelines can be a real pain first management now the emergence of open source data processing tools that allow you to process large amounts of data in parallel the Apache Hadoop and Apache spark ecosystems are a great example they're both a blessing and a curse they allow you to set up an environment where you can decide on a tool you can read the documentation you can get your infrastructure you can then set that infrastructure up you can set up your tools but then you have to tune the tools you often have to find experts who can help you adjust all of the knobs on those tools you have to production Eliza your environment even though the tools exist and they're awesome they're very powerful and they're great to use they can be very difficult and by the end of the day you are probably now a team of people supporting both infrastructure and software when your end goal at the end of the day was to simply process a lot of data that's important to you but next this should no longer be the case in the future we think it should be very similar to using a tool in the toolbox you should be able to open a toolbox pick out the tool you need not have to assemble the tool and forge the iron and tune everything you should know how to use the tool intuitively or even just watch a simple youtube video to get it and then carry away and solve your problem now the second thing that we think is really important for the future of data processing is the right set of abstractions how you represent your data processing pipeline right as data processing needs to become more sophisticated users often find that they have to write a traditional batch system for correct results and also use a different stream system to get more real-time updates now this bifurcation means that you have to write twice as much code you have to maintain twice as much infrastructure and somehow reconcile these two different results into one conceptual output now we think if we can find the right way to represent our data processing pipelines we can handle both batch and streaming use cases in the same unified system and the final thing that we think is going to change the future of data processing is portability right many current systems tightly couple the code for expressing your logic with the implementation of the service itself so that means if you want to move your application from Hadoop to spark or from on-premise to cloud you have to rewrite large portions of that logic and a different framework and then you have to dive in and find what the right tooling tuning knobs are in this new scenario so we can break that cycle again if we find that right abstraction that right model you'll be able to write your application logic once and run it in multiple places so ultimately you might be asking great so you've identified three things management model and portability but why do these matter why are these things that you have picked why are these the problems that we need to solve for and what are the impacts on me today and in the future I'm gonna use a metaphor say you have a rental car and many of you may have gotten a rental car when you traveled here you trust that the rental car agency has managed the car you don't have to pop the engine or pop the hood and check the oil level when every time you get a new rental car you also are familiar with the controls of a car so you don't need to learn a new set of controls every time you get a rental car and while you're traveling in the United States most signs are relatively the same and you trust that the car will drive on different types of roads so you have the portability you can drive on the freeway you can drive on country roads you can drive on city streets there's no problems there ultimately why it matters to you is when you are wrangling with the infrastructure and the tooling to solve complicated data problems you are focusing on the infrastructure and the tooling and you're not focusing on what matters to you the most your day these are not new challenges and in fact a lot of the challenges have existed for quite some time they're really hard problems to solve however so let's start with a little history because MapReduce is a solution to some of these problems which has influenced the present and potentially the future alright so back in the early days Google like many other folks needed to process a lot of data however conventional tools and methods couldn't keep up with the growth of this data so engineers ended up spending their time writing custom computations to handle each particular use case now if there's one thing engineers hate it's wasting time right particularly on something that can be automated so the engineers started looking for a generalized solution for specifying logic that runs in parallel across many machines at the same time they wanted to shield the author of that logic from dealing with low-level details like moving data from one machine to another and handling fault tolerance so Jeff and Sanjay settled on a simple reusable pattern right you take your data set and you partition it into chunks then you take each chunk and hand it out to a different mapping machine a mapping machine takes its chunk and runs a piece of user-provided logic over that chunk to process each element now each of those chunks is processed independently on a different machine so this makes it extremely easy to parallelize once the mapping machines are done they redistribute their data across multiple of reducing machines based on a key of the data and then finally each reducing machine again independently from other reducing machines provides another but runs another bit of user logic to create these final outputs together this is your output collection now the beautiful thing about this pattern is it's extremely powerful you can take pretty much any big data processing algorithm that you want and you can run it in MapReduce you might have to take your algorithm and completely convolute it beyond any recognition but you can shove it into that framework if you try hard enough so in 2004 Google published a paper on MapReduce and at this point things diverge a little bit inside Google we kept innovating but we were doing this in a relatively homogeneous environment so we had only a few file formats we were dealing with we had a limited number of languages that we needed to support and we had extremely standardized tooling so this meant that we got to spend our time focusing on really refining our core methodology and generating new ideas on how we would want to process this data so we continued to publish papers on these new ideas and from the external community folks saw a lot of PDFs popping up a lot of good things to read but nothing concrete that you could actually get your hands on and play with now at the same time the externally in the open source community we had a different implementation of MapReduce inside Hadoop write an entire data processing ecosystem developed here some of this continued to be published by the Google papers but there was also a lot of new innovation that happened here on its own in this very diverse system so today Google cloud platform contains two systems two products that come from this MapReduce lineage the first one is Google Cloud dataflow and this is a fully managed cloud service that evolved directly from MapReduce and includes some of these later ideas from Google like flume java's clean abstractions and mill wheels focus on streaming and real-time execution now for those users who have a significant investment in open source technologies already we have Google Cloud Data proc which is a fully managed service from executing Hadoop and spark programs James thank you so let's take a look at the first product in the Google cloud platform portfolio that's based directly quite literally on MapReduce Google Cloud Data proc so as Francis mentioned the Apache Hadoop ecosystem evolved directly as an implementation of the MapReduce white paper and arguably it's had just ice I apologize unarguably it has had an enormous impact on the current state and future of data processing it allows people to solve really hard data problems that weren't possible before it has the models it has tools it has the community it's really made a change and how people process data but a lot of these tools also come with their own set of challenges and this is true for apache spark it's to think for Apache Hadoop in general a lot of open source tools share these three common problems first installation they can be a real pain to install and configure second they can be really tricky to run at a cost-effective scale third typically you have to know quite a bit about all of these different components to use them effectively well google has been running MapReduce and other data processing technologies at scale for a long time so why not leverage all of this existing investment infrastructure and knowledge to create a product well we did and cloud data proc is the answer to that that challenge it brings the familiar spark and Hadoop ecosystem to the Google cloud platform this is great for moving existing code that you've already developed and on-premise or other cloud environments or brand new development and if you're familiar with a sparking to do Pico system there's a wealth of different tools that fit into to that ecosystem cloud data proc ultimately help solve the thorniest management headaches that usually follow the Apache spark and Hadoop ecosystem it really focuses on speed simplicity and cost-effectiveness cloud data proc is designed as an ephemeral solution and ultimately what we mean by that is we want you to have clusters when you need them when you actually have work to do and we want you to be able to turn them off when you don't need them we don't want you to have to carry excess idle capacity when it makes no sense to you so we like to think of cloud data practice combining the power of Google both in software and hardware with the power of open source so ultimately what is cloud data proc it's best to think about Cloud Data proc is to top-level concepts clusters and jobs cloud data proc cluster is ultimately our layer cake of three kind of big components the first cloud data products built on the power of Google cloud platform this means the virtual machines that you use for your cluster are Google compute engine machines you can connect to Google Cloud storage so we use the already existing tools available to us we then have an agent that runs on top of this cluster it's really the glue between the underlying Google cloud services and the open-source tools that live on a cluster the agent is doing all of the things like tuning the five to six hundred different knobs that exist in spark and Hadoop alone and finally we have the open source tools this is spark this is Hadoop this is hive this is pig the second top-level concept in Cloud Data proc our jobs and we provide a set of tools which abstract the pain of trying to manage workflows away from you to create a an abstraction layer where you can run some of the most popular job types on your cluster without having to open terminal windows or know how sparks submit works which means you can submit spark PI spark spark SQL Pig High of Java MapReduce all without actually having to ever log into a cluster you can simply create a cluster in one click and run your job in your second click that's it Cloud Data proximal SAR not isolated it doesn't stand alone and this is a very important point because it means that you can read and write data to many different places you can read and write data from other GCP products you can read and write data to data proc jobs both on the same cluster or since it's an ephemeral solution and you can create clusters quickly any other cluster you could also feed data to other applications on the cluster so we give you the ability to install other open source components for example patchy Zeppelin on the cluster Cirrus bark can be talking to Zeppelin all on one cluster easily I want to go to the point about data proc talking to other Google cloud platform products because this is a very important point it allows you to use the familiar spark and Hadoop ecosystem that you may already have knowledge existing code documentation tooling and use it with the other powerful tools in the Google cloud platform portfolio for example you could have a PI spark job which reads data from Google Cloud Storage processes the data with spark using PI spark and potentially all of your favorite Python libraries and then output the resultant data set to bigquery Google cloud data proc is designed to bring the experience and power of this very familiar ecosystem to the integrated and comprehensive processing platform provided by Google cloud platform I want to back up some of the things I'm saying and not just say that Google Cloud Data proc is fast easy and cost effective I want to give some specific points to actually elaborate on why that is the case so let's start with speed on average cloud data proc clusters start in about 90 seconds for your average cluster they also stop in about the same time that's really important because if you have an ephemeral cluster that you're creating precisely when you need it it means you spend less time waiting for your cluster to become available you also aren't paying for your cluster to start and stop second clusters can be resized at any time so if you have a series of big jobs you can add more nodes when you're done you can remove the nodes and Cloud Data proc will handle all of the brokerage and trying to Commission and decommission nodes without causing your jobs to fail we also don't bloat the clusters so we include vanilla versions of spark adieu pipe egg and a few other components but we're not putting on software extras that we think you might not need which are going to slow the cluster down or just complicate your use of the cluster ease of use so as I mentioned when I was talking about jobs we provide a job wrapper which allows you to send jobs to the cluster monitor jobs you can stream the output of drivers without ever opening an SSH window you can do it in a browser you can do it with Python you can do it with any number of libraries you can do it through a REST API that also means we have several surface areas that you can use to interact with Cloud Data proc including our Google developers console the Google Cloud SDK REST API s and at the end of the day since this is built on compute engine and it is vanilla SPARC and Hadoop if you want to go SSH into clusters go wild who totally can and finally optimized for cost I have never really met a spark or Hadoop job which runs specifically to one hour or two hours or three hours typically it's a fraction or a subset of hours we bill Cloud Data proc by the minute with a 10-minute minimum this means that if your job runs for 28 minutes you pay for 28 minutes not one hour and when you're creating large clusters with potentially tens or hundreds of nodes this can be absolutely substantial we also priced a cloud data product based on the size of your cluster and the number of virtual CPUs so it's easy to understand and doing the cost calculation is fairly straightforward and finally you can use preemptable x' and now custom machine types as part of our GA last month that allow you to very carefully craft the size of your cluster based on the needs of your data processing pipeline that means that you can articulate your cluster specifically so you aren't over or under consuming resources so going back to the three things that Francis and I are discussing today but that are really important problems that need to be solved for a next-generation data processing Cloud Data proc address is one of them head-on management we have really tried to solve the thorny management problems that exist with some of the open source tools so you don't have to worry about them but there are other services in the Google cloud platform portfolio that go a little bit further and cloud dataflow is one of them thanks James so let's dive in to more details on cloud dataflow now this is the past the glut came out of MapReduce it is based on a bunch of continued innovation internally at Google now it's available to you as a cloud product and there are two key advantages to cloud dataflow the first benefit is the programming model this is the way that we encourage you to write dataflow programs this is the way that you represent your business logic and you focus on that your application logic not how you cram that logic into some underlying infrastructure right instead you're building a pipeline your pipeline contains a mix of custom element wise processing aggregations and library functions dataflow pipelines can process both bounded fixed sized data sets like we're used to in traditional batch systems but it can also handle infinite streams of data and when you're writing that application logic that becomes your dataflow pipeline you don't have to wonder about what type of collection you're running over your logic will apply equally well to both bounded unbounded data sets this means that you have a lot of flexibility in how you write your logic and it can be reusable in many different scenarios now to truly unify back and streaming into a single system we need to separate the notion of event time from processing time event time is the time an event actually happened so let's say we are we have a mobile gaming application users are on their cell phones all over the world frantically doing something they're popping balloons crushing candy I don't know whatever it is they're doing it's happening everywhere and we want to process those points that they're scoring and figure out information about that so the time the user crushed the candy that's the event time the processing time is the time when that score is available in our system for processing ideally those would be the same thing but distributed systems never cooperate so there's actually usually quite a difference so here we've got a sample data set of points that a specific team scored in our game so on the x-axis you can see the event time again this is the time the point was scored and on the y-axis we have processing time so if distributed systems weren't actually a problem right everything would appear along this dashed line something would happen and immediately we'd be able to process it in our system sometimes things aren't so bad so this event here happened right before 1207 and but just after 1207 were it's available in our system for processing so maybe there was just a small network delay other times it's worse though so this event over here is 7 minutes delayed from when it happened before we can process it perhaps this user was playing our game in an elevator or in a subway somewhere where they had a temporary lack of network connectivity we had to wait for this user to re-establish a connection before that event was able to be ingested to our system and processed now the margins of this graph are nearly wide enough to what to contain what would happen if our games supported an offline mode now we could have users playing our mobile game transatlantic flight while they're in airplane mode it might be hours until the users land reconnect and those events are available for processing so as you can start to see these types of infinite out of order data sets are really really tricky to reason about unless you know the right questions to ask so the data flow model itself revolves around four key questions the first one is what results are calculated what is that algorithm that you're actually doing I'm computing sums joins histograms machine learning models where an event time our results calculated so how does the time when each event actually occurs affect your overall results are we aggregate events overall time for fixed windows of time or based on bursts of user activity when in processing time our results materialized so that's asking does the time each element arrives in the system and actually get available for processing does that affect results how do we know when to omit results what do we do when data comes in late and we've already emitted the result and finally the fourth question is how do refinements relate so if we start emitting multiple results because new values are coming in and we're changing our mind what do we do with each of those new copies how do they interact so let's take a look at and how we use these questions to build a simple pipeline so here's a snippet from our pipeline we are processing those scoring results from our mobile gaming application in yellow we see the computation that we're performing the first question the what right here we're taking Team score pairs of these scores that happened and we're going to sum them per team we want to find out the total score per team so right now this is a pretty simple pipeline and let's see what happens if we execute it so in this looping animation you again you see our our axes of event time and processing time and that gray line represents processing time as it progresses as the pipeline executes and encounters elements they're accumulated into that intermediate stage is white in white and finally when processing completes we omit the result in yellow so this is just how a batch pipeline would execute it's pretty standard but as we addressed in the next few questions this is going to get more powerful the first thing we're going to play with is this notion of event time so we'll start by specifying a windowing function and by doing this we can calculate independent results for different slices of event time so we could compute something of root for every minute every hour every day in this case we're going to use two minute chunks of time and ask for a different sum per team every two minutes so now if we look at how things execute you can see that based on event time we're calculating for independent results every two minutes slice of event time is going to give us a different result now at this point we're still waiting for the entire computation to complete before we emit any results and this works okay if we're dealing with a bounded fixed sized data set that will eventually finish processing but it's not going to work if we're processing is seeing an infinite amount of data right because we'll never actually complete and and produce results so there what we need to do is reduce the latency of individual for the results and we do that by asking for results to be triggered triggered based on the system's best estimate of data completion we call this estimate the watermark it's the way the system estimates it at this point it's pretty much seeing all the data it's gonna see for this portion of event time so now I've drawn the watermark on our graph in green right and you can see that as the results for each window passes the watermark and we think well we've pretty much got all the data we go ahead and emit the result but again this watermark is just a heuristic it's the system's best guess about data completeness and guessing in a distributed system is going to be a bad idea right now the watermark is too fast we're moving on before we have all the data so in that first window we thought we were done then that user who's offline in the elevator finally reconnects and we realized we've got some late data and it just gets missed in this case that users out of luck their team is never going to benefit from that score now we could be slower and more conservative with our watermark but if we do that we might have to wait an unrealistic amount of time so if we're dealing with those offline users on the airplane we're gonna have to wait till every flight everywhere lands just in case there was somebody in seat 26 B who is playing our game right so that's not reasonable either we need to be able to deal with this type of heuristic best-effort watermark and work around it so we do that by using a more sophisticated trigger so now we're requesting both early speculative firings so as results are trickling in we're asking for tentative updates as we go and also we're asking for late firings or additional updates if we see events later than we expect so what this means though is that we're going to be seeing multiple results for that same slice of event time and now we have to answer our fourth question how do those results refine over time in this case we're going to use accumulation mode and just continually accumulate the score so every time we see new results will emit a new cumulative sum that just continues to grow now we go back to our graph and you can see that we're getting multiple results for each slice of event time in some windows like the second we produce some early speculative results those data is still arriving then in every window is the watermark passes we think we've pretty much seen it all we emit an on-time result and finally if there are late results like in that first window we might have met a late updated element and because we chose to accumulate each result that we emit includes all the elements for that window even if those elements were already part of a previous result so what we did here is we took an algorithm in this case it was just simple integer summation right I could have taken a more complicated algorithm except then I would have had to animate it and these already got complicated enough so we just did integer sums here but it could be a much more powerful chunk of user application logic and then we tweaked a few lines and by changing those other questions and addressing them we were able to cover a whole number of use cases we went from traditional batch all the way up to advanced streaming without having to change anything about our algorithm the what that we're actually computing so just like MapReduce fundamentally changed the way that we do data processing by fine by just by providing a new set of abstractions that allowed us to reason about these types of programs we think this data flow model will change the way we do batch and streaming processing in the future by unifying them together based on these four questions so that's the first benefit of cloud dataflow the programming model and the way that you write your pipelines the second part is the fully managed service for executing these pipelines this service scales the number of workers and configures that throughout pipeline execution as your data sizes evolve it dynamically schedules work across your different machines and it provides integrated monitoring and logging so they're between those two between the the model and the fully managed service we've addressed two of our three goals but we still want to address portability that's where Apache beam comes in so in late January we took the data flow model and the SDKs that implement it and we developed these in conjunction with the managed dataflow service but along with some partners we took this programming model and donated it to the Apache Software Foundation as the incubating project Apache beam which means among other things we get a new logo so here's our snazzy new logo with two overlapping beams of light representing the unification back and stream into beam and now we have puns all over we're beaming with joy there's all sorts that the puns never get old alright but what does a battery beam actually include right so it's the programming model this idea of describing your your data processing in terms of the what where when and how it's the initial Java SDK that we developed as part of cloud dataflow and they'll be other SDKs at other SDKs including Python to follow and most importantly for portability it's a number of runners that know how to take a beam pipeline and execute it on an existing distributed back-end so right now that includes runners that can run a beam pipeline on Apache fling Apache spark and then of course the cloud dataflow service our goal as we transition the dataflow programming model into beam over the next few months is to fully support three different categories of users we've always focused on end users these are the users who want to write data processing pipelines they want that nice little Pacman from the beginning right where they focus on their logic and their results they don't have to deal with the other stuff right they just want to take the language that are already familiar with and run it in whatever distributed processing environment is most convenient for them but in addition to those users now as part of Apache beam we want to focus on developing stable api's and documentation that are going to allow others in the open-source community to develop new SDKs and provide new runners for alternative distributed processing environments so we're just getting started growing that community so building a community around Apache beam is going to be absolutely critical to its success the community will help Apache beam really achieve the goal of being an open source platform for next generation data processing but building a community involves a few key things and we're just getting started building this community first we have to focus on collaboration we were really surprised when we wrote the Apache beam incubating proposal and submitted it there is an outstanding amount of interest in Apache beam there's also a lot of groups that have thrown in new ideas in ways that they want to expand beam and see beam grow taking all of this and collaborating together so we can take all of the collective energy and brainpower and needs and problems that people want to solve and work together towards a unified solution is going to be both a challenge but ultimately incredibly rewarding as Francis mentioned the dataflow SDK and model at this point has really focused on end users we want beam through the collaboration to also include the SDK writers and the runner writers now we want to grow Apache beam and there's a few people that may be wondering why the Apache Software Foundation it's come up in conversations that I've had with people here ultimately Apache beam is a great fit for the Apache Software Foundation because it will grow within a community of other data processing tools so as Francis mentioned there's a flink Runner and a spark Runner it's not all about just making an Apache beam awesome and better there may be things that we need to help out on with spark or with flink or other projects and as a member of the Apache software community and under that umbrella we can make that happen and that's critically important we also want to learn and this is Google's first data-related contribution to the Apache Software Foundation and we're learning quite a bit we're learning the Apache way we're also shifting from Google tools and infrastructure to those that are used by Apache projects and we're trying to take that learning and apply it and learn quickly and get started quickly and move things forward so we wrote the proposal in January and we entered incubation to the Apache Incubator in early February to show how serious we are about really getting started and making an impact and moving things forward the first commit to the repository was in late February so we're really excited to get moving early in 2016 so where we are now we're really focused on refactoring and redesign we really really want to folk all three of those use cases so the end users the runner writers and the SDK writers that means by mid-year we're going to take all of the design and refactoring and things that we've come up with new API so we're going to be implementing them on the beam project it's important to note though that we don't want to and we will not interrupt dataflow users during this process so we're really focused on improving and making these updates to the beam project so towards the end of the year the beam team can say that beam pipelines will run on multiple runners who can take a beam pipeline and run it reliably on flank or SPARC you could also use the beam SDK to articulate beam pipelines and run them on the cloud dataflow service so with beam and cloud dataflow you start to tech check all of the boxes for next generation data processing with cloud dataflow you get an awesome managed service where you can send it pipelines and you don't worry about infrastructure you don't worry about spinning up servers you don't worry about logging and monitoring with beam you get a portable powerful unified model that you can use to articulate data processing pipelines so between the two you start to end up in a place that is truly next-generation that said well we think that cloud dataflow is going to be an awesome place to run beam pipelines and we think it will be the best managed way to run beam pipelines beam itself is also portable which means that there are other runners you can use to run beam and these runners can exist in any number of environments they might be on-premise you might want to run flink for instance on a cluster in your local data center you might want to run SPARC on another cloud that's okay these runners may have varying levels of fidelity and how they support being based on their own models and underlying semantics but again going back to my comment about being a member of the Apache Software Foundation that's why it's very important for us to work together inside of the Apache umbrella so we can try and help everybody out and move everybody forward now it's getting late and if you only remember a few things from this we've been talking for a while if you wake up tomorrow and you're like that was the best presentation I've ever seen please remember it with the following points first the MapReduce paper in 2004 kicked off a flurry of activity you had two branches that predominantly emerged you had one in Google that continued to iterate on the ideas of MapReduce and create new papers and then you had a whole ecosystem develop in the open-source community as a result of these two branches we have two awesome products that you can use today in Google cloud platform to take advantage of these work that work in these two work streams you have cloud dataflow to take advantage of all of the awesome iteration and both infrastructure and software they Google invested after MapReduce and you have Cloud Data proc all of those components you could use on cloud proc today Apache Beam is a bridge between these two work streams that split in 2004 and 2016 we want to bring them back together Apache beam can be managed using services like dataflow it's very easy to run beam on manage services beam provides a unified model for batch and stream processing finally beam pipelines are portable along different runners you can take your beam pipelines and run them on different runners in different locations come on there we go we hope this talk leaves you wanting to learn more about doing data processing and open source at Google you can go use cloud data proc today you can start spinning up Hadoop and spark clusters and use that fully managed service if you want to learn about the data flow and now the beam model you can use data flow today to write pipelines that run on cloud dataflow and over time as we finish bootstrapping you'll be able to use a patchy beam to run those same pipelines anywhere alright well thank you very much James and I will be around so please come find us ask questions thank you very much you
