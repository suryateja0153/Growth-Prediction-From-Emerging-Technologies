 I've always been described as being a very analytical person and my brain tends to operate I am usually thinking about logic problems and how to solve problems that I myself faced and encounter or problems that my friends face so analytics is really has always been my passion at least and in my career and also in my personal life my name is akia Barnes I am a first year class of 2017 and I plan on concentrating on International Management somewhere along the lines I thought I really enjoy programming in SAS and I really enjoy crunching numbers but I want something more and so I thought I could really add value and lend my insights in such a way that I think would be would be marketable if I had an MBA that stamp saying that you know I understand the fundamentals of business but I also speak analytics in such a way that people can understand it most of the companies that I've interacted with expect their interns and full-time hires to have a global perspective and I thought one of the benefits of coming to Simon was its diversity not only in terms of the students but in terms of the faculty what surprised me the most about the Simon community is how resourceful and determined the students are they will do whatever it takes to get the job done and and if that means staying up a few extra hours to perfect a presentation if it means visiting New York City every week and really putting themselves out there that quality is certainly rubbed off on me everyone in interact with its told me that I've changed since enrolling in Simon the key change I would say is my ability to network network with other students network with professionals network with professors Simon is one of the few business schools that offers a pricing concentration so I've taken the first class which is a pricing policy with professor Schaffer he does an exceptionally good job of sort of walking you through his thought process when he presents us with alternative strategies that's when really sort of the magic happens so for my pricing policy course the current homework set they were working on now is actually a great case and so the goal of the case is to essentially consult the company and help them determine if they have they're gonna launch different brands what should the price point be of those different brands and if they're not which brand should they focus on some of my greatest interactions happen actually off-site outside of the classroom I plan on hanging out with my classmates a lot more that's certainly on the top of my priorities but hanging out going to happy hours and I really am very excited about exploring the Eastman and I recently discovered the Little Theater and it's just been a great experience because watching independent films is a great a great passion of mine
