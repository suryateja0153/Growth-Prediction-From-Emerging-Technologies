 you you you hi everyone thanks so much for joining today's webinar my name is Marley long and I'll go ahead and get things kicked off today at the webinar will cover how financial service organizations can improve SharePoint and office 365 adoption with analytics just a bit of housekeeping before we get things started so this webinar is being recorded so if you want to share this with a colleague in the next few days we'll go ahead and send an email to everyone who signed up and we'll send you the recording as well and you can connect to us on twitter our twitter handle is at cardio log and of course if you have any questions believe some time today towards the end of the webinar to try to answer as many questions as we can and you can send your questions through the questions box within the GoToWebinar panel in regards to the agenda for today's webinar we'll start out with a very short introduction we'll talk a little bit about interlock who we are and what we do then I'll jump into a presentation with some tips and some of the best metrics that you can use to monitor in and shoot improve SharePoint adoption and usage I'll also present a little bit of our sauce based solution just to show you a bit more of what you can do at with cardio logs asks just a brief introduction in turlock has been around now for about 11 years we're based out of boston and over the past 11 years we've been focused on one thing and one thing only and that's analytics designed for SharePoint and office 365 so our flagship solution is cardio log analytics and it's built specifically for internal platforms including all versions of sharepoint from 07 2 2016 and as well as sharepoint online and 365 we can also track third-party tools like Yammer citreon CRM tools as well and the solution is available both as an on Prem or as a sauce based version which is hosted in power bi so our goal is to help our customers constantly improve SharePoint based on how it's being used and for today's presentation specifically we decided to focus on how these analytic reports can assist financial institutions and so you know faced with the need to operate you know very efficiently and more cost-effectively financial organizations are met with a variety of internal challenges so many of these financial service institutions are embracing at what we call advanced analytics for their portals that are really enabling them to see the big picture so then they use these intelligent insights to make important decisions to boost their portal ROI and help their employees really gain value from it and just a few of the leading organizations using cardio log analytics our organizations like Suncor solera old mutual fidelity and IMF and more and so there's three main pillars that we talk with our customers about so the first you'll see here is to monitor so that's the first step so essentially that's you know the both most basic step which is tracking the usage within SharePoint the second step that we talk about is engaging these users so asking them what their needs are what their pain points are and what's not working for them and then finally the most important pillar is to enhance so we want to constantly make sure that we're always improving SharePoint based on these three pillars and the idea is to have these actionable metrics which allow us to constantly make SharePoint better for the users just to give you an idea of what some of our financial services customers have been able to do with analytics I wanted to share just a few examples with you so in terms improving portal ROI they were able to engage with enterprise users so increasing that portal productivity and by collecting insights from their users they were able to really drive home at more collaboration within the portal the second thing that they were able to do so analytics can be used to identify user challenges so this is a really great aspect of using analytics as well as optimization tools so our customers facilitated these innovative survey discussions and based on those insights that they collected from the survey discussions they were able to empower and improve at user innovation they were also able to enhance portal usability abso an example of that they could identify a specific videos in the portal that were reviewed for 20 seconds or less and then they could identify or replace ineffective video content and similarly they could identify unmute or updates and then they were able to inform site owners how to most effectively position that content for increased viewing in the portal and the last example that I have is increasing corporate productivity so they were able to identify a failed search queries so this was really effective in saving employed employee time and so they were able to actually refine those failed searches by identifying the failed search queries and they also identified how many users were accessing the portal less than five times per week so then they could easily see you know which specific users were in need of more training and i'll go into in depth a little bit of these examples a bit later once i start showing you guys some of those key metrics that we talked about so why do we need analytics when talking about sharepoint adoption and how do it analytics play into it and so the key here is that you can only manage what you can measure so only can we know you know really what's going on in SharePoint and really define if the launch was successful at all is by measuring so how can we measure if people are using it and if adoption is increasing and so these are really important questions that we need to be asking when we start analyzing the portal so being able to measure what's going on and that's really the end goal that we help our customers with so how can we measure the deployment analyze it and then help customers improve their environments based on what's going on with real data and again making an investment you know in an intranet or even a migration for example and this includes a large amount of resources so it can be in the form of budgets and particularly for licenses or consultants as well as human resources which can involve multiple teams administrators developer stakeholders and so by leveraging analytics you can really find out whether your organization is performing as expected and whether your employees are truly at you know finding value in the portal so let's hop into a short demonstration I'll show you a few examples of how we can really track adoption and there's two things that I really want to emphasize when we talk about tracking adoption so one is the ability to measure what's going on in SharePoint and measure and manage the adoption and really show that it's improving and two is just as important is actionable metrics so at the end of the day when you're looking at this data if the data doesn't let you take action then this data is essentially a useless so the end goal is really that we want to at leverage sharepoint and measure adoption with end goal of making SharePoint better for the users all right so let's go ahead and jump into the cardio log analytics user interface and I'll go ahead and build a dashboard from scratch with you guys I'm so you can see here this is actually a cardio log analytics at user a user interface for our on-prem version a little lado a little later sorry I'll show you our SAS based solution as well which is a bit of a different interface because it's in power bi but this is actually our own user interface and I want to build a dashboard from scratch just to show you a how easy it is and B how powerful these dashboards can be as help you manage and track adoptions so let's build a new report here together go down here so we'll click a new report and let's just give this a name quickly okay and what we will receive is a blank report in edit mode AB so it's super easy to drag and drop those metrics that I've been telling you about on to our dashboard so I'll just go ahead and click one of these grids on my canvas here and so since we're talking about adoption today I'm going to focus within this visitors category here of analytics at so there's a lot more categories that you can find within cardio log analytics on Prem so for example we have a lot of search analytics portal growth navigation page views at goals we have our social analytics as well and but we'll go ahead and jump into this visitors category for today since this is the most relevant category in terms of tracking your adoption all right so we'll go ahead and go into our inactive users so start out with this report so this is one of the easiest metrics that you can use to take action so inactive user is very simple these are your folks who rarely or don't use SharePoint at all so once you know who these users are you can really take action and you can ask them why aren't you using the portal and if they don't know how to well that's very simple you can go ahead and put them in a training session and in that way we can really work towards improving our adoption rates so that's our first metric here to help us manage our inactive users so go ahead and we'll focus on our unique users now and we'll go ahead and make a graph out of that so this is another great metric unique users so here you can see a trend over time of unique individuals and so obviously if we see this chart growing over time like we see here more folks from the organization are leveraging SharePoint really allowing us to show management or wherever we want that over time employees are using and benefiting and gaining value from sharepoint as well and another metric which is one of my favorites is the ad user groups and so we talked about individual users but if you have thousands or perhaps ten thousands of tens of thousands of users that may be a little bit more difficult to manage so in that sense we can actually monitor groups of users and with that maybe we can find out if there are very specific departments in the organization that aren't adopting very well and then with that you know vital information that we gathered we can really pinpoint these groups with more training or more sessions to understand what they need from sharepoint and here you'll see a list of all the different groups from your organization and again very easy you can add to analyze what we call this actionable data and here at the bottom we can actually see some of these laggers so you can see for example we have three groups and you know the marketing team and perhaps integration the international or the extranet teams and we can see here that they are the laggers within this metric and we want to ask ourselves why aren't they using sharepoint very often why aren't the marketing folks using the portal and so now we know that they're not using the portal as often so let's improve that and we can actually provide training and simply target these very specific groups and and this is you know as opposed to some organizations who give their groups departments or regions the same amount of training across the board that's a little silly and so let's instead spend those resources on the groups that are really lacking within SharePoint and let's offer them training so let's go ahead and actually see if this training was worthwhile and again this is really important so with that we can really spend these resources effectively so in order to actually see if a training was worthwhile let's go into our unique users and will actually create a chart this time I so I'll actually want to take a specific group for example and I'll want to essentially slice and dice this data so let's take for example we were talking about our marketing folks before okay so we can actually a filter here as you see by users and groups and we'll click customize and we'll search marketing select that here okay and so now I actually see only users from that group so that's very easily and finally I want to compare data for each user before and after training to see what's going on so obviously if there's an increase in usage after the training I can go back and show that our training was really powerful and was really helping folks so we'll go here will click on compared to past period okay and so on the left-hand side here you can now see all of our folks from the marketing group and this is actually the change rate so this is what we want to see is these green arrows showing at an increase in adoption and that's really you know what we want to see and what we're looking for here so you can see in most cases almost everyone has gone up a few people have saved the same but again that's really what we're looking for is that change rate and that green arrow of that increase in a change rate from a past period over time so step one here was to find out we said who's not using SharePoint very often and step two was to find to provide training and then go back to make sure that that training was actually helping and you can see here that boosts in adoption for the group that was originally our laggers and so I think that's a really powerful metric to really understand what's going on in the portal and you know from a past period to the current period of time I'd like to show you just one more metric so we'll go here and go into depth of visit this is one of my favorites as well so depth of visit here we have a few at you can see under the depth of visit in this environment particularly the depth is pretty shallow so most of our users when they open up SharePoint you can see here they're only viewing one page and whereas usually when we see folks with higher adoption rates and that have more services within SharePoint with employees utilizing it more that depth of visit is much deeper and you you would actually see that they're browsing through more pages so you know browsing to four or five pages in one session and so this is just another really great indicator to show the health of the current adoption and the goal is to really have the depth of visit as more than five pages or more because then you know that people are really spending time in the portal and are really getting what they need okay so this is a dashboard that I've created so let's go ahead and generate a report so we'll click here under actions and we'll click generate report and how can we get this adoption information to the right people so if this data isn't being accessed by our site owners or administrators we can easily share this data with your colleagues by creating a distribution list so you can actually distribute at hundreds of different site owners and have cardio logs send it out automatically to each site owner so he or see he or she can see the adoption of their department or of their site and so you can send it out via report or PDF and or another neat way to share the data is as a web part so you can actually have an adoption metrics page on each site on your portal and you can show all of this data and of course it's dynamic so every day when you browse to the page you can see okay who are made top users for today who are my inactive users for today and you are my top groups and so forth so that's just a very quick introduction to some of the metrics that we can provide around sharepoint with the end goal of taking action to constantly measure and to constantly improve our adoption levels so I mentioned previously that I was going to show some of our reports as well in our SAS based version so another thing I'll show you now towards the end of our session is our cardio log analytics s so this is an all-encompassing solution versus this on-prem solution which I showed you previously so our solution is provided through the power bi data visualization interface and it's hosted on Microsoft Azure servers and power bi is an analytics visualization engine developed by Microsoft and it really provides a nice kind of comfortable user interface so you can really explore your data through this kind of freeform and drag and drop canvas and so here you can see the dashboards and the reports sections here so that these are the two main sections that you'll work with when you open up car you'll exhaust and power bi and specifically cardio access comes with a set of pre-made reports and dashboards that we've put together in a way that we thought would be most beneficial for our users so at the moment we have 20 pages in reports and so you can see here at the bottom I'll actually go ahead and make this full screen so you can see here at the bottom we have these 20 pages and reports and we actually are constantly adding more and when we design these reports we had a few things in mind so the main purpose is one to provide the data but we wanted to kind of take it to the next level and instead of saying like hey here are your page views here are your visitors you know go ahead go out there go make decisions we wanted to actually help our users understand what they can learn from the data that is provided for them and more specifically we wanted the reports to be built in a way that actually helps users know how they should measure business and their portal goals so for that having experience of 11 years in measuring SharePoint was really helpful but we also spent a lot of time with our customers to really understand what they care about and what they define as portal success so together we came up with these kind of five portal goals which we've learned organizations are using share that are using SharePoint you know that they care most about so perhaps some of these may resonate with you at so the first goal was SharePoint adoption which is exactly what we're talking about today so whether or not users are actually using SharePoint at the second goal was based around visitor engagement so once users are actually in the portal how engaged are they with the portal and with each other the third was collaboration so are you zzzz at making the most out of the SharePoint collaboration capabilities the fourth was portal usability so talking about the user experience how easy it is for the users to use the portal and the fifth was the optimization of portal resources as well as supporting a migration process so this really allows organizations to save money by learning what they can you know at remove from the portal at before a migration and where they can spend their resources throughout the migration process and another thing you know one of the great things that we've learned as we went with power bi is that if you don't feel like any of these categories with the needs of your organization or metro goals or if you have you know very unique goals which we haven't covered and it's really easy to take any piece of information you know that we've gathered with cardio log and create a report in any way that you would like so a great report is one that you know really tells a story one that lays down all the pieces to the puzzle and can really give you a full picture of what you're trying to see so I'll go ahead and add dive into this visitor adoption overview report and so all of these reports that we have were careful they were designed very carefully and they're all meant to actually interact with each other and give you these deeper insights so you can see here this is our overview report for a visitor adoption and there's a few things that you can see right off the bat here so here you can see your active at user rate chart in this chart specifically here so this shows you the total registered sharepoint users and the trend over time so let's go ahead and click on April so this is actually the lowest result and once we click on that you can actually see how it interacts with the rest of the widgets on the report and if you click on that you can see that only thirty-seven percent I'm sorry thirty-three percent of the users were active and we can see how many users became active that month as well over on the right hand side we can see the new users rate um and so these metrics will show you roughly what the uses percentages and the right out of your user base but knowing all of this information is great but it's not enough and so what we also want to know is what they're doing once they're inside SharePoint so for example if you think about a case where ninety-five percent of the active you know you have a ninety-five percent active user rate well that can look really amazing on your first dashboard but what if i told you that the only visit that they only visit sharepoint once a week and they only spend a minute looking at the homepage and then they leave so that's why we added you know all these additional metrics as well in terms of advertise of visit the single page visits right and the average depth of visit I touched on that earlier in the arm on Prem version um so it's the same metrics here so you know learning how deep your users go into the portal and again here the bounce rate so how many this is ended within one minute and we can also see the trend over time to see if anything has changed throughout time so if you see any of these disturbances in the patterns or spike then that can be a red flag to kind of look into additional reports we also have this chart of average number of visits per user per week and we can see how much time they spend in an average visit and how many pages they see in an average visit as well so you can click here and again you can drill down into that into specific documents that they're visiting on these visits as well and combining all of this information together can really give you an idea of your user adoption rates but again this report here is just an overview so to see more information you'll really need to drill down into some of our more individual reports and so let's go ahead and do that so here you have your visitor adoption in your inactive users um and this represents a drill down of what I just mentioned previously from that overview report and this shows you the percentage of inactive users in each department and I apologize that it's lagging a bit okay there it goes seems to be loading um so you can also drill down and see exactly who they are so here you can see your active and inactive users by Department so if you're wondering how this this is done specifically so it's done by pulling information from sharepoint so one of the things that we pull is attributes from sharepoint profiles and as well as from the Active Directory groups which I mentioned previously so you know it's the same information that we have in the on prem version just presented in a bit of a different way um so you can easily select which attributes you would like to include in each report and you can even include your own attributes as well and as we mentioned previously you know not all departments need the same amount of training as so here you can actually see which departments require you know more training for example um so here I t they had the highest number of inactive users so let's click on that and here you can see the number of visits by username so you can see all your specific users within that IT department and again that's very similar to what i showed you previously in our charts so you can also click on them and see their details on the right hand side as well so for example i can click on this user Caden Taylor and if you have you know photos within the portal that will show up as well again this is just a demo demo demo data and so here you can see kind of you know even more details about them including their office their department and their job title specifically and then you can actually see on the right hand side you know a full report of their activity so here you can see their information at by quarter and then you can actually drill down into what's their activity by a specific day and again what hours they're most active within that specific day and drilling down even deeper you can actually see which content they interacted with the most so this is really powerful in order to improve adoption to help you really see who are these most and least active users in order to dedicate you know more training and more time towards these specific users and you can really take this list and you know really use it to ask your users you know why are you using sharepoint and really understand you know at who are your least active users and who are your most active users and you can even interact with your most active users and collect insights from them to see how you can kind of replicate that success as so that's a really nice visualization again of your active and inactive users I'm going to talk a little bit now about usability as so this is again another really important aspect of the portal so we're talking about adoption and adoption you know we covered that high level overview but usability is actually how you can improve adoption and by improving adoption you are actually improving usability at the same time so if your users don't like the user experience then they simply won't use SharePoint as much so a key a key thing here is search so if your users can't find things and are struggling then that's not a good use of their time and this is where these search reports can come in to help you see how your users are searching in the portal if they're you know if they have some roadblocks or challenges in the search schema so here you can see exactly what people are searching for as if you click here you have all your search phrases you can see at the top you can see the number of searches as well you can see at the average number of results etc and you can see that seven percent of times or okay sorry nine percent of times the result click was the result clicked out of searches and so that's a pretty low number of people who are clicking so if you see that then you know okay maybe I need to improve my search schema insert or include a you know missing content in the portal that's not there that users are searching for as well as a search improving the search queries and so you can also see trends to see what people are searching for or what they care about in this nice visualization of these surprises here and you can see that words search phrases that are more popular will be bigger and ones that are less popular will appear smaller and so it's a good example a that I like and so holidays if you see add this search phrase here we can click on holidays we can actually see how it's trending over time and we saw that essentially around the holiday period more people are searching for search phrases relating to holidays so site owners can actually add more content around this search phrase around that specific time of year and you can also see a trend of a percent of failed searches and so if content was deleted and now maybe people can't find it or perhaps it's been moved and people can't find what they're looking for that's a really great indicator to understand how many failed searches are happening within the portal and we have a lot of other different reports in terms of usability we've also got a great report on our portal responsiveness and so this is really helpful for IT users as well but for today since we're talking about Shin I focus on these specific reports but again if you're interested we have over 20 different reports so we can definitely provide a demonstration for you and your team that will go a bit more in depth to cover you know as things that will be more specific to you as well and so if you are interested in a demo of either our SAS or are on prem solution feel free to send a chat into the chat box and I'll be happy to set you up with one with someone from our team all right and I think we've got just a few minutes for a bit more Q&A um so let's if you have any questions at this time I'll be happy to answer them so you can go ahead and enter your questions into the chat box and go ahead and try to answer some of these questions that you guys have all right i'll just give you guys a few more seconds to enter in any questions you may have all right so I've got one question from mark asking if we can track social platforms is specifically Yammer so the answer to that is yes so we have a broad range of reports available to track Yammer and all those kinds of fine details within Yammer as well so at including reports like user adoption rate top groups and Yammer group activity influential users followers likes and more so if you're interested in tracking Yammer we can also provide a very tailored demonstration to show you very specific reports that we can provide to track the Yammer platform I've got another question coming in from Stephanie asking how cardia log analytics is designed specifically for SharePoint so I mentioned again previously in the presentation that cardio leg analytics is the only analytic solution out there designed specifically for sharepoint so cardi log is based on the structure and content of SharePoint sites so particularly Internet portals but also extranet and websites so being designed for SharePoint means that cardio log analytics can provide accurate and useful data on your SharePoint implementation and a mother among other things it seamlessly integrates with sharepoint user profiles so really enabling you to make use of that flexible use of that data on the people who use your site and it also supports to your point fast a source server so offering insights into how people are using the fast search engine as well and as I mentioned that cardio log is designed for SharePoint but also works with office 365 as well and the last question I have for today about all the time we have is from Rogers so he's asking if we have a free trial so yes if you're interested we have both a 30-day trial for our on-premises version as well as a 7-day trial for SAS based version so just simply send a chat into the chat box if you're interested in the trial and i'll be sure to get you squared away all right so that's all the time that we have for today so again for a free trial or a personal demo feel free to visit us at WWE until you are calm you can join our readers at blog intercom and if you have any questions feel free again to send them into the chat box or you can email us at info at intercom thanks everyone have a great day
