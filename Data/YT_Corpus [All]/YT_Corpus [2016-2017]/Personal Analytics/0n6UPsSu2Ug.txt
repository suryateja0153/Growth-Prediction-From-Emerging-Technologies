 hi this is ivy Dixon I'm a senior solutions engineer with Scala here at NRF 2016 today I'm going to be speaking with you about the Scala data presentation and analytics environment so this is an opportunity to take the data that we're garnering in RAW format from all of our interactive and experiential engagements and make this something purposeful for management and corporate infrastructure to understand how customers are engaging with applications what you're seeing here on our data presentation wall is different analytics that include not only gender information but also who's lifting what and how are they interacting with those experiences and then a breakdown of different types of products that we're offering and how often they're being selected the great thing about this information is that in this format it's easy to read and quick to be able to modify and understand but we can take this data and make a second layer of information by pushing this into the analytics environment that we provide with a software and services offering and then make quality recommendations about what the next steps are with your digital environments the other great piece of this is that it gives information quickly to managers who are trying to understand par those digital experiences working well and are people engaging with the products that we're putting out or do we need to make a modification to those products to make better sales choices thank you and have a great show
