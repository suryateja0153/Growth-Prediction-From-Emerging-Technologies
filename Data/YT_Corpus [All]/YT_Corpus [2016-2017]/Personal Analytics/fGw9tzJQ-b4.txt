 well welcome to today's webinar campaign feasibility reporting and analysis I'm Doug Cogswell I lead advisor solutions were a software company that does a lot of work in fundraising analytics we put dashboards together help people untangle key metrics create scoring algorithms and the like I'm here with Mary Ann Peltier from stopple and we've partnered up with her because she provides a lot of hands-on front end consulting that complements the work we do we like to say we take the data advisor takes the data that goes into the CRM systems and other data sources it makes it easy to work with and get out and she helps teens really use it to make better decisions and improve operations so Mary and I'll turn it to you for a couple minutes here to talk about what we're going to do here today in your background great thanks very much Doug so as Doug said I've been fascinated with data and what we can get out of data and what the different pieces of information mean when you put them together in different ways and so this year we founded stop al analytics group as a way of accessing directly others who also are curious want to figure out how to build strategy we I fell for the advisor product the first time I saw it I think it was 2009 or 2010 and so duck was the first person we spoke to about a partnership when we formed the firm this year so let's take a look at our agenda today very just on our side and we've seen Mary Ann and just across the industry and I've had numerous APRA awards and she'd been engaged in a variety way so we were really excited when it's possible for the two of us to come together and work on something like this thank you so what we're going to talk about today is how to develop an overall strategy and plan for designing a campaign the usually that's done outside of the business intelligence team but it says we certainly have plenty of ideas that will help you and your leadership make good plans we're gonna give you some information on data-driven feasibility studies everything here of course is a topic on its own but we want to expose you to some really good ideas and then we're going to look for the hope in the middle of the campaign we're going to talk about gap analysis we're also going to talk about some really good ideas for figuring out your prospects and including some of the ideas that Doug is bring by in this concept of expected value and then we'll wrap it up by talking about end of campaign and we're leaving plenty of time to go over questions that you may have just to make sure we're covering the topics you want us to talk about and if you have questions there's a chat panel at the bottom of the webinar control you can type them in there and we'll be picking them up at the end or if you're really bold you can raise your hand and we can unmute you and you can ask you a question live at the end so the the deal with a campaign is that it it actually depends on the prospects the prospects are the ones that tell you that dictate whether or not your campaign will be successful and identifying the prospects of course becomes a key component which we'll talk about in the next few slides however the goals are actually dictated by the needs of the program and by the staff who are in charge and then by the infrastructure of your organization and so often known prospects don't always fill a campaign goal and so we look for new prospects as well and then as you see those two arrows facing each other they certainly demonstrate the tension that goes on then between the non prospect pool and what they've given before and the organization's needs I have asked clients before to sum up the total life giving of their entire database and when they did they found that often found out that it was less than their current campaign goal of course that has a lot explains a lot about why gift officers and other fun tend to move so we're gonna help you figure out how to make the feasibility much better so the essential data you really want to have is you want to understand your goals of course goals are driven by the needs of the organization when we talk about donors hetrick fundraising we often try to figure out how to guide a donor into the kind of goals that the the campaign has and so that's another tension set that makes the tennis match with a badminton match between us between fund raisers and prospects we also want to look at feasibility results and that's the question do we have enough prospects do we have enough capacity because if we don't we're going to have to think of new and inventive ways to bring in either more people or expand the goal for corporate and foundation relations fundraising you want to think about all of the programs and how they'll participate will the Annual Giving Program have to increase its annual receipts is this going campaign going to be an engagement piece how of course will major in principle gifts be involved in making sure that the goals are met and so let's take a look at elements of the feasibility study as well so the campaign pyramid is often made up of a number of prospects how many prospects you think you need for each gift some of the more sophisticated organizations will actually have different numbers of prospects at each level of giving today three prospects for $1,000,000 gifts for each million dollar gifts but five prospects for each hundred thousand dollar gift because you know those prospects left less you want to understand your prospect to gift ratio and so the and that's the piece how many prospects do get put into gift officers portfolios two to get one gift out at the other end and you want to think about it through all of your stages normally there are five qualification sorry identification qualification cultivation solicitation and then success and so as you go through all those five stages what do you start with and what you end with and then how many prospects do you need by your sub campaigns it's always true that one particular portion of the organization attracts the largest number of donors so how do you take care of the organizations that attract fewer dollars and then what are your silent phase requirements when you announce the campaign you have to be half successful already what are you going to need in your core prospect group and then we come back to what I've mentioned already they're corporations and foundations are you going to use your campaign as an opportunity to involve more organizations in giving to your to your charity and then of course the economy as we learned in 2008 and 2009 the economy certainly plays a role so when you are looking at it go ahead guess who stay when you look at one of the things we like to do in the gift pyramid is create what we call a calculated campaign ask which most of you have the data to do this and it's not that hard to put it to put it together so I want to just define what we're talking about and then show some examples of how you'd use it so I calculated campaign as we mean take each prospects capacity which you can get from the different wealth rating agencies or you know if you don't have that even just using wealth at the zip code level can be monetized and give you a proxy for capacity so there's a variety of ways of getting that x attachment an attachment or engagement or affinity can be scored out of the data that most of you have generally what matters in this is the number of alumni events people have been to recently or in health care it might be the different events around the institution it matters how frequently they've given in the last five years the five years before that it matters that they come to reunions play student sports if it's a health care organization or not-for-profit how engaged were they when they're worth when they were in the institution so that gives you an expected value then you have to take off the total lifetime giving today so here are some examples somebody's got a million dollar capacity their attachment we would call detached which means they're really not engaged they're not coming to things they're not giving and they're a non donor so we take the million dollar capacity multiplied by a point O two who are detached a good gift expectation for that person the calculated campaign ask would be $20,000 you're unlikely to get a million dollars because they're detached but they've got a good capacity so they clearly can give more than like five hundred bucks the same another person $1,000,000 the same capacity highly engaged owner so this person's all in coming to events giving frequently coming to reunions you know whatever they've given twenty thousand so far like to date so take the million dollars a highly engaged owner might be a point five factors they have an expected value of half a million dollars they've given twenty thousand so your campaign calculated ask would be four hundred and eighty thousand dollars third case million dollar capacity again another highly engaged owner but they've already given four hundred fifty thousand maybe in the last campaign or they made some you know special gift or something so they've got the same five hundred thousand dollar expected value but since they've already given four hundred fifty thousand you know what you're not likely to get that amount again you're more likely to get in the fifty thousand dollar range so this kind of calculation one of the services like one of the cool things about this particular way of doing things is that we often struggle when we're dealing with capacity ratings we often struggle with we when we do a capacity rating we actually figure out how much giving a person can give to any to all organizations that person chooses so we can actually figure out people who have high value but low attachment including some of their sentiments as expressed to us in surveys or in their own social media or some of the other ways that they've communicated with us and I think that it's a it's a cool idea because we end up getting a better probability instead of shooting at the dark yeah absolutely and then if you put these together you can get the dimensions of a campaign gift pyramid so this is actually a live project I'm going to click on this it's going to open an advisor project for a campaign gift pyramid and we can take you through from the entity or the prospect level rolling it up to giving levels and schools and other affiliations how you could figure out what this my total out to because the goal is you gotta get somewhere around that calculated campaign and ask them out so here is an example the gift pyramid we're looking at expected campaign asked amounts we generally want a bucket them ten million plus five to ten million one to five million five hundred thousand to a million hundred thousand five hundred fifty to ninety nine twenty five to fifty thousand ten to twenty five thousand under ten thousand I mean this is a major giving campaign so those would be good buckets we've got sixty three thousand three hundred thirty seven prospects in the database eighteen of them have calculated campaign asks of ten million or more fifty seven thousand of the vast majority have calculated campaign ask under ten thousand dollars and that's a pretty reasonable distribution but the dollars and when you add up the calculated campaign ask for these eighteen people it's two hundred eighty five million out of my billion won total so that's twenty six percent of my total is in this top eighteen group the next group is sixty eight million to thirty eight so you actually see what we typically see these pyramids near the top small percentage of donors contribute the potential for the vast majority the campaign here the like the million and up on this group of roughly a hundred and thirty people is close to 50% of my billion won expected for the campaign we also want to look at the current solicitations on the street so I've got four hundred twenty million out to this group against a million one campaign so I'm getting there but I'm actually seeing the top is where I've got the gaps at two hundred eighty five to forty seven versus two thirty-eight to 107 and so forth so it looks like I actually probably need to do some more work at the top this these other charts in this page we've taken the prospects and group them by primary school so 6556 are affiliated with the business school a group with the college and the colors are by the affiliation engineering and medical and then we just picked out some other attribute like sports so for example I might be raising money for my football program and I've got twenty eight hundred and fifteen football players I can click on this bar it's going to reshuffle all of this down to show mrs. drop in on it the football players the 2815 are worth at this calculated campaign ask 76 million dollars so if I'm trying to you know raise 50 million its my goal for a new football stadium this capacity would seem to support it and you know I can sort of see I've got a few at the top of the pyramid and then I work down and I can sort of see the football players by class here the bulk of them are in the 70s and 80s in here 329 are already staffed a whole lot of them aren't staffed and by the way some of the football players also played rugby and baseball so I've got multiple sports participants in it so that's an example I'm going to hit the business goal in a second another example but how we can take an overall program and then drilling on a sub program and see if we have a capacity that would reasonably be expected to contribute to my goal of 50 million dollars with this new stadium and things I'm going to build around it let's back up a step I'm going to step back my sequence and let's look at the business school because now we want to see what could the business school do in the business school in play sports so that goes blank there's 65 56 of them worth 121 million dollars that says it's like 12% of my overall campaign I've got a group at the top the million dollar plus donors looks like I've got 14 of them so let's grab them so I can grab the top of the pyramid this is drop in on them and go to the next page and see what they are because this is where the detail for that's coming from so of those 14 this is Cleo Dodds is a twenty million dollar calculated campaign ask you can see where it comes from he's got a capacity rating of 50 million or more which we both would have monetized it as a 65 million dollar amount so we figure out somewhere in a range a little over this because it has no upside to low it keeps going this is a highly engaged attachment which say let's say it's a point three three so 65 million times point three three - a million five Cleo's already given as nineteen nine four one million there's a current solicitation of seven million on the table Kimberly Lloyd is a staff manager Cleo lives in Menlo Park so if I'm the business school lead I'm probability would want to have a talk with you know Kimberly about why I can't push the current solicitation amount off because this was all in person whose high really high capacity really engaged its already given a million five why not create a naming convention and really push this up the bottom of the list here I can see I've got up enik methought there is a five to ten million capacity that would monetize is 7 million times 0.2 minus ten thousand so he's got a calculated campaign ask of a million four which is pretty good no solicitation an alum not staffed lives in Minnesota so that's somebody we probably would want to get staffed so that's that's kind of how you can go about this and go from and is bring everything back an entire program with a you know billion won potential and 63,000 prospects look at a specific football program do we have enough capacity what could the Business School do how we doing with the top of the pyramid one of the considerations to think about while we're looking at our pyramid and our actual capacity is that wealth really is concentrated at the top I was reading yesterday that sixty-two people owned half the wealth in the world or that could be exaggerating someone's going to email me and tell me what the article was but we are finding that you know 95 percent of the campaign money comes from our top five percent of donors if that was true and our last campaign and economic conditioners were similar so we kind of want to emulate that pyramid again here so the pyramid that we're looking at here has excellent distribution but also it has a good enough concentration at the top to represent what we might be seeing in the wealth of the world right now yeah definitely and what I like about this format is you can go from everybody and then check out specific programs or the interest areas and then you get down to the people because at some point you just a gift Kermit it actually matters who are these 18 people and what's their status and you know have we are we close to getting the expected calculate campaign ask all of them right and at that top level you know I've certainly had top fundraising executives say to me if there's a million-dollar prospect on Antarctica I'll go to Antarctica to visit but we also when we looked at the map we also want to look at we also want to look at whether or not we've got enough cohorts to have a visit you know have a good visit and have a good couple of days and see a lot of people so this is the mapping that we were looking at was also excellent we're going to go to Minnesota and who else are we going to see when we're there all right so we're gonna come back and you can grab here's Minnesota you can actually just grab up here right apps are selectable - I grabbed around Minnesota I can go back to the first page and this just drop in a Minnesota here's you know here's the Minnesota 862 prospects in Minnesota 18 million dollar potential you know there's some look at the million dollar office for but if you go 500 visitors a group of like seven at the top that's probably worth the visit oh I might say the winner is a little cold up there maybe we delay that to the spring at this point you have to be to be practical about these things yeah actually so do you mind if I answer this one question we have coming up sure go for it so the question is if capacity is total philanthropic capacity over five years why wouldn't I subtract giving in the last five years rather than lifetime giving and I think that's an excellent question the question is is do we how many times do we want to go to the well and do we exhaust the well and so Doug first notion is you start with by you know mitigating your expectation by what they've already contributed if in your organization you want to think about it as over the last five years they've given us ten million dollars we know their capacity is 15 million dollars we're really going to ask him only to stretch to the next five or the their wealth has changed and that's one of the things that you're implying in your question in my 20s my capacity was much different than it is now in my 50s and so that's oh that's going to play a consideration as well dodge point is is that part of your part of your expected value does include thinking about what they've already attributed and can we guess at what somebody would give in a lifetime by the way who you were talking I got distracted I looked at the chart this this is Minnesota guess what jumps out is the major sport played hockey oh yeah okay that's cool so now we've got our you know where there will be a link right we've got our feasibility done and so now we're in the mid campaign so Arian what happens here so in the mid campaign you really want to know where you are and the nice piece about what we're looking at right now is we can answer questions right away and I've certainly been in enough meetings with gift officers to say well what about the what about them so we did and you just demonstrated a lot of what about this right there how do we get to those answers so we could move on to strategy in the middle of the campaign you're actually at what about what about these goals what about the football program what you know who's who's behind and where do we have fewer gifts than expected and then there's also the concept of gap analysis and I think of gap analysis as opportunity so it's not that something is missing it's that there's a space there that we can fill with prospects and gifts and when I think about the campaign pyramid and how often the waste the leadership Annual Giving portion of a campaign period goes thin that's actually an opportunity to fill with lots of gifts so we we do want to know especially mid campaign where are we and and how are we going to do and we can't wait till the end of the campaign to solicit more of the gifts than we did at the beginning we still need to be moving a lot so the next question is is our the gift officers who need better prospects and are their gift officers who need more encouragement and is the prospect of gift ratio still holding true because though as we've discovered in our recent in recent days the the economy the stock market all kinds of things we'll make changes over the course of a five-year campaign so Doug how do we do some of that tracking and analysis yeah so let's take a look at dashboard that's team that this is another live ones I'm going to click it it's going to open in a web browser so the way this works is this is a project for campaign tracking it loads data from the CRM system usually nightly whether it's Blackbaud CRM reasons edged advanced banner money 'm edge alon we work with a lot of them and then it you know when you click on it it puts the opens the data into our app and then i'm running in a web version and in you know 10 to 20 seconds you're up and running and so this is trying to look at results percent goal by fun category and percent goal by funds and there's a hierarchy this could be schools it could be programs either departments sub programs you know fun categories fun so there's a there's a level depending on how you organize but mid campaign what you're trying to do is see how things are performing against goals we have two indicators there's a green line which says goal 100 that's where you should be today and then we've actually colored these things green if they're the best in there if they're like at or above gold or green if they're way bad they're red and here you can sort of see in the funds you've got a group of four of them that are doing pretty good then another group is nidalee got a couple of them that are kind of far behind and then under the fund categories the sub pieces you've got some things that are excelling some of them right you know 300 percent of goal like a quarter of them there's another group that's kind of okay between maybe 50 percent and goal it's like another quarter and got half of them that are under a 50 percent goal which is not so good and so suppose i'm the vp of advancement and i'm really interested in what's going on with faculty support so i click this what happens is it shows the details of faculty support down here overall we've got one hundred and twenty two in and this could be a combination of you know cash received pledges we revoke up over all of it other stuff adds to one hundred twenty two million my goal is one hundred sixty million so 64% which is pretty good but it's made up of five things a faculty research and supports doing awesome it's up here at you know 106 million against 50 million two hundred thirteen percent professorship so faculty award of funds chair and general faculty support are pretty low and if you take something like this which is running like five percent well we've got 2.8 million in against a 50 million goal so I'm running this thing I'm going to be kind of concerned about what's going on with these guys so we can drill in I can just get rid of all the other funds at this point and go to campaign details so here's what's happening for faculty support over time from 2009 to the current year the red is the actual total in the blue is the cash in so the Reds a little higher than the cash in by those same funds I hear I'm sorted or measured by dollars instead of amounts but you can sort it's the same thing by record type you know I was expecting a lot of lumps that alums to come in on faculty support but the alums here represent only 3.5 percent three and a thousand dollars out of the total amount in here so let's drill in on the alums and see what's going on because that's sort of startling low so I can click the alums get rid of everything else and it updates to see you know I've only got Omar's given a million bucks Felicia five hundred thousand before this drops off pretty quick the top of this alums contribution to faculty support it's tough and I also see it looks like I got a big million dollar one is pledge but not yet received which would be Omar so you know at this point I probably want to go sit down with the team doing this and figure out how do we get the alums more engaged in faculty support because it's really really really important annually alums have done more with the College of Management and the institution wide restricted than some of these engineering so somehow I seem to be really low on the engineering side so maybe I want to drill in and pick up going to the engineering affiliation and see if I can get more engagement with that group so that's Marian the kind of thing we're doing here mid campaign to try to like zero in on what matters because so often we see you know this gets masked under the top level you know faculty supports doing pretty good but wow this area it needs help and it needs help pretty quick if it's going to meet its goal yeah the the nice piece is that we we can take a look at this and decide is this an engineering problem or is this a problem with faculty unnamed faculty support so if people are really into professorships then there's an indicator there are they into professorships across the board as we saw in the earlier chart or they only enter professorships when it comes to say the liberal arts program and so their question is is it what they're supporting are they supporting people is that what they're into or is it what particular department they're supporting and once we can figure that out and looks like we can figure that pretty easily we can start rebranding those things that are getting left behind also engineering we can think about what are the ways felicitations methods that have worked with people who would be interested in this program and beef that up as well so we have an opportunity to go after things because we can see what what our results are so far great in just to go back I mean you know what we love about something like this is the ability to have a simple dashboard scorecard so at the high level you can get a quick snapshot of how it's going and this is this would update every day but but you know usually in our experience that's not enough so we love the ability to then go down into the detail and figure out you know in this case it's faculty support in some of the programs the alums in the engineering is the issue in let's which that's where you can fix it you know this level it's hard to see what the fix at that level you can clearly in some of Marian suggestions to be right on about how you'd go about it yeah and the funny thing is is that in my direct experience engineering alumni didn't want to be solicited in person but gift officers are very personable people so they found out that they needed to solicit engineering alumni even for million-dollar gifts through email and it worked and so the cool thing is is that we pinpointed the problem can able sit down and have a brainstorming session about is that the case statement is it the approach is it the audience and and then start making shifts in order to build more success into the campaign that's a great where we work together on predictive modeling that's the kind of thing the math and the model you can quickly untangle are those kinds of differences and then boy when they when you see them it becomes clear and then you can operationalize around it mm-hmm isn't that fun yes about part of the job so now we're coming to the end of the campaign we've just got a couple of slides left what about this what happens at the end Marian so at the end this is when you start congratulating each other if you've met your goal you want to make sure that you've swept in all of your high capacity unassigned prospects probably nothing is more painful to an organization to find out a year after campaign has ended that someone who would have given whatever amount of money you would consider a high gift opted not to because they were never approached during the campaign and so you want to make sure you've reached everyone and everyone's had an opportunity there are always the surprise gifts as well that make the research team go well how come we didn't notice them and so you've got your last minute prospecting as well so in the third year of the campaign let's say I sell my business and now I'm a multi-millionaire with a tax problem I absolutely want to be noticed as part of the end of the campaign and also we want to do our last minute gap analysis we need to keep the promises to heads and to all of the other people who are relying on the cash in we want to think about celebrating no matter where the campaign goal is whether we've met it or not we want to think about how to celebrate appreciate and even at the last year of the campaign you can think about whether or not to go back to people who contributed the first year of the campaign and have already paid things off this is also the time to start looking for success stories and to do brilliant stewardship so Doug how do we show our board and our staff and the public how well we did so we can have that celebration yeah let me before that I want to just are ok and time jump in and try to just do a quick run high-capacity unassign prospects like how would you find them you okay with that yeah that'd be great so we're going to click on this we're going to go back to that campaign feasibility project and just reload it at the end of the campaign the data has been updating you know every day with the new information and so at the end of the campaign you'd probably want to grab our there's some unassigned prospects who have high capacity expectations so yeah there are there's some one unassigned prospects I'm going to grab them these are the ones not assigned these are the ones not assigned to an mg oh no when you get rid of everybody else and then it looks like over here if I grab there's a half a million and up or maybe a hundred thousand this grab is happening there's a hundred thousand and up group off of here so I'm going to grab the three 22 the 23 this group at the top so here's everybody who's got a campaign expected ask up a hundred thousand or more who is not assigned to an NGO and let's see where they are because these are the people you know let's have a conversation with them and see where they are you know maybe our VPS going to the Boston area because I've got looks like a group here in Boston I've got some out here in the suburbs so let's just grab the Boston area and here's a list of see what we got we got 34 people worth six million dollars of expected ask amount or in the Boston area got my list here let's slide it up a little bit I can study these people and figure out got some you know here's somebody with a pretty good capacity how we engage is given 600,000 no solicitation not a sign the business school let's take this list get it out of here and use it to set up the meeting we're going to have in Boston when we go out there next week so I'm out of here into Excel or whatever else I want to put it into ready to go fun news is of course you could do your Boston list hop on a color go down to New York through New York list hop on Excel in Philadelphia right and that's the beauty of this I mean you try to just quickly get some ideas who else we might staff into this campaign and try to close that out strongly so let's go back to your a point from a minute ago so we've got it done and then there's a bunch of reporting and view out that has to go to the staff the board the public and kind of what I know is there's always a whole bunch of questions like what about this what about that can we see it this way can we see it that way and you know we the same concept we can have a dashboard that shows you kind of how when here's the straight line the red lines how it came in across the length of the campaign you've got totals by years summary stats transactions by fiscal year colored by here the Blues alum and I think via the the orange and red are corporations and foundations you can see the color down down here I can sort of see the total transaction with heavily alumni but in terms of dollars contributed it's been pretty consistent as bright orange corporations and foundations across across time so you know that's it's helping tell a story and then much like the other one is the questions come you can drill in on this and slice in on it from different angles and figure out how the business will go how the law school go how this campaign go but this is really helpful to get a snapshot of what happened where the money came from and help you get success stories going at the campaign and of course you want to the success stories can come from a variety of places including we've increased participation by our constituency by this much percent or we've brought in this many new friends we have increased the highest gift we've ever received I remember being asked over and over again can you find the highest gift ever given to something something so that we can see if we can't out the gift that we received as the highest was ever yet that's ever been given to something something and after a while of course I started joking to say it's the highest gift that any organization has ever received from a fellow named you know whatever Julian Fellowes I don't know so so those are the kind of the fun things but you want to look at everything you can it at all different angles the you can say you've doubled the engineering school endowment as well I was at a at a panel discussion by board trustees for organizations in New York they had to go through large transformations and one of the one of the themes that I was pulling out of their presentations was that they really dug into the details and I'm a customer when I'm working or presenting in front of boards I'm accustomed to giving them as little detail as possible I said we were a great give us a bigger budget we were great give us a bigger budget but the given the advent of the X generation donors tend to want to be much more involved in seeing the results and seeing what happens and getting these questions answered certainly their questions are going to come up and our executives have to answer them whether they're in front of the border in front of the public or in front of their own bosses and so we have the opportunity here to start with a snapshot and then drill down as much as we need to great great yeah and I just think that this whole what we just talked to about starting with potential from the prospects aligning with the goals figure out who the people are who have the capacity is there enough capacity then managing through these gaps all the way through the end where you're sharing success stories and able to quickly get information out is that nikita kate key to having this like just run smoothly from start to finish yeah most of the organizations I've been with actually they really get their gift numbers only once a month so the first week of the month is when the top of the you know the top brass actually find out how they're doing I like that we're moving toward a a culture of having real-time information so that you know really good decisions can be made in plenty of time great so we've reached the end of the allotted time for the presentation we have a whole bunch of questions which I have up in front of me and here's one how would you handle large corporations and foundations within the campaign ask a mount info in the pyramid is that calculated separately Marielle you take a stab at depth and I'll come back yeah I mean the the nice piece is that corporations and foundations tell you directly what they're interested in how much they give away on how to approach them so you don't have to worry about trying to figure out their expected value they tell you right up front so you can you can actually put their you know their whatever you're going to make is that you ask about is their expected value you can decide if you want to add some kind of probability measurements but you'll know yeah I would agree although it's you know obviously the calculations not the same capacity of a corporation and they're going to have different kinds of engagement so as we're mathematically calculating those things and we're running models on attachment and engagement and so forth we have to do different models and even for different kinds of prospects so I'm expanding on this a little bit obviously corporations and organizations are different and you would not apply the same math although there's a bunch of clues where you can figure things out like Mary and just said but then when you're doing the calculate campaign ask for alumni versus parents versus spouses versus friends you know the the capacity is going to be comparable because you're looking at somebody's overall wealth but the attachment and how it applies that the capacity is quite different and for example an alum is going to come to reunions come to events it's more encouraged to give every year a friend it doesn't have those same opportunities so you can't use the same attachment model and the attachment scoring may be different it's gonna have to be put it against the campaign ask so we probably simplified that a little bit in our description earlier but it is important as you figure out the calculate campaign ask and in some cases I've seen you know graduate school alums are going to have different attachment mechanisms or engagement mechanisms than undergraduate alums because they have different experiences and can't do the same things so I expanded on that and Marianne you might want to come back on that and add your perspective yeah I I agree with you I mean the it's one of the ways that I talked about with organizations that are not alumni base is you want to think about how someone came into your database so are they a grateful patient are they a family member of a grateful patient are they someone in the community who likes to be associated because it looks good to be in your say you're a theater and it looks good to be in your program so figuring that out is actually of the ways to segment people into different sentiment levels also when you're looking at something like parents you may see that their expected value is lower because their parents or you may say that their expected value is at the highest when you solicit them for and it could be the sports program or the you know financial aid or whatever you know whatever you discover and that's a part of a piece of modeling is getting to a question that can get you an actionable answer yeah and just I'm going to add two more things to that first in a large University with different schools the factors in the especially the attach an engagement can vary quite a bit like if at the University with a business school and engineering school you know an undergraduate Arts & Sciences you know some of those they have different makes of people they have different kinds of activities they build different degrees of connection and bonding so sometimes it's pretty consistent across the undergraduate population but other times depending on the actual institution and how the schools vary it can be quite different the other one is health care where we're doing increasingly amounts of work there the the factoring for a campaign ask obviously you have capacity it's the capacities the thing people just have but the engagement or attachment in a healthcare institution the good news is more and more the organizations are able to use the patient data they actually the patient encounter data that was opened up by HIPAA like a year and a half two years ago and some of the leading institutions now have that available on the fundraising side and we're blessed to be doing some pretty good work there with some of the leaders and we're finding experts really enlightening and and really helpful and things like which area they or somebody in their family had treatment in how intense it was which provider was is very meaningful and there's some surprises in there that means some of the more elective kinds of procedures which may attract higher-end people and you know help somebody just improve their appearance may have a higher connection and some of the things we typically you'll hear about like cardiology and all the other things so some really interesting data as some of us are now getting into mining that and really trying to relate it to fundraising obviously the same kind of things like alumni not alumni activities that people participate in news whether click-throughs frequency of giving also matters in the healthcare world but there's this whole other rich data set that is you're looking at calculated campaign ask is really valuable and then plus you obviously have the the affinity because you knew you know which medical area they were in so it's maybe a little easier there to capture an interest or an area of interest those are two points I wanted to make Marion can you had any have you done working and helped her what's your perspective on those two topics so the closest I've gotten to is a volunteer ship with an organization that had rehabilitation houses and had a school for autistic children there's there are a lot of different levels of engagement and the piece that I was thinking about while you were sharing your thoughts is that when I go into a charitable organization it's the direct care people direct contact people that I build the relationships with so I build a relationship with a doctor or in the houses that I was just talking about I build a relationship with with the house caretakers to take care of my daughter or you know in a educational institution I build relationships with faculty and then these strangers show up and say how did you like that was that great and so as those fundraisers we have to try to figure out how can we reconnect people and remind them of the warm fuzzy experience that they got even though we are not those faculty or doctors or even you know the kids and the Boys and Girls School or the coaches or all those different things that we care about or even that we're not the trees that people are contributing the environmental organization for how do we as strangers reconnect them to those experiences and then turn around and ask them for funds and so that's where things like sentiment or engagement or attachment all come into play there's a another question kind of drilling in deep on attachment by the way we do have advisor has a tutorial webinar on attachment scores which is up on our website which is you can see my emails up there it's WWE Weiser solutions comm resources webinars there's a webinar up there on attachments of course and they're also baked into well that's probably the best place to get it there's one here what's the highest attachment score that you've seen and Oh answer the marryin you can jump on are the advisor modeling algorithms will create a range score from 0 to 1.0 and usually when we do this the you know there's like three percent of the population is over 0.25 0.25 to 100 is this tale of like 3 percent of the population and maybe another you know 10 percent of the populations between point 1 and point 2 5 and then the entire arrests 75 the percent of the population is under a score a point 1 so this is hugely skewed where you have a few people who are really highly engaged and we would clip off that top portion and call them owners maybe the 0.25 and up and then between may be 0.15 to 0.25 we call them highly engage and maybe between point 1 and point 1 5 we call them engaged and then we break that bottom part into probably disconnected and detached but that's typically how it runs some of the modeling will create you know scores that range from something that low to something high we forced it into that zero to one range which then you actually can use for the factoring I you can just take the score and put it right in to the equation against the the the capacity number although I would caution that you know one is probably maybe a little extreme but you know there's usually very few people up there Mary Ann can you jump in on this one yeah I agree I think that when we talk about attachment and we said when we were rehearsing for this webinar where we had some discussion about what attachment really means and I start at the top of the line someone who is a board member somebody who is actually taken a personal responsibility for the welfare of the organization's future success is the most engaged or invested person so you call them owners and I think of them as investors or stakeholders all similar synonyms and those people are the people by which we measure the attachment or engagement of everyone else so how close are they to this level of engagement and what does those people do to get to this level I want to apologize for my cat with something solely yeah so so then and when we think about attachment though the other some of the other systems that have come into play Jennifer Cunningham introduced the idea to me of Net Promoter Score and that's something when you take out any kind of serving you say I really like that experience I liked it less you're actually putting in how you feel about the organization and that's the Net Promoter Score is a system of figuring out who your promoters are versus your detractors and promoters and detractors do answer the survey and I've done some work with surveys to figure that out and that helps with attachment and once you have those scores you can see who are most highly attached or engaged people and then who are the people that look like them and that's how that goes so so with all the similar that the question is how do you force it into a probability and and Doug I think you've gotten the closest that I've ever heard about coming up with a theory that works well to to get someone into a probability that you can actually use as an expected value equation if they're just for all of you just remember it you know this is probability so like when I did that analysis with the football back at the beginning and the campaign asked total came up to seventy million dollars I mean that's a directional statement because you got lot of variants and are the capacity numbers actually real so they really have the capacity do they just like do something that wiped at house you know these these attachment factors and how they relate to the capacity are all directional and then no one is going to be exactly what it is but in in in if you take a pool the kind of the risk in these things kind of falls out so it is directional and if you look at that football thinking it was like 70 million the business school was like 120 million that's directional and if I'm looking at raising 40 or 50 million for a football program and I've got 70 million calculated that way I go it's a good shot I can make this let's let's go for it I have capacity I mean obviously if it came out of 30 million to probably want to test the numbers and if it came out of 200 million of going I've got an overage here I think that's important um I also as Marian was talking it we when we do our work you know those scores when you're talking with the stakeholders the gift officers the management we we always frame it in terms of owners highly engage engage disconnected or detached we we actually never talk about the scores because they're just people don't relate to in real well but if I talk about somebody with a million dollar capacity was highly engaged people get it and so how you frame the language and how you relay this to the team is really important in you know the point three point five point seven if it's all relative but like most people would agree that somebody who's given consistently been to a bunch of activities came to a bunch of reunions is engaged or highly engaged they get it and so we find that's you know much more helpful in terms of relaying this to a team the nice piece also is that when you can do the modeling you're breaking your own paradigm so if we say people who buy football tickets are not going to be engaged outside of football and then mining might actually demonstrate or modeling might actually demonstrate that people who attend football games actually start attending computer events and then we looking at a behavior change after they've attended theatre events they actually get asked to give to the Annual Fund they start giving to the Annual Fund and so you have you know what is the propensity of me moving from this step to the next step that gets me up to that invested or own owner ship piece that we're looking for at the top and we can we can build that when one ladder step on the ladder at a time so there's a couple questions here about how you actually operationalize this so I'm gonna jump on this for two points first is we really like operationalizing and so that the team can work with these gift pyramids on their own and sort out in bet whether they make sense in and get a comfort and we we know a lot of times is where it gets farmed out and some looks like group goes and says you know here's the pyramid and here's what can go to this but we actually do believe both of us that you know teams can do this and you might need some help getting it set up and going but it's the kind of thing you need to wrestle with and slice it and exam it and test it and discuss it to us that's more valuable than kind of you know here's the number the other thing is the operational question so what you saw in these examples is something that you know software that pulls from your CRM system usually nightly it can load on demand or whatever it can one host it it could run on premise that's irrelevant but it's everyday it's grabbing like for these attachments it's going to grab the activities table it's going to grab the giving table if it's healthcare it's going to grab a bunch of encounters stuff about patient encounters it's going to grab if you've got newsletter click throughs the newsletter clip - as of last night and then it once it loads the data it does up unto calculations it figures out you know how many events you've been to in the last month over the last two years it's all obviously Calculus out you know how many of the last five years have you made a gift how many newsletter clicks have you've done in the last 60 you know 180 360 days that's probably as far back as you want to go with something like that then it has a scoring algorithm that turns all those things into that attachment score so you know maybe you were a point one you were border you know disconnected engaged you're a borderline on Saturday you know and then over the weekend you came to your reunion you made a gift and you joined a committee you might jump up to a point to on Monday and now you're highly engaged because that happened and that's the beauty of this stuff you can put these things in they can run right off your own data which almost everybody is collecting and then this dynamic and updating and at the end when we went into that you know are there any more prospects you want to know like right now who are the unstaffed people who have this capacity and kind of where are they and how do I get at them you don't want to have a report that somebody did you know eight months ago and like everything's different because they actually made a gift or you know they've been assigned and they've already been cultivated so that hope you know operationalizing this is kind of what we do that's our business and it's it's not that hard I mean it's some setup because the data is complicated but you know our setup is usually four to eight weeks to get one of these kind of all the way up and running with all the scoring going and so forth and then once it's in it loads and updates daily or hourly or whatever you wanted we were sorry I did we were talking about this in the prospect DMM listserv do we want dynamic scoring or do we want stack scoring one of the answers was the Annual Fund would not like to have dynamic scoring they'd like to set their segments in August or July and then just used those segments however the deal is is that you can continue to have dynamic scoring and use the segment's codes as you know a different thing as once you an annual fund hits March and discovers that perhaps the goals are not as close doing their gap analysis the goals are not as close as they want them to be they can look for those people that Doug described people who are raising their hands through recent behavior or people who are showing evidence through new understanding of wealth or new understanding of capacity and so it gives it gives the choice back to the fundraiser which i think is great I love that so we've got time for one more question here we reaching the our point here now there actually I'm gonna ask you Marian a question you know these these campaign is or one or two like we talked about the different steps you know from start to finish what makes the one or two three things the big things that make a difference in a successful campaign versus one that kind of flounders and maybe doesn't meet its goals and it could be data-driven or what do you see in your experience it really makes a difference there so in my experience it's really the one thing it's the ramp-up process it's the preparation has to be done well before even the silent phase you have to you have to ramp up staff and so before the campaign starts is when you should be heaviest in your prospecting and prospect research and business intelligence path work up your gift officer pool as you get into the campaign your solid if your silent phase isn't successful it makes the public face all the much harder and so the feasibility study needs to be thorough when I started in fundraising eighties you know a feasibility study was a consultant came in and talked to maybe a hundred of the top donors and asked them would you give again and it was pretty much just making the ask for the organization now we have the opportunity to really guess what's what's really feasible for this campaign with the prospect pool that we have and if we're not going to reach the goals that we've said where are we going to get the prospects that we need and to get those questions answered before the campaign starts brings the campaign success because in my mind the second thing is is that keeping the staff on board for the duration of the campaign when you have a lot of staffing changes especially at the leadership level you lose continuity around especially the largest donors some of the studies that I've done demonstrated very clearly that prospects who have what we call gift Officer churn when they were visited were less likely to give them prospects especially trustees and board members who had one gift officer through most of their tenure nobody likes to be handed off imagine how you feel when you buy a car then your hands it off to somebody else to actually make the purchase who wants you to buy more stuff it can feel that way and so the whole preparation continuity making sure that everybody's on board everybody's with the same theme also organizations that decide right at the start of the campaign to change their software in order to make the campaign more successful actually have a much more difficult time so you can hear that the theme that I've got here is distractions you want to gear everything up if you're gonna make a software conversion do it at least three years before you start your private phase otherwise you're just going to be having a lot of high blood pressure staff and you're gonna have difficulty focusing on the campaign goal yeah we've seen that and yeah I think that was a pretty honest and truthful assessment of the things that help campaigns be more successful than less we've reached our time limit here this has been recorded and we'll have it up and I'll post it out within the week and you've got both Marion and my contacts up on the screen so feel free to you know talk with us or call us or email us we this is clearly a topic area we both love to talk about and we're both very engaged in so I thank you for your time and attention today and have a good rest of the afternoon you
