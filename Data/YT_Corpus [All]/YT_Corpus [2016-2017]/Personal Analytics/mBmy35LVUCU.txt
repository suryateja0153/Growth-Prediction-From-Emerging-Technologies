 twitter is barring government agencies from using the social networks data mining service that could identify potential terror attacks as their unfolding that's according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal so joining us now to talk about this and this new wrinkle in the ongoing privacy debate is mark spoon our he's the editor in chief over at tom's guide so mark first off tell us about how data on twitter can be mined can be used by US intelligence agencies and tell us a little bit about what the dynamic is between the parties involved in this whole twitter versus the government versus data miner discussion yeah I think first it's important to understand how this relationship works so data miner is a company that twitter has five percent stake in but they are separate entities right and then you have data miner which is not just looking at public fees they're running them through an algorithm and there are putting things against that like geolocation and they're trying to site trends and that's what they're feeding to the US government and third parties like news agencies and broadcasters the USA Today and the Wall Street Journal count themselves as clients now the interesting part about this is data miners service itself is it clear now is it Twitter that shut the government out of using its fees or as a data miner that shut the government out of using the information it kind of turns yeah it's not exactly clear I mean so ultimately you would think it's data miners call and because twitter has a five percent stake I'm sure that they maybe had some influence but I think this really speaks to the overall debate that's happening right now but will you have silicon valley and tech companies on one side who are really championing privacy and on the other side you're talking about the federal government and law enforcement who are talking about this need to have information in real time if not sooner so that they can prevent attacks mark let's go into this a little bit more what is this new development here say about the relationship between Twitter and the government or broadly speaking between the government and Silicon Valley we all know what happened with Apple the iphone and the FBI trying to unlock it for the San Bernardino shooting situation yeah I think what's happening right now is that you have both sides that are essentially digging in and if the US government wants to get at this mation there at least for now they're going to have to find another way to get it and they do have a known arm of the government that is invested in data mining so they're going to have to figure out a way to get around this up this block all right so what will government agencies need to do mark to bolster their research and investigation taxes and make up for the fact that tech firms perhaps like Apple perhaps like Twitter at least for right now seem reluctant to cooperate yeah they're not gonna be able to essentially lean on the big data firms that are out there right now and they're going to have to do a lot of investment on their own I mean the good news is that it didn't really take that long when you think about it for them to unlock the San Bernardino shooters iPhone but they're going to have to apply all the resources that they have in this new direction if they really want to stay on top of the terrorist war all right so it sounds like that privacy debate has taken a huge step forward here given this new report out about Twitter data miner in the US government mark Spoonhour thank you so much for joining us and sharing your insights that's mark spoon our editor in chief over at tom's guide and thanks for watching I'm Dominic Chu have a great day CNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel here you're going to find videos packed with all of the information that you need to be smarter about your finances you can subscribe by clicking right here and click on all the videos around me or the eye right here to watch the latest from CNBC thanks for watching
