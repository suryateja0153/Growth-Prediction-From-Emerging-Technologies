 hi I'm Stephen Downes of the program leader for the learning and performance support systems program at the National Research Council in Canada today I want to talk about the overall concept and architecture for LPS s we've been working on LPS s for a little while now we've explored quite a bit about the way people learn using learning management systems and educational technology now I want to talk about how we approach learning here in building the LPS s technology the opss me website and future work down the line the concept of LPS s basically is this first learn from anywhere with anyone the idea here is not to learn from one university or one course provider or one site or one system but rather to be able to learn from any content that's located anywhere on the internet whether it's EDX Udacity a learning management system Flickr YouTube khan academy or your best friend it doesn't really matter and learn with anyone not just the class that you've been stuck with not just the people in your community but people that you choose that you connect with from around the world second keep all of your learning records in one place this is a big problem not just for individual learners who lose track of what they're doing and don't have an easy way of presenting all the courses workshops training sessions MOOCs whatever that they've taken it's also a big problem for employers who don't know what their employees have learned and it's a hard job for people who are looking for new employees new recruits to know what they've done when there's no good way of putting all your refuge in one place LPS s is about centralizing the learning records around the individual to did the learning putting the ownership of those records in the hand of person and enabling that person to share those records with whomever they want whatever records they want third Express create and show what you can do learning isn't passive learning isn't sitting there watching a bunch of videos learning is about working with people creating things interacting with environments with simulations with games with tasks with challenges it's about creating things whether they be articles videos blog posts electronic diagrams case studies and then showing what you can do taking the things that you create the problems that you solve and sharing them with members of your own community or with members of the professional community that you want to be a part of learning is about sharing as much as it is about consuming content and so LPS s is directed toward that and finally using your learning to make your life better there's no point well I you serve as a point to learning if you're not making your life better but generally people are trying to make their life better they're trying to achieve employment they're trying to win contracts or new business or very small and medium-sized enterprise they might be trying to get project funding whatever the idea here is to be able to match what you've done with the opportunities that are available for you out there in the world so that there's a direct link from what you want to do what learning you actually do the things that you've created your learning record all the way through to obtaining that position that contract that project funding of your choice so that's the concept in a nutshell it takes a lot of technology to make it work if it was easy it would already be done if it was easy you'd have it now so here's how we've approached it at opss first of all we have the model where the learner is at the center and then around the lunar are the various services I've used the ten hundred word model with all due credit to XKCD for for that kind of expression but really if you look at it on the upper left hand corner your LPS s system needs to connect to the external world stuff comes into your system like courses like videos like messages from your friends like directives from the corporate office whatever stuff goes out messages you send videos you create blog posts you write case studies whatever then there's stuff you keep which I've called the closet that's your online storage right pictures books movies you just pile them up high and and you're there if you need them but you don't carry them around with you all the time then there's the playroom the playroom a is your personal learning assistant your playroom is where you do stuff your playroom is where you actually go play with the simulation play with a game try to write a piece of software maybe make something with lego whatever you can imagine and LPS s helps you do that opss provides what we call scaffolds to support you in that activity and then finally in the lower right I've called robot wisdom here because I was limited to ten hundred words right was the analytics of the system that's the smarts of the system that's the bit of a system that looks at what you've done and tells you that you might be interested in doing this or it looks at what you've read and tells you you might be interested in talking to someone so does a lot more than that but that's the basic idea if we look at it in more detail we get the major elements of the opss system that we're building on the upper left-hand side resource repository network so this is what we call the harvester or the aggregator it's an engine it contacts web pages services etc around the internet or in your digital environment it might not capture an RSS feed it might read a list of courses from Coursera or EDX it might connect to your email there's a whole range of things that the resource repository network can connect to and the RRM brings imean and helps organize that for you then it goes into your personal learning record and you notice the personal learning record here is represented as a graph the idea here is that we have what we call the personal graph which is the record of all the resources that you've looked at all the activities that you've undertaken the people that you've talked to the events that you've attended and it's not just a great big list but they're put into context with each other so you know what's related to what so if you look at one thing you can see the other things the cloud storage I mentioned we use existing cloud storage systems that everybody can use around the internet things like Dropbox Amazon Web Services own cloud which is a way of storing your cloud storage in your living room and so on learning assistant is the thing that connects LPS s to other resources to other systems it might use lti2 lots of learning resource from EDX it might access a SCORM compliant learning resource and show that it might connect with the third party to rules such as a simulation engine we've connected opss with the neural touch simulator for example and it gives us information about these environments the place the system that we're working with what we did with these things captures this and helps build our own personal learning record and then finally the analytics I mentioned earlier we do some pretty technical stuff because we have some pretty well established and knowledgeable analytics expert shares we do things like entity recognition for example where we look at a page a blog page say and are able to identify the entities it refers to in the text in order to help build that graph sentiment analysis automatic translation text analysis to look for patterns look for concepts competency detection to see what experts in the field actually are doing in their learning so we can use that to inform us about what novices should be doing in their learning we put all this together and this is a key point it all works together it's not just a harvester it's not just cloud source storage it's not just Pinterest or just a social network it's all of these things together taking these tools that were traditionally available only to the enterprise traditionally available only to colleges universities hosted web sites packages them and puts them into the hands of a lunar puts them into your hands to use as you want to use them here's the simplified design of the system again it's the same sort of concept but you see there's a central part which is LPS s proper which is the stuff that we make but really the key here is that it connects all of these external things the external repositories external cloud storage external application api simulation systems whatever and external analytics and services so that you don't have to have all of that processing power on your own computer in order to take advantage of the capacity that computing power gives you today here's another way of looking at it this is the way we've set up the projects inside opss so we have the RN project the pc project eats etc each one of these doing some of the tasks and they are broken down into some very specific tasks like data information retrieval itself cleaning information representing the information and building the repository of content which will go into your personal cloud Davis incarnation synchronization etc for cloud the search recommendation layer the data capture there all of these are elements of the technology and if you want to see this in more detail hey this is a video you can freeze the frame and read the text we can go and we do go into even more detail in each of these major areas here's the resource repository network represented graphically for example look at the different kinds of information that are out there on the internet right now that you use today email blogs and and Flickr pages SharePoint repositories Facebook Twitter monster.com for job opportunities government repositories learning management systems etc the RN brings that content into your system and then analyzes it looks for entities and then stores it in the graph the graph is made up of different types of things are those photos videos people authors publishers job opportunities competencies etc even certificate if they're spelled wrong they're still in there it's a bunch of different entities that we store in the graph we relate to each other so that if you're looking at one you can see what's related to that thing that you're looking at your personal learning record has three major components and a bunch of minor ones it's an activity record if you're doing something on an external system like again a simulation or a game or an external learning tools such as a quiz you create an activity record that activity record is stored in something called a learning record store and Pilar manages your access to learning record stores it also manages your portfolio the artifacts that you create papers you write for us to take etc the evidence of your work and some of that evidence includes badges certificates credentials and competencies this is a rapidly changing environment and there will be other kinds of records of your learning in the future it takes all of these and represents them for you and you can manage these and export these as your own personal CV or export these into job search services etc so that you can project your credentials into that third party site your personal learning assistant the idea here is to collect the contextual information for the system if you're working on a simulator like this narrow touch simulator it captures that information and stores that is part of your learning activity it also displays the resources as I mentioned the score more learning technologies integration it provides authoring environment or or or ten plates etc to help you create and manipulate data and it even helps projectile PSS capacity into external services an example about is the tool kit that you can add to your web browser so that LPS has travels with you wherever you go on the internet so finally we have cloud services which is the places you store your data and LPS s has mechanisms to create and maintain your accounts on these services access what you've put into those services and then put new contents into those services and then learning analytics and I want to talk a little bit about learning analytics because again it points to the value of taking a personal learning approach traditional learning analytics are focused around one platform say EDX and across many people and the result is you get data about many people using one platform it's very shallow and it doesn't really tell us about the person a lot of these systems use this kind of data to make predictions it does that by clustering people together getting demographic information and making predictions but it's shallow and really in the end it tells us more about the platform than it does about the person we're interested in deep learning analytics deep learning analytics focuses on one person and it tells us about that person and it gathers data from that person's usage about a number of different systems Facebook Twitter at X Coursera YouTube blackboard email etc now obviously we can also create a hybrid type of analytics merging both shallow and deep but that's a bit tricky and you don't get there without the deep analytics so it's only if you have a personal learning environment that you can do deep analytics and so that's the kind of analytics that we're trying to do in support of opss the take home again with the technology that we're designing a lot of the stuff that put into the slides here is built some of it okay a fair amount of it is still projected to be built it's in the work plan it's what we're working toward the take home again the objectives of the system are to enable you to learn anything from anywhere with anyone to keep all of your learning records in one place where you own those learning records and you can share those learning records in the format and to the recipients that you choose where you can express and create show what you can do and store the things that you create in your personal cloud and share what you create with your friends with prospective employers with the world at large and you can use us to make your life better using analytics deep personal analytics to match you up with job openings that you uniquely are qualified for or for funding opportunities or contracts or programs etc totally up to you and that's the end goal of LPS s is to not simply act as a teaching system but rather to act as a learning system that helps you use learning to accomplish the things that you want to do in your life i'm stephen downes thank you and we'll see you again
