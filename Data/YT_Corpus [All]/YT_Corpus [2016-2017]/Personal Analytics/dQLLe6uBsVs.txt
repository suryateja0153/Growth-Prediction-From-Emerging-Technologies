 so hey everybody good morning welcome welcome thanks hungry here so this session is all about analytics all that good stuff hi I'm Andy as you can tell by my accent I've come a long way to be here today all the way from San Francisco I'm a member of the distribution team here at 500 startups where I work with the portfolio helping them you know you folks grow get more customers prior to 500 I launched and ran stripe in the UK for a couple years and before that I had my own startup which I co-founded as the co founding CTO group spaces that was a 500 startups portfolio company that I've built up and then built down again when it didn't work out so my one thing there is when you sign that contract make sure you check the terms of that investment agreement to make sure that if your company fails you don't have to spend the rest of your life working for Dave and Christine cool so there's one thing there's a lot of great content so we're really excited to share with you today if you do me a favor you know as it often is you know with these presentations if you could take out your mobile phone and make sure you've turned it on open up Twitter Facebook and get sharing tweeting you know going crazy if you like it's a so if you disagree if you want to heckle me I've got my Twitter profile up there but but great to have you engaged today cool so right into it so analytics wait what why I like to start think about this topic with like what do we measure and why so there's a lot that we can measure about our businesses vanity metrics revenue metrics conversion rate you know the pirate metrics which hopefully all familiar with you know the thing is we need to know how we're doing as I colleague Dom on the distro team I heard him once say like if you're not keeping score there's no point playing the game right we need to know if we're winning or not so today these tools make it super easy to track things and like over the past sort of five or so years there's been a great development in tools like Google Alex Mixpanel Localytics thanks awesome partner KISSmetrics branch metrics really great platforms to make it very easy to track things collect lots of data but they also make it really easy to fall into a couple of pitfalls mistakes I've made and I want to help you avoid so becoming overwhelmed with too much data focusing on the wrong things so you know typical challenges if we start by just installing some great new analytics tool and like collecting everything we very quickly start drowning in too much information you know a big pitfall is failing to select and focus on the top metrics that matter and then discovering we're not tracking the data that we need in order to later on answer key questions about our product or about our business right so how do we avoid falling into these pitfalls um I like to think about there's three things that we want to do with analytics so the first one is to know overall with our business how are we doing are we growing is the business healthy are our KPIs on the right track so then related but very different is zooming in so the results of our experiments that we're doing sort of week to week we want to be able to measure those so that we can learn from what we're doing you know the incremental things that we're doing the changes are they pushing us in the right direction and then thirdly there's this concept of what's happening right now so real-time if you like this I found very useful in the past the Mon sort of experience being able to like concentrate on whatever I've decided to do this week safer the knowledge so there's something great or terrible happens from left field as so long as I've got the right you know set up in place so that I can focus on it and so I'll know when that happens so for example something great maybe we're featured in a blog post that we didn't expect and get a huge influx of traffic maybe we want to quickly scramble to like switch our messaging and you know people often do it if they get featured on producthunt when you click through there's like little banner like welcome visitors from products hunts what can you do to really capitalize on that on the flip side if something bad happened so for example we've been working away iterating our product and it inverted ly breaks something like break a key step in our signup flow so we want to have the sort of visibility of what's going on across our business in the corner of our eye so that we can regain that confidence that we can keep focused knowing that if something big happens we're not going to miss it besides that I would actually caution against the lure of the real time if you look at like Google Analytics is real time view it's sort of very captivating like all there's someone on my website that sort of stuff is typically not that useful a part to verify like is my website up like is my analytics working right so typically it's number one in number two that are most important so diving right into that so the first one overall how is our business doing and I like to start with this by saying right above everything else identify one top-level KPI right so this is the the attraction metric that defines how our business is going and it's hard to do actually and this is just you know anecdotally from working with companies you know there's so many things going on so many parts of our business it's often hard just to pin it down to one and the thing is right if we pick the wrong KPIs and we're screwed you know if we put KPIs and then ignore them we're also in trouble but here's the thing right so if we pick and monitor our kpi's diligently but we don't assess that everything we do and everything a whole team does around on the basis of whether the things we're working on day to day and week to week are the most effective way to drive growth in that top-level KPI that matters right the end of day we're still screwed so this is super important to identify what are we really trying to achieve on a daily and weekly basis so how do we go about this and you know the good news is you know if we just zoom out we can keep it simple it's probably like a predetermined answer for what's your ultimate like top level KPI based on what type of business you have so ultimately you know it's money and like eventually its profit in the near term it might be revenue but in the earlier stages maybe we're not focused on revenue or maybe we're pre-revenue so how do we think about this so this predetermine answer keep it simple if it's commerce number of sales so subscription business SAS or you know consumer subscription your number of subscribers if it's a marketplace number of transactions the key thing here is this is like the one number that if it doesn't grow over time there's only so long we can kid ourselves that we're moving in the right direction right so start off with that one number and say okay get comfortable with how you're focused on just driving this one metric and then theory goes if we can increase this one number then revenue and profit will come so once we've got our top level KPI the next thing I like to do is add some new ones so it's super critical to get just one number at the top so that just one number giving us focus but that typically doesn't tell the whole story so I like to add maybe one or two more nuanced metrics around that just so that we can understand the whole picture so for example if our top level KPI for a commerce business is the number of sales we might want to understand okay but what's our average basket size like average sale amount like how many unique customers do we have so for example if we've got one loyal customer that orders like a whole bunch of stuff from us you know that's pretty good but it's not as good as expanding our unique customer base right because we'll get a bit sort of unbalanced in terms of you know having a lot of our attraction coming just from you know one or a small group of customers so you know average amount number of unique customs we have these are sort of good nuances to understand the full picture behind whatever our top level KPI is in a marketplace it might be you know how many we've got how many transactions but how many suppliers are actually fulfilling those transactions and is that sort of scaling nicely or we sort of quite concentrated there so once we got the top level KPI and we've got the new ones the next step is to figure out what are our drivers so the drivers are the things that we can work on to drive growth of our business and ultimately drive growth of our top level KPI so for example for a marketplace if we want more transactions we could get more suppliers or you could get more customers put them together hopefully there's the quiddity and we end up with more transactions the key points about drivers is you know when we get up out of bed in the morning and we come as the office we typically do not work directly on increasing our top level KPI right we don't work directly on more sales you know that's an output if we were running a market store you know we would work directly on more sales if you're like hey sir madam come here roll up roll up you know buy my products right that be literally what we're doing but when we're in the tech world you know we're working on other things so other examples of drivers so supply and demand top of funnel driving more traffic more downloads conversion rates getting more first-time customers versus getting more repeat customers to come back all the different component parts that we could get more growth and then finally beneath it all we end up with a full funnel so thinking about the pirate metrics everything from your acquisition all the way down and yeah you went you end up with the full funnel um so what I suggest you do and actually we'll have some time to go through this this afternoon put it in a spreadsheet and I've actually got a template example to make it really easy for you example here put it in a spreadsheet so what we've got oh laser pointer very simple columns along the top for you know deep weekly periods and you can use this weekly or monthly and then down the left-hand side just lists all your metrics the top-level KPI at the top and some nuance beneath it and then down below the things we can drive in order to drive that growth and then you simply fill out all the numbers in the middle and this spreadsheet template you can find it a bit li / KPI - sheet it's a Google sheet and what you can see here in the sort of the green and the red is just some nice little sugar on top to make it sort of you know pretty so you can help interpret your numbers so why is this important now first of all it helps you know get us really clear about understanding you know our funnel of what is our top level KPI and what things we can work on to drive that there's some other key benefits as well so things you should do with the spreadsheet once you created it review it on a weekly basis you know and share it with the whole team so that everyone in the team can understand what they're working on whether it's product development Kuster support you know sales and marketing how their particular tasks contribute all the way up to your top line growth set targets so you can actually fill out in the future specific targets for things you want to want to achieve and this is critical so what I encourage you to do is in any given week have one number so one metric so one driver so you could say this week we want to get more visitors to the website or more downloads more top of fun or this week we want our one target to be trying to increase our conversion rate you know at this step in the funnel and by writing it down setting a target you can focus what everybody does aadmi everyone does on the team around achieving that and I for every company I work with they are every time most successful when they do this one number one row this week this next two weeks we're gonna hit it it's it's some kind of magic and the other thing is you can use this when you set the target to actually help you predict and prioritize what to work on because if you think you know you can fill out the number if we're here we've got an example of like some actual numbers but if go through and say what would happen if I changed one of these numbers here and you can actually say how would it you know what were the knock-on effects be working all the way up so you can say say I worked on this conversion rate what would be the impact on my top level KPI how many more sales would I get what if I increase traffic from this channel what would be the impact it would sort of filter through my funnel and then how many sales would I get and so you can use this to prioritize where you should spend your time to get the biggest impact it's just invaluable and as I said we'll have some time this afternoon to actually work through and make a start about creating this for your own business great and so the key thing as I saying is then focus on the weekly you know look at this weekly and focus on your week a week or month or month growth in your one metric that matters so what is your one metric that matters so if we think about we've got our top level KPI which is our ultimate ultimate ly our business traction you know sales transactions subscribers one metric that matters is the metric that you choose to focus on so that's the metric that you've decided will have the biggest impact in your growth by focusing on that and setting a target this is really informal I don't think what's got some volumes just take it down a little bit so there's a really useful blog post that's linked from the slides will be shared with from the folks who wrote the lean analytics book that's incredibly detailed about how to choose your one metric that matters so I won't go you know through it in detail here but the key point is figure out what's the most important metric for you set a target and then focus in on that great any questions so far cool no moving on so other key metrics to think about besides the growth of your business cack LTV - hey where do you know that you're spending too much time and maybe on too many metrics for that excel sheet versus taking action right when'd you get analysis paralysis when are you spending too much time looking at the numbers versus actually actioning stuff great point thank you for asking so what I encourage people to do is in that sheet fit it all on one screen you should have like 15 key metrics once you've broken down the top level and then your drivers it's quite simple it's like top of funnel conversion rates you know different sources so it shouldn't be a big overhead right the key thing and why we tackle this in the first week is give you the framework so that you can be up and running the important point is back to you know my introduction it's like we need to understand how we're doing because if we don't understand how we're doing and we're executing we could be executing in any direction and that's typically actually god I've screwed this up with my startups just like the tenancy is got so many great ideas we push in all directions at once so we don't want to overanalyze we just want to get those 15-20 metrics so that we can pick one and it's actually more important to pick one than it is to pick the perfect one I'd suggest so by picking one we're going to maximize the impact we have on it and that's probably gonna help whereas in my own personal experience back at group spaces the tendency is it's like in any different week you could work on like six different things at once and you end up spreading yourself so thinly that you're pushing you only have so much effort time and resources you end up pushing in all directions so only you're getting a fraction of the distance and because you're spread so thin you're actually being very wasteful so while I'm covering here today is stuff that we shouldn't you know maybe spend a couple of days on upfront you know get the basics and get it so that on a weekly basis you can just spend 20 minutes per week reviewing the numbers and that 20 minutes is incredibly well spent to ensure you're on the right path and so you mean working on say one part of the funnel one check that matters for like a few weeks and then you know by reviewing the model when it's time to switch to another area because you can see that the whole business all at once yeah that sound good yeah so a little bit of work upfront to like figure out what all the metrics that matter and then the key thing is yeah spend about half an hour once a week just reviewing zooming out right in the day to day we're in the details it's slow provide water like zoom out and say hey what are we trying to achieve here what's our target are we getting there you know have we been working on this for long enough and maybe now it's either we're getting diminishing returns or it's time to start thinking about another heir of the business that may be more important sighs you start thinking about dividing and conquering so repeat the question at what size you think about splitting a team up to divide and conquer so that different parts the team were working on different different metrics so you know it it's it's actually you've got to be really careful here fewer numbers is always better and so if it makes sense for the whole team to work in one direction I've worked with a company that's got a product out and their marketplace and they've got a bunch of customers and they align everybody product development sales around this one goal of getting new supply side customers sign up through this one channel and so the product people were working on like making sure the flow was working the marketing people working on driving leads and the sales people were working on converting them like they were kind of flat for about five weeks they spend one week all working together and they doubled their number right so it really works as you scale you will be dividing up into multiple teams that's a call you got to make and then you've got to make sure that each team has one metric but I've worked at companies of like eleven twelve fifteen people where everybody out of given time is just working on that one number hopefully that example shows how you can actually get everyone working together cool so moving on to other key metrics so you may or may not have be favored these co CAC LTV churn so these are sort of from another angle key metrics to understand how our business is performing review this very quickly and I've got some foreign resources if you need to read up on them but I want to make sure that you're all aware of these and have developed a great understanding so customer acquisition costs how much you spend on average to acquire a customer including your paid spend on marketing we're also including other things that you may not think about like if you're you know you've got sales people on the team cost of their salaries lifetime value on the flip side is like you know how much revenue or eventually how much margin you're making on an average customer and typically the theory for LTV is like in all time for that customer right so if you if it cost you a certain amount your CAC to acquire a customer how much money are you going to make from them you know as a result and generally you know if your LTV is bigger than your CAC then you're in business you know if your LTV is smaller than your CAC then you're on a limited term venture funded Joyride right the money is going to run out and typically people say if the LTV is greater than about 3x your CAC then you're in a good business so for early-stage what I encourage you to do is don't worry about the specific numbers but worry about the ballpark right you want your LTV the value you're getting from a customer to be substantially greater than the amount you're spending to make sure you're in business so don't worry about calculating this every week this is maybe something you look out on a monthly or every couple of months and you don't need it to the nearest cent but just sort of are we in the zone here and if we're not maybe you should be thinking about prioritizing doing things that work towards you know at least getting profitable with you you know your unit economics as we've gone to other key metrics alongside LTV and CAC though a key one is your payback period so if you haven't heard this term before the payback period is how long it takes you to get back the amount you spent to acquire a customer to Ric keep your CAC so why is this important this is important because you know your overall business performance could be you know good or bad depending on like the ratio of your LTV Chilkat but your payback period determines how fast you can grow and how expensive it is to grow because if your payback period is long it could be many months or years in the in case of like enterprise then you're going to have to raise money to fund the growth of that business because you have to spend that CAC upfront and then you'll only make that money back and breakeven a long time in the future if you can bring this down and if you can get your payback periods you know incredibly short like for e-commerce if it's your payback period is you make money on the first sale that's fantastic because you can immediately reinvest that money into your own growth and you do not have to suck up to investors right so super important in terms of controlling your own destiny the other key thing here is the magnitude of your numbers and so it's just the other thing to keep in mind along side you know how you know whether you're profitable for a customer or not so compare enterprise you know where the numbers it could cost you even tens of thousands to acquire a customer factoring in many months of sales people salaries right but over time you could make hundreds of thousands if not millions from that customer so it's still a good business but you might have to think about funding the gap as I mentioned social you know the numbers could be dollars or cents even and so the key thing here is factoring in not just on a per customer basis are you making money but thinking how many customers in total do you need to make an absolute amount of money how many customers in total do you need to make a million dollars in a year right and so if it's enterprise you may be you know it's kind of obvious right but you only need a few customers versus social and it's like good just stepping back and just checking we're working on building our business but if we if we end up where we're aiming for is that a good place to be so just you know doing the back of the envelope numbers so calculating your cross requisition costs you know a very simple approach to start with just take your total spins and divide it by your total sign you may have heard this you know quote before from John Wanamaker you know half the money I spent on advertising is wasted the problem is I don't know which half you know when we're starting out it's okay at least we get an idea for what our overall is including across organic signups right then you can start getting more sophisticated and breaking it down by what's our paid what is our CAC for a particular channel right so over time we get more sophisticated make sure you've got the basics there first um and then on LTV sorry question yeah don't overthink it to the earlier question don't get bogged down in trying to calculate some there is Sun just don't make the mistake of leaving out significant costs or pretending that you don't have like so estimate upfront and then you know figure out whether in the bull pack ballpark so yeah as to make man hours and then in six months you can revisit it when maybe you've collected more data and you have a more accurate accurate picture there another question no cool so LTV the thing is you don't have a lifetime of data and in traditional theory about lifetime value people talk about extrapolating out your LTV over time right so the thing is you know I say that there's only one way to know your lifetime value right and that's to kill your customers it's the only way we can know how much revenue that customer is going to give us in a lifetime so I don't recommend that surprisingly so what do we do about that and people often find this little tricky so two things one is measure your actual lifetime value per cohort so for each group of users how much value how much revenue whatever how much margin have we got from them actually so you just sum it up so we had a hundred people sign up last month what's the total revenue we've gotten from those folks compare it before and then you compare over time and you can say you know after one month we have this much revenue after two months we have this much revenue and we can sort of extrapolate that out and see where it's going to you know is it kind of linear if we're a subscription business where we get the same amount from a customer every month does it kind of trail off maybe in an e-commerce it's a big spike at the beginning and then the question is are we going to get repeat orders or not key thing there keep grounded it's very tempting to say our customers gonna be with us for five years right you know though going to be super long they're gonna love it so our lifetime value is going to be huge it's good to have that prediction but keep grounded with what the truth the real number is so far and keep tracking that every hopefull same question for advertising face models so for advertise basic models you mean about how you measure the value you never get a great question you should probably look at both right so you should look at you know for if your advertising base is the question like do you look at which any any marketplace actually where you've got two sides so an advertising based model you can think about as a marketplace where you're just connecting like attention with brands so you've got supply and demand right so you probably want to look at it on both sides and you can do that by saying okay first of all let's look at our our users are you know the people browsing our site interacting with our content how many of them do we have how much time are they spending overall how have I monetize that and then on the flip side the brands over time how much do they spend with us because it's gonna be relevant on both sides when you're plotting out your user growth over time and also plotting out you know how much a brand is you're gonna get from a brand or an advertiser and like how many advertisers you need to get to get so much revenue so on a marketplace you want to look at it from both sides and then you know put the two together know your definitions what is M RR stand for monthly recurring revenue it does not stand for my really awesome revenue if you have revenue that is not default retained if you do not have someone with their credit card on file that is going to be billed again next month unless they cancel it is not recurring too many people think ah Mr R it's my revenue right get it right otherwise you know you'll make a fool of yourself in front of your destroy points of contact and investors gmv what's gmv gross monthly revenue you DMV is simply like gross merchandising value right the key thing about DMV so if you have like a marketplace the DMV is like the total sales the total amount that your customers are paying right very different to your revenue so if you take a 30% commission your revenue is 30% of gmv two examples the key thing here is you know don't be dumb just SWAT up there's some two great posts here from andreessen horowitz 16 starix and 16 more start-up metrics that may not necessarily have been how they wrote the title but i 500 branded it super great just make sure that you understand these 101 stuff cool right any more questions so far I thought I'm gonna go on to talk a little bit about analyzing our data cool all right this is where it gets fun so I want your I want your thoughts here I want your feedback here is a chart for an example business right here is an example business's monthly sales and if you're anything like me I have in the past walked into my monthly board meeting with a chart that looks something like this what can you tell me about this chart is this business doing well what do you see revenues growing over time shallow right so we don't know where actually whether this is number of units or like you know revenue but something's growing yes if this is unit items right then we don't have the full picture here basically right so if this is number items but our average basket size is going down yep what else some is a bad month okay why is it a bad month it went lower is it about month that could be seasonal you know I guess the question is what did we expect at the back right so we don't know if there's one order that was really big and everything was flat it's not showing churn it's not showing number of orders it's an incomplete picture right so one key point to take away is you know just like one metric isn't the full picture on what's going on just in general though if you were walking into your board meeting at the end of March and this was your chart would you be feeling happy yes yes hands off yes hands up for know hands up for you I'm still awake hands up for yes I'm gonna keep going round and ZUP for know someone said hands up if you're not gonna raise your hands okay cool so I mean like overall it's growing right so okay so here's a second ago so this business has gone about things in a different way so they've chart is there sales as a daily number instead of that monthly bar chart so for this business what what do we see here like and what's interesting about this chart and daily numbers those actually goes down or close right it's the super holiday so it goes right down in the sort of holiday period right is that what you meant yeah what else and for ourselves because it goes up on Mondays right Enterprise buyers more at certain time could also be consumer actually I work with a fashion company where they have a massive spike on like Sunday evenings actually I another for so for fashion ecommerce so there's a really big fashion ecommerce business in London when do you think they're peak time for purchases in the week Friday any other guesses someday shout I can't hear you Sunday evening I thought it would be like it is Monday at 11 a.m. people get into work they're like oh crap the week what am I gonna do to make myself feel better go online and bhatta myself something nice that big transactions Monday live now okay cool what else is interesting about this chart it's very so I got like a week please cycle here at sacred pool yeah so it feels like there's some weekend effects it's this business thing all right if this was our business and we were sitting here but this is like you know what they are today how would we be feeling someone who wasn't a friend here would we be feeling good no why not you don't know yeah I think it's going down better a downward trend here what people agree with that or not yeah okay anything else oh right I can start right yeah sure okay so if you haven't realized yet it's the same data right so I've just plotted it monthly and plotted it daily I want to show you a third chart where I plotted the 28-day rolling total of the same data yeah so what I've done here any point on this chart is the sum of the prior 28 days so this smooths out the chart and lets us see sort of what's really going on so it actually highlights yeah we've definitely peaked and like the rolling sum is now getting down compare back to the monthly chart where I've been in the situation where you walk into your blood meeting right the King ah it's great I'm growing it's awesome and why am i pick 28 days yes yes so four weeks good point so I haven't picked months for a couple of reasons one is because as we've seen there's a weekly cycle so if we did a monthly period we'd get an uneven number of things that we do you know as we went so I recommend this technique for pretty much any metric we're looking at trends over time averaged over seven fourteen or twenty-eight days so that you smooth out the noise from like the daily chart but you don't lose all the data that you know you lose if you get a monthly chart this is right there's another point about months right so like February actually looks worse than it is right febri is actually awesome because it's a much shorter month so this is your are kind of since February is like you know midway between but actually we can see here you know the shape of how February had really strong growth some other really useful things to imagine this is a commerce business right and say maybe we're hiring temporary workers to help us with shipping our products before Christmas when you think about my capacity planning so here you know we've wrought we're monitoring the trends so bring your minds and every day every day goes by that chart is revealed so we know exactly when we've hit our peak on the flip side we know exactly when we've bottomed now or we started growing again so super useful so the takeaways I wanted to leave you with here about like viewing your data in different ways using these rolling songs avoiding outdated information right so whether you have bar charts that are like a long time period you end up looking at data that's like three four weeks old makes things of that just having one view of your data like hopefully you saw that did three different views actually showed you know very different signals and then another couple of things like if you have to make manual calculations all the time you can get really annoying so hopefully just get your spreadsheet thing just pissed off in and view the results and this one key thing you know hopefully we can see that monthly bar chart if you have bad metrics it actually leads you astray so don't be Andy going into his board meeting thinking he's growing all right um any any questions on that or anything to add cool I have another couple of topics to cover this morning that are super important so questions back say so for business and the challenge annually to do I don't think I'm the experts answer that question so let's come back to it where do you want to join okay cool there you go the power 500 thank you great so growth accounting what the hell is that something I just wanted to run past you so any metric we've got monthly recurring revenue could be monthly active customers you've got your key top-line metric you end up with a chart looking kinda like this so if you think back to that first bar chart I showed you a lot of the feedback was it's not the full picture we don't know what else is going on so growth accounting is this very simple method we can use that understands behind you know a monthly change in our metric this shot looks very nice doesn't it I want a shot list like that okay behind that change what could be going on you know again the question is is this business healthy and it seems to be growing right so seems healthy it's very simple we take a metric wake up monthly recurring revenue and instead of just looking at the change month or month we look at all the components that make up that so when it changes what are the different things that can drive change so we break it down so each month we can get new revenue from new customers we signed up or we can get reactivated revenue from customers that were previously turned and we won them back via expansion revenue from upgrades up sales right so actually all this stuff contributes to increase in the monthly revenue on the flip side we lose revenue or we lose active users through naturam when people leave or cancel their subscriptions or their account and we can also get contraction if people downgrade their subscriptions right so the key thing here is this is one example for revenue including upgrades and downgrades we could use this for active user count where we say okay what's a monthly or weekly actives but how many of those were new how many of those were you know one back that previously cheiron's how many other did we loose and again we could get the same top level growth with very different scenarios happening behind the scenes so it's critical to understand you know we could get good growth by being awesome at signing people up but by losing pretty much all of them as long as the difference is positive we're still growing that's not a good place to be we should probably fix our products maybe they don't have prime market fit alternatively we can get the same growth curve by only signing up a modest number of people but by keeping all of them right that's a very different picture we have an amazing product people love it we just need to double down on acquisition so growth accounting split up into the components that make up your key matrix parts monthly revenue or monthly actives and understand a big picture cohort analysis who knows of COBOL analysis half the room who doesn't know of COBOL houses 1/3 of the room here understands cohort analysis five people Calvin says is super-powerful you should all do it it's very simple I'm going to take you through let's start by saying why is it relevant take any metric any metric you're measuring at all this example here active users it could be any metric that we measure it monthly or weekly that's great and we want to know if we're improving over time the problem with this is that any metric were saying we've got the percentage of our users are active any metric where we're measuring it over our entire all-time user base is going to have problems the reason is that as over time we get more and more and more users that sign up in the past that just haven't been around in ages like early people where there wasn't a fit they just haven't logged in and so we're trying to measure whether we improve our products and that has a good effect if we're factoring all these people that didn't even see the improvements then that doesn't make any sense and the key point the effect is that we end up drowning out any change we may otherwise be observing right and so our overall like metric sort of is you know any change in that is lost in the noise so cohort analysis is just a simple technique to fix this problem so what we want to do is we want to figure out over time if our user behavior is improving if the product changes we're making are making a difference if we're getting better over time so we just take the same data and present it in a different way very simple you just divide your users up into buckets or cohorts so there's just groups of users and typically you choose groups based on the time they signed up all the time they first purchased right and so we say before it was like what percentage of users were active in January now it's all the users who signed up in January how many of them were active one month later how many of them are active two months later so for January it's like the blue line is February and the red line is much for the February it's like how many people sign up one like where active one month of the signup sets the blue line here is how many were active and watch so actually this blue line here on this red line here is the same period of time it's two months after sign up for January and one month to sign up for February and so by doing this we're restricting to measure that metric just over like the relevant group of users and so over time we can now if this this draws out any change that may be happening so say we're improving our product so we're trying to figure out whether we get an improvement in activity and we can see okay maybe we didn't make much improvement here maybe for March the March cohort we made some great improvements that made people stick around for a month but there was actually no effect in them sticking around in the second month so they saw like initial interest got better and that dropped off over time and then here we can say oh but actually the products improvements we made by April and May we're actually driving longer term retention of active users super key concepts basic approach group our users per time does there are how many questions on this say again sorry so typically a good place to start is weekly cohorts or fortnightly or monthly cohorts right so you just regularly in the habit of looking at overtime are our users you know improving in their behavior is our conversion rate going up or our metrics getting better and so it's related though to a/b testing so you could use your cohort bucket buckets by which bucket of the a/b test did a user get exposed to and it's the same idea then you'd only have two buckets right and it's the same idea like which bucket performed better over time but if you use like month weekly or monthly cohorts typically the people in that cohort may have been exposed to like different product changes what you're really measuring is the output of all the things we're doing are we moving in the right direction so that makes sense cool at the back different groups that you can put users into if I understand correctly the main one is the time of signup or the time of their first action and that'll be you know 90% of the cohorts you use another example is the different buckets of the a/b test people per typically don't think about that on the title cohort analysis but it's exactly the same thing and actually this afternoon when I talk about tracking will have a lot more examples about all the different parameters that could be relevant here so I'll come back to that later if that's okay yeah geographic so if you've got users in different geographies they could behave differently another way to think about it is this you're expanding into new markets your behavior of new markets is probably gonna be very different to behavior of places you're already like saturated or you're already well-known and up and running and so basically anytime you average anything over your entire user base that's a bad thing averages suck right because they hide the detail of what's going on underneath so avoid averages and break down into these cohorts so that you can figure out the different behaviors that make sense cool all right so there's oh I'm done fantastic so it's like analytics is all about knowledge it's about understanding how we're doing and knowledge is power confidence and sanity good luck you
