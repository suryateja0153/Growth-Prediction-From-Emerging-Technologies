 hello everybody and I know that I'm standing between you and lunch so I'll be brief what I want to do today is to give you the perspective of the small guy we had the larger company sitting here and talking about the perspective of India and us interactions from the perspective of the larger companies but I want to give you the perspective from the viewpoint of a start-up right and so what are my credentials for doing that I've been working with startups in this space of marketing analytics for the last four years and have been scientific advisors for three such companies and two of them are actually startup started by Indian expats here with operations back in India now one of them unfortunately is not in existence anymore but I did learn a lot of I have a lot of experience as to why it failed and and one of the reasons as to why you know we are having a situation where there are opportunities but there are also lots of challenges so I just want to run through a few slides to set the stage for why marketing analytics and why startups in the area of marketing analytics so if you look at marketing analytics there is tremendous growth opportunity in terms of you know the size of the market and I will talk a little bit about it and also for startups and you will find that many of these applications that come up in the marketing analytics area are going to be fueled by smaller startups who have very innovative ideas and they are going to be heating up or acquired by larger companies as the experience shows so I'm going to also compare Indian IT revolution with the analytics revolution that's going on and and that has some special challenges for startups that are based here as well as in India and then I also conclude with this future scenario as to what's going to happen so then you the new marketplace as we about you know we already know that emerging digital and again the panel talked about it there is a lot of innovations going on in that space we have print radio TV social media and digital versions of all the above and proliferating sales channel and devices and you know some of the exciting things that are happening are on the last line their mobile smartphone tablets smart watches virtual reality all right and this is the space that I'm talking about where startups are contributing in a very significant way and again we have finally the era of big data and internet of things and expect those areas to also you know feel a lot of start startup activity very soon if not already now you know there are some details about why big data is going to make a big difference Mackenzie's report in 2014 talks about it and if you look at the application methods that they talk about applications and methods are the basic area where you will find a lot of activity and that's where the startups will start making a lot of contribution and you know if you had to look at marketing analytics and all the technology revolution that has taken place tools today you will see that this is actually the era of the CMOS right to see your era as you know passed the sea or more era has come but if you were to really make a comparison and say well things are going to be the same as what happened in the CIO era you'll be mistaken and I will tell you why that's not so so these are some of the growth opportunities that we have in terms of this is the IDC report that came out in number 2015 so they talk about Big Data technology and services market growing to about 50 billion by 2019 and this includes infrastructure software and services and if you look at software and services that in foods marketing analytics software which is about 2 billion CRM analytics about 7 mobile analytics and if you look at the applications social media marketing email marketing SEO marketing pay-per-click marketing display video content marketing and so on now of course this has got the eye of a lot of Indian companies Indian companies in India trying to make a play for the US market and in fact I was there last year at a nasscom conference that was held at hyderabad where they were focusing on big data and analytics and looking to see what was the you know role that Indian companies could play in this space right and if you look at the startup opportunity itself I am looking at us now there are 323 marketing tech so I am looking at this particular area of marketing technology right and they were about 323 marketing technology startups which got about 100 and about 11 billion dollars from VC's in 2015 right and there are total of about five thousand startups in this marketing technology space in the US now in the towards the end of 2015 the ad technology sector started taking a beat so the investment in those technology has really tapered off very fast but if you were to look at the other you know areas you find that there is a tremendous interest from venture capitals in all these different areas all right now where exactly does US and India startups come into play so these are some of the models so the startup listening in the US started by you know typically Indian expats serving the US market and then they have India back office operations right and of course this was not started by these startups but you had companies like syndicated market research forms like comscore IRI now already doing some other work back in India because they had qualified people who could do a lot of analysis for the service work they were doing in the US so this is one example and then there are some interesting startups which have done really well in the SEC sector which is mu sigma which is also started by some indian startups chicago-based visual like you is another company which was started they have back back office operations in question and you find that this is a very popular model which people have adopted because there is a lot of technical support that they can derive from india and you know look at the markets in the US which are much more advanced as compared to the indian market now the second startup model is Indian firms in startups which are typically started by Indian Americans going back to India and starting these companies and focusing purely on the Indian market right now a good example is this company called honza equity CX equity which does CRM type of work with large Indian companies package good companies Hindustan lever PNG and so on and then you know the two of the people who actually started this company are from here went back and started this and their focus purely on the Indian market and then you have Indian firms in startups which are looking at both the US market as well as the Indian market alright this is the typical IT industry model where the IT industry really started working with Indian companies and then you know started coming up here so what is the situation analysis so as I said startups typically are started by Indian expats in the US back office operations in India building and scaling the business and and that is a very costly you know proposition a cost of setting up these startups are very easy low barriers to entry and so there is a intense competition for you know these companies and some of the early start ups were acquired by US companies Google and adobe acquired many of those companies starters start up started by the Indian expats and many other startups now which are still you know in play are about in the 100 million sales level and they are kind of stagnating at that level and I'll tell you why you have some problems there now if you were to compare this with how the IT revolution took place Indian IT revolution took place in the US the IT industry was looking at very mission critical applications right and the budget for these IT services were coming from the operational budget of companies so what the companies used to do is to come in here have a foot in the door and then start growing you know so started looking at how can I increase it to 5 4 10 4 20 fold over time and if you look at their business models it was you know repeat business was a big thing ninety percent of their business in the growth came from repeat business with the same company that they were working with and ten percent of them came from new acquisitions right and of course they have you know they still have very good homegrown talent who had experience working with Indian companies and so this easily was transportable to the US market and aided by the fact that you have very clear standards and specifications with which you need to do this work right so the result was there was a tremendous growth for the Indian ID revolution now if you were to compare that with the marketing analytics revolution that is taking place now there is a big difference then the difference is because marketing analytics is still now seen as a discretionary spending by US companies all right I made a lot of fun business development message with some of my startups going and meeting with some of these companies and and what it really comes across is that it is not needed at this point this is something that they will look into but they could probably do without it at this particular point and so they are a little gun-shy in committing and also there is no easy standards or procedures you know typically marketing companies CMOS have tough time understanding what is the quality of the service or the application or the product that they're going to get because you know there is no clear standards and specification like you have an IT services and and these applications are tend to be very new across different kinds of psychos right so US companies are more in the R&D mode at this point with respect to marketing analytics and then there are the sales cycle is fairly long three to six months all right you have to make visits and try to close it the closing doesn't happen if it does happen it takes quite a while and this is not just true for it just the Indian startups but it's true of any marketing analytics startup that's in this space and another issue is selling custom service rather than modularized product tight version of service and one of the reasons best why we find many of these companies are stagnating at the 100 million level is they are very service-oriented that means they start a project on crm they'll ever put lot of people they'll have to hire people back in india and some ways from here in order to maintain that account and then they get another account in the crm but it is customized so they really cannot take this and you know transport it and get and learn from this and you applied there and so it actually doesn't scale up very nicely right and the other issue is about marketing analytics talent in india now this is something that I've had personal experience with now there is great talent in India in terms of data architecture and system development but there are a few that are you know in the running and you know there's a lot of competition for these few guts you can you can easily acquire some of these people but if they feel that the work is not very exciting they leap right and so the very critical p these of people that you need back in India to help you build products marketing analytics products is difficult to find and also the talent there is not about product development mindset it's more of a service mindset so if you want to really develop products that could be modularized and sold and scaled up it's not all that easy and another thing that i found was about marketing expertise the marketing domain expertise is available here but people back in India who are working on these systems really don't have this marketing domain expertise right and so much so that people from us have to be hired and sent back to India in order to work with that team so that the team's Allah knows exactly how this application is going to be used alright so so the main many of these companies that I talked about have this problem because once they start growing and they come to about 100 million and they want to hire more people back in India they really can't do it because there are no more really good people that they can find helpful and thought leadership is also lacking especially in the area of marketing analytics customer acquisition customers are in the R&D more like I talked about compared with a kanay ERP system or something where repeat businesses abound in marketing analytics generally it becomes a one-shot deal all right so you get a project you work with the project and after you finish the project and you want to upsell and cross-sell the opportunity is not there and they are looking at well we'll come back to you later so the customer lifetime value compared to the IT you know industry and the ID customer is much lower in the marketing analytics space right so just to touch upon you know one of the companies that I work with failed due to lack of funding and of course the problem was that you know we were working on an application which was a little ahead of time and it was tough to convince the marketing cmo's to really adopt it and they will be the first few to adopt and so I think by the time you know the we had a 30 people back in Hyderabad working on this and so we had to you know pull the plug just last October right and there are the other companies which are working but they have been more successful in trying to get you know they are not profitable they are successful in getting orders but again you know they are limping along but what we actually found was that in the marketing analytics pace since the applications tend to be very very different if you already have a foot in the door a big company like Google really can expand their footprint in different applications very fast so they acquired companies like a dormitory which was a start-up and then you know they are they actually go and acquire lots and lots of different companies which can provide and as a result Google can go in and provide a suite of different applications which a start-up cannot the startup tends to work in a particular silent right but you know I don't think everything is bad because the future looks pretty good and why I say that is this rise of master's program in marketing analytics and business analytics in computer science AI so there are lots of Indian students coming from India getting educated in our school and other schools and so the idea is that even if ten to twenty percent of them go back to India you will certainly have a large set of students who are well-versed with the techniques and even working for 23 years here and going back so you will certainly have this talent pool increasing over time and as analytic you know analytic products become much more mainstream down the road I'm looking at next three to five years it's going to get into a sweet spot where I think many of these applications will become a very very commonplace and as a result of that I think with increasing talent back in India you can have different kinds of models possible now the e-commerce in India right now you know startups like Flipkart another are in the mode where you know many of the American companies we're here from V sees that there's a lot of investment going on in these startups and the startups are spending money like crazy they are not making any profit but they are going for market share and so that's what happened here too and so pretty soon they will need analytic services and in fact some studies have shown that the support services would be needed in 25 different categories where these companies these ecommerce companies once they become established in India they will start needing all these analytics so you know suddenly the model number two will benefit okay which means we will have more of Indian companies looking at Indian markets with talent brought back to India and it could also help model three because I believe that innovations in the Indian market context are going to increase you know I have personal you know I have a nephew who was from MIT worked for bein for two years went back to Mumbai and started a start-up very confident about you know being successful there and I asked him so why did you leave and he said well you know the next generation of innovations in technology is going to come from India and he has a terrific team that is working with and he's looking at the social space now the social space is going to be a terrific opportunity for Indian companies because the penetration of social media and India has become tremendous it's very high and it has bypassed the usual common forms of communication as to how companies use in order to communicate with customers so social is going to be a big innovator in India and I think we're going to find more of those innovations coming here and being used and transported to the US so finally that I just want to touch upon you know the craft leadership thought leadership is on the right with the exchange programs that are going on as an academic I can talk about a lot of interactions that we have with Indian business schools and with the new innovations and methods using cognitive computing and deep learning and I think there is a pool of you know expats in Silicon Valley who are creating something interesting and in fact if you go and go to this Indian startups USA website you will find there is a lot of activity going on people are trying to meet up and figure out what kind of startups can be done which can benefit markets here as well as in India all right so that's about what I have to say and if you have any questions I can take it otherwise we'll go have lunch you made a comment about leadership okay bottle marketing domain expertise was the phrase you use so I'll ok bring that up back to you so I guess my question is you know there are many leading indian business schools and there are lots of large US and other multinationals that have been doing business in india for a while so you know to my mind that is a pool of talent for marketing domain expertise do you find them not getting engaged yeah tech community so you know typically what happens is in the startups you know the people that we tend to attract are the ones that have graduated from schools and willing to engage now and i don't know whether this is true or not been in any in india if this if people are already you know in a you know well known company there isn't much of an incentive for them to leave they leave that job and come to startups and that is why i said we're in the startup area you really don't have much talent certainly I wouldn't put down Indian companies I work for some Indian companies and taught us for example so talent is there but the idea here is marketing analytics you know talent understanding how the applications are done and trying to bring it in product development so that's the kind of talent that lacking yes so you talked about people studying here like in business analytics and all and going back to India to research market and doing a start-up but in terms of like social and cultural landscape India is totally different from the US so can you give an example of people going from here and Adam take to adapting to Indian market and like applying their skills there yeah it's just a good question the company that I work for you know scientific advisor I work work for Smith School of the deans here so so that company essentially they had two people who had come back all right for different reasons one one was water to back be back in Hyderabad and be with family and so they so they were working in that company and and and they were very good they were working here for a couple of years or three years and then they moved back and so what I'm saying is I don't think all of the Indian students are going to move back but there will be a sizable number and they will they will i also have a cousin who was working for the yahoo he moved and became a vice president for supply chain in flipkart and and so you know he you know he was here for a long time and he thought that this was the right time to move and he moved and so what I'm saying is i'm looking at anecdotes and i can see that there is a lot of interest in moving back and you know working with startups and i think at particular point in time and it the the you know the the point at which you will make the decision will be different for different people but i'm i'm pretty sure you will find a lot of people going back and you know getting involved in startups and other indian companies
