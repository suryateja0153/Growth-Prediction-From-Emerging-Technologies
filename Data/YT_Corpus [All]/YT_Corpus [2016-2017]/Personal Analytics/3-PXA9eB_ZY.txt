 alright so today we're beginning relatively difficult very hard chapter which makes it relatively much harder for me to teach and explain it goes by right and I'll do some writing over here by data mining and data mining let's see what we have here is focus on understanding better your data trying to find out various address in the day to try to find out different relationships ah the first big thing is data data exploration you try to explore the data just see what it is and hard to make that exploration is what may be called data reduction the second biggest part is classification you can also say data plans if we patient how you classify people users consumers whatever the third part is called Association how can we figure out based on your characteristics how to form different groups having a three people being friends here and six people being friends over there for example maybe those guys out there on the back their joint line not very interested to study right or deposit maybe those up front here sit together because they're eager to learn okay oh maybe these two guys sitting out there are joined together by the passion for macbooks right so they both have macbooks make it all help Lexus's right of course so somehow they are together but is it their passion for books or porn exorcist or for racing bikes whatever joins them well same thing will be for consumers how consumers will choose this problem with that part in other words in Europe would like to say hey are you a BMW Barry what we're saying this guy right what kind of car you prefer out there and these are the typical choices for us usually you know we're coming that Lots hours and hours our jeeps are sorry it's all of the phrase association and I'm before is cause and effect and it caused an effective similar to association cause and effect will be what we discussed last time in classes somehow we have a society is that eat tons of fat and I want they're not very fat animal tooth and I want heart disease and they got major societies their own eats a lot of animals they'll keep alive that but the people are very fat and they got the standard heart disease the standard time he is so cause in effect the effect will be go in our case disease sins and cause is the bridge is it fat horse or is it junk all right or worse that without a discussion afterwards well maybe fats are causing or bars of the cost but now have two types of hands on it good fans all right so now you get tons and tons of statistical data which is very peaceful yeah and the question now becomes well which are good fast in which all are bad facts so you're trying to get the cause between bad fast and easy is good past and health but at the same time we try to classify classify what would we look good and what would be okay of course that's using statistics you could approach of the problem very simply easily with a common sense and we call sense it's a lot easier hey what how we have humans with wealth maybe for immunity what kind of fast human 843 the answer is saturated fats and still worth any other fats I cooking homes were non-existent for a place now they were existing so for 33 million years we've adapted to saturated fat and we have not been adapted to but yet this is a statistical hypothesis using common sense is a statistical hypothesis hypothesis that animal fast and saturated that are healthy because we've been adapted for three years and that's vegetable oils being a result of chemical factory investor-owned products for barely six period years we have not been able to adjust in down in there for they're probably unhealthy again that's a statistical hypothesis so one way to run the hypothesis is to classify now back into saturated and not saturate or any more fans the bull facts and then try to determine cause and effect so you can run classification you can run alright that's good enough let's see what we have well been given the same things on the slide data exploration and production number one classification is number two remember classification maybe sometimes context you may use common sense for classification unit evil science okay but classification sometimes cannot use common sense life which students are unlikely to graduate from university in which students are not likely to graduate of course we may have ninety five percent of the students are allowed you to graduate only % will not graduate well how do we have identified the five percent do we look into their attendance and based on attendance do we look into their GPA or do a look into where they sit on the back being busy with their phone symbols both sitting on the back end alright so come over up front so i can see you there the one on the back yeah yeah just you look yeah i just am I alright so how do we determine to win the German imbibe where they sit for your petals or in classification we'll find out there is a major correlation between where they said in their hands those people that usually don't attend a lot they usually say under that all right and there's a correlation with a lonely people so turns out we can find various characteristics and they would be similar ok that's the classification and similar with association what determines and analyze natural Association all right let's try and move on so you should do basic data exploration that's number one yes he is not very good for data exploration but SPSS you have a commercial version is very good it's got tons of graphics in versions graphics and Excel actually do have some good graphics so when it comes to graphical analysis data exploration it may be that Excel is a little traitor than PS BP but not better than spss spss is the commercial commercial version it's ten times bigger it's also expensive to have an SPSS about one dollar store copy but it's an expensive software but still works very well so you can use what they have is Excel line and they give you well here's the worksheet this is what you do again if you decide one day that you need some of these things anything is it makes you can probably also use with Excel by simply following the screenshots again to powerpoint slider afraid it available so you look so a sample worksheet and whatnot in things and stuff and it gives you some results and it tells you what it is again for data visualization you can use it different charts different types of charts you know with these little bars and what's the ranges of months of whatever being employed and being being more than you see single guys and usually more months of being one so we basically use different visualization types so this is one of the many dozens of different fashion charge you could use a parallel coordinates charts again that's not what I'm trying to teach today but I'm trying to each today I'll get off of slide 15 for example go you know you got all of these different visualizations what it looks like you can also use scatter plot if matrices so it got some variables over here there goes over here here is what the scatter plots look I so you can visualize your data in hundreds of different ways hundreds of different ways it can use one of the same type of chart in many different ways into sliced eyes and visualize that they just use your eyes in the data is beginnin art in itself and then of course when you have certain outliers against the same old story what do we do with those again variable plot it is just unbearable pause again a lot of different things at the bar charts and all the elements of just slice and dice things ok you can look by months of past glory to look like a live by credit risk high low you can look like whatever the job is at one point single whatever so you can look at your data and guess what is the relationship that you may actually need well that's the one thing if you live in the real world one of the more important things is dirty data especially when you do marketing sales data survey data even financial market data sometimes the data is missing that's very very very common any data is missing you need to figure out what you have to do do you delete the day and you just delete the whole room maybe just delete the whole observation ok you just ignore again but maybe you will plug in some mean there maybe you're not in the medium fair again you may have different approaches but one thing is sure if you have dirty data you gotta clean it up so the two approaches to cleaning up is number one the data but deleting the data can introduce bias okay for example you ask a lot of people certain question and let's help the people 10 people did not answer but it may be that they had reason not to answer to me makris or a personal reason so the data was empty or black the value was missing because there was a true genuine and on the court possible rate for example ask people about divorces and what was the cause of your divorce in strength this was my fault and sir p it was and then I didn't answer right maybe didn't answer because it was his fault right so there may be circumstances where when I honest people they don't want to answer because the answer is inconvenience or they don't like the answer okay so that's the case for missing them well you may have missing values let's say training you got markets we discussed in it is a in the West End wanna make a correlation between trading in the market and journeymen Asian mark is anyone to get a correlation for diversification well today whatever many mind the Chinese might expose you will not have them just because it's well that's okay so missing day the soul you need to decide what to do I'm gonna need the whole name or gonna put last yesterday's clothes okay now I had even weirder stuff ah I love maybe early holiday for the weekend and Saudi Arabia is Thursday and Friday on Thursday don't know what I'm on Friday them and they working saturday and sunday now i work in bahrain the kind way they were under the holidays friday and saturday but sunday is a regular birthday so now you're trying to correlate the arab markets in their open on sundays but western markets are closed on sundays and then on let's say friday the Western market is open but the let's say middle eastern market is closed whoa what do you do you're going to get set of dirty d alright so salmon how you need to use common sense or technique some way you need today you need to figure out how to approach that again it's important to understand that there is no one single perfect way to do it will depend on why the data is dirty what's the cause what's driving the dirty data maybe it was not recorded maybe someone mr. okay and get all the respondents ages hundred and eleven years maybe not right maybe they just miss okay alright so now that I spent 25 minutes on all these introductions I have two specific topics to cover topic number one is cluster analysis which is also take the segmentation is a collection of different techniques number of different ways which we use to grow or segment the people so how divine this class into groups or in three groups or five groups if we need to make different groups how I'm going to do it again have different it may be male female the city the province of Nationals or yours GPA about 3gpp 03 sitting up front sitting on the back ok so Oh tribal dances of maybe the characterization could be simply are running on Android like Samsung Galaxy vs. kinda fun having of Windows laptop versus again let's go right so somehow we need to group the people if we need to separate them in three groups how are we going to do that so that's cluster analysis we try to get them into subsets 63 route 43 on the clusters someone's within each cluster are sampled how more both with really so cluster in hierarchical clustering you can use a collaborative and the other one is device the picture looks like this in a glimmer of the methods you take the whole thing actually fell short and along with it you take the at the bottom okay and then you say well maybe are closer and then in dr no closer he is close ok invisible ambiences coaster so you need to divide it into two clusters again we will get together AB&C movement that's the one cluster in deities will be the second time in a divisive method its Chavez it we take a b c and d and if you spread them into two clusters you're going to get a DC in the DP even in three clusters it may be a b-1 Lancer DS the second plaster in to see is the third class alright so everyone is only in one classroom if you need for maybe you can do a B C okay or maybe you do a b c d you need to separate an attitude for classrooms so the approach made up down or now come approach well if you have a cluster you need to have a definition of similar does it mean similar similar is defined by some sort of a distance the business between sitting in charge so you made it very similar just because your setbacks or you may be similar because have long it will go here or maybe similar because both have similar right that's a singularity or maybe because you drink the same kind of drink again depending on how we define singularity singularity is defined by the characteristics differences is it distance so we usually use in mathematics and statistics a standard distance so we use the distance between points is called your premium business is defined in a very simple way just not to study in your geography just 82 points and you measure by the coordinates okay so that's a basic way to measure distance now things get fairly complicated if you have distance between two points it's relatively what it is now things get a lot more complicated when a distance between groups of camera here is group a okay and out here is groove be how we measure distance between groups is not here it's very clear-cut we measured between two points a and B distance is usually divided by the shortest is speaking to be in a straight line well here we can use this that's what which one so one way to define business is say well we take the closest points and that defines distance between a and B so this was between a and B this is going to be a 3 and being 7 so this would be the distance between two cents but distance will be defined by the two farthest point you may define distance between this one here and this one he will give you the largest or too much fun all right next why we're all waiting longer to move this could be defined you take for these the center you think this is going to the center so of all the points you in at the middle point ok and then of all the points here you get the middle point and you take the distance between the middle and then you may use some sort of weighting scheme so that's what these guys are basically single image you know nearest neighbor the distance between two groups is defined as the distance between the closest pair of object so this first one will be things 8337 complete the distance between groups of the distance between the most distance pearpod so it's going to be this bird around here this or the film you could use the main values for each variable to compute so very different ways and the problem is basic that you may define distance between two sets in different ways and I have to make a basic choice of course if you define business currently you will get different results in different clusters okay but you use one of them and please try to see what happens using one of them is better than doing nothing anything a clustering for colleges and universities you ask well what do we want to classify want to classify my school type and then we use the median as in examples what not and we try to not see the different schools by some kind of and they give you here well this is what it is and this is what it does continue to cluster whatnot and let's see select the number of clusters sometimes if as the data well given what happens masters sometimes we usually determined up front how many clusters we pastors we need men we just need to prospect maybe we need to be within 10 again sometimes we'll know up front how many clusters we need sometimes what we may have to do is let's pick three clusters and see what happens there must be five clusters and see where I may be big ten clusters and see what happens but we usually use the number of clusters that we give it up front for the calculation and went into the calculations it gives you some data whatever the variables are you do some job stuff and you can get a simple chart if you got a dividing two groups here you use hey this is the one growth on this end and this is if you need let's say more groups here is one group here is a second group here here's one group over here again somehow the software will be hide you and give you the different groups and eventually going to get the data the key the final result will be something like this for all of these data the first one is cluster IE number 47 ones plus ready to pass ready to pass 33 11 2 for one so basically the software gives you which observation belongs to it plus if it students which is good and belongs to which drew again we don't know what the group is we still have to look into what unifies the group is it the way they sit is it the GPA isn't the kind of car again we don't know we'll have to look into the naked to find what determines that monster what is that thing that makes people too similar to each other so that's on clustering we have and I'm trying to remember a simple of command which is I think it's called a simple plan sir cluster there is big man called cluster in our regression maybe I can try I don't know if I can do this thing now over here office I need to software if I need to open the PSP p manual okay and in the PSP p manual remember you got open clear the statistics oh ok there it is oh it's not coming up ok let's see anyway I got its gold let me write it for you quick cluster quick cluster is the Canadian that you will use you will see the syntax it just says give me two variables you can be the to a criteria in terms of number of clusters maximum iterations what you do with the missing values and then trim them okay it very simple very easy very straightforward it will take between one and two minutes to work so we just gotta say hi pretty master needs a placid can ask trip today again you have to be careful have huge Gator with thousands of observation and just drink all right so that's number one let's see what else I got in here back to the next will be classification methods classification which I don't classify categorical outcomes into one or two more categories so in classification the key is category the category maybe win or lose it could be in the stock market make money who lose my the classification the category me maybe graduate from school not graduated from school the category may be married or single okay well we can use a completely different categories that's very common of unfortunately in the West for married women have child doesn't have a job maybe is the career if she's got a good high-paying job in a career she doesn't have a child because she don't want an average okay that's one case now the more common cases ah maybe she wants the childhood can't have it covered too fat and sometimes not being able to conceive okay these things do have so the category could be any kind well it's possible that three categories okay one single married divorced it's possible that drake quotes normal have three categories okay well the three categories for those nice back there the two main categories will be yes ma'am book pro macbook air or just the brand new 12 inch macbook which is not crawl in which is not there now have three levels throw err can just back up to 12 days right so these are the three categories the question is if your netbook guy which one do you choose you choose here or the scheme like the 12 inch super skinny alter life okay so how do you determine the well the categories would be well in this particular case they've categorical instead of when it could be Android and iPhone ok that's a single category well of course the category could be car ports this side again tons and tons of categories let's move on and see what we got in here so decision maybe a poor credit borrow or muscle bone or have a house doesn't have a house or decision oh cool credit reject prep again you can have lots of different variables so you try to figure out what the relationship is and try to classify different ways let's see what's going on classification matrix players training I need to go into what is coming up next class accommodation all right here in classification okay camera have to rewrite again we have k-nearest neighbors so by nearest neighbors union classified use my records and that has similar numerical bed okay this is similar to the clusters like the same you can also use this criminal analysis and finally you would use logistic regression and logistic regression estimates the property but belong to a category using for the rational cricketer fair now so software's have this driven analysis some softwares have gained nearest neighbors but we're the good news is that we don't have the first two we got only logistic regression which means that i'll jump through these first and i'll go straight to logistic I see where's my over here we just go through I think so k nearest neighbors they give you examples examples examples examples then discriminant analysis this is what it is all sticks again of his criminal classifying using the discriminant analysis how to classify the discriminant they give you and finally we got about six or seven slides and maybe five or six minutes for logistic regression logistic regression is a variation of linear rivage so we so I'm of linear regression good defender their voice categorical so in a linear regression you can have a standard variable like what's your GPA be pointing 8.9 or 2.2 so it could before what you went 60 kilograms or 247 so you can have a continuous variable or the categorical variable will be with the course will fail so that's a category and in our case the categorical variable with logistic analysis is buyer made only to back home too so just the Canalis doesn't work with cars it's not gonna work with the macbook pro air if you have three houses it won't work okay it may work with married not me but won't work with three maps so just be cool analysis can help I only give the variable an interest past two bears that's been working to understand it is a statistical transformation whereas yes in know you will calculate a probability for yes and you'll calculate the probability for know you got one probability for yes one probability for know the probability for yes who call me well because in the probability for know is 1 minus P and in order to make mystics works nice you will take the log of P and there is some property in this p 10 what I just want a standard linear regression of the log probability erations the probability ratio p divided by 1 over P is called the odds ratio I can explain it like this let's say the chance is for one is eight percent in 11 speed is twenty percent the ratio is 41 okay that's the simple wish well it is fifty percent and 1 minus P is 50% the ratio is 112 the ratio could be 1 to 100 it could be 100 150 so the ratio could become pretty much a positive okay and when they take the log this is how the odds ratio when I take the log a lot of any positive number will be converted converted between zero asian one and that's how we'll just regret it is still a linear regression of the odds okay and then you solve Oh Baba software does the solution for you the software that solution you see what it is and they look at basically what the results are it tells you what is the coefficient for each variable and based on these cognitions you can calculate later on the probability the probability hello macbook horses hair of a single versus Meredith of a graduating student versus of any students and you can use that data what have a new students already have somebody else to determine is this person likely to buy and one fall or likely to buy it I so or is this new student likely to pass or likely to our exam him well let me just give me one minute are 20 years ago 22 is 93 94 the University of Delaware was making a research they are running master's program and he comes and when they run the master's program in economics they are admitted you know the comfortable area and they hire all much of all areas trying to see you know to ms a master's degree so then it may be under t and are these hundred people 80 people will fail very quick in eventually eventually 15 people will graduate when you graduate during the students by performance and you check the indicators which will indicate the success of the student the indicator country their GPA from undergraduate this is a monster it could be there english language skills it could be the training entrance ok so when they ran the statistics to figure out what was the determined to success in the best determine the success they discovered that the best determine of success was a 20-minute interview where Professor gender University of Delaware Greg and gave a score on each student and his score was the best correlation with the performance of that student per year so you can run the most sophisticated text can't compare to the judgment Jeff you know you can take the GPA of undergraduate degree for all years and it can't compare to the keenness judgment again if any one session agenda so this is an example and up trying to get an association because in effect is maybe another hear of the regression was called just one last minute if you remember let me try and see the regression was called logistic let me take that he user was it that here is called logistic regression so basically for the current chapter you need to learn how to use these to connect but also there is a cluster window and of course there is a logistic regression window you can use the window strength or to just write the code itself either way you should learn how to use it what it means and how this chapter will be doing the problem holes do it faster again which is the aggression
