 the future is the ultimate unknown there's no more coveted knowledge then what's gonna happen but isn't prediction impossible the only thing certain is uncertainty the weather can only be predicted so well human behavior no less unpredictable does this field introduce a question of credibility by virtue of calling itself predictive analytics that's a credibility question that I'll address partway through my presentation I'm going to introduce predictive analytics describe how it drives value across business applications across industry sectors by way of what I refer to as the prediction effect which is that a little prediction goes a long way then I'll take a look under the hood a bit about how predictive models work especially in terms of what I call the data effect which is that data is always predictive and then I'll touch upon an advanced topic which is optimizing for persuasion or influence with regard to operations such as marketing analytically so how many people here know or have heard of Nate Silver many okay there's no more famous person of prediction in the United States no better known prognostic quant than former New York Times blogger and political poll aggregator Nate Silver who correctly predicted at the 2012 u.s. presidential elections the outcome for each of the 50 US states so people ask is that predictive analytics does that count did Nate Silver use predictive analytics actually the answer is no but Obama did and this is a perfect way to exemplify the difference between forecasting and predictive analytics when Nate Silver did is forecasting for an individual state like Ohio he created a forecast of the overall trend across voters for the state with the state go more towards the candidate Obama or the competing candidate Republican Romney red is for Republican and blue is for Democrat whereas the Obama campaign analytics team actually rented a predictive score for each individual voter now you may have imagined or assumed initially that what they predicted about the voters was the voting behavior the outcome would they vote Democrat Obama or red Romney in fact what the Obama campaign did was more advanced a particular form of predictive analytics called persuasion modeling where they're predicting for each one will this voter be influenced by way of campaign activities such as a volunteer knocking on the door or of making a phone call and similarly to target direct mail is this a good door to knock on or should we not spend our time there and go and knock on this door instead that targeting of marketing and a presidential campaign is selling a presidential candidate it's a marketing campaign very much much the same concepts apply for driving rather than voting behavior driving commercial buying behavior this is what we want to optimize for so in a nutshell while Nate Silver competed very publicly he was on all the talk shows in the US multiple times late-night talk shows everything he competed very publicly to win at forecasting the outcome of the election whereas the Obama campaign analytics team competed very secretly to win the election itself so which is more powerful this speaks to the fact that predictive analytics empowers an organization not just to predict the future but to influence it by virtue of that defining point that it produces a prediction for each individual and those millions of per individual predictions directly inform actions treatment outgoing behavior of the organization for each individual so if we want to turn to defining what predictive analytics is well an informal definition is in the subtitle of my book predictive analytics the power to predict who will click buy lie or die so let me actually give you a quick elevator pitch this book is conceptually complete introduction that's being used as an intro textbook at 15 universities extremely accessible so any of your lay person uncles and aunts should hopefully be drawn into the thing however for those of you who are already experts the last three chapters address advanced topics such as the persuasion topic I'm going to come to that are new to almost all even advanced expert practitioners so let's turn to a little bit more precise definition of predictive analytics it's technology that learns from experience learns from experience by experience I mean data so you know data maybe not with this crowd but is often considered kind of a boring word right data it's deal-killer at cocktail parties I know from personal experience I have the data but that's because you forget data is actually a long list of things that have happened it's a recording and encoding of the collective or aggregate experience of your organization from which it's then possible to learn from it how to render predictions for each individual so each person gets a predictive score a number the higher the number the higher expected chance that individual will click on a certain link buy a product respond to an offer do something you don't want them to do like cancel the subscription commit an act of fraud commit a crime turn out to be a poor credit risk any kind of behavior for which there may be value for the organization to predict in order to drive all these decisions these treatment these outgoing actions so in a nutshell the technology at the center here takes the data in as input from the left this is number crunching pattern detection or some kind of regression fitting a fitting a formula which then comes out in the form of a predictive model that I depict in these slides as a golden egg and it's the whole point of that thing what's been learned that golden egg its job then is to produce the prediction so this golden egg now takes as input one customer information or any whatever it's a customer could be a voter it could be healthcare patient but the information about that individual one at a time and produces the predictive score so for example in marketing you're looking at a customer on the Left if we expend the cost of contact for marketing send them a brochure or what are the chance that tomorrow there'll be a positive outcome they're gonna buy the sneakers so the credibility question Nobel prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr said that prediction is very difficult especially if it's about the future and comedian Jay Leno how come you never see a headline like psychic wins lottery right so there is this question when we go around claiming we predict stuff it's it's very simple to establish credibility though the bottom line is really really simple straightforward you actually don't need to predict accurate in order to drive great value predicting better than guessing is oftentimes more than sufficient when optimizing the performance the actions of outgoing treatments on masse over millions of organizational decisions and tweaking that numbers games that organizations play and so let's make it that a concrete with a with a with a back of the napkin arithmetic example in marketing let's say we're marketing to these 1 million customers we're gonna spend two US dollars to contact each one so by mailing all of them it's going to cost two million if we assume there's a 1 percent positive response rate that's 10,000 positive responses each of those make us two hundred and twenty dollars so 10,000 times two twenty we got 2.2 million dollars in after spending two million to contact everybody so the bottom line profit is point two million dollars two hundred thousand dollars how much better would this marketing campaign get if we targeted with a predictive model so we have a prior marketing campaign where we have contacted customers some did and some didn't respond that's experience from which to learn analyzed crunch on that create the golden egg use it to score all 1 million of these prospects sort the list from highest to lowest take the top quarter so now you've got the top 25% predicted it's most likely to respond to contacted if now we target in that way we suppress the other 75% of the list and that way we're driving these in action decisions by way of the predictive scores and we do the same arithmetic if we only were to market to the top quarter right take the calculator watch same type of arithmetic its skyrockets the bottom-line profit by a factor more than 5 to 1.15 million dollars which is such a big deal it's such a dramatic difference that I actually paid my graphic designer who I paid by the hour to make this explosion star to de-stress myself as I'm a robot I don't have emotions wait a minute wait a minute this model isn't this model isn't good it's not accurate it's not telling me like a crystal ball this individuals definitely gonna make a purchase we don't have high confidence about any individual just three percent response rate three times average a lot more than average but still so this model really stinks but there's no denying its value so we can call this a skunk with bling that could be our new definition of predictive analytics it's a skunk with Bing wait I call that the friction effect a little prediction goes a long way predicting better than guessing oftentimes is enough to drive and improve performance and value when optimizing on math over many decisions in marketing and beyond so before we talk about a bit under the foot of how pritam all works let's talk about what is we actually need to predict defining the predictive objective specifically and to that end you know one good model for marketing is actually dating and conversely actually next time you're on a date you can look to marketing analytically to help optimize your performance because it's you you're you're not in the restaurant for food right it's a sales ball you're selling yourself I'm a dating coach so it's very important to predict ahead of time which outgoing treatment or methods gonna lead to a positive outcome and which might lead to negative L so how many people here saw the movie Groundhog Day okay mostly so Bill Murray here's stuck in the same day supernaturally living the same day over and over again he's in his own personal hell he can't get out he hates it well he realizes that this provides for having the unprecedented superpower to test different marketing treatments on the same prospect under exactly the same circumstances to see which leads to a positive outcome let's watch a forty second clip from the movie Groundhog Day you weren't in broadcasting in German believe it or not I studied 19th century French poetry whatever what's the time I mean for someone else that would be an incredible waste of time so bold of you didn't choose that it's a very very strong person yeah you weren't in broadcasting or Joan was amazing like that believe it or not I studied 19th century French poetry laughs he keeps him Ella see I've come for fair to say about Vienna I'm sure you speak French so the fact is there's no do-overs so literally then the only recourse we have is to predict which treatment would lead to a positive outcome but what is Bill Murray on the left here predicting he's not just predicting the outcome he's not just predicting the future the behavior of the prospect will she fall in love with me he's predicting which treatments which action towards her will lead to the positive outcome will this treatment choice influence her you actually predict influence to do influence in an advanced form of predictive analytics that I'm going to come back to and generally you're just predicting the future so let's look a little under the hood and of course naturally then we turn to Kung Fu Panda how many people here saw Kung Fu Panda and how many people here saw Kung Fu Panda and and don't have kids we should hang out like what so the old wise turtle said yesterday is history tomorrow's a mystery but today is a gift that's why it's called the present right well let's take a slightly less clever sentimental look at it pragmatically what do we have today in the present it's a resource to help us predict this unknown this thing on the right nobody knows it's impossible it doesn't exist yet but we have these two things in Pocket that already do exist to have the same relationship something that happened yesterday we decided to contact this customer we waited it around and then let's say earlier today we found that yes there was a positive outcome they bought the product these are both things in the past nothing to predict a learning example from which to analyze and learn produce this golden egg corresponding to one row of data everything on the dotted line was already known back when we would have liked to have predicted such as the customers male lives in California had made 10 purchases etc and then on the right is a thing the outcome the thing that wants do you want to predict that we found out later now this one row of data is one of many roads obviously in general one row per individual and getting your data into that form and format which is called the training table is the most arduous time-consuming technical part of predictive analytics it can't be automated because it depends on what your data looks like already so getting doing that whole data manipulation thing understanding the the state of your data now and its meaning and putting into that form where time is a defining element there because we are talking about prediction that's the most arduous it's not the rocket science part where you're produced in the egg but that ends up being the bottleneck technically the most time-consuming portion and once you do you can analyze it and you start getting these insights such as that at a retail store customers who bought diapers were more likely than average to also buy beer on the same trip often interpreted as daddy needs a beer your email address ha domain name which is turned out to be so valuable for many different client projects in this case what are the chances that you'll be acquired as a paying customer on an online dating site from 0.5% hotmail up to five times that probability based just on this one factor EarthLink is at the top here 2.5 percent that's the that's a internet subscription service so maybe it's our permanent email address Canadian Tire issues credit cards and looks at how good a credit risk is this person are they going to pay their bills on time with respect to what they've actually purchased using the credit card it turns out people who go to bars have used it a drinking establishment or worse credit risk more likely to miss payments but if you've been observed going to the dentist maybe you got your stuff together more conservative whatever you're going to be paying on time less likely to miss payments similarly by those little felt pads that go on the bottom of your chair right very important better cry risk go to the dentist and buy the felt pads I call this the data effect data is always predictive there's always something in there that effort is worth it getting into that form and format of the training data where your juxtaposing something you knew at one point in the path in the past right next to something that you then later found out later and you wouldn't generally like to be able to predict and that juxtaposition of this incredibly valuable thing you always find predictive patterns correlations that help predict every data sets got some value for all intents you could probably come up with counter examples but for all intents and purposes this is the excitement big data the big is about excitement and it's because data is experience from which it's possible to learn to predict when you put the data together multiple factors the email address did they buy diapers all these things together that's what the golden egg does more precise predictions and you get these great business results these three examples in marketing First Tennessee bank in the u.s. lower Direct Mail cost twenty percent improving the return on investment of the marketing campaign by factor of six large retailer target improve Direct Mail by 15 and 20% and premier bank card which is a major credit card issuer in the u.s. reduced mailing cost by 12 million dollars there's so many of these case studies in fact what's happening across business not just marketing but outside of business government law enforcement health care political campaigns etc it's taking such a strong hold and this penetrated so deeply at least in North America and Europe and it's only getting traction more and more worldwide predictive analytics has such a big influence on our lives as consumers as you walk down the street in your normal daily life our experience in modern society is dictated by how we're treated and served by all these different kinds of organizations and they in turn more and more are driving millions of decisions a day with predictive models in order to determine who to call male approve test diagnosed worn investigates incarcerate set up on a date and Medicaid so predictive analytics is definitely here to stay it's only gaining traction more it's such an important differentiator one of the last remaining significant qualitative points of competitive advantage thank you for your time wait no no stop oh yeah I have still got like three minutes left and I have to touch upon this advanced topic which for me is one of the most exciting things it's this influencer thing this persuasion thing right we talked to second ago about how we targeted marketing so effectively had this higher response rate and we're going to only expend the cost of contact to this segment if all these people responded who are green we're getting this really high relatively speaking response rate how could we possibly cut costs and be more effective and efficient and targeted with our marketing well there's this extremely surprisingly overlooked question in marketing all the time who of these green respondents may have actually purchased the product anyway could have been half it could have been these purple ones in certain cases the products kind of flying off the shelf its selling itself we could have saved all that marketing cost if we had somehow predicted not only who's responding but who's a sure thing it's like that love song from the 60s you didn't have to be so nice I would have liked you anyway you'd have to buy me flowers you didn't have to spend $2 on a marketing campaign I was gonna buy the product now it turns out there's a similar plot twist with regard to the other main analytical application within marketing which is targeting retention it offers so retention so important marketing you can see your customer base as its balloon so the new customers are always coming in from the left like air flowing into the balloon the attrition is that lost leaking out to the right if you could just squeeze that nozzle a bit and hold those people who are leaving at least some of them in decrease the attrition rate how much more quickly would that balloon be expanding that's the growth rate of your customer base the thing is is that to keep a customer who might otherwise leave around is a retention offer that can be very expensive in telecommunications maybe you have to offer an entire free phone not something you can afford to do it all your customers so once again predictions the only recourse in order to more effectively target retention campaigns you're trying to keep the customers around great but that doesn't solve the problem because it turns out there's another plot twist there's this backlash this inadvertent backfiring that can happen from a retention offer like this one and telecommunications the customer receives this brochure at home she feels incarcerated with her current obligation to the cellphone provider and this brochure reminds her oh my contracts up for renewal actually I'm free to defect heck with your offer and your whole service and this customer would otherwise have stayed around it's a sleeping dog customer we want to exercise the adage let sleeping dogs lie don't trigger customers to leave who otherwise would stay it turns out to very much the same exact thing demonstrable II came up with in the Obama campaign analytics team of course we didn't get any of the story till the election was over but they've been quite forthright with all the discoveries there were plenty of voters where if you've knocked on the door as a campaign volunteer you actually increase the chance the person would go over vote for the opponent which was Romney these were sleeping dog voters so this whole issue here isn't just predicting the future are they at risk of leaving will they respond if I contact them it's predicting will this treatment lead to a positive outcome is it likely to keep in the stay is it likely to get them to buy that they wouldn't have otherwise but not annoy them is it likely to get them to vote for our political candidate so the technology to do this is a very advanced thing I can only touch upon it for one second now I'll go into it a little bit more during my workshop tomorrow and the plenty of stuff online it's called uplift modeling and the Obama campaign called it persuasion modeling which is an okay word but it's also applies to healthcare you're not persuading a body to get better but it's the same concept it's about influence you're predicting influence in order to enact influence so we define it as modeling to predict the influence on the customers buying behavior that results from the choice of the marketing treatment from choosing this treatment option over the other one so instead of predicting for each individual the outcome the future the behavior what's going to happen what are they going to do are they going to get healthier which is what you might first think of with prediction in this more advanced form of predictive analytics we try to predict how much more likely is this treatment to generate the desired outcome so we're predicting influence of a marketing treatment in order to optimize the choice of marketing treatment so it's sort of if you're new to print of analytics this is super duper advanced because even people in the field for ten years haven't even heard of this but it's it's taken hold there's lots of case studies now more and more we're seeing where it does make a big difference for example tell noir large cell phone company in Europe based in Norway showed that when they did head-to-head comparison of the standard best practice use a predictive model predict who's at risk of defection and targets a retention offer that's the standard that's the best practice prior champion method and then the Challenger was the same thing but target with an uplift model so for example they're going to avoid hitting those sleeping dogs and triggering customers who otherwise would day a huge win especially in this case after phone number portability was introduced and people were more inclined or it was easier for them to defect eleven fold factor improvement on the return on investment the win from the campaign when moving from one old-fashioned freak of analytics in this case to uplift modeling so I've discussed three main takeaways the prediction effect is that across all the different business applications there's so many places you can use predictive analytics you can imagine so many different kinds of behavior to predict so many different types of masks scale operations to optimize by way of those predictions and a little prediction goes a long way predicting better than guessing is oftentimes more than sufficient to have a dramatic improvement an overall effectiveness over millions of decisions the data effect is well the great news is we can do that because data is always predictive we're gonna find these patterns these trends these correlations that help predict and enhance that golden egg the predictive model and then lastly I touched upon this advanced topic uplift modelling you need to predict influence in order to more directly optimize for influence per se for marketing marketing applications healthcare any kind of decision we're trying to make a difference and change a behavior and out external outcome thank you for your time
