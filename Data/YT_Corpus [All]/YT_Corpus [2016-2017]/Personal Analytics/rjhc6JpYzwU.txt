 ladies and gentlemen assuming they can hear me out there the Macomb School Texas MSBA class of 2016 please be seated congratulations to the graduating class of 2016 a special welcome to family and friends of the graduating class who've come from various parts of the globe to celebrate this occasion we know for a fact that we've got people from Singapore and Taiwan in India and it's wonderful we appreciate you making that long trip each year I've had the honour to say to the graduates that they're a very special group that they've set a very high bar for every future batch today you've reset that bar as our third graduating class and you've done it even higher in all dimensions GMAT scores GPA employment starting salaries but beyond those tangible and objective measures you've also set the bar high for a number of other areas such as collegiality teamwork classroom effort timeliness and as we as we learned last October you are not at all shy about letting us know when there are aspects of the program that you feel could be improved thanks for that and I'm sincere when I said thanks for that that was really really appreciated you've been a terrific group of people to work with and and to get to know and we'll miss having you around every day especially important though is that you have set a very high bar for other competing programs across the world numerous analytics programs have followed our programs example and our curriculum and several more will be competing with us soon we've had the opportunity to share our proposal and curriculum with many of these schools and we want to live by the adage that competition is good so thanks to you all we look even better than we did when we started out this group accomplished a great deal in just a few months an MS ba team won the usaa hackathon in the fall we had a team present present the results of their capstone data analysis at the retail industry leaders Association national conference in April and teams work on capstone projects that has significant business impact in the airline electronics and software healthcare and commercial real estate industries you've shown evidence that that what you learned in you've shown evidence that you learned in the classroom a number of key concepts and you've been able to apply those concepts in real business environments our expectations for you were very high as you joined our program and you've met those expectations and caused us to set new ones for your coming success we can't wait to see what the future holds for you we can look back with great satisfaction on the creation of this very successful program almost five years ago now I'd like to acknowledge the extraordinary team that made this program a great success doctor profit of Canada's vision and leadership in launching the program back in 2013 and specifically dr. Ramesh Raju Gopalan Hilary Patterson Lainey Hoffman and our student workers angel Lowe Gabi Leo and dang dinh their energy passion and commitment are unmatched I know how much they care for each one of you and they rejoice when you accepted our admissions offer I'm literally when we when we would get email saying yes I accept we would do high-fives you know fist bumps and they'd cheer when we we find out about a great job offer this program couldn't happen at the level it does without their hard work and commitment I need to add a special note on that commitment this past week we were able to celebrate a very special accomplishment of one of our own Hilary Paterson Hilary was named a winner of the presidential staff Excellence Award and was one of only a handful of staff people across the entire UT campus to receive her award and recognition directly from president fenves in a ceremony just a week ago congratulations Hilary were very very proud this program is truly interdisciplinary and it cuts across information risk and operations management marketing finance accounting computer science and engineering and I thank all the faculty members across the campus who signed on to our proposal to be part of this program and specifically I want to thank the faculty here today along with those who teach in the program who cannot be here because the excellent education we can provide through this degree begins in the classroom with you you are now our greatest ambassadors of our program and your success is our success we hope you bring talented students to our program come back to recruit our students and help spread our brand awareness for this MSBA program keep in touch come back often and we'll see you when you come back to hire our future graduates it's now my pleasure to introduce the chair of the information risk and operations management department dr. steve gilbert for some remarks dr. Gilbert is the Sam P Woodson jr. Centennial Memorial professor in business he has a BS in industrial engineering from the University of Michigan MS and industrial engineering from Stanford and a PhD in operations management from MIT dr. Gilbert's research focuses on coordination and supply chains especially in the presence of strategic consumers as you might guess he has heavily published in a variety of journals and is very active in informs and the production and operations management Society dr. Gilbert has served as department chair for AI ROM for the past year dr. thank you Mike before I started I'd like to say you know Mike acknowledged a lot of people rightfully so probative Ramesh Hillary Lanie and all the students I'd also like to acknowledge Mike he's the director of the master of science and business analytics program and he does a lot so thank you Mike so you all arrived here just 11 months ago and when you arrived I remember I showed up at the orientation and you might remember I congratulated you on a decision to join our program in the hopes of starting one of the most exciting careers that there is for these days at that time what I didn't tell you is that we were hugely proud that you had decided to join us you came not only you were all very smart you had very high GRE scores the average was over 700 your average GPA and your undergraduate institutions was above 3.6 so among all graduate programs you're maybe the smartest that we have so we were all very proud of you and in addition to being smart you were very diverse we have people here who are from places like Caracas and Shanghai and Bangalore and we also have some exotic locations places like Baldwin City Kansas and Albuquerque New Mexico I think there's only even some people here who are from Austin Texas so when you came I welcomed you and one of the things that I welcomed you with was that your time here would be filled with challenges rewards and excitement you might remember one of the things that I said to you I gave a quote from a movie that I really like it's called a league of our own it's a movie about a women's baseball team during World War two and in the movie there's a scene where one of the women is ready to quit and she says I'm gonna quit because it's too hard and the character of place the coach played by Tom Hanks Jimmy Dugan is his name in the movie he says it's a was to be hard if this wasn't hard everybody would do this and I wasn't trying to scare you when I said that but what I wanted you to do is think about the times that you would experience when you really had to struggle with a class or a project or some kind of challenge that you were facing so I hope it had that effect on you because it's not just in your graduate program that you'll experience times where you need to think about the fact that it's supposed to be hard things they're worth doing are often very hard so the other thing that I told you was I asked that you try not to be an island that you take advantage of the fact that when you're in graduate school you have a really unique opportunity to make connections with people who will likely remain connected to for the rest of your lives some of your best friends you have probably met while you've been here in graduate school so it's now 11 months later and now I have the privilege of congratulating you on what you have accomplished in these past eleven months and one thing I'll say is that you're leaving us to as many diverse industries and companies as the backgrounds that you came to us with we have people who are going to work in health care we have people going to work in finance and marketing and we have people who are even doing things like sports analytics some of you are going to work in very well-known large companies like IBM General Motors Deloitte Consulting Walmart but there are others who are going to much smaller innovative new firms like Revie onyx GoPro itter cysts so you're going to a huge diversity of places but hopefully you'll remain connected to your friends and peers that you've met here while at UT so as you go off I want you to know that you've been a true delight to the faculty you've made my job easier because our faculty really love teaching you and that's a you that's a nice thing to have for me so I know that you're gonna go off and I know you're gonna do great things I know you're gonna make the University and your your faculty here at UT quite proud of you so now it's my pleasure an honor to have the opportunity to introduce J Hartzell he is the 12th Dean of the McCombs School of Business he holds a BS degree in Business Administration in economics laude from Trinity University after that he came and got his PhD in finance here at the University of Texas at Austin he then spent a couple of years at New York University's Stern School of Business but then saw the light and came back and joined the faculty in the finance department here at UT in 2001 his most notable positions in the school include services senior associate dean for academic affairs chair of the finance department executive director of the McCombs school real estate finance investment center he's also established himself is a great and popular teacher in a world-renowned scholar dr. Hartzell holds the Centennial chair in business education leadership in the trammel Crowe Regents professorship in business and his research focuses on real estate and real estate finance please join me in welcoming Dean J hearts thank you very much Steve and and let me just say it's a delight to be here at the risk of going off script and therefore making mistakes let me just say a couple of things overall about the program first I wanted to add my own personal congratulations we're very proud of you we're very proud of this program I'm sitting at seated next to our senior associate dean Eric Hurst and when Eric and I and the rest of the school administration go around and talk about this program it's really become very very quickly one of the trophy assets of the school and really the University and both Steven might talked about the quality that you all have as students but I'm just so proud to sit and watch today and get to this is a really fun day I think for all of us to get to watch you walk across the stage and think where we've come from 3 4 years ago where this didn't exist and where we stand today and it's really a tribute both to you and I think to the faculty and the leadership as well so let me own thanks to probably of kunana your early vision on this project I think was was very much appreciated insightful and without you I don't think we'd be probably here today so thank you for that we're very excited to have Steve now as department chair and I'm sure Steve will continue this and he shares our goal for this program to continue to be the top and what it is you do and thanks is what a mic these things are Labor's largely of love as Mike keeps reminding me that he's not doing it for the money which we're grateful you're doing this for so it's for the love but we really appreciate it well I'm not gonna talk later but you know really Mike and the staff the other part that you realize and I'm glad that the Remagen the staff you put there one things you don't realize it as a professor really until you end up with certain kinds of roles is how great a staff we have in the Macomb school and you know Laney and Hillary they're they're exemplary in that in that regard so these things don't run themselves so thank you all as well so it's my honor and pleasure to join you both parents relatives friends of the 2016 class the MSBA program for this celebration during academic pursuits you form strong bonds with your classmates build trust across different personalities and extended your networks for years to come you brought passions your education a passion I am certain will translate to you success in your careers and into your future as you make your way it's my hope all of our hope that you will build upon that trust value and use those networks and reinvest that passion through your continued involvement in the school join the alumni network accept a committee placement serve on one of our boards give of your time talents and your treasure I would also like to take this point to thank all the individuals behind the scenes for those students parents friends spouses children graduate school can be an intense and very stressful time as I'm sure all of you would agree and I'm sure that some of you feel as though you went through this program as well as you along with your graduate students let's take a moment to recognize and thank those people here today who helped and supported you during this during your studies at UT our commitment speaker today is mr. Rob hi Rob is one of the world's leaders and artifacts artificial intelligence as well a distinguished architect and technical strategist for the long history and distributed system component models as the vice president and chief technology officer for IBM Watson hi leads the IBM team responsible for bringing cognitive computing to the world supporting the development of deep natural language processing and other cognitive computing capabilities in the areas of speech language vision and reasoning under his leadership Watson is ushering in a new era in computing and which systems are able to interact in natural language analyze large volumes of unstructured data respond to complex questions with evidence-based answers and discover new actual patterns and insights highest recognizes when the world's most exceptional technical professionals and was named an IBM fellow in 2008 for his pioneering work in the field of SOA and for his leadership of the SOA foundation it's my pleasure now to introduce mr. Rob HEIs deliver our keynote address okay thank you and my congratulations to you guys - outstanding I'm real pleased to be up here and a warm thank you to the family and friends faculty administration staff and sponsors for all your support for these incredibly hard-working individuals let me ask you guys we need to think of your future what do you think of do you think of your family how you will form relationships how you'll raise our kids how you will provide for them or ensure they grow up healthy or the issues they will face in life do you think about what work you will be doing who you'll be working with and for what you will accomplish what you will find fulfilling how you will contribute to society or what success looks like for you do you think of the global issues that are bearing down on us economic stability environmental sustainability political resolution human justice do you think of business opportunities of starting your own company leading great companies to achieving even better purpose or inspiring new innovation or do you think about your own well-being your health your prosperity your intellectual and social development your ability to make a difference according to søren kierkegaard life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced is that the way you see your future you've just completed another major chapter in your life you invest a time and effort into furthering your own education your own knowledge you now have bona fides that acknowledge that accomplishment but I'm certain that all of you did so with some thing in mind some kind of goal you were looking to the future and you knew that you could address that future better having done what you've just accomplished this was just one step one of many that you will take but it was a big step it took courage it took sacrifice effort and perseverance that by itself sets you apart you're uniquely you were uniquely motivated to take this step because you felt that doing so wasn't port to achieving something else something that is still ahead of you and maybe you have a sense of what that future will look like there are many factors that will influence what our future will look like many of which will be the result of other people that like you have a vision have motivation and are compelled to advance the world in their own way take for example the world of Medicine the work that dr. Patrick Shanshan is at UCLA is leading to decode the genetics of cancer to put the body's own immune system to work in not just destroying cancer cells but to go as far as to make the patient immune to any future occurrence of cancer to cure cancer this and other related work promises to eliminate the cancer as a disease or the work that dr. Joanne Kurtz Burke at Duke University is doing to treat pediatric pediatric and acquired to a genetic brain injuries with him Hemet to take aim and pronounce it right helmet opa topi ik stem cell transplants or the related work by dr. richard burt at Northwestern University on regenerative medicine used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis Mycenae gravis and many others these advances will enable us to completely regrow any organs any bone or tissue or even correct deficiencies in our own immune system or the work that being done by dr. Lynch in at the UT systems Institute of Health Transformation which is leveraging social mobile cloud and cognitive technologies to personalize health care delivery and democratize clinical expertise for diabetes and other chronic disease patients all of these and many other efforts are going to completely transform how we diagnose treat manage and cure diseases throughout the United States and the world over the next couple of decades people in every walk of life will live healthier longer and more productive lives or let's turn to the role of information computing in our lives who could imagine even ten years ago the impact that smartphones would have on the fabric of our life can you feel the familiar weight of your own phone in your pocket or purse are you just itching to pull it out check your email or Facebook page maybe somebody you are looking at some of the things I just said about advances in medicine on the internet right now that was you no doubt a bunch of you however will pull it out to post images of today on snapchat just think of how much information will be produced at just this one event pictures videos tweets text messages emails maybe you'll blog about the experience tonight hundreds of you from just this one place at this one time now multiply that by everything that's going on today here across Austin across Texas across the United States across our entire globe we estimate that in 2015 two point five exabytes the data was produced every single day as 2.5 billion billion characters of information being produced it's equivalent if you having trouble with that number that's equivalent to about six point two five billion Harry Potter books being written every single day don't ask me which volume it's an approximation but that's occurring every single day now not all that is written text a lot of it is in the form of messages and tweets and blogs emails papers some of your own presumably articles books and so forth a lava is audio recordings and photo and video images a lot of it is being is data being generated by IOT the Internet of Things devices our thermostats our wearable health monitors cars other industrial devices that are constantly monitoring their own condition as well as the environment around us by 2020 in the next four years we expect that to grow to 44 zettabytes as four orders of magnitude more data being produced every single day now who do you think is reading or looking at all that information how much of the information is being lost because there just isn't time to assimilate at all we estimate that for a doctor to read all the research reports and articles published in their own field of medicine every week we require they've spent a hundred and sixty hours a week to get through it all there's only one 58 in the week so either they're incredibly good at multitasking or more likely they're making a lot of medical decisions without the benefit of the very latest advances in their own area of discipline and we're all in that situation whether we're making profound decisions about our health wealth and family or more tactical decisions about where we're going to go celebrate tonight that's what's driving the demand for advances in analytic and cognitive computing information systems that can crawl through mountains of information reading through the texts and images to interpret their real intention and meaning like we would to figure out what's relevant and what's not to assimilate and create inferences to bring the best latest and most significant insights to our attention to inspire us to new ideas to new perspectives to psychologically activate our own creativity and cognition these advances are going to completely transform how we create find and use information to make better decisions and improve the realm of the world around us but let's go back to our experiences with mobile devices your smartphone your tablet your laptop we're about to experience a major shift in our mobile experience embodied cognition is about to enter our lives robots I don't mean the kind that welded and painted our car at the factory nor the oversized rolling hockey puck that sweeps our living room floors I mean social robots robots like algebra ins pepper and blue frogs budding in touches Vita and savvy X savvy one Hansen's robotics little Einstein and any of another hundred robotic products that are now in development these robots will create a presence in our hotel lobbies in our stores in our offices in our homes they will embody the cognitive computing capabilities they spoke of earlier to sift through mountains of information to help us answer our most pressing questions to give us insights to help us make better decisions these Rovers will be able to help us in other ways guiding us in the right direction help them protect our homes delivering our essentials even doing our cooking and cleaning for us these things are becoming a reality now yes I robots Roomba and Amazon's echo or early examples but even more advanced form of social robotics are emerging day one orders of Aldo Baron's pepper sold out in Japan in one hour G Bo will be commercially available at this summer elemental paths cognitive educational and dinosaur is taking pre-orders now experiments are underway at a hotel in Virginia using a robot - sis with concierge tasks and the embodiment of cognition won't be limited to just humanoid devices moving around to your homes and offices embodiment will occur in the form of rooms spaces even our own transportation as intelligent homes avatars and connected an autonomous that is self-driving cars we're already seeing examples of this these advances are going to change how we relate to our environment how we care for our parents how we care for ourselves how even relate to one another if we measure the number of smart phones by the number of people in the world we will be measuring the number of robots by the number of places that people occupy they will make us more productive that will make us more social that will free us up from certain tasks while at the same time enabling us to perform other tasks that we couldn't do previously this is just a small sampling sampling of all the advances that are now occurring across many different domains the things these things are going to shift society as we know it they're going to force us to reevaluate our own humanity it will impose economic and social disruptions in ways that we can't really estimate at this time we will see workforce will we see its workforce to decline I don't think so not at a macro level but we will see more flow workforce dislocation for every job that is no longer needed we will see other opportunities arise for those able and willing to adapt for every business that goes away others will replace it to create or take advantage of new markets new opportunities new innovations people will live longer on the one hand we will need to be able to feed people for longer the global population will continue to grow and increase demands on our available resources on the other hand people will remain productive longer they would be more knowledgeable and creative they will find ways to solve society's problems in a novel and more responsible ways we will learn to be to be better stewards of our environment and find more productive and sustainable use of our resources and you are better prepared than ever to help society make these changes to make these transitions for better or worse you better than most are equipped to recognize the opportunities that arise the risks that lurk the trade-offs and the skills for leading teams companies and entire markets through the transition that is inevitable but to do so is going to require that you reach inside yourself to know your inner passion decide what matters to you and have a vision for how you will play out your future I ask only one thing from you that you wake up every morning and ask yourself this one simple question what are you waiting for what are you waiting for don't wait don't wait to apply your vision don't wait to take each step forward don't wait to make a difference to help society through the transitions being imposed on it don't wait as Albert Einstein said strive not to be a success but rather to be a value embrace our world our existence our potential and our flaws take what you've learned who you've become to make our world and our presence in it better be valuable thank you and congratulations again thank you rob for your remarks and your support of our program it's now time for the commencement Awards we asked our current class to vote on an outstanding student and an outstanding faculty member to be celebrated at today's commencement ceremony Hillary Patterson will help me recognize the outstanding student so this year has proved to be a challenging one for many of our students I'll say most of our students they're required to balance a course load much heavier than what most graduate students carry while working their way through a rigorous recruitment process when we asked all of our students to select a member of their class to receive an outstanding student award we asked them to have three criteria in mind academic performance teamwork and positive impact on the class here are some quotes regarding this year's recipient diligent worker helpful to classmates and good academically works very hard and is extremely kind and approachable extremely hard-working calm and composed demeanor and very helpful - super smart and sweet to others we're happy to announce this year's outstanding student of the Year baizhang Sadeghi hey Jean would you please come to the stage and accept your award or you can do that so please accept this on behalf of that your your classmates with the gratitude by staff well thank you guys for voting me here I appreciate it and I appreciate all of our teachers and everybody who supported this program and he's concise - congratulations vision I will now introduce you to Ben grits Ben represented this program in the graduate student assembly and we thought it appropriate that he present the award to our outstanding faculty member of 2016 as selected by our students thank you dr. Ashley Oh get afternoon everybody thank you to all the people both family and friends that have supported us over the course of this year and to those who have made the trip today is my honor to present the MSBA 2016 outstanding faculty award but first I would like to thank the faculty as a whole we owe every single one of you the utmost gratitude for all the time and effort you have given toward our development your guidance commitment and energy have propelled us through this whirlwind of a year the influence you've had in our lives is undeniable and your impact will not be forgotten we hope to make you proud in the coming years as a testament to the strength of your teaching and of your leadership the wisdom and compassion you bring to this program have laid the foundation for our successes both here and beyond and for that we thank you today we recognize someone who many students have described as the best professor they've ever had dr. Kumar mr. Amon is an add up teacher who fully invested we've fully invested in the students you see here today his emphasis on improving our ability to work with less familiar colleagues shows the level of care and attention to detail he put into his class it was this thoughtfulness together with his supreme teaching ability that made each day in stochastic control an optimization a truly remarkable experience as one of my classmates but it many professors are brilliant but what sets professor myth Raman apart is his ability to communicate his brilliance in terms that can be easily understood by students another student said he carries the whole class forward and stills confidence I would just like to quickly point out that these comments were all submitted before we had to take his final exam last week in a program where we were grinding each day to figure out what exactly we were doing professor Mazur Raman was able to cultivate our intuition for why we were doing it he knew every student's name in every student's name by heart which enabled him to engage and connect with each student on a personal level my peers and I arrived all spring about his ability to read the classroom understand what we were struggling with and figure out exactly what needed to be clarified one student said he has figured out the perfect pace of teaching and the perfect way to impart the content and another called his class the perfect course so without further ado on behalf of the students of the Tucson 2016 MSBA cohort I would like to present the outstanding faculty award to the inspirational dr. Kumar booth Raman congratulations everyone and thank you all for this this is truly a hunter you know what this means it gives him much less incentive to improve my handwriting for next year thank you okay now it's time to individually recognize the members of the McCombs School of Business MS business analytics graduating class of 2016 Sneha Agarwal Nalini Agarwal Zak Aldridge Steven Allen Romney psy abullah Zachary Jase Barton zeref daya Bonnie Matt Bonfante Matthew Bregman Landon chambers modular Koch Audrey Leon Chen Justin Chang Vivian Chu Bob cook Bonnie Gayle Daniel Vijay Kumar Ganapathy Julian got Ali Kevin James Gregory Benjamin Griz Alexander Grubbs Holly Jones Eric conky Vijay Kasturi Rankine James Craig Sri Oz Krishna and Shri Khan Daniel I Brian T Leakey drew Lieberman Gregory merchant Alexandria win a nod Paul Duany Potter kathleen Pasque lee.carter Pearson Suraj Tata Prasad Andrew Ruben beige on Lee said again Francisco soon Yanis Abhishek sanghavi Reshma Sekar Sanchez Charlene Karthik Shama thought about Sharma Aida when you she on sing some Rudy so money mayor Srinivasan Gabriel rudia un Wang Carlton M Washburn molly jane wolf Julia whoo dan Zaleski Michael Chang Vicky chi-ching yang Yang how about a round of applause for the entire class okay first a little housekeeping before before we call it quits immediately after the end we will meet outside at the Plaza after we sing the eyes of Texas and we'll meet for a group photo so please as you as you exit and go to the right where the fountain is just below the fountain at the Plaza we will we'll take a group photo so please meet there everybody is welcome to join us please at the Alumni Center which is just on past the fountain and the the Alumni Center there on San Jacinto please join us for a reception to help us congratulate our graduates and now it is tradition that we join our new graduates in singing the eyes of Texas and the words if you are not familiar with them or if you're an Aggie are are in the back of the program so please and for those of you who haven't sung it before it's like I've been working on the railroad so it's not that tough so please please stand and join us and and remain standing during the faculty procession
