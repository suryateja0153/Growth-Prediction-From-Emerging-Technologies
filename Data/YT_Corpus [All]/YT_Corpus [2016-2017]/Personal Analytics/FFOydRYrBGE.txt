 what I wanna interface what I'm gonna you can hate all you want to but you're so do put our prima donna but I wanna tell us back my friend bootstrapping in America we have Mike stringer in the house today and to Tony I know you you can't get enough of the whole data science world but Mike's yours one data scientist you've met them all what Mike series gonna blow your mind okay today by the name of the company is data scope analytics you are a small chicago-based data science consulting firm that's right you look one thousand interviews into bootstrapping we have never had on a pure data science firm all right leaning out there yeah thank you are are there a lot of data science consulting firms or is this or this a relatively new space no it's very new yeah so it's funny I probably should be more aware of other consulting firms out there but and there really aren't that many I'd say that the biggest kind of consulting firms that are doing data science are actually the kind of big management consulting firms that are kind of growing that as a capability or so when you first went to school where did you go so I undergrad I went to the University of Colorado that engineering physics there okay but did the was the data so data science because I've been hiring people for a long time and the term data science really is something that I've just run into probably less you know I don't even know like five six years oh yeah yeah yeah it said we started desk up seven years ago almost know and we had heard that term but it was it was kind of restricted to the halls of academia and weird places it's only been in the last couple of years that we've even started using the term to describe what we do just because it's kind of a it's kind of a meaningless term anyway it's a control it's a kitchen all but it seems to be that it seems to be where'd you get your PhD up in northwestern northwestern and that's why you stayed here yes sure because it seems to be that firm like if you know it's almost a kind of thing where oh you don't have any data scientist yeah it's no its you can't possibly compete with us yeah it's very common for somebody who has a different title to just oh you know what I'm a I'm a data scientist now it's kind of a title it hasn't really it's only recently kind of started converging on something that means something is so I would look at your business the same way I would look at for me same would look at a really strong like programming / consult dead firm you know they could do lots of languages that can they can I would look at pretty about languages I would look at it more as a as a business I could hire they could solve my most complex problems you know right the requirements to solve the most complex problems and then program for the solution how would you describe your business that's a great question so that I hear there's there's a big component of data science that's development that software development in most cases even but is that you don't you're not actually developers you can program but you're not you don't right so right yeah well we do we do write software but behind the scenes software behind the yeah behind the scenes software or a software that's that has a nice user user interface for management to make decisions but maybe not necessarily we're going to be writing the next Facebook or something you're not front-facing super right right but the the key thing for us is actually much less on the development side what we learned very early on is that the biggest problem with approaching problems quantitatively is not with you got to be the smartest person in the room it's that you have to be able to communicate well you you have to be able to design something so that'll actually be used and to that end we kind of we almost think of ourselves more as designers than data scientists so we kind of draw from the human centered design or user centered design community and really think about a we're solving problems we have been to be very good at using data as a resource to solve those problems but ultimately we want make sure we're focusing on the right thing and so when you ask the question about like writing the requirements for development that that's probably more along the lines of somebody comes to us and they'll say I think I need to use the big data or I think I need data scientist but I don't know what a data scientist is I read something and Wall Street Journal that said that I need data scientists and what kind of tell them to take a deep breath and we'll work with them to understand what opportunities there trying to pursue what are the real business challenges you know and if and how they might use data as a resource to solve some of those we use so we have data science to Sun staff here because we do a lot of research we're like a little think tank but finance space and our thought process when hiring you know when hiring a certain type of PhD or masters degree or that kind of you know somebody that specialist was was that I'm especially the financial markets there's very defined the numbers are very defined like the the is the history is out there like some places the histories I'd in there right yeah we have the history yep but in order for us to get through a massive amount of data you know we needed people that could design systems write code design systems so that process so we we don't get paid for the back end yeah we get paid for delivering the front end which is all the information and so we needed to make the backend efficient so that we could create really good content on the front end that could evolve every single day and that's what our thought process was right I don't know if we were I think we got it right but you know like you never really know yeah that's all thing with the holders with this whole big data revelry like you know it's just like running company you can see it makes sense to you but for us so you have so many different pieces like we're trying to forget this does this really work you know yeah and I'm sure that part of what you guys have to do is is really teach the companies are using you what you do oh absolutely that's a huge part of it and I would say we've had of roughly 50 projects we've done with companies we've probably had one or two where somebody actually knows what they want done most of the time it's helping them to understand what's possible what we can do what's possible with with big data it's it's really that's a lot more important how do you ever complete a project do you mean lately it's like a question how does anybody ever it sounds like they there's no way to ever be done yeah that's a good business model yeah that's a development firms business I mean like you you're never truly done with your developers yeah and only you never truly be done with your data scientists yeah we always ending a project is always kind of a subjective thing that we always kind of been our clients love that we always want to keep working on it and it's something where yeah there's there's not really an end you can always do a little bit better but we always kind of try to aim to I take an approach that gets most of the way towards what's possible and if there's if it really makes sense if there's a business problem where it makes sense to keep on refining the approach that you're using then we'll advocate for that but in most cases you kind of get most of the way there with the initial push do you ever run into the situation where you are looking at a business ideas whatever you're doing a project for somebody and and you're like oh my god this is what we should be doing like you know because that happens to a lot of to have consulting firms and a lot of consulting firms generally like awesome we have a really nice business but but we can have a business that you know yeah make your product here's what we can monetize this to him you know and does that is that a dilemma for you or seda is that that happen yeah it happens all the time we've I think we've done a pretty good job of focusing on what we're a kind of a pure services company yeah that being said we have not been able to completely resist the temptation to to go down those paths just because we we work with a very broad array of companies in different industries we start seeing patterns of problems that it doesn't matter what industry somebody's and it's something that people have trouble with right so we do have a couple of kind of early irons in the fire for you have you potential products that we would try because I've seen in this business produce for especially for you know for game changers or people that are for new entrants you know first to market type thing I didn't create like ridiculous amounts of value that I think it's really hard for you know in the consulting world to create because that's not essentially your business model yep you know so that's interesting or i could just became a favorite data consultant because time to scalp some e-mini S&P s4 3057 30 350 bucks for each contractor each tranche that we did so this segment for us very much just a seven-point drop one question for you know I went through your side a little bit here and we're kind of in a war here with the Pistons I think we're Hannah hey a hepa came in front of them for the playoffs here are you gonna do something sabotage them hopefully user science you know so Aaron a wolf was the first person he's a big Michigan sports fan he kind of went to the MIT Sloan sports analytics conference and met some people from the Pistons there so that's how that relationship got started we hope you run the minus I you know what lies I've recused myself from that project i haven't had a hand in itself is there this interesting is that data science has become probably one of the areas of quantitative research using data that has been the most p are worthy has been sports yeah you know quantitative sports right and we were we were here one day interviewing somebody that you know was telling it was mentioning companies we never even heard of these companies before and then they're you know they're huge and they're doing you know the the sports sports modeling and I was listening an interview yesterday with Theo Epstein from the Cubs and he was talking about you know the role that they play with just quantitative research now it's just you listed this stuff it's like man he was thrown out statistics no way do these old-school general managers ever have any of this stuff him and same thing with basketball we had a firm on once that you know basically tell you every statistic about every it's just interesting you know how they put that stuff together is I guess what you do is you know simplify the process so that they can so you can use the data yeah but all things considered I would even say sports I mean sports is not a huge industry all things considered oh it's a good it's a huge industry in the sense that it's it has a lot of high balls yeah absolutely I i would say sports is a little bit even more forward-looking than you look at something like consumer products with companies that have been around forever yeah there are a huge amount of opportunities to do the equivalent of washer like the Moneyball story in in baseball yeah there's all sorts of those opportunities in all sorts of industries big industry is where people are doing reined in and kind of using their gut and they think that they they have this knowledge that really like you just attract things do things quantitatively it's a lot better here's an interesting thought about that did you know you can use in the future sports the reason it works in sports is because the life cycle of the general manager the manager the coach whatever it is is determined by wins and losses in in the now yeah it's an immediate you have to return on your return on capital is immediate and it's expected otherwise you get fired so there is apps if you're in a big corporation like you're working for craft or general middle I didn't know what the front starting a project able your job there is not to get fired yeah sure Chavez don't do anything stupid so that you get fired verse in these jobs you got to win now yeah so that's why you see the the adoption in sports take place at such a media New York rise right that's as opposed to you know big companies where the where the aversion to risk is completely different right yeah it's crazy yeah I mean we we would if we could afford here we would go balls out like you know we would do everything that would because because yet what's the point why way today yeah yeah it's just so so you're in a really good how do people learn about you guys though how do you get that out there us is in a lot of a lot of referrals from past clients that's been the main thing just kind of general networking talking with people in the community in the tech community in the business community and then we developed a data science training program we were hired by kaplan to do that and epilim the education education occasional room right yeah and so we wrote the curriculum for a data science course that they now teach in New York San Francisco and soon Chicago and that collaboration with them has kind of helped increase the visibility of us too that's nice that's nice i assume that you know at some point in the next decade or two decades will will end up with an overabundance of data scientists because that's just the nature of yeah you know the nature of workforce of opportunity is there yeah the nature of workforce opportunity but but that's for sure not the case right now so I'm sure it must be hard to you know to find the level of you know talent and skill and and I don't even know how many i assume i assume now most universities have you know PhD programs in in data science but it's probably still pretty limited you know it's not yet actually I really i'm using the word i mean there's just like at datascope we come from physics engineering all sorts of areas there's still people going through those programs and then they really are data scientists by a different name yeah so there aren't specific programs what's surprising is that there I would say like we haven't had at datascope we haven't had a terrible time finding people just because there really aren't that many data science consulting companies and a lot of people that finish up their their PhD and in econometrics or something they might not be looking to go to a huge consulting company they want to go to a small kind of collaborative open place and so they end up finding datascope so we've been really lucky in that regard that's great it's a good story fine tradition be able to work for you because they're gonna do the money it's a good way between us and international thing you've ever said all things considered um like smrt smart it if people want to go check your site out where they going datascope analytics com datascope I'm lunes Alex calm and your chicago-based and thank you so much for coming into
