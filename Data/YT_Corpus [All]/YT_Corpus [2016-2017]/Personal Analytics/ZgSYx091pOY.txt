 what's up YouTube and thanks for tuning in today I'm doing another how-to video with Terapeak and I'm going to be showing you how to do research on your competitors so if there's a product category you're thinking about getting into we can do research or if there's a product category that you're already in and you want to know how to how to beat your competitors so let's just say for example we are selling will say paracord bracelets so typically the people who are on the first page are gonna sell the most so I typically look at a couple of these guys actually typically I would do a search within Terapeak for paracord bracelets look at the top 20 competitors and then analyze those competitors but for the sake of this we're gonna look it this way so all these guys are selling pretty good this guy sold 2800 this guy sold $13.99 ideally I'm gonna find somebody who doesn't ship from China reason being it's not really a level playing field those guys yeah they can get the better prices but at the same time not everyone wants to buy from a guy from China so we're gonna search for Illinois but as you can see this guy is in Wheeling Illinois and he has sold more than 2800 of these so his name is Alpha Panda so what we're gonna do we're gonna go over to Terapeak and we're gonna type in alpha tanda and i'll show you kind of some of the different research we can look at so this is gonna be kind of an overall profile of him his actually you know we'll do one more thing let's look at his store first and see the types of items he's selling because he okay it looks like a lot of camping and survival type items right like multi tools different types of connector links waterproof cell phone case looks like this is a fire starter so a lot of like matches fire starters that type of thing in the past week this guy's sold 869 dollars worth of stuff that's actually not a huge amount of money although when you're selling items like you know this is only five dollars it's a fairly cheap item so I mean if we take safe I don't woody suppose say nine hundred dollars divided by five it's actually only 180 items these items are probably costing him about 60 cents so let's say he's told about one hundred and hundred and eighty items we'll say five minus 0.6 so he's making four point four four dollars and forty cents ya know is one hundred and eighty s will do one hundred and eighty times four point four so not too shabby this guy probably made I'm guessing around you know some of those items are gonna be more expensive some are less expensive some of his wholesale costs are gonna be higher and lower but I would venture to bet this guy's probably making between seven and eight hundred dollars a week even though he's only selling you know seven eight hundred you know because of the margins are so crazy he's making a pretty good amount of money so but let's go look at this so he has 29 listings a 100% sell through rate so everything he's listing is selling most of his stuff is selling like between 6 to 8 p.m. in the evening very good sell through rate let's see his key words are survival I kind of knew that before you know as soon as I saw paracord bracelets and all this other stuff I kind of knew he was going to be into the survival niche most of his stuff sells on Friday although Monday is another good listing so basically as a as a seller myself if I'm selling similar items of this guy and he's more successful than me I'm gonna kind of try to look and see okay what category is he listing okay he's listing and Sporting Goods that's the same category as me so that's the same oh you know most of my I never really thought about what data and my listings but most of my listings end on Tuesdays which aren't really the best day maybe I shouldn't end them on a Monday or Friday one of the most important pieces of info here is a keyword so here's the keywords that most of his items are having them that are selling and here's also the keywords that most people who are buying me these items are searching for us we have keywords like survival camping cycling bike military and waterproof those are kind of all to be expected the price points another important thing as you can see most of his products are between one and four dollars really has a pretty good mixture of sales everything from a penny all the way up to to about 25 bucks so you know he's pretty varied price points I guess we could say his most expensive items are $20 and it's a survival bug-out kit so even as most expensive item is is still fairly cheap but he's making really good margins on this stuff we can look at his particular listings I mean we could do the same thing by just going into a store but we can look at his listings we can see whether they're buy it now sore auctions or stores so most of the stuff is selling out of his store if you don't have a store and you're selling this type of niche of items you know maybe you want to consider getting a store so there's some good data I don't really like this category a historical look at things and here's his best selling items so he sold three of these emergency water straws he sold three paracord bracelets propane refill adapter you know so he he uh you know this is only one week of sales since that's not too bad I was actually kind of surprised by how low his overall sales where he must he his listings must run forever I'd be curious to see his quantity but I bet she's got a quantity in the thousands because for a lot of items if you let your listings run out your listing starts from scratch so not a lot of people have 2000 listings sold this guy must keep his listing up until it sells out and constantly up the quantity with some categories you're not allowed to you know list over a thousand dollars or list over so many items so it's just kind of unique to cheaper items and specifically this niche that you were able to get up this high but uh yeah I mean you know nothing groundbreaking here I just kind of wanted to get you guys familiar with Terra peak and how to pull research on your competitors really quickly I'm gonna do one more thing here if any also I should mention if any of you guys have an interest in this program Terapeak that I'm using and pulling this data you can get a free 7-day trial by clicking the link I'll put in the description box below but I'm gonna show you one other way that I would find competitors to search so actually let me start over so we would click in-depth research we would click product search and what we're gonna do we're gonna type in paracord bracelet and let's keep in mind we were just looking at the Alpha Panda so let's see where he shows up in terms of the top sellers so here's the overall sale stats on paracord bracelets here $10,000 worth sold the week that's pretty good we're gonna click the guy icon which is gonna be the top 20 sellers and let's see oh you know okay alpha pandas only the number 12 seller so honestly you know maybe my strategy there wasn't the best like I said this is normally how I do keyword research normally I would go up here and find this guy who I had the top total sales and that's weird these stats aren't matching up with the other one anyhow normally I would find a top seller here oh you know why because paracord bracelets are only a small portion of this guy's offering so he only sold 800 dollars with a paracord bracelets but I'm sorry I sold $800 worth of overall merchandise but only 163 dollars worth of it with paracord bracelets as you can see this is a top seller SW gear gears us so we can click him and we can look at all that same competitor data so where's the other guy oh this is really crazy to me okay I got you so the reason that this guy only has 285 in sales and he's ranked number one cuz right now we're only pulling stats for paracord bracelets so this guy's name was what the heck was this guy's name let's open an ebay temp so I can get his name you know svw gear uh okay so we'll take his name we're gonna go back here to in-depth research we're gonna go back to competitor research we're gonna type in his name so now we're pulling all of his sales not just based on paracord bracelets and we'll go to his overall sales stats here and okay so five hundred and twelve dollars so it's slightly more as you can see these guys in the survival niche they're not selling a ton of money worth of product like some of my products one product alone is over $500 so my sales made war if this guy sales however if I'm 5 a $500 item I may only be making 10 bucks whereas this guy you know even though he's selling 14 items or whatever however many items that may be to get the same amount of money his margins are huge and things like paracord bracelets I mean I've told you guys about this in other videos you're gonna get those for probably 20 to 50 cents and you're gonna be able to sell them at a minimum for battle 5 bucks if you put together your listings right or if you sell them in Amazon you potentially can get you know 8 10 15 dollars for them like I said if you have interesting products and you market them right so there's definitely good margins in this but it looks like the sales are kind of split up we'll split up among a bunch of guys but yeah overall I just wanted to show you guys how to do competitor research using Terapeak again if you
