 okay today's lecture is very nice because we get to use what we've learned and what we've learned is that in crystals you have fine structure and the band structure describes the energy eigenstates of electrons living in the crystals and this lecture is about two types of crystals that are very related graphene and carbon nanotubes they're both carbon structures that generate a lot of current research also some applications in solid-state physics and with the knowledge that we have at this moment we can actually work through the math and demonstrate what the band structure of graphene and carbon nanotubes is so I'm not going to derive it completely for you today there is you gave you a handout with the derivation but we're gonna hit the main points of the math and describe the concepts that are behind them so both graphene and carbon nanotubes are carbon compounds 100% carbon and carbon is one atom that is worth discussing in great length as you all know organic chemistry is based on carbon materials combined with oxygen and hydrogen that created the entire ganic chemistry we're not going to talk about that we're going to talk about pure forms of carbon and we already saw one of them in particular diamond a few times appearing during the course and we saw that diamond has very strongly coupled atoms and so electrons very strongly coupled to atoms and therefore it has a large band gap of five or six electron volts and that explains why it is transparent to light we also saw that you can have impurities in carbon that would then give it color there are diamond color centers and so we are actually not going to study Diamond today because it's an insulator we are going to look at the band structure of materials that are conducting and the material that is more similar to what we're going to look at today is graphite graphite like in pencils is the one that is closely related to graphene now all these materials are called electrodes so they're made of the same atom carbon but they are very different crystal structures very different physical properties but the same basic chemical ingredient and so this flat illustrates the difference between graphite and diamond diamond I already showed it to you it is a cubic crystal this is diamond cubic crystal with bases right and it's a basis where there are two atoms per unit cell it's an FCC sorry two atom basis and an FCC crystal structure there is a second atom displaced from the first time so this is the basis and you have the FCC cubic lattice on the contrary graphite is a somewhat unusual crystal for for us we did not look at such compounds in detail before this is what graphite looks like you have these layers and inside layers you have chemical bonds shown by these solid lines and between the layers you have Vander Waals forces tying them together so just intermolecular forces so as a result there is a huge anisotropy as you can see in in graphite and it is very easy for example to separate the layers they take them apart and that's why pencils right in essence so when you're right with the pencil you're just removing layers from the top of course it is come more complicating than that because in your pencil you have a poly crystal you don't have a single single crystalline graphite graphite pencils that'll be maybe a little excessive but this is essentially the the reason why graphite is so easy to peel off and break apart and diamond is the hardest material we know so in diamond all of these bonds are like these bonds here we will see what they are in a moment okay so graphite it is and but these are not the only allotropes of carbon so this is diamond this is graphite this is something called lawns delight which is something in-between because one thing I didn't mention to you yet is that inside these layers you have hexagonal structures so this is a not a cubic structure it has hexagonal elements here and this is something in between so actually I looked it up I didn't know about this before you it occurs when meteorites smash earth and they have such a graphite in them and when they smash it goes from graphite into diamond and sometimes it gets stuck somewhere in between so this is a doesn't have a cubic lattice but it has this dragon or lattice character but it is a solid form of carbon and not very frequently occurring but does occur in nature where you have metal rights there but this abc1 are things you can hold in your hand they are big bulk solids solids in the basic sense of it these ones down here D F and H in particular are essentially molecules so these D F are balls of carbon atoms and they're called fullerenes and they are named by the number of atoms like C 60 looks exactly like a soccer ball so that's number D looks exactly like soccer ball where you put the sockets of a soccer ball that the vertices of the soccer ball and that where carbons are but there are also more complicated ones like C 540 it's a huge molecule 540 atoms or C 70 which has more atoms than C 60 so that's very interesting these fluorines are very interesting and we're now going to talk about them today but they've been subject of a lot of studies carbon nanotubes we're going to describe in great details it's essentially one of these layers rolled up can generate carbon nanotubes by many different ways like an arc discharge catalyzed growth where you flow methane which has carbon atoms in it at high temperature over a metallic catalyst and methane decomposes producing the carbon nanotubes hydrogen goes away and carbon nanotubes grows from a metal like nickel particle there is also this amorphous carbon so this is just the random network of bond some of them not satisfied not met some dangling essentially they're called dangling bonds so it's a mesh of these bonds and this is also a form of carbon so what is graphene graphene is a single layer in this layer graphite structure and is how it was described to me when I was studying solid-state physics that you know if if you could take one layer off of graph fight you would get that's called graphene of course was not possible back then but in the meantime we have found ways to separate and isolate this one layer of carbon atoms and that's a remarkable achievement even though if you know how it's been done it's a little silly I'll show you in a moment but this one layer has remarkable properties for example it has very strong mechanical properties so it's 100 times stronger than steel of comparable weight if you try to break it or tear it apart or make a hole in it that's that's hard of course it's a usually a very light and small layer but you can still do this calculation so it has remarkable mechanical properties it also has very interesting electrical properties so transport of charges through it and we are going to look at some of them but not all of them in this lecture right so some of them that based on your current knowledge of the band structure but there are I just want to advertise that there are many more interesting properties in graphene such as pseudo spin spin orbit interaction climb tumbling and various interesting things ok so this is how you can make graphene and it was done by question I was Olaf and Andre game at Manchester they took scotch tape you can see it here apparently games tape get stolen a lot so he he wrote that it's his and essentially what they did is they took a crystal of carbon and chara graphite and they peeled they stuck scratched it with many times and then they stuck that tape onto a piece of silicon just to have as a substrate and they stuck it many many times and then looking under just a simple optical microscope that you can have in many many labs you can see by the color change that that you have made a single layer of atoms so the way it works is diffraction effect so here is a actually silicon on silicon oxide silicon oxide is transparent it's a dielectric and so you have a layer of atoms here you have light going through and reflecting off of silicon which is somewhat of a metal at room temperature and you have another wave going like this these two waves interfere and it changes the color just enough for your eye for your eye not armed with anything else to see the color difference from a single layer of atoms so thanks to this silicon on silicon oxide and silicon substrate on which you can hold so there are other more sophisticated methods by now of producing graphene also large-scale this produced little flakes up to one micron 10 microns maybe a hundred microns record in size now people can make inches large layers of graphene it's explored for use in things like flexible screens that you can just pack up and you know pull pull pull out and read a newspaper on it things like that many other applications so it is becoming an industry but it all started with with a scotch tape now let's go into the into our stuff that we know how to do so it's a lattice like this and each red dot is a carbon atom why is does it form a lattice like this well carbon atoms are group four elements that means they have four available electrons to either make bonds chemical bonds with other atoms or to be conducting electrons and so what happens in the case of these graphene layers is three of the electrons participate in chemical bonding with the neighboring atoms and they are tied in those bonds so we don't consider them they are you can say that they're in the field bands that are way below the Fermi level this is how it looks there are three of these elongated bonds and they are sp2 orbitals they lie in the plane of the graphene sheet these three guys lie in the plane and they are responsible for making these bonds you can see that each of the carbon atoms is connected to three other atoms and that's exactly because of these three electrons that that you have here all the things that we're going to talk about today are going to be related to the fourth electron and that electron occupies a PZ orbital why is it called Z is because it's along the vertical direction and it's a p orbital so it has this figure eight shape those electrons are available for tunneling from one atom to the other for hopping and for building a tight binding model width so we are going to be studying the band's that they create and how they live in those bands so these P orbitals the fourth the fourth electron of carbon is available for transport now let's start using what we know a quick quiz this is the graphene structure is it a lattice is it the crystal lattice I have somebody giving some signals I want all of you to think about it a little bit you guys should you should guys should play poker okay go ahead okay why you wanna okay you say it's a periodic structure it's a lattice was it the definition of a lattice okay yeah that's very good so for example right if we look at points actually I have a bunch of texts about it here if we look at points P and the points are they have different environment right so point P has two guys on the sides downwards from it and another one higher up and the point R has the opposite thing right so this is not a lattice another way to see that it's not a lattice you cannot come up with lattice primitive lattice vectors right you need to have the lattice vectors to create the lightest and what is the definition is that each sum of two lattice vectors creates another lattice point and you can have take three vectors in this direction four vectors in this direction you always hit a lattice point and so what could be you know you start with this lattice site what could be the lattice vectors well you have to go to these point and to this point but if you add these two vectors you're going to be in the middle of a hexagon there is no atom there there that's not a lattice point and you show you and you also going to hit you're gonna miss a bunch of atoms this way so this is actually not alike so there is no there's not a hexagonal lattice although it is used a lot these words or and I will it's okay to say that it's a hexagonal lattice but I just wanted to make this point that but by our definition that was not a lattice what about this that's a lattice right so this here you can define two vectors and then the some of them will bring you here if you go twice in this direction while insertion you're going to cover this entire so this is actually a trigonal lattice with the basis of two atoms this is what graphene is so it's a trigonal lattice with a basis of two atoms or you can say that it's two trigonal lettuces intertwined and they are equivalent because both atoms are carbon both atoms have three bonds so chemically they're they're equivalent the two lattices are equivalent you cannot you can start with one and the next one you will find it displaced by the same amount as if you start with a second one and so you can fill this two-dimensional space with this kind of ROM be called shapes each containing two atoms as shown here that means that this rhombus shape is a primitive unit cell for this lattice this will be the primitive unit cell so it contains two atoms and it's a trigonal lattice of these kind of ROM B you can also define a unit cell to be a hexagon that also works you can fill this entire space with hexagons and in this case you can also see that it's two atoms per cell because you can't the red atoms and the blue atoms each belonging to three ROM B and there are six of them so the number of atoms per cell like this is also to one third of each atom 4/3 so these are now marked a and B this is like I want to stress it this is arbitrary you can also mark them a and B the other way it just depends on where you start in the lattice they just marked a and B because there are two of them per unit cell but they are both carbon atoms and it's interchangeable however it is important that there are two then that they're called a and B as we will see as we develop the quantum mechanical model for graphene okay so we have figured out what is the lattice it is a trigonal lattice and now atoms a and B are marked with blue and yellow colors we can define vectors of the slightest primitive unit vectors and they will be vectors a 1 and a 2 to start with the lattice Seiken we connect to the nearest neighbor site so this will be a basis basis vectors and they can be written out like this because it's a hexagon there will be the square roots of 3 from the signs of 30 degrees a will be the distance the size of the hexagon so that's about one point forty two angstroms that's the size the distance between the two at so the length of a 1 and a 2 are given here in terms of a and you can see that these are not 90 degrees with respect to each other they are unit vectors of a triangular lattice and therefore they're at this angle of 60 degrees okay we can also construct a reciprocal space so we need to take remember the formula that includes the vector products of a1 and a2 and the third vector for that formula we can take it just perpendicular to the plane the Z vector the third vector for that formula to work can be a unit vector perpendicular to the plane and we can derive b1 and b2 which are the reciprocal lattice vectors and you can see that here we have 2 pi over a with respect to this and also they form their own trigonal lattice so in reciprocal space again we have a trigonal lattice and you remember that it is important for the band structure calculations to know what is your brilliant zone brilliant zone we can construct it by vintners eights method which is to find the region around the reciprocal lattice point the region in space with for which this point is the closest lattice point to any point in that region so here is the next lattice point here here's the next lattice point here here's another one here and then we just go along the line connecting two lattice points and make a cut halfway and we repeat this for all directions around and we find that it's a hexagon so the first Brillouin zone is the space inside this hexagon gamma is the name of the point in the center of the first Brillouin zone as we already saw before so that's K equals zero point and interesting points that we're gonna be one wanting to look at are these K and K prime points K and K prime points will play a huge role in the graphene band structure I will tell you a little bit later on why they're called K and K Prime and what's the difference between them okay how are we going to find the band structure we can use a tight binding approach you remember tight binding approach you allow for hopping coupling between the lattice sites and you also have some energy of being on a lattice site and then from this you build a wave function assuming some UNH's ads which includes the orbitals so eigenstates of an electron on one particular lattice site on one particular atom are called orbitals and then you hope from one orbital to the next by some tunneling J before when we consider this tight binding model in its pure form in its conceptual form we just introduce J as is now we have a particular lattice of particular atoms and so we're going to look you know build J in a little bit more detail so we will a will emerge from this calculation so this is a tight binding approach but I'm not going to just say J is equal to one electron volt or something like this I'm going to construct it based on this lattice and based on the wave function given this opposites so this is a collection of plane waves this should be already you should be comfortable with these kind of construction from previous examples and this includes a K vector R are the vectors in real space so it they belong to G which is I guess the Griffin lattice that's what they means by G here and there is this function which comes from the orbitals so what is this function Phi we are going to say that it is a function that it loses the probability to be on atom a or probability to be on atom B which are going to be Phi 1 of x and v 2 of x so these two functions will have a peaks at the position X 1 of the first atom and a position X 2 of the second atom in fact you can see from this construction that this is a this function is built in k-space and that you can be on anywhere on on the real lattice this sum goes over the entire lattice it tells you that actually these coefficients B 1 and B 2 tell you how much of your electron lives on one sub lattice on the a sub lattice or on the B sub lattice so you just look at the blue points and that's one sub lattice and that corresponds to B 1 and you just look at the yellow points and that's another sub lattice and that's a function B 2 so that but that's also a very natural anzats for us because we know that we have a unit cell with two atoms and so this corresponds to having a lattice with the basis of two atoms probability to be on one atom and on the other litem in the in the unit cell is given by B 1 and B 2 and so like I told you we stuck a little bit back to arrive to a tight binding model and therefore we consider this Hamiltonian which is just a Hamiltonian of an electron living in the graphene lattice so it has a the free particle component and this potential which can finds electron either to an atom at position X 1 that will be atom a our atom at the position X 2 that would be atom B and this potential repeats itself with the periodicity of the lattice which is given by these vectors R and of course this potential has some kind of an extreme point at X equal to X 1 or X equal to X 2 for that other term so what do we need to solve to find a band structure very fundamentally we need to solve a Schrodinger equation and so we have to take the wave function and plug it in to the Schrodinger equation to find G of K find our dispersion relation and those are going to be our bands that's what we're going to do now I already showed you before that you can represent this shorter equation as some kind of a matrix right where you have inside this matrix you have matrix elements which are on the diagonal the eigenstates of some Hamiltonian and off diagonal there are transitions between different states and in this case for the basis of this matrix we can choose the probability to be either on sub lattice a or sub lattice B so we going to project it onto on these five functions here and then this form if we project the Schrodinger equation on to the five functions here we are need to calculate various matrix elements or example we need to calculate matrix element between phi1 and phi2 and the full wave function side and we also need to calculate the matrix element of this hamiltonian for function Phi and sine so if you project this showing your equation onto Phi 1 and Phi 2 you're going to get two equations of this form and why are we projecting it so that we can build this matrix and then it will be very easy to solve the Schrodinger equation because we just need to diagonalize this matrix and that's going to give us the energy band solution so this is why we're doing this but what we need to do is to calculate this matrix element and this matrix element now what is this Delta u Delta u just comes from applying this Hamiltonian to the wave function Phi so it contains this V atomic for X 1 and X 2 so this is a bit of a lengthy expression to carry this H around and so it's replaced by Delta u in this in this map okay so our plan is to look for a solution in this form where Phi is given by a combination of being on sub lattice a and sub lattice B and then solve a shortened ur equation which we rewrote in projection 2 Phi 1 and Phi 2 this way that's going to create a matrix 2 by 2 matrix which we diagonalize and find the energy solutions this is just our way of solving the Schrodinger equation here we calculate these matrix elements that we need here so if you look at sy and Phi to take the matrix element between Phi and Phi right remember this is an integral of Phi sy they are over the entire space that's what the matrix element is and if you take an integral five times five that's going to be one because all the wave functions are normalized and the probability to find a particle in the wave function integrated over the entire space is one therefore if you take sy with Phi the matrix element of that you're gonna get from five one you're gonna just get B 1 here so Phi 1 and PSI I'm gonna give you B 1 and from be on from Phi 2 here you're gonna have B 2 times the integral of Phi 1 and Phi 2 right so you plug in this fly into you plug in this Phi into the sy and then take a matrix element between them so you're gonna have the integral of Phi 1 and Phi 2 and you're gonna have this term which we should discuss in a bit of detail this is where the tight binding approach begins to kick in so this term comes from e to the IKr here from this on that's that we've made that these are plane waves living in a tight binding potential in a periodic potential and for the for it to be tied binding we only going to include for today the nearest neighbor terms all the others are going to be zero so electron cannot hop from a yellow atom all the way here it can just hop to the nearest atoms and what this creates for us is we have to substitute for our just vectors a 1 and a 2 that's what we have to substitute for our and that will create three terms here one is unity because that's just the position of atom itself and then i ka 1 + i ka 2 so that's going to be a very important pre factor here so we have a very similar expression for the matrix element of fly to with side so if we take integral here 5 2 with side we're going to have B 2 because of the integral of Phi 2 and Phi 2 in up side so we're gonna have this B 2 and then we're gonna have B 1 times the integral of Phi 2 Phi 1 and the same prefactor with a different signs here okay so we're going to go forward by calling this integral here gamma 0 and we're going to say that both of them are the same gamma 0 here and here so Phi 1 complex conjugate Phi 2 is the same as Phi 2 complex conjugate v 1 because this integral is real so we're gonna have them be the same we are going to see that we're going to call this pre factor alpha this is just not to carry these expressions around okay so we've calculated the matrix element of psy and Phi I our shortened gur equation was also including Phi Delta u sigh so we need to calculate this term which is the transition from one sublattice to the other over the confining atomic potential so if we do this calculation we're going to find an expression which is very similar in structure because the integral of Phi 1 with Phi 2 will be some number it will be gamma 1 for example but the integral of Phi 1 with itself with Phi 1 over this Hamiltonian will actually be 0 because this cameltoe nyan corresponds to a transition between atoms and therefore this expression just has B 2 and gamma 1 which we abbreviated this integral with an another pre-factor which is the same as for the other calculation which we called alpha and so by doing this basically taking these matrix elements between Phi and Phi with atomic potential we reconstruct shorten your equation in the matrix form like I promised to you in this case we already moved you of K from the right to the left and the matrix equation is just this two-by-two expression here this is the Schrodinger equation just expressed in terms of the parameters that we introduced gamma 1 alpha and gamma 0 and we need to solve for e of K how do we solve we find a determinant so this term times this term minus this term times this term equal to 0 and we can just find U of K by solving that that equation that is just a essentially a quadratic equation okay so it's a little tedious but this is the solution so this is a solution of the tight binding sure anger equation for a graphene lattice for a hexagonal lattice this is what it is now we already plugged in a 1 and a 2 here now pointing this way and that's why you have K X K Y here and a which is the lattice constant the distance between atoms sorry and you have gamma 0 here the integral that we've calculated before also in this expression now you can plot it this is what you're going to get so this is a plot in k space of the energy bands because it's a two-dimensional material truly two-dimensional material we can conveniently plot it in 3d and use the third axis for energy so you have K X K Y and the third axis is energy and you have this magnificent structure which is just this solution here given here it has two bands thanks to this plus minus here as plus minus gives you two bands why do we have two bands what determines the number of bands right number of atoms in the unit cell or number of orbitals available per unit cell right in this case each atom has one PZ orbital and we have two atoms so we have two orbitals per unit cell so a tight binding calculation should give us two bands should give us two that and there is a band gap so you can see this hollow region around here that there are no States the bands are repelled it's a band gap but there is also something very peculiar and rather unique to graphene is that there are these six points where the bands cross and they don't repel each other there is no band gap opening at these points and those are the K points they are K and K prime points they are the corners of the brilliant zone so at these corners remember I told you at the edges of the brilliant zone what all these models give you the tight binding the free electron nearly free electron model that at the edges of the Brillion zone there is a gap opening in the spectrum well in this case in these particulars six points it is not happening and that's because of that factor alpha K which has one plus e to the I okay e to the i ka and so on so it's thanks to this factor alpha at those points there is a cancellation of this interaction term between the bands and the band's become degenerate at those points however in the middle of the brilliant zone which is this gamma point here there is a huge difference between the bands and that's because of the you can think of it as a bonding and the antibonding orbitals in between the two atoms two atoms of carbon okay so here is a here upstairs is the picture from before I need to erase some stuff or it erased itself great here is a picture from before and here is a just a cut through it a simplified view which makes things clear so this is a card going from gamma to cane from gamma to K to K point to one of these degeneracy points if you cut across there you will see the two bands the blue and the red and you will see that these two bands they cross at the K point and they make this degeneracy here there is no energy gap at K points if we now look from the top at the band structure we will see the brilliant zone like this this hexagon those are the K points and remember I told you that there are K points and K prime points so the difference between them is that they belong to two different valleys of graphene they are not equivalent what does it mean that the K and the K prime are not equivalent it means that if you are sitting on the at this K point you cannot come up with any reciprocal lattice vector G that will bring you into the K prime point so if you sit here and you go by G in any direction g 2g 3g - 3g in any direction you will always hit another k point and there are three K points in the corners of the Brillion zone and then there are three other points which are called K Prime that you can never reach by going by primitive by reciprocal lattice vectors so you can never reach those points and that's why these two are not equivalent and that mean that there are two valleys in graphene that mean that the electrons in one Valley in principle cannot cross into another Valley unless we allow for some additional physics mechanisms for them to do that in this pure calculation these two values are separate those like to cease of electrons living in the same space but not seeing each other like there is a parallel world now these points these K points how are the the main focus of Griffin research and what makes it extremely interesting this is why so the gap is zero there essentially that means that the valence and conduction bands meet together why is that it's because we have two bands in graphene and we have two electrons per unit cell right each of the PZ orbitals has one electron but remember we have spin spin up and spin down and that means that only the one of the bands is fully occupied and the other band is fully filled so if we had a band gap we would be in a semi conductor situation where all of these states would be filled with the two electrons per unit cell and all the states above will be empty so this would be the conduction band and the valence band and we are in a semi conductor scenario here now in graphene what we have is all of these states are filled however all of these states are empty but there is no gap between them you can take an infinitely small energy and go between the valence band and the conduction band so graphene by our definition is then a metal reffing is a metal because of these K points there is another very very interesting thing about this band structure and graphene is the shape of dispersion relation whatever we looked at so far always had the parabola dispersion relation like is shown here this is for the conduction band and for the valence band I told you at every band minimum we can expand the band structure to be a parabola around the decay point which is the band minimum now here is the band minimum this red point but it's not quadratic it is actually linear so this dispersion relation is Lin given by this formula energy is proportional to momentum so who can remember another particle for which this is the case the photon right for a photon you have a speed of light times momentum gives you energy and this is said what this is not a photon this is a Fermi on this is an electron but it has a dispersion relation of a photon so another object that has this dispersion relation is a relativistic electron so the electron traveling at very high velocities close to the speed of light would have this kind of dispersion relation and those electrons are solutions of a quantum mechanical Dirac equation which is a form of Schrodinger equation for an electron and for this reason this kind of band structure is called a Dirac cone and this Fermi velocity in quote marks is kind of like the speed of light for electrons in graphene it is much slower than the speed of light this is what it actually is this is a parameter you can calculate from the band structure you can actually tell what this slope of this cone is supposed to be and this velocity is you know plays the role of the speed of light so this is why people say that study relativistic electrons in graphene without needing to accelerate electrons to extremely high velocities they're automatically traveling at this graphene speed of light velocity so conceptually it's very interesting and it gives rise to a lot of interesting physics phenomena like for example tunneling through the barriers without retroreflection which is called client Halloween I am NOT don't have time to explain it to you today unfortunately but I encourage you to look up client tunneling in graphene something that was envisioned for relativistic particles but could not be observed with real relativistic particles but in graphene is possible now the meaning of this VF is also that no matter what the energy level is in this dense structure you can raise the chemical potential and fill part of the veil conduction band or you can be in the valence band but no matter where you are these particles travel with the same speed whereas in a more standard band structure of course the more you fill the band they higher the kinetic energy the larger the momentum the larger the velocity because the velocity is just a derivative de decay right here dadk will change with P and here the ADK is independent of P so these are some of the bizarre and interesting consequences of having a linear dispersion relation like you have in graffiti okay that's what I wanted to tell you about graphene today there is a lot more to discuss and I wish I could tell you more but let's look at something else which were we can put our knowledge to use and it's a carbon nanotube carbon nanotube is a tube of carbon atoms and how you get it is by taking a sheet of graphene and rolling it into a tube okay this is not how actually you do it right nobody actually was able to take a sheet of graphene and roll it into a tube so far although people were able to unzip a nanotube they took a nanotube and cut it and made a little piece of graphene out of it that was possible chemically but not the other way around but conceptually this is what you do so for example here is a graphene sheet and you can imagine cutting taking a cut like this taking a cut like this and now taking atoms from the bottom and making bonds right so now atoms on the corners have only Bonz the yellow ones and the yellow ones here have two bonds and you take the atoms with two bonds and connect them with the atoms with missing bonds on the other side and they become happy each of them has three bonds 3sp bonds and of course one p orbital sticking out and you make this object with all the chemical bonds satisfied and the few orbitals available for traveling around so this particular one the the nanotube you make this way is called an arm-chair nanotube and the reason why it's called arm-chair is because the edge looks like this and it reminded somebody of an armchair not my choice I would have called it I don't know what but this is not the only way that you can roll a piece of graphene and make happy bonds with atoms on the other side in fact there is a huge number of ways and in principle infinite number of ways to roll graphene an armchair way is only one of them more generally what the way you roll it is by defining a rolling vector which is n times going along vector a1 from graphene right the a1 and a2 are these little vectors here which are the primitive lattice vectors of graphene going n times along and a1 and M times along a two will always give you a nanotube so here is a general example where the equivalent points on nanotubes are the red points here so this is how it's going to be rolled this is the vector C in this direction so this is a vector C MN and now this vector is a vector T and this is a vector of translation along the tube so there are two natural ways for an electron to travel in the tube one is to go around the tube and their vector C is the important one it's the role vector where you start with this point and you end up at the same point after you cross you traveled for vector C along the circumference and the vector T is just traveling along banana tube so nanotubes is an example of a one-dimensional molecule one dimensional solid so it's a real 1 dimensional structure because the electron can live the wave function of the electron can live in the entire circumference occupy the entire nanotube in this direction and then can travel as a particle along the tube so the third direction is free and this direction is confined and we already confined in one direction because we are on the graphene sheet now the gray region here is the unit cell of a nanotubes crystal so depending on the vector C it can be a pretty huge unit cell right all the atoms of carbon that are in the gray area are inside one unit cell so there can be something like n times M atoms or of that order so there are there are a lot of atoms in a unit cell and that means we're gonna have a lot of bands right because each of them brings a band so that all makes sense right so it's also reasonable why the unit cell can be so large right because we to define a unit cell we want to start with a lattice point and then end up on another lattice point and so for this reason you have to travel by vector to hit another carbon atom there are no other carbon atoms in the path in the path here until you reach this one that's why this is the size of the unit cell and in the direction of rolling in the C direction it's obvious this is you know anywhere you are on a nanotube it's very different so you have to go all the way around to complete the unit cell and so then nanotubes is built by stacking unit cells like this on top of each other so the next unit cell will be here but this is actually the size of two so they will go up and up and up and the dashed line on the other side will be the same as makes sense so these are some common examples we already know the armchair tube actually it's a bit confused here this one is the armchair this one is the zigzag so zigzag is the tube where you can trace these kind of line along chemical bonds and so it actually turns out that to make an armchair tube your C vector has to have NN has to have the same indices for a 1 and a 2 so this means the C vector is n times a 1 plus n times a 2 so you go like that through the graphene and for zigzag you just go in one direction I think this is also confused here and then you can also have an arbitrary kind of tube which is then called the Cairo tube so then you have m and n different indices and and Y is called chiral is because you can see the the lines are tracing through the tube like this so it wraps the sheet of graphene wraps like this okay so this is the nomenclature now what are the consequences of this wrapping and periodicity for the band structure the general approach we're going to have is we're going to say this is essentially graphene this is a sheet of graphene just rolled up and what does this rolling up give us it gives us a periodic boundary condition on the K vector so we're already familiar with boundary conditions we saw that when we have a finite size crystal we only can occupy discrete K State's remember have a continuous band that we obtained from a solution of some model like the tight binding model but we also have to remember that we have only n unit cells in this crystal and that means that only n points in this band structure are allowed K vectors and in fact what we used to derive these end points were periodic conditions even though that was maybe not the most physical thing because the crystal is not a periodic crystal meaning that one end does not connect to the other electron traveling this way does not appear on the other end but the result is always the same regardless of boundary conditions but in this case of the nanotubes we actually have periodic boundary conditions you travel around the loop and you arrive to the same point and so in before we looked at these born from Carman boundary conditions which told us that the allowed values are some integer divided by the number of cells in the crystal in the directions and one and two and three and only these values for M 1 and M 2 M 3 integer are the allowed K vectors in the case of graphene and carbon nanotubes we have two things going on we have travel around along the circumference and there we have a periodic boundary condition and we have free travel along the other direction so what that's going to do to the graphene Bell structure I showed you these points here that are they allowed points now we have this two-dimensional band structure and periodicity in one of the directions will reduce this two-dimensional picture to one dimension where the allowed K values will be given by the red lines crossing through the main structure so these cones here are the six Dirac cones zooming into this region and now looking at them at an angle we can see that the yellow is the occupied so the Fermi level is at the zero energy and all the states below are occupied the white half of the conserve are not occupied and now because of we are in a nanotube only states along the red lines are the allowed ones that's due to the periodic boundary condition that's expressed in this form in terms of vectors t1 and t2 for the graphene lattice so now that's very interesting depending on how the nanotube is rolled the slopes of these red lines will change and they will go through different points in k-space so imagine that none of these lines hits a k point none of them hits this point where the gap goes to zero that means for any allowed value of K there is a gap because in the graphene structure there is only one point where gap goes to zero that's the K point so if these lines don't cross the K point there is a gap and so by creating a carbon nanotube we essentially gapped graphene so graphene was not gapped graphene always has these Dirac cones where the gap is zero but that the carbon nanotube will be gapped but not always depending on the rolling vector so here are the gray shapes which are the Brillouin zones and the K and K prime points are the corners of the zones and remember you need to hit one of the corners and if you hit one of the corners with a black line which represent the allowed values of K so black lines are where K's are allowed by the periodic boundary conditions if you hit a boundary of the brilliant zone then you have no gap and your tube is called a metallic tube because you are crossing the Dirac point and so for the armchair and the zigzag tubes it happens to be the case that you hit can K prime points in this case and K points in this case so for this particular rollin vectors 1010 you're gonna have 20 States I believe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t yeah 20 states so it's 2 and and you go through one of the K points that means there is no gap it's a metal now for zigzag tube which is a going this way in 1d agonal cuts you also hit one of the key points and so there is a band which has no band gap with the other band so that's also a metal this is some kind of a different zigzag tube with eleven zero so this is 12 zero this is 11 0 so both are zigzag but slightly different rolling vector length and in this case you actually don't hit any key points so in the zigzag case you can be a metal or a semiconductor so if I project this onto the energy axis this is the energy axis and this is some K where I here is my drag point the allowed values of K can be including the Dirac point or not including the direct point and that makes a difference between being a metal or a semiconductor now you can work out for all possible rolling vectors whether you're going to have a metal or a semiconductor and it turns out that there is a general formula that when the rolling vector satisfies this expression 2 n 1 plus n 2 or 2 n plus n is a multiple of 3 then you have a metal this is just you can work it out from looking at the band structure of graphene and if you put this equation to to a visual representation like this then if this is a point 0 0 then these are all possible rolling vectors that you can have they stopped at this line because they will be equivalent if you if you cross this line to the bottom you will find in the same nanotube basically as one of these if you go in this direction due to the hexagonal symmetry of the graphene lattice so this is the armchair tube along this vector along this vector it's zigzag and all these in between are chiral and then the field circles are semiconducting tubes and the open circles are metallic so along the armchair edge you can see that they are all open circles always you're going to hit a key point along the armchair direction and along the metallic direct zigzag direction you have a mixed metal or semiconductor situations so this is the difference in the band structure what I was trying to explain with these cuts so each of the cuts gives you a band you have a two-dimensional graphene band structure for each of the cuts you can plot how energy of wolves along that cut and then you can plot them all on top of each other because in the reduced zone scheme all the bands will live in the same brilliant zone now we have a one dimensional brilliant zone because of this additional quantization condition we live along these cuts and when we have twenty cuts like in this case that means we have twenty bands and some of the lower bands are represented here so when you include the K point in one of the cuts and you go along that cut you're gonna see a linear dispersion relation close to the K point and that's gonna be a metallic tube if your card goes a little bit off to the side of the Dirac point of the K point your lowest energy band is gonna look like a parabola why is that because here is a cone and imagine that you are cutting the cone with a slicer a little bit off of the center of the cone you cut it a little bit off of the center of the cone you're gonna have a slice that looks like this you cut it here and that will be this red band here that's the slice that I just showed you all right but then you have these you slice up the cone with two times and bands and you're going to have two times and cut slices and they will all go to higher and higher energy as you move away from the cone you'll line them all up and this will be the best structure of the nanotubes so statistically wise arm-chair is always metallic zigzag is two-thirds metal and one-third semiconductor chiral are same ratio it is actually a little frustrating from the experimental point of view because you may want a nice metallic conducting nanotubes for building an electrical experiment or you may want an ANA tube with a gap for some other device like a transistor or some optical device where you want to excite photons across the gap but when you grow nanotubes you normally don't control this and and em you don't control this chirality you grow a million of them and they will all wrap how they please and so some two-thirds of them will be metallic another third of them will be semiconducting and the one you take will have this probability you will not know so people are actively researching ways to select them based on chirality and there is some progress in this in this direction so that will be a great advance for nanotubes because they are of course proposed in all kinds of applications so this is a general formula for this band structure so I told you you slice up the Dirac cone this is the energy band structure for an arbitrary nanotube you can see that it's an energy versus K parallel K parallel meaning momentum along the tube that's where you are not confined K perpendicular is confined so it different values of K perpendicular give you different bands in a nanotube so this is a function of K parallel m and and are the components of the rolling vector and this index P just enumerates the bands so that's just an integer that enumerates the bands so you can get for any chiral nanotube a band structure based on this formula the values of K are restricted K perpendicular are restricted to these numbers you cannot have any other k / particular due to the periodic boundary conditions and these are some examples of calculations using that formula for different rolling vectors and once again you can see that sometimes you have no gap sometimes you have no gap sometimes you have a gap depending on numbers and and M okay I think that's where I'm going to stop today and I'll see you on Thursday
