 so here are some flexible all that so who are you so my name's Tom Taylor I work for CPI the center for process innovation we're at tez on UK that's in the UK in the north of the UK we're a technology and innovation center so this is a flexible OLED you bend it it's printed on plastic and we have coated the plastic with a membrane barrier that keeps moisture from damaging the electronics out normal plastic than the device would fail very quickly whereas this device last for several months in operation so that's all that that's flexible and with plastics and what I'm looking at behind there is which is why that's the the electrodes deposited on the back the aluminium electrode and then you've got a transparent electrode on the front and the light emitting material is glowing green and did you tint it for green or how does it work how do you choose colors we so you can do any color you like this screen color is very possible is popular with us because this is printed for a medical device which I've got here this is a device glows green which patients wear at night and it reverses the effects of to eye diseases that cause blindness one is age-related macular degeneration and the other is diabetic retinopathy which is a disease that all diabetics suffer from of course is blindness and in old age so actually this is a medical use of flexible OLED that's fact so where would where would the patient use this so typically to the patient's go blind because they suffer from poor blood circulation and at night dr unlike most organs in the body the eye is highly active at night the rods without much light having to strain at full power to see any light part of the eye the cones go to sleep at night but the rods are wide awake and they use up more energy than the eye can supply so with old people and diabetics the rods become leaky and protein gets deposited on the eyeball causing the patient goes steadily blind standard treatment is laser ablation or an injection in the eyeball but eventually the patient loses their eyesight this treatment puts a very dim glow into the eye this shows it beans but showing it so it can be squashed so we've squashed it over 5,000 times all right that's the demonstrate it truly is flexible what kind of other users are there for flexible all right so the internet of things you can print output so you can tell so one of them is card games board games the output on safe packaging you can tell how much product that's left inside gonna be in clothing could be on clothing yep relax of all stretchable nice what are you showing over here so what kind of other things does a CPA do and so so the CPI is a technique technology and innovation center this biologics facility is where we've developed scalar technology for DNA based medicines meds modern medicines be personalized treat cancer and other diseases personalized by DNA by DNA by the individual's DNA so you take the DNA of the person and then you can give them unique medicine just for that person just for that it work and it was it just research seven of the top ten drugs are made this way based on protein a very specific so the non-toxic unlike small molecule drugs so they're given to each patient individually based on their DNA that's the idea yes and this is already in the its mass production this is so some of these medicines are in mass production but it's the future so what we do is develop the Diagnostics to measure the DNA but also you need cheaper ways of manufacturing it because making the medicines by today's technology and steel vessels is very expensive to some of these anti-cancer treatments cost a hundred thousand dollars so what we're developing is the ways to mass manufacture individual medicines so the machine is by the bedside in the hospital and it makes the medicine individually how soon are you ready with that how does it work while we're working with the biggest drug companies companies like astrazeneca GSK get it out as soon as I get it out in the next yep five years all right what are we looking at here so here is into the Internet of Things this is a company spin out from London University have developed a glucose sensor measuring blood glucose the patient breathes on the sensor so instead of pricking picking their thumb to get a glucose measure me they can breathe love it what we've done is devout scale-up method for printing the circuits for them so this is this is this you just breathe in it and it tells you how you are with the diabetes stuff yep so this diabetics have to measure their glucose level several times a day to check their insulin pump is working set correctly which means a finger prick whereas this is just assume thing that Britain's not very nice if you have to do it several times a day even one time is not nice and very just a breathe into your SmartWatch yeah and then it will tell you how it is and it how far is that this is probably a year or so away from just a year and you would have a sensor like this on your Smart Watch or on your something if I can't quite say exactly how they're gonna but how's it going to be a reliable compared to a frickin compared with blood that's that was their University innovation was to get sensor reliable enough to be in use where we we come in we are not the inventors we come in to help people make it mass production of mass produce it that's all that's awesome scale that's the most important part of Edward technology rights the area where the UK lags behind that's what catapult centers like mine do is help companies translate these ideas to financial Rihanna UK is lagging behind compared to the US or a well compared to most developed countries Germany Korea the u.s. we're very good at inventing we've got very good universities but then you get out of this out to make it real yeah people have to go somewhere else and that's very important we're trying to reverse that we're trying to get more of it made real in the UK and we're going to get in here to here with here printed antenna or the Internet of Things these are silver ink but we've got a series of carbon and graphene amassing all right to try and take metal out of the systems to make them easier to recycle so if the metal atom sir this is not metal this one is metal yeah but with somewhere here put a carbon 1 i've got carbon ones cry right you're taking the metal out and they're related to these this year there's a company in the UK called pragmatic printing they've developed and all printed a chip this is a non silicon chip into plastic electronics or chip that they can print by the million and the idea here is to get intelligence on to packaging so with this antenna and this chip you put the power from your phone using near-field technologies you can interrogate the chip and put information into the device and then take it out ask device how fulla T's or state the quality of the product and it will transmit that I just ended chip so it's a printed chip but how does it compare with an ARM processor what can I do it's like very basic so um so the company that's invested in pragmatic printing one of the company's venture funds is supported by arm this is where I am sure that the arm techcon is sure the flexible arm processor of the future yeah that's are they probably working there it could well be I don't know what your that specific example but it could well be this technology to give you an idea intel make 100 million microcystis a year and they sell for about a hundred dollars you can make a hundred million a day a year until make about 100 million a year I'll make closer to a trillion a year and they retail for about ten dollars are now in every mobile phone pragmatics model is to make trillions for less than a penny less than a cent alright well I me I think they're saying 12 billion or something right so but this could be trillions of chips from for even much cheaper and it could be even ARM processors yes it could be any well at the moment they're fairly simple yeah circuits and are they are the trustor prototyping or are they real are they even use somewhere so that they're at the prototype and so they could make these in the thousands we are working with them to develop the technology so that they can make them in the millions to take it to market so you're helping those guys to bring it to real yeah I scale it up how far is it but they can make at the moment they can do their pilot processing in our fab and they're now investing in the technology to take it to the next stage of development have so maybe Nick here and the longer it's hard let me next video defense what's this this one this is printed copper so this is real this is roll-to-roll printing of copper circuitry developed by cambridge in technology this is so companies can send a circuit design to CPI and we print going to printing a seed layer and then we develop that that's Leslie jus circuits roll-to-roll and we will then post back the circuit to the company or further process it so the this near-field communication chip the copper copper antenna was done using this inkjet printing test technique it can be done roll-to-roll well why do you have faced right here that's I think I've mentioned that that's the that's the the mask for the awesome so really COMPOR word to all these awesome things coming to market you'll see these in the next five years so you could you staying busy we're very busy yes our fav is full it's great and expanding yes we've just opened a graphene lab to bring in graphene inks and that's looking at taking metal out of packaging and antennas sticking to make material stronger but also conductive to take weight out of outer products so that's where that's the next development but the big thing coming along the line for us is the Internet of Things cool it's going to keep you busy oh great did you send me a link
