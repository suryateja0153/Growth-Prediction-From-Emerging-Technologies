 nano online simulation and more for nanotechnology welcome everybody and thank you Mark for this very kind introduction what we are going to do is as Mark already told you we are going to talk about the high frequency application of carbon nanotube transistors this is a quite large topic and that's why I got a chance to split this presentation of the two talks today I will talk about fabrication characterization and the compaq one of these kinds of transistors and tomorrow i will i'm going to talk about the multi-scale simulation framework we are trying to develop in our Center for advancing electronics trace let me start my presentation with two claims about seeing cheifetz so analog high frequency applications are the most suitable entry point for CNT fence and the second claim is that device linearity this is a very special property of CNT feds is most valuable for unlock high frequency applications during my talk today i'm going to motivate these two claims i will give you some examples and explanations and that you can understand these two claims about CNT vets closely related to these two claims are the following two challenges we have to make sure that we can provide access to these intrinsic material properties in fabricated devices and we have to make sure that it's in T vets they are going to build can be utilized in applications so the main idea of our class that is of our centers to come from the materials to very symbol transistors to more sophisticated transistors high frequency transistors and circuits and systems I would like to discuss with you many many different topics but it's not a good idea to put everything within 45 minutes so I decided to present only selected topics but I have prepared some more topics for further offline discussions after my presentation if you're interested in what I really like the cover is the following I would like to motivate why should i use seen T vets for unlock high frequency applications I want to discuss with you the challenges in designing and manufacturing zinta vets I would like to give you an overview of the current status of the CNT for technology for high frequency applications I would like to show you the applicability of our compact model seachem for CNT feds so you always need a compact model if you want to build circuits and systems with the technology and if i have time i will give you some more details about some benchmarks or design studies we have done so far as a backup and for our offline discussions he can talk about trap and use a parent linearity of CNT efforts you can discuss intensively by current physics-based compact models feel to predict the behavior of the CNT fits correctly i can give you some more further details about application of seek m4n log and digital applications or you can also discuss scientific manufacturing challenges and you can discuss the pros and cons for different manufacturing methods for CNT fits now it's time to start with my real presentation and let's talk about the device linearity I mentioned this word linearity several times before but now it's time to explain your water lean with device linearity Nets has the look at these gadgets on the left hand side we see the transfer characteristic and on the right hand side the related transconductance I sketch the transfer characteristic ins actuary that in a certain bias region we have a linear relationship between the train current and the gate wall and if we see that a transistor has such a linear relationship between the output current and the input voltage we say that this device is linear sometimes it's very difficult to decide by visual inspection alone if it transistors linea or not that's reason why we also have a look at the transconductance so the derivative of the current and if you have a linear relationship in the transfer characteristic we have a flat trans conductance in the same bias which on the next slide I'm going to explain you why we claim that this device linearity is essential in communication systems one very typical communication system is a cell phone knife on for example and to understand what I'm going to explain you we have to disassemble the iphone we have to look inside iphone and if we do this we can find many different components and one of the most important component an iphone is a circuit board and this is shown here this is a circuit board on iphone 5 you find many different electronic components there you find the digital processor you find a memory you find the power management unit there but we have also one part which is called der f front end which many different analog modules which we need for the communication so if you're for example if you talk to somebody with your cell phone if you download videos and you'll watch the videos and if you send your photos to the cloud all the Gator has to go through this are that the change is that the customers so you you want to have higher volume to be transmitted and this transmission must be very very fast and this is very challenging for the electronic components we have at our front end it's very challenging in terms of the spectral efficiency and the transmission speed because both are limited by the signal distortion of the electronic components we have here and by the battery lifetime videos you have been handheld telephone and if we want to send a lot of data and it's very fast you need a lot of power let's have a look at this pie chart here very have visualized a typical breakdown of a power consumption of a handheld telephone so we see that one-third of the powers consumed the processor one quarter is consumed in the screen but almost half of the power is consumed in our front end so if you want to meet the expectations by the customers for higher wall human high-speed data transmission we have to do something if you want to do it with our handheld telephone so our claim is now that the device linearity could help to meet future communication demands that we are able to reduce the amount of power we need at our front end to understand it's better let's have a look at this very simplified pictures assume that we want to or that we feed in a sinusoidal signal into the gate of a transistor if you have a look at a Fourier transform ization transformation of this signal you see a single peak in the frequency spectrum in a first step let's assume that we feed this signal into a transistor which has a nonlinear relationship between the output current and input voltage and if we do so we see that the output current is distorted so the signal you feelin is distorted and if you make a Fourier decomposition of the signal we see that you not only get the peep you want to have if you also get harmonics at higher frequencies which is very bad because power is lost to these harmonics and this is not what you want to have if you use instead a virtual seen TV technology which gives us a linear relationship between the output current and the input voltage we see the signal is amplified without any distortion and we get in the Fourier transform ization only one single peak and this is in fact what we want to have all the power is now within this single peak and not in the harmonics let me summarize these findings on the next slide on the slide here so if you use a classical a conventional semiconductor technology like Silicon MOSFETs and we have a nonlinear relationship in output in the transfer characteristic the signals will get distorted due to the harmonics we have we will get interferences with other channels so we need expensive folders to get rid of these harmonics and we have higher losses and how I power consumption as I already explained on the last slide if you use instead our virtual seen TV technology which has linear relationship between output current and input voltage we get pure signals which allows for higher data rates we get simple systems so we can reduce the cost of the ship and you get the lower power consumption and does longer battery life time and the claim is now that if we can exploit the linearity in such a system who are able to it use significantly the amount of power we need for our front-end so altogether we can say that distortion or the other way around the device linearity is a major issue in mobile communication and it's a target of our class to work on this to make it possible to exploit the device linearity for these kind of systems if you want to explore this linearity we have to talk about the fabrication the design of these kind of transistors because one of the main challenges we are faced with this how to obtain and provide access to the unique intrinsic properties like the linearity of the CNT vets and how to use them for applications let's have a look on this in general the transistor properties are affected by different subjects first of all strands of the properties depends significantly on the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor material you use as a channel material so in our case it's the scene teeth it it's a scene t then we have to talk about the channel morphology we have to discuss the device architecture itself and we also have to discuss and this is very important in nanoelectronics we have to discuss the interface properties also let's start with the intrinsic property of cnts i think that most of you are very well familiar with the properties of cnts but nevertheless let me summarize the main important the most important properties here on the slide so if you have a look at the cnts itself they can have different band gaps depending on the crystal structure of the scene t itself depending on the cue ality so you can get metallic tubes and you can get same connecting cubes with different band gaps so typical band gaps on between 0 and 1 point 2 electron volts typical diameters you have for CNT sign between 0.5 and three nano meter so this is really really small diameter and all the electrons which are flowing through the CNT have to go through this very small material so in this case we really have a one dimensional transport all the electrons have the flow in one direction they have no chance go into another direction because it's a very small material only one nanometer two nanometers and this one dimensional transport gives us some very good electronic properties we can exploit so for example the first and easiest obvious one is that we have a low scattering probability if you have one dimensional transport the other one is the device linearity which is also closely related to the one dimensional transport I'm going to talk about this tomorrow in much more details what else a single CNT can carry up to 25 microm roughly which is relatively high if you compare to a very small diameter you have of such a tube we have very low intrinsic capacitances in the range of one out of rod and see you to the band structure of the CNT we can get karey velocities up to the farm glossa t of caffeine which is really high and if we have look at all these different properties and if you summarize them we see that there's really a high potential for high frequency applications with a significantly reduced signal distortion now we have to talk about the other subject the channel morphology so I distinguish roughly between three different morphologies it's a single tube channel where you have only one single tube in the channel it's a multi tube channel where we have all the lines ents and parallel in the channel and it's a soon film channel here we have more like codec network of the cnts lying on the substrate depending on the method you used to fabricate these kind of transistors you get a single tube channel and Martha tube channel or thin film transistor I have I will focus on three different fabrication methods so you can use cvd chemical vapor deposition to directly TRO you see in TS where you want to have them on a waiver you can use a dielectric for users dep to deficit the cnts but you want to have in this case you can use pre-sorted cnts or you can use a polymer transfer technique to transfer pre groans ents from one substrate to another substrate depending on the method you use to manufacture your device you're faced with different challenges first of all let's have a look at the DP methods dielectrophoresis method in the dielectric research method you try to put the cnts from a solution onto the substrate and here we have to deal with the tube placement and it's you pre sorting what we want to have is for a semiconductor device you only want to have semen conducting tubes and a channel but as I told you before depending on the quality depending on the crystal structure we can also get metallic cubes which is not good if you want to build a transistor out of it so we have two priests or dissemble you care you have to get rid of the metallic cubes but now we have to consider the channel lengths we have for example if we restricted to a channelings of 800 nanometer to to the lithography we have we need cnts which are much longer than 800 nanometer there must be 1.2 micrometer for example but if you want to pre sort these CNTs you have to treat them by ultrasonic and if you treat CTS with ultrasonic to create these seeing tease you put defects into the scientist which is not good so you have to develop smooth sorting techniques to get long pre-sorted ct's if you talk about CBD we have to talk about the catalyst this is a major issue also because the good point is you can drag a crow the cnts with cvd where you want to have them but then you have to make sure that only same exacting tubes are crowing and this is really difficult for this you have to find special catalyst for selective cube drove the other point is which on which substrate you throw the cnts if you crow the cnts on silicon oxide for example you get a codec network if you cross in teased by cvd on quads you could well aligned C&T s and this is the reason why sound groups decided to crow the cnts on quads and then to use a polymer transfer technique to put them onto the silicon oxide substrate because this is much easier to handle if you want to build the transistor out of it you have to move the transistors from quartz or silicon substrate but if you use a polymer to transfer these ents you get some contamination you get third on the cnts which is really bad because it cannot get rid of these dirt on a CNT and if you have third you have traps if you have traps you get hysteresis in the transfer characteristic of your transistor which is what you do not want to have since the only I do not have time to go into much more details about these fabrication methods but we can discuss offline the different aspects of these methods in general the general morphology determines the channel resistance and the current drive we have and does the application let's have a look at a single tube channel in a single tube channel we have one single CNT it means we have 25 micro amp what can you do with 25 milligram nothing you can build may be a difficult circuit but that's it if you are interested in analog high frequency applications you need a lot of current drive so you have to put many cities in power to get milli watt output power and if you have a look at a thin film transistor it's really really difficult they are relatively easy to fabricate but due to the chain of cnts you have so the electrons have to move from one scene to another CT to another CNT to put your gap between source and train so in this case you get a very high general assistance and if you have a high very high channel resistance you cannot build high frequency applications so thin film transistor interesting for sense applications may be in five point of view next subject this advice architecture so high divided roughly a device architecture under three different versions so we can have a global back gate C&T vet which solid it will easily fabricate we have a top gate seen t fit and we can also have a local back gate seen t fit in general the electrode design and device structure itself determine the gate control and important for high-frequency application to parasitics because in between the different metals you have you always have prosthetic capacitances and we have to eat use them to allow high frequency operation of these types of transistors the type of architecture you choose depends on equipment you have in the lab if you want to build a global decade transistor this is relatively easy and can be done in almost all labs but if you are going to build local bekheir transistors where the Gator spirit into the substrate this is very challenging you need a lot of equipment knowledge and process modules to do this since we are interested in analog higher frequency applications we have a look at our Center at the top gate CNT vets at the local Becky indifference the last subject we have to deal with in designing and fabricating CNT heads are the interface properties and two main inverse properties I have put you on the slide first of all let's have a look at a wide plot here we see a typical transfer characteristic of a multitude CNT fat and we see if you make a forward sweep and a backward sweep and view if you plot the current in the same figure we see a window in between them and gap and this is called esterases which is not good because if you bias the transistor at one point over time the bias point will change and with such technology you are not able to build circuits out of it and these are services to two traps you have due to a bad quality oxide or if you have third and Racine tea the honorary challenging issues the contact resistance or the contact properties this is data from Franklin from IBM he shows the contact resistance over embedding length so what is embedding length you have your contact you have your CNT and the length the CNT is wood into the the metal is called the embedding length and if you decrease this embedding length you see that contact resistance goes up and what else do we see that depending on the metal we use for contacting the CNT we get different contact properties let me call like this and we will see especially tomorrow that the contact and the properties of the contact significantly impacts or effects the device behavior so this were some general ideas about designing and manufacturing of CNT vets now let's have look at the current status of this technology for high frequency applications as I told you we are interested in analog high frequency applications we need a lot of current drive in level you need a lot of output power that's why we enjoyed it in multi tube CNT vets here's a typical sem picture scanning electron microscopy a picture of such a multitude multi-finger transistor or too easy we the white lines coming from the top to the bottom and these are the gate fingers we have a lot of them in parallel we have queer lines these are the source and trained fingers so we have a lot of them and the white lines coming from why up on the left to the right are the scene T's it looks like that we have our chaotic networks or similar to a thin film transistor but this is not the case here because you see in these we have fear are long enough to purge the gap between source and train so that's why it's not a thin film transistor if you are interested in to build analog applications you need around milli watt output power and you can get milli watt output power of transistor if you have 1,000 or 2,000 parallel tubes in the channel of your transistor and by the way these transistors these cds are grown by a cvd method here that's why we have a chaotic like network the good point is if you are talking about analog applications this footprint does not play any role he had we do not have to scale it down to very small dimensions like for digital applications where size really matters in this case for analog applications we don't care about the size of the transistor because we need a lot of cnts so the dimensions of such a transistor will be 40 micro meter by 40 micro meter roughly and the channel length and for this transistor type is about 800 nanometers this is due to the low to Carter pre we have in our labs the next issue is that in this case we have a lot of parasitic metal tubes in the channel of about twenty to thirty percent because at the moment these transistors were fabricated we didn't have control about the catalysts so we are not able to selectively crow only semiconducting cubes that's reason why you have zone so many metal eight cubes in a channel but also we have so many metallic tubes on a channel we have a first prototype technology which delivers quite nice well use for the peak transit frequency it's about 10 gigahertz it's it's the extrinsic value not an intrinsic value you find sometimes and literature it's an extrinsic value so video embedded nothing except for the pets and we have a output power gain of more than 10 DB the bed messages that so far you are not able to experimentally verify that we have a good device linearity and to my knowledge there's no true worldwide which has shown that these transistors provides a good device linearity but we are working on this and tomorrow I will give you some more details about how we can achieve device lingeria innocent events giving the VC IV curves they don't look linear or you have a dollar powerslave yeah from parts measurements sometimes it's a good point it's one of my backup topics you can see sometimes linearity in these transistors but this is caused by the characterization method you use you can only verify it if you use pulse measurements what else can I say about our technology we have so all the transistors are fabricated on a 54 inch wafer so we have many different dies on it on each die we have different test factors for a single tube CNT vet for multitude multi-finger CNT vets and we have transistors in a GHG configuration which allows us to characterize the high-frequency properties of these transistors now let's have a look at the characteristics on the left part of the slide we see typical single tube characteristics here it's a transfer characteristic where if you have a current of 20 micro amp roughly 25 my pram and we see we can switch off the device nicely hits the output characteristic we see as the duration of the current this quite good but if you now have a look at a multitude characteristic shown your right hand side what do we see the transfer characteristic we are not able to switch off the device due to the high number of metallic tubes we have in the channel and also an output characteristic shown here we see the impact of the metallic tubes so we get no saturation of the current which is really bad yes contact blatant contacts yes yes because there are some how functional I society's not in the scene tea itself in the channel it's due to the oxide we are using in this process that note this is a top gate now let's have a look at the some AC characteristics so AC characteristics is really interested in the high frequency characteristics of a transistors you can only have a look at Martha tube transistors because you have to measure them with a 50 ohm equipment and in single tube CNT if it has such a high impedance that are unable to to measure it with a standard equipment for I frequency characterization so here is you see only the characteristics of a multitude transistor in the transit frequency extrinsic values we see that this transa have roughly seven gigahertz and maximization frequency is also about seven gigahertz the transistor also have some ex-model the gain of about eight DB and here in this plot the intrinsic voltage gain here we see the impact of the metallic tubes the intrinsic voltage gain is only about 2.2 which is really really low and if you have a mind that most of the circuit topologies you can find they are billed or designed in such a way that they exploit the the intrinsic voltage gain this must be we are very high in typical circuit topologies if you have metallic tubes the intrinsic voltage gain is really no and this limits also that available output power but one of our partners and build the first CNT base single stage I'll Bend RF amplifier out of it so this is the circuit yeah the transistors with a feedback network and a matching Network also and by carefully designing the transistor in the circuit they were able to show 11d be linear again at two point one point three gears here we see some external data as parameters of a frequency compared to the model we have I'm going to talk about this in a minute I hope that the data I have shown you not convinced you but gave you an idea why we want to use these into efforts for analog high frequency applications the technology is there we have to work on the metallic tubes we notice and we are working hardly on this to get rid of the metallic tubes that's not an easy task and yeah but we can build right now and work applications with this kind of transistor nobody asked me why how can I build a circuit out of a trance which cannot be switched off so but if you have a look at analog applications you do not have to switch off the transistor if you use for example these transistor for small signal amplification for low noise amplifier you bias the transistor and one single bias point and you do not have to switch off this transistor so you do not have to get rid of the metallic tubes that's why we are able to build right now and low applications out of it and yet a point i want to mention is the device linearity is most valuable fan look high frequency application but so far so far nobody was able to experimental e-verify it that's why we we need something with which we can project the performance of a circuit when we can get rid of metallic tubes what happens with the properties with the performance of a circuit if you can get rid of the metallic tubes and this can be done by a compact model and this is this will be the last part of my presentation I will give you someone who knows about the compact model we have for designing these circuits this is a compact model which is which was developed and religious developing for high frequency CNT fence before I want to give you some general ideas for what do I need a compact model because I don't know if everybody is familiar with compact models so what's the purpose of a compact model the compact model allows circle design circuit simulation and if you have a good one also optimization for an existing technology so you have seen the characteristic the electrical characteristics of the CNT the technology and the model must be able to capture these properties these characteristics this is what I mean was existing technology then by the help of the compact model we can try to understand the circuit properties and how they are related to the technology so we can play with the metallic tube fraction and see how does it affect us circuit properties this is what we can do is we can do prediction explanation of the circuit and system properties for future technology notes so far we are limited to 800 nanometer channelings but maybe in two years we have new equipment we can build a 100 meter long scene tease but we want to know net tons if it's really beneficial for the circuit applications we have in mind this can be done with of all designed compact models and it gives a nice feedback for the technology development because we see which technology parameters must be improved to boost the circuit phones what about the state of the art and compact models for C&T fence so most compact models you can find the literature are designed for typical applications so for beyond CMOS applications and they are restricted to nano scale channel lengths in our case we have 800 nanometer long channels so we need a different type of model most of the models you can find are restricted to single tube C&T vets and low voltages if you are talking about analog applications we have to talk about high voltages because we need power to try to n 10 of our mobile phone most of the formulations you can find are focusing on describing the DC behavior alone but AC behavior but if you are interested in high frequency application you have to know the AC capability of your transistor you have to predict it also a preserved aside and most severe issues that almost no model which you can find it's verified by experimental data there's a lot of experimental data available the literature and we have our own transistors but if you have a look at the compact models which are available so far you find that they are not experimental verified so you see there's only little emphasis on Malta tube higher frequency analog applications we have to do something and we did something he developed our own model for Marta to high-frequency transistors if you want to build a model a compact model for Marta tube transistors where we have saving conducting tubes and pathetic tubes in the channel where we have a lot of gate fingers and parasitics we need an equivalent circuit which describes the behavior of the metaphyseal conducting tubes this red one we need a sub circuit described the metallic tubes and we need a sub circuit surrounding these two different types of tubes for describing the parasitics what else do we have to consider in all fabricated seen T fits you have short key like barriers between the metal contact and the CNT you will never get an ohmic like contact at C&T it's almost impossible to get so that's why we have the google Schottky barriers the problem is the challenges that compact modeling and the welding itself of Schottky barrier is really really complicated and so far there's no feasible physics based model available which takes into account the schottky barriers for the calculation of the current and the charge so this is reason why almost all existing compact models do not consider the Schottky barriers properly if you compare them with experiments so this is this was the reason why we decided this was another reason why we decided to develop our own compact models and in my group you have two different models we have a semi physics-based compact model called seachem and we have a physics-based compact model called chica i'm only going to focus on seachem in this presentation here what is C cem cem is a same physical large signal compact carbon nanotube fetch model for analog high frequency applications what are the features of this model this is important for the circuit designers I hope that Sam circuit designers are in this room here so we have byes dependent formulations for all internal elements its large signal model so you can use this modeling cadence to a form a parity static state analysis or you can use this model in 80's to perform a harmonic balance simulation to get into the details of the circuit and harmonics and it is torsion of your circuit for example all equivalent circuit elements have a temperature dependence and geometry dependence because we have to scale the dimensions we have to change the layout of the transistor because you have to change the gate would we have to change the number of tubes to adjust the current level to the current level we need an hour circuit if you have access to technology parameters like the faction of the medic teluk tubes with this you can make some projections what happens if you can reduce the number of metallic cubes we have a nice model included which is important for low-noise amplifiers and you also have a tredmill here's until now all transistors or transistor technologies which you can find on the market on the literature you have to do those traps and as I told you before if you have traps in your transistor you bias a transistor and after one minute the bias point isn't he advised one is here and force one sec replicate applications you see you will get totally different behavior and this must be captured by the model and this can be done with a trap model you have implemented in our CQ see cam is not only available in MATLAB it's also available in Rio de car which makes it possible to make 30 design studies with cadence 80s and all the other different commercial simulators which are available so far and the other point I want to mention is that we make use of the high come infrastructure for developing and maintaining energy standard models for our model yeah I don't know if you know hi come hi come is the industry standard model for hpts for hater attraction bipolar transistors and it's developed and maintained well by Professor Schroeder he is hosting me in tracing and you can make use of his infrastructure and make profit out of it for the ck model we have did you have a small idea about the equations which are within secam I have shown you here three equations describing the current you see it's it's not physics based its empirical based tutor shot quieres we have but this gives us the chance to not model only the DC characteristics which is shown here which I have shown you here for single two transistors and multitude transistors so the line is always the model and the symbols are the data external data we have with c-can we are also able to fit nicely the AC characteristics so we get if you have a good equipment for the transit frequency for the maximum frequency of oscillation and as I told you before it's also important for the circuit designers that you provide a model with which you can change the layout of the transistor and this is shown here so the circles are external data the crosses are the model and you see for that for different gate woods and channel and finger numbers you get a nice agreement between the predictions of our model and the experimental data for the transconductance and the peak transit frequency shown here yes so Holly also Sanjay extensions at all no then not intentionally doped yes the channel hiss yes yes yes this is the main working principle of the transistor this is this was shown young on this slide this is a typical very simplified band diagram of transistor you have the Schottky barrier here between the metal and the channel and by changing the gate voltage you change the width of the shopkeeper area and that's your control there were you control their current flowing through the transistor yeah this is a source this is a train this isn't approaching source and train and this is the gate on top of it because it's a top gate configuration yeah they are not doped they're not oh they are electrostatically controlled by the top gate you have fringing fields from the side walls of the gate and they are controlling the the conduction band here and these spacer regions 200 nanometers is about one of nine meters for now or in this case that's a little bit different so it's 300 300 300 roughly so is that a design challenge to over there gap because now if you like the problem the problem is if you lower this gap if it decrease the distance between the source and the gate you increase the parasitics so you have to find a sweet spot for optimizing these transistors for high frequency applications but you rely on the fringe in the field of the gate modulator yes yes you need to find a balance but it's not so important to use these fingering fields you can also ignore the fringing fields and by pulling this part or conduction band down you also pull down the conductor meant here but the gate controls not so bad and just not so good in this case then let me use the last 10 seconds of my presentation for the time I have to give you a very short outlook of about the benchmark circuit design status we have done so far you have already seen this picture the most important point is here shown on the right hand side we see the experimental data and the predictions power model and we see a a good agreement between experiment and simulation on this slide you see Samsung late results for a very symbol P a power amplifier where we have only one single transistor some matching networks and the civilization network and in this transistor you change the number of metallic tubes we have in the channel the impact of the metal tubes on the output characteristic is shown here so you lost well you lose the saturation of the current if you increase the metallic tube fraction in the channel and here we see that if you increase the metallic cube fraction you decrease the output power you can get because the intrinsic voltage gain goes down on the last example i want to show you and study up a ring us later build up and current mode logic so we choose a differential architecture farm see our building plot building block we put I think seven stages together and here we see the oscillation of the output voltage over time for different metal cube fractions 400 pound seven and 1.5% and you see that the amplitude 40 percent is relatively high if you increase now a little bit the metallic tubes then we heat goes down and get smaller and smaller and we only get oscillation for metallic you fraction less than two percent so what we see is that a ring oscillator is much more sensitive to the metal cube fraction then the power amplifier finally on this slide my last slide I will summarize my presentation in a few words so we know that cities have excellent unique intrinsic electrical properties and we want to use them for high frequency applications which provides very low distortion the problem we have phrase well right now is the higher number of metallic tubes we can see it here in a multitude transfer characteristic but we are working on this to get rid of these metallic cubes and we are following two different approaches you are trying to get rid of the metal tubes and a cvd based process and then a dep praise process because we do not know which technology will give us the best results and I have shown you that a compact model for high frequency applications is available it captures the characteristics for an existing technology but you can also make some projections what happens if we would use for example in our of metallic cubes and SECAM is available and maybe in a few months and a few weeks also available at nano hub needs maybe thanks a lot hey we have time for a few questions so currently we are focusing on to find a better catalysts for the cvd based process so playing with a metal particles we are using as a catalyst and in the DP process we are working on to get very smooth sorting methods which delivers a very long tubes and only some in conducting cubes yes now we have tried us to apply a very high train source voltage while switching off the same conducting tubes sometimes it's working but it's really difficult because you have seen we have a more like a codec network in this case it's very difficult and the other pointers if you are interested in high frequency applications and if you burn a sin ti metallic CNT you only burn two nanometers from the from the metallic CNT and then you have to rest of the CNT in a channel and you still have the parasitic capacitances to to these parts of the metallic CNTs which are within the channel that's why burning is not an option for us all did you consider Leo parasitic capacitances between different defense facility yes and yes it's true if they'd seen these are coming very closely together they are interacting with each other but in these technologies we have a tube density of around 10 to 50 tubes per micrometer so the distance between the cnts is very long so they are not interacting with the errata so oh you talk about the impact of metal metallic series and how they leave you be yes let's say you solve that problem yes you still have cubes of different diameters that hassle yes yes yes is that something you can suit that red branch in your voice invite people that promise blitz in tomorrow it's a good impact against the good messages no it's not a limiting factor because we need 1000 3000 tubes in the channel and all of them will have a different property a different quality but the mean value is very closely related to technology you have so if you have a technology which is working which is well-established you have different tubes but you will always have the same mean value and I said what I want to say so the statistics is playing with us okay it helps if you need so many tubes you always have to say mean value yes yes yes it's true if you're talking about digital applications that you want to use only one single tube and you want to build the process out of it for 3 billion transistors and each tube have a different reality it will have a different special voltage and now the difficulty is to build a circuit out of it if you have different flash of voltages digico applications it's not possible but for another applications it's ok hmm ya na VI if you have analyzed so it's not an issue just currents that you have the mixture of the cannon thanks marcus graphene transistors because the average of three is recognized she yes yes yes noticed all the caffeine work because they found out that caffeine cannot be used venrock I frequency applications it's the voltage gain and it's really really difficult to get to get a better voltage gain and for caffeine in here in this case it's only 22 imaginary tubes and we are sure that at one or two years we have found a method which works and which delivers has only same connecting tubes and the next point is worth caffeine at the missing bandgap it's closely related to the intrinsic college game yes common for the separation also in halligan the 719 cute citing a northwestern has downloaded through 99 1000% so if you use that as a star man we already have very good semble server there was ninety-nine point nine percent key material but these tubes are too short we have a you are restricted to a channel length of 800 meter to tell our geography we have and these tubes are much shorter so then if you use and we have used many different commercial ones you get a chain of cnts so we get a thin film transistor not a real transistor is the final device charger yes yes yes it's working no it's not an issue these space regions which are not directly on top of gate does not contribute so much to the whole general assistance so the Schottky barrier here diabetic contact as much higher resistance then these ways of agency range are you targeting yeah I found out in simulations that for the technology we have for the 800 nanometer channel length 30 gigahertz for the gigahertz would be achievable if you can get rid of the metallic cubes so this is what we want to do for the channel links we have and if you think about mobile communications mobile communications are working at two gig ads so if you have a transistor with a peak transit frequency of 1020 gigahertz is sufficient to build applications at 2p ads this is what we want to do and the next step is to shrink the channel length but for this we need in other equipment maybe one more question and then we'll take this one but Martin will be your after the talk so one more question and then I use is your channel net difference of the cartridges yes no no channelings it stings that is therefore individual to you or hold on to it no no it's fun individual cube yeah this is data from Franklin so we did not make these experiments I only use data hi it's shown here this data is coming from Franklin from Ivy I'm tired Lee some change and guys know who Franklin is no use PhD thesis here Burke error he took tlm structure hmm and extracted the taconic persistence for the different materials you have well it's a single tube okay maybe we should let some people probably thank you for a wonderful thank you thank you for being here
