 at this very moment we're busy connecting millions of Australians to the things they love but what about tomorrow see all the other things that make us human will never change the ways that we connect will we're building a smarter future we're clever innovations will change the way we live work and play for the better and one thing's for sure life will be easier giving a small time to focus on the things that really matter work smarter and faster machines will actually talk to each other so we can concentrate on the big picture communication will be the new transport immersive technologies will allow us to feel like we're in the same room even will miles apart we'll be able to be at home when we're at work and work when we're at home work and life will be truly balanced and imagine saying goodbye to waiting rooms appointments will fit around your schedule and the world's experts will be there literally at your fingertips shopping will become more social more interactive more engaging in fact the whole way that we transact will be revolutionized entertainment will take on your dimensions will create more interactive experiences that put you in the heart of the action we're making our cities smarter they'll be cleaner safer and more connected capable of responding to the here and now now tell us what we need when we need it it's gonna be amazing but no matter how much technology will influence our everyday lives there will always be some things we'll have to figure out for ourselves papertab is the world's first paper tablet pc paper tabs represent apps as physical windows working together to create a seamless experience the location of a paper tab is tracked on a desk through an electromagnetic tracker now it's helped by the user act like full screen physical windows apps at arm's reach in the warm zone show thumbnails of documents while cold tabs that are out of reach show app icons these apps can be opened by touching them with another paper tab when a tab is held by the user it's flexible touch screen allows full editing of its contents here we see a user picking up a PDF document by touching one papertab showing the DDF icons with another the document is open and navigated by bending the display allowing the user to flip through its contents without requiring buttons or swipe gestures here we see how a user uses a bend gesture to fast-forward through a video the user reverses the action by dog airing the display in the opposite direction here our user is creating a larger view by placing two paper taps together because the displays are thin it's very easy for users to draw or drag graphics across multiple tabs as you would with paper by working together paper tabs make it easier to work with multiple documents and traditional tablets emails are simply open by touching the inbox tab with an empty tap quick dog-ear creates a reply attaching a photo is a straightforward as tapping the reply with a photo the email is sent by placing it in the outbox in paper tap each app is a tablet it wakes you rightly and punctually with a gentle vibration and by so doing without disturbing those around you his law allows you to get war turning the usual morning jog to an enthralling composition having chosen an opponent well matched to you even if they're on the other side of the world with the technology of a wireless payment system it will replace your wallet as well as your apartment and car keys and what's more it will assist in keeping tabs on your finances helping to control your expenses it will keep an accounting of your nutritional input by tallying up the calories of food that you by the store and deducting the calories which you expend through physical activity in addition it will not only keep track of your weight but also the nutritional value of your diet indicating to you in a timely manner any deficiencies or over abundances of vitamins and trace minerals which you require observing the chosen diet keeley feels and understands you so well that it can easily determine if you would like a new movie or not even before you have watched it it won't let you down and at the point where different people's tastes collide it will help to find common interests and choose music for you and your partner matching both your tastes the perfect assistant is like a person's character everyone has its own unique one the S bracelet and assistant with an attitude i'm natasha and i'm here from b2i demonstrating our hydrophobic nano coating technology so I stop fishing here well I'm going to start with the tissues there's a bit of a party trick for us one of these is treated with our nano coating technology and the other one isn't now the coating is a thousand times thinner than a human hair so actually you can't see a difference you can't feel the difference but if I put these into the water you're going to see a very big difference normal tissues all wet like you'd expect cut on our hydrophobic tissue the water simply beads up and rolls up in a way your company you make it this year but we don't make tissues we make the coding so working with electronic manufacturers like Motorola and TCL we apply this technology on to electronic devices and i'm going to show you why here so normally when you get your components wet you can see that the water spreads out on the surface and in fact in this point right in here capillary action is pulling that water into the phone now on our hydrophobic phones instead of being pulled into the device the water beads up so the water molecules are now more interested in themselves than that and if i give it a little tip that water will come straight off inside the corneal it we would work with brands like Motorola and right at the end of their processing we would go on just pry the packaging and supplied in the plasma chamber which looks similar to a fridge and we'll put about 800 phones in there at once and the process goes down to a low pressure and a gas is applied and that goes both on the externals in the internals of the device you can absolutely we lost in October 2011 with Motorola and in October 2012 we launched with TCL so alcatel one touch now this we're very excited about because this is almost our next generation technology it's about similar hydrophobic benefits to splash proof but it's got a barrier technology so it's actually physically stopping the water molecules from interacting with the electronics so can you show something that enables us to have had this phone under the water for an hour and 55 minutes now we're just gonna leave it in there all night and in fact on our booth better take a standard Samson a ps3 this is a standard samsung galaxy s3 well we've applied it and we had to open it up and put it all over inside right well it's another coating which is about a thousand times thinner than a human hair so actually the coating is applied at that low vulgar low pressure and the gas so it doesn't necessarily need to get open up it can go in through out yeah we're talking about gas now well it's an that what are you signed it to me recently which I thought was very good it's almost like it's growing on the surface so we're forming these very very very tiny polymer chains on the surface of the product but very kind of like straight up to the phone no we put it into one of these plasma chamber machines so we'll put the phone in there and lower the air pressure so when you apply the gas and put it under a plasma it's going to grow all those molecules together to form of these polymers yes we can do yes sir when we work with motorola on the splash proof technology then that's actually a really important part of us being able to commercialize the technology because that way we can be right at the end of processing and we don't interfere with their production line making us very cost-effective yeah so done before for us is still just a technology we're working with pioneering brands to commercialize the process making sure that it provides everything that they need at a cost effective and industrial scale and it depends on the price of the boat so the cost is normally absorbed directly by the manufacturers so they can share her seven feet a consumer won't see any increasing cost well this is actually a water-repellent technology not waterproof okay in the world arena I know but what a creeper at the definition implies that no water is getting into the device and actually here this phone has water inside of it it's full of order room is for water is working but it's still working okay so it's going to just say it for years yeah a certain amount of time you're going to get well actually what's going to happen fest is that the phone battery will run out and we'll need to take you out but the consciousness states the managers crash surface well one of the reasons why we apply it in this plasma chamber is to get that bond with the surface so it forms a covalent bonds so permanently apply to the server jerky we have 56 pattern families protecting our patent portfolio and we actually originated as a part of the ministry of defense to protect soldiers clothing from chemical attack UK ministry yes then we've got other sectors as well so we work infiltration life sciences footwear in fact even timberland and case twists apply this technology on to their shoes k-swiss in particular is quite interesting because if you're running a marathon in their shoes you don't want notes footwear to gain any more weight you talk about the revenue not me personally I can but I do have other people here today include how we're privately yeah you ring is a wearable input device which will allow you to control the most anything you just need to wear the ring and tap on the side to start your gesture ring captures and analyzes your gesture inside of it it sends the data to your smart devices vibration and led notifies you status updates and notifications each application has its own unique gesture mark so when you want to use it simply perform the designated action gesture marks can also be edited making customization simple and easy to control home appliances simply sink or into them using your smart devices you can connect directly or by using the hub when designing ring we had to start from scratch we make numerous prototypes in which time we got smaller Alice functionality and group capturing and analyzing the fingers movement was also a challenging task in 2013 her gesture recognition technology was still in its early stages however by 2014 it has been nearly perfected it is even precise enough to detect letters now you can type test midair anywhere anytime we also provide refund make you type of quick and easy another unique feature of ring is this advanced payment solution gateway when used with GPS or IBM ring allows you to immediately make payment transactions revolutionising the way you shop we will also open API so developers to make original applications and publish in the ring store the ring store allows you to search for and install many applications we've already tested and confirmed that ring works with numerous hardware smart devices and web services so now technically your devices on he loves you daddy daddy my dream for running on the beach again in Australia no longer does that beach have to be yeah yeah but you get connection of the nerve the muscles the soft tissue providing this drape of mr. richard Norris only six days after to the heroes Christina Hager
