 such a startling effect deserves a more in-depth explanation you see as the ink penetrates the paper much of the pigment ends up below the surface reducing optical density and uniformity and just as ink gets absorbed into the paper fibers it also wicks along the paper fibers making the edges ragged with Landon Anna graphic printing a dry ink film is applied to the paper so there's no penetration and the edges are super sharp since these ultra thin film images are literally laminated to the paper they conform to its surface roughness right down to the typography of individual paper fibers this accounts for Annanagar fees extraordinary ability to match the gloss of the paper whether coated or uncoated unlike conventional inks in which the pigment particles are many hundreds of nanometers in size land and nano ink pigments are merely a few tens of nanometers these nano pigments are not only super efficient absorbers of light but they also don't scatter light these properties give land an Anna graphic printing the broadest CMYK color gamut of any printing process so broad in fact that it covers 17% more Pantone colors than offset printing
