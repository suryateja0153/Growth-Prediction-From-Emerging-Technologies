 so what we are looking at here is a computer a computer from the 1930s and it's actually a device that is working based on mechanical moving parts fast forward ten years in the 1940s you got this kind of machine that beast is actually an all-electronic computer it's not too far off in terms of conceptual ways of operation from what we have today but obviously it's a lot bigger and less powerful than what we have which now looks like this this is our computer today a lot smaller a lot more affordable and a lot more powerful now that's the you might say the information processing branch of Electrical Engineering how about the electricity generation branch of Electrical Engineering this is the generator you had 100 years ago powering your house it was essentially a an engine that would spin a generator of electricity what do we have today we have this it's a lot more powerful but it's also a lot bigger and a lot more complex and a lot more expensive so how come we haven't made the same type of progress that we have with information processing in electricity generation why is it that we haven't made all these simple small compact devices that don't involve mechanical moving parts and can harvest all sorts of waste energy and create electricity for us and what I'd like to point out is that I think and you know obviously there is a lot of technical difficulties but I'd like to suggest that the core of the problem the main reason why this has happened is one fundamental property of materials and that's the fact that conductors of electricity also conduct heat let's see how that plays out what we are looking at here is a schematic of a piece of metal in this we have all these little tiny particles called electrons electrons are charged particles that are responsible for the flow of electricity electric current means the movement of these electro now imagine I wanted to get electrons to move from one part of this material to another so that I have electric current how would I do that so one way to do that would be for instance to give electrons thermal energy heat up a part of this material and I could think of multiple ways of doing that but here's one example if I take a beam of laser and point it at the middle of that piece well I would hit that portion and that heat would basically set the electrons in that portion of the material to movement but you might say I'm being a little too clever here because there is a problem as soon as I try to heat that part of the metal what happens that heat spreads to everywhere in that metal it's not just that portion that gets heated up now what's the consequence well the consequence is that electrons everywhere in that piece of metal gain a lot of energy so all of them start moving in all sorts of random directions and as a result there is no net flow of current I have electrons moving in all directions so the outcome everything cancels out so if I wanted to have net current generated in this manner I would have to be able to localize the heat that I generate with that beam of light and what I want to discuss today is an effect that allows us to do that this is how it works or this is how I think it works in fact we don't really know the physics of it properly yet but this is how we think it works imagine that same piece of metal but now I carve out a very thin wire out of it a wire that's so thin such that its diameter is on the order of a nanometer a nanometer is roughly a billion times smaller than my height now what happens is the same piece of metal if you make it so narrow will start exhibiting different properties the flow of electrons as well as the flow of heat will change and this is not only because of this quasi 1-dimensional nature of heat transfer but also because of some additional potential quantum mechanical effects but we don't want to get into the detail of that the end result we think is this what you're looking at here is that same laser beam illuminating a portion of that metallic wire and the hot region in this case is confined to where the laser beam is the heat is not traveling across if this actually works it means that I can get electrons from that region to other places in the metal and that would give me a net flow of electricity now you might say this is something too small it's not really of a practical use but what you can do is stack many of these next to each other such that we create effectively a macroscopic bulk structure but its internal nano structure will allow it to have these additional properties like what we are talking about here now the the way we came about this effect and the way we thought about making this kind of structure wasn't by this logic that I described it started out of an accidental discovery and that was this observation take this structure this is what we call a carbon nanotube forest and what it is is essentially a forest of tiny cylindrical structures that are hollow so we call them nanotubes their diameters on the order of a nanometer or so and they are made out of carbon atoms and you can indeed make arrays of these that form both structures but they have this internal arrangement of these individual tubular structures we have a laser beam illuminating a part of this nanotube forest and as you can see on this schematic the heat is confined to the region where the laser beam is striking the structure this is a cartoon but what about reality well here is a photo of a carbon nanotube forest and on the sidewall of this this photo you can see that I'm showing a electron microscope image that actually shows individual carbon nanotubes aligned and forming this microscopic structure and this forest of carbon nanotubes is a few millimeters across so it's actually a microscopic piece that you can hold in your hand and we are illuminating it with a laser beam now if you take a camera and take a picture of the side of this forest where it's being illuminated you see this there you see a glow and the glow that you're looking at is not the laser beam it's actually incandescent from that spot that spot that's being heated by the laser beam the laser beam itself has been filtered out in this image so you see the glow any hot surface will glow and the surface is in fact at about 2,000 degrees and that's why it's glowing white-hot so we are seeing something very interesting here that we call heat trap carbon nanotubes are conductors there are conductors of electricity and conductors of heat yet in this particular setup we see that heat that has been generated by that laser beam is actually confined to where it has been generated and it's not travelling across the nanotubes that's why we call it a heat trap the heat is trapped now again we don't want to talk about the physics of it here but let's see if it has any practical consequences for us here we are looking at a little gadget that we've made using carbon nanotube forests so in that glass cube there in that glass encasing there we have a small forest of carbon nanotubes and they are being illuminated by a laser beam it's a small handheld laser beam not very different from what what you would use a little as a laser pointer and when the laser beam illuminates the sidewall of those nanotubes you see that big glow very hot at the same time if you look at the measurement device that's sitting next to nanotubes and next to this device you will see that it's demonstrating that there is an electric current flowing in the structure that electric current is essentially the result of the light that illuminated the structure and was converted to heat and then to electric current so in fact we are seeing that this heat trap effect allows us to create a converter of light to heat to electricity in this case now there's also something else that's interesting about this when when we first made this device we thought oh this is you know a new concept to heat something with with light and then using the mechanism that we call thermionic emission generate electricity but it turns out interests in this mechanism has been there for about a century now and in particular in the 1950s and 1960s the space industry was very interested in this so NASA and the Soviet space program tried to make devices that worked based on this concept the difficulty or one of the key difficulties I should say was the fact that if they wanted to use any source of light that's readily available and in particular was of great interest in sunlight well if you take a piece of metal and you try to heat it like we saw before the heat spreads everywhere so to actually get the high temperatures that you need you have to use an enormous amount of sunlight but it turns out because we have this confinement of heat to where our light beam is illuminating the material we don't have any waste so all the light that goes into our carbon nanotube forest goes into effectively heating the material and as a result of that we need very little input power to reach the temperatures that are needed to set the electrons in motion and to demonstrate that I'll show you a picture of the same device that you saw in the previous slide but in this case it's actually sitting outside the lab on a sunny day in Vancouver and as you can see there's just a small lens that that you can keep in your hand and the amount of sunlight that that little lens is collecting is sufficient to heat these nanotubes to the temperatures that are needed now contrast that with what you're seeing in the surrounding images for instance in the top left you see a few cars on the side so that gives you an idea of the size of the mirrors that NASA was using to heat their structures the amount of light that they had to collect what I'd like to conclude with is that some of the decades-old challenges of technical problems such as for instance in this case energy conversion might find solutions in new materials in materials that have structures on the order of nanometer or so where you see interesting physics properties that are very counterintuitive compared to what you expect from bulk materials we are not saying that this heat trap effect might save the world or solve all of our energy problems but one one can't help but wonder what would the world be like if we had these nanomaterials 50 years ago would we still be having all these energy problems would we still be using fossil fuels in the same way as we are doing now consider the fact that there is so much waste heat and so much waste light around us more than half of the energy that we extract from primary sources to power our industries and our civilization actually goes to waste to waste heat and if we could use properties such as this trap to harvest a portion of that energy that could have huge consequences for our access to energy on the one hand but also implications potentially for the environment thank you you
