 nano online simulation and more for nanotechnology he graduated 2008 with his PhD from Electrical Engineering and David James was his name is Barry Cisco advisor and since then he's been at IBM and he's now a research staff member and he has achieved many things when he was here he was in the National Science Foundation fellow since he's left the way I described this career trajectory is that as the research community and now carbon devices has hopped from one that lighting to the other one Erin kind of stayed on one and moved his way up and now he's I think pretty much driving the train for carbon nanotubes which makes sense because his nickname is here with the a-train and then this thinkin is something that's not in his bio but I mentioned to him before I think that he is the record-setting student of the birth center for accumulating the most lab charges in one year I remember one year when he racked up $75,000 in user fees at the Burks our one student and it may see me you should recent papers out of IBM where he talks you know almost philosophical terms about devices with carbon nanotubes and and also some other technologies like drafting but what it all means and what really might happen with carbon nanotubes in practice and per banana tube devices so I hopefully he's going to talk about that they that teach us a little bit so it's my thank you so much Tim so it's it's always fun coming back because of the memories I have being here obviously but there are a few things that you forget in time and one of them was as my wife and I were driving over the Wabash this morning was remembering it being a lot bigger than it is but when you live by the Hudson it makes the wall match look like a creek in comparison so it's really fun though to see how everything's growing and how well people are still doing here and exciting change is being made so it's it's fun coming back from the nostalgic effect and also for the opportunity to show you some of the things that I think are exciting that we're doing in IBM you're gonna notice something different about my approach it's I've been told from a few people I'm very honest and it's intentional which means while it may seem you know occasionally like I will hype something I will be very honest about what the shortcomings are because the fact is as Tim mentioned in his introduction of me which I'm grateful for I still work on carbon nanotubes and this field is full of a lot of misconception about why people should or should not still be working on it whether it's still alive or died and we're trying to resurrect it and I want to make sure of nothing else to correct that for those of you who've taken the chance to come this morning and with that also provides sort of a broader picture of nanoelectronics where the field is going and where with maybe only a little authority I can tell you where IBM stands on that whole picture huh so here's that outline and I pretty much mention that already so we'll jump right in I'll give you a little history for those of you not overly familiar with IBM and you have two members of the faculty here who are from IBM the very lab I'm from your gap and seller and Joe Hong Chen Xiao Hong who I worked with when I first went to IBM after leaving Purdue almost five years ago and this is a picture of the company if you're not overly familiar with it there are of four hundred and thirty thousand plus employees - maybe six thousand in the last month or so but those luckily did not come from search and this shows you how small IBM research is compared to this mammoth company and this is a fun thing to point out because if you really knew what I BM is the business model is today you would realize well it's kind of a Serb isness services company so what does IBM research doing with that and we like to say we are the face of IBM IBM that loves the accolades that the research community has brought in and because of that they can sell things like you know complete solutions for your email and servers because if we can do carbon nanotubes of course we can fix your email software solutions right and we kind of have prided ourselves of being able to maintain that over the many many years and many many people who've done amazing stuff there but it is a small faction of a very large company the research disciplines within IBM are shown here very broadly while the Watson lab in Yorktown Heights is the headquarters for research there are a variety of labs throughout the world they're not necessarily split perfectly by discipline there are some crossovers between those labs Zurich and almond in and Watson or have the most crossover my area is predominantly electrical engineering but just like the Burke Center we have a great deal of multidisciplinary researchers and a lot of creative collaboration that comes out of having that type of an environment for semiconductor research we have a bit of sort of a pipeline in place and communication happens at different levels to make this work but the idea is we have core exploratory research at yorktown Watson almond and Zurich like I said there's a lot of crossover there and that hopefully whatever technology is being worked on there will push its way up towards Albany where there's an advanced R&D center which is moving now towards 450 millimeter it's a great facility with a consortium of different companies that contribute to it and finally if something gets through line there they'll move it to Fishkill New York where we have an actual fab to push product out so it's nice to have that type of pipeline in place even when you're looking at an exploratory R&D level so that you can keep in mind what the technical challenges are and how they need to be addressed in the long run with what you work on so the transistor industry in general and why are where most of my research focus is I like to give a background using Moore's law as you'll see in a minute but I want to try to re-educate how people look at Moore's law so this is what I mean when you look at where things have gone with electronics we've started to step away from caring just about how fast our processors are how much memory there is and all of these core technical components and we care more about functionality we want to know what can it do once it's in the hands of the user and that's created a really interesting split on what we expect from transistors because for years with respect to Moore's Law we saw a very consistent reason for increasing the number of transistors because we wanted to increase computing performance we can run faster etc all of these things were very straightforward but there came a time about eight years ago when we decided we cared more about application in some cases than we did about performance or transistor count and we started seeing like the Atom processor from Intel delivered which had a very low count but gave people what they wanted from their application and this I think is a big part of what's missing when people look at where we're heading in 10 years because it's not the same as it was when we thought about it 10 years before and this is a another way of looking at Moore's law and and these are the two ways that most people see it and this is where I want to create some of the misconception most people see it where they either see minimum feature size getting smaller or than transistors getting larger and we all her all the Magnificent postulation of more from 40 50 years ago that suggested that this could be the case and that's great it's a really amazing engineering feat that we've managed this but I think there's a couple of ways that make more sense to look at this so one now this is this is a funny plot about this this is more technical makes more technical sense this is the power watts per centimeter squared dissipated on a chip this was made ten plus years ago it got a lot of attention though because people like showing how if we continued on the same trend of increasing the power on a computer chip that it would hit you know a rocket nozzle and the surface of the Sun eventually and of course those things not gonna it's not possible and we can't move the heat away you know good enough to allow that type of power on a chip so what we had is a flattening where we said we can't get any higher around 100 watts per centimeter squared we have to just flatline this and change other things about what's going on and already this was a bit against the against the grain of the way that the classic scaling was supposed to work we were supposed to be able to see a reduction of the amount of voltage it took to operate his transistor and therefore even though we maintained sort of the current the performance we could see some scaling of the power because of this and this is not been how that part of Moore's law has worked and this is what I sort of coined this power constraint scaling other people talked about it this way this is a simplified look at what some of the main dependencies of active power on a chip we don't have time to talk about the other you know issues with power but just looking at active power you have a huge dependency on things like the operating voltage and of course the number of transistors and we always want this to go up and that's why we look at Moore's Law no we have to keep going up there because that's what that's what matters but if we don't scale this operating voltage in convene correspondence with the increase in number of transistors then we're just juicing the power up more and more and so this is what I think is one of the more accurate ways of looking at Moore's Law the blue is the traditional way transistors on the Left axis number of transistors on a chip but on the right axis and in green here is this supply voltage and for really the the years throughout the 80s and even before there was very little scaling if you know any scaling at all it's at around five volts and everyone was sort of okay with that and pretty soon we thought well no no no we need to do some about this and I don't have all the data points in here but it came down to three point three volts and sat there for a while and eventually I mean there was no way to sustain that and there was a bit of a scaling trend that occurred that almost flattened off in the early 2000s and we've sat around the Volt's ever since then where it really warrants a lower voltage on the transistors in order to reduce the power but it's something that cannot be survived in terms of the cost and performance that is an important part of Moore's law when we think about what we want devices to do in the next generation and how they're gonna fit the applications with that so here's my fun way of looking at this when I talk about this road ahead for nanotubes transistors and I think in terms of the entire field what does the road look like and this is my sort of personal perspective first the rearview mirror is important and so if you ever drive you should pay a lot of attention in the rearview mirror and if I'm driving on this road what do I think is in the rearview mirror I definitely think that classic Dennard scaling is in the rearview mirror this is not disputable we cannot scale transistors just by reducing or changing the dimensions and the doping by a certain constant that allows us to maintain all the other parameters doesn't work anymore on the rear view mirror is also the standard bulk MOSFET it is gone no other technology generation will be delivered to you with a bulk silicon material it is now going to have to require other type of thinning of that material or restructuring of it into fins and that's now become a thing of the past we also maybe you're starting to see silicon in that rearview mirror there's still technologies coming from it but it's getting closer to the point where we really honestly cannot get a whole lot more out and I think unfortunately that Gordon wort needs to start going into the rearview mirror not because he hasn't done amazing things but because we've relied too much upon Strictly doing things based upon an old postulation instead of considering what may give us the best next technology by application and we're too bound in a lot of ways to what we've delivered for many years so what's ahead well we know already we're seeing the 3d devices they call them which are the FinFETs that Intel has a 22 nanometer out on and others are working towards getting products on we have a lot of people still working on three fives and all various forms of them whether or not they'll resolve the issues remains an unknown but that's something that a lot of people have in their path including Intel's predominant research is on three fives for replacing silicon tunneling transistors still receive a lot of attention because of the potentials for lowering the power the big issue they're getting a little operating voltage down and I'll talk about carbon nanotubes today and where those fit in and then there's this sort of gray misty area where I only put a couple pictures where you can put dozens and a lot of people have moved to the mist and why I put the mist over spintronics and neuromorphic computing is because no one really knows how we're gonna use these things they just sound real good and these are non von Neumann architecture this is when I start moving away in most cases some of them can kind of fit the model it depends but it moves me into a space where we're changing the entire paradigm of computing and that could be a great thing but it's also kind of an unknown thing and we still have a lot of work to do with that okay so let's build the perfect transistor this is my way of making sure that whether you're have a ee background or not if you look at a transistor and said I need it to work the way I'm used to them working but in the best way possible how would it look and the first thing is you have this channel the semiconducting channel it's going to carry the current it needs to be very thin because I need to be able to put a date on that to electrostatically control it as best possible it needs to have ballistic transport I can't be concerned about how carriers are going to interact in the channel I just need to get them from one side to the other okay no bulk effects I don't want anything else that's happening around this guy to make a difference of what's happening in the channel itself gating I need to be able to make a gate all around geometry so that I can get the best electrostatic control of this really small channel because it has below 10 nanometers which means I don't want to lose the ability to turn that channel off with that gate the contacts also need to be very small because making a small channel is meaningless if I can't make the contact small as well and the performance needs to be able to give me a lot of current for a very low operating voltage alright that's my perfect transistor and there's it's hard for really anyone to argue with that because for what we want out of a IV curve this is the dream way to get it so the question is how do nanotubes measure up with respect to the perfect transistor and the fact is most of the things that make it a perfect transistor a nanotube naturally lends itself to it has all of the channel properties that we would dream about it can give substant animator gate length devices which I'll talk about and delivers high current density at a low operating voltage the issues one of them all address a bit in the end of the talk is this gate all-around geometry and things like variability and up I didn't circle it but making small contacts so the way that I've structured this talk is and this gives you some more of those motivations in fancy picture format for why we like nanotubes but the way I've structured this talk is to give you some of the motivation but then try to spend the whole second half telling you what the problems are because the fact is I could try to convince all of you why everyone should still be concerned about nanotubes and willing to consider them but unless you know what the problems are and are willing to try to make a move to address them there's no sense in motivating it anymore because it'll never get fixed just by us working on it at IBM ok so history of nanotubes transistors I like looking at it like this this is getting a little old since I made this and went to 2011 covered over a decade I spent a few bleary-eyed hours staring at the computer looking at all the papers that had been published about carbon nanotube transistors and this is the trend now this is about transistors the field itself would have had hundreds of thousands of papers I think but if you separate this trend by topic area in other words the papers that focused on nanotube transistors for digital applications this is the number sensors thin film devices RF and optoelectronics of course I was very disturbed by this sort of taper drop off in the mid late 2000s and so I did one more search and found this out graphene comes in and starts taking over all of our nanotubes research ok around the mid-2000s and the other thing that I think is important in spite of that is that the work on digital application space up to that time the papers that were motivated for that space remained relatively consistent and that's I think an encouraging fact of what we and this is you know worldwide research the fact that there are research labs that are still receiving enough support to put some attention towards an inner-tube transistors for digital space applications and we've seen that even at the scientific publication level so the difference between atoms of graphene now that I brought up a bit of a negative tone there I think graphene has a lot of excellent things happening with it and I think it's important to keep it separated from nanotubes for what what it's good for as most of you probably know it does not have a bandgap and even though it's a great electronic transport material has very interesting properties it's more appropriate for something that doesn't have to turn off like an RF application even then it has a lot of heavy competition but it has more potential there and it's funny because no matter where I've gone and visit in the last few months and I bring this up and I always have someone say oh yeah but nano ribbons right graphene nanoribbons then you get a bandgap and then it's kind of like a nanotubes I said yeah that's great a terrible nanotubes why would I be motivated to go with a terrible nanotubes when I could just use a nanotube which gets rid of all the edge States doesn't have the same type of fluctuation issues and you know but there's still there's still interest because it's graphene and and that's okay maybe someone will figure something amazing out so if I look at this is my last funny slide now get into the the core the core stuff I like this analogy of a road trip and there are we there yet so I just drove from New York to Indiana with my three small kids and if you've ever taken a road trip with kids you can have some appreciation for that it's kind of when I think about it related to research it's kind of like the parents or the researchers and the kids are the funding agencies we're doing this for them right I mean when we told them we were taking the trip it was because we told them how amazing it was going to be they were gonna have so much fun it was gonna be worth every second of the trip and mostly we did that by telling them how awesome the place we were going was right like this CNT paradise we talked it up to no end and we got them so excited they were willing to do anything to come along for the ride so we got them in the van and we started on the road and you know what I don't even know if we left New York before they were like are we there yet when are we gonna get there and then as where I can good progress graphene land shows up on the side of the road just when we were really starting to make sure that we were making the right progress towards our own destination the kids start saying can we stop please please please please it's nearby it were tired we've been along this road for a long time and we need something new right unfortunately a lot of people got out but what they figured out is that there was a lot of bad things in graffiti land long lines overcrowding and even though the first few rides were fun it was hot outside and they just started thinking gosh what are we doing here and some of us got out and decided to walk now whether or not we'll ever make it who knows but and this is this is I know a little bit of a slapstick way of looking at it but the problem is when you have a good material as a very promising properties for electronics we have to we have to question how much time it should take to deliver the end goal and in this case we never got there with now just haven't gotten there but should we still be trying is the question that people are not asking and they should be asking it because instead they're jumping over to new materials and I keep saying but why did you get out what what made you get van and this is the kind of conversation that I think needs to be had more okay so how many other dudes work I see I mean for me you guys come in we've got a lot of Mechanical Engineers here so you're gonna get misty I kind of you know glazing over on me as I go through this talk so this is a little bit of a double e's look at solid-state physics for you that maybe it'll be insightful about how a transistor works and it's usually meant to talk to people who know how a MOSFET works and compare a nanotube but if you look at the energy bands this is a band gap no carriers could be there here's electrons this is a silicon mosfet and this is the IV curves and the sub-threshold off state when it's turned off there's a huge thermal barrier I can't get carriers to get over there no matter what the thermal excitement is of them they can't make it over if I put a bias on this electrostatic gate here and I move these bands down it lowers that barrier and carriers get over but see how they bounce down to the edge of the band there they're scattering they have a certain mobility of property of this semiconductor that tells me how well they transport from one side to the other so here's the difference for the nanotube transistor and this is a generalization but it gives you some feel even though the curves look the same there's different stuff happening here this is how my band structure would look and instead of having sort of a natural doped semiconductor Junction for my contacts I have metal to semiconductor contacts which is known as a Schottky contact and that creates its own type of barriers that I'll show on the next part but for the off state it's kind of similar there's a thermal barrier carriers can't get through and so the device is turned off in the on state I have in most cases a small or in it depending on the context metal substantial Schottky barrier where carriers either need to be able to get over or to tunnel straight through and the unique thing is that while that's new what's happening the channel is even more new and that is they're not bouncing down to the conduction band you don't have that type of scattering if they're gonna scatter they're gonna go all the way back there 1d they can only go one direction or the other and it's most likely going to happen at one of the contacts where we have a certain transmission of getting the carriers from that semi connecting channel into the contacts so in an equation since this is how these two things would compare this is a standard kind of an on state MOSFET equation I have things like carrier mobility spatial dependence charge it's in the channel and a certain bias I'm applying for nanotubes and enorme look a little less friendly but it's not it's not too bad but look at some of the differences there is sort of a charge in the channel effect but it's based upon the density of states I have this sort of bias dependence but it's based upon where my Fermi levels are aligning at the source and drain and I have this carrier Fermi velocity and transmission at the contacts over here no density of states consideration no consideration of the contacts and over here no spatial dependence this is like a single molecule conducting and no mobility dependence because what's happening in the channel in any respectable links that I would be interested in this thing is going to be ballistic so it's really about getting the carriers in and out and not what they do when they're in there so there's a bit of a difference okay so a couple motivations for more for why we're pursuing this and then cover of these challenges here's another way to look at Moore's law another in my opinion more correct way to look at Moore's law yeah this is just a fun way of seeing what's happening over the years with how we change devices in order to keep scaling them but over here is where I want you to pay attention on the right side this is the plot of date length so you always see minimum feature size and most people even technology people have no idea what it is what what switch feature but it's obviously something important that gets very small but it's not the channel it's not the gate it's something else so when you look at the gate length which is very critical because when you shrink down the gate length in a semiconducting device the transistor you lose control to other sources like what voltage you're putting over on the drain so making the gate small it can be challenging and you can see there were several generations in the mid 2000s where we really stalled the gate length scaling even though we delivered from one node which would have been probably the 45-ish I'm guessing or maybe even before that we were able to deliver a new technology with more transistors we couldn't make the smaller because the negative effects were too great and that's a big deal now there was it with the 22 nanometer intel was able to finally give a new gate length scaling with the three with a FinFET device but even then there's some unknowns about what we're going to be able to do stepping forward this is a really important thing to consider when you're thinking about something to replace silicon or give you a better channel more ideal channel what can you do with gate link scaling because if you can only give us one little node is it really worth it is it going to be able to scale further and how far can it go so with nanotubes this is a question that was only asked kind of recently because for years people thought well they're so small of course we can make tiny channels out of them and they'll be perfect we'll be terrific but the theoretical evidence was contrary to that the few papers showed that you had negative effects like source drain tunneling because of the very small effective mass that we're going to degrade what happens at small channel lengths so we did some experimental work which I'll go through the experimental details for sake of time but here is some images of the device we specifically were looking this is one of those papers where we really did just want one or two devices we wanted to know can it work that was the question can we make this experimentally and make it work and making a channel that sub to nanometers is not straightforward there is no lithography process in place that can give you a lift off of two metal contacts with a sub to nanometers spacing so we had to do some creative work to obtain that and here's the result so I'm not going to go through all the little details of how these devices look here but if you look at the left this gives you the scaling trend on the same nanotubes of four different channel lengths and you can see the improvement in what's happening with the current and the on state with some clipping of the minimum current in the off state but the sub threshold slope meaning how the device switches or how well it really if you look at the power of a device how low of a voltage you can use the sub threshold slope is one of the most important things and that remains relatively consistent which was an important observation but what should matter to you especially if you're not a and can't look at this and get some valuable information is what does this mean with respect to the other options and so compared to silicon devices specifically we scoured literature and found the three best performing sub 10 nanometer channel length silicon devices and you may look at this and think oh sure best you know he chose a decade old data just so that it would look good no these really are the best now someone may have tucked on their shelf at Intel or maybe even an IBM that I don't know some device that's better that they've built that they've experimentally tested at sub to nanometers but it's not in the literature not when we look this up and so these really are the the best ones that were there and some of them are not even ideal in terms of what you can get with with dimensions this nanowire is 30 nanometers they can make them comfortably to 5 nanometers now which should be better but this is what you have for the comparison nanowires fins and ETS ly which is a very thin layer of silicon used to help reduce that body thickness and the other question is not just finding which ones to compare to but how to compare them because this is not apples to apples I can't just choose something and say oh well look of course the nanotubes better so we decided well if these things are ever going to be used for sub 2 nanometers they're gonna have to run at about a half a volt or probably less than that so if we choose a specific operating voltage and assume the same threshold voltage for the devices then I can look at the current at that operating voltage for all of the devices and get a somewhat realistic comparison between them all this is showing their sub threshold swing that's a another discussion the the nanotube is in blue and has a scaling trend similar to the other guys though I will say it has a lot of non idealities in the dielectric that should shift the whole curve down a bit more but it looks good just comparison for face value now this is looking at that current based upon diameter normalization but as much as I like that result and would have been thrilled to just publish that as is because it makes nanotubes look just heroin they are so great right there their effort they can provide so much more than anything else in current based upon the same operating voltage but this is completely unfair because the nanotube is only one nanometer so the diameter normalized current is going to be extremely high and I'm never going to make them exactly next to each other for several reasons so it's more fair to look at a pitch normalized current and these nano wire guys were just as bad by the way they reported diameter normalized in their paper so shame on them because you're never going to put silicon nanowires right next to each other you have to get a gate in there right so we modified this for a pitch normalized if you had nanotubes and an aggressive 5 nanometer pitch nano wires and fins at a mostly unrealistic 20 nanometer pitch because you still have to fit all their gates tax whereas the nanotube works just for just as well in terms of the gating with a single gate below it so I'm not limited by the gate stack fitting in and this is where it looks with pitch normalized current the nanotube is still more than double what you can get out of a nano wire so it's still great but it's also a bit more realistic for what I could expect at a low operating voltage from the nanotubes and it's promising ok so the challenges to all of these are great things and everyone obviously should be coming back to this but what the challenge is the main challenges are important to know because these are the things people remember when they think about why we may not see as much from nanotubes at the moment the first one is separating szymek Onaga tubes carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting the single wall type based upon their chirality or their diameter in the simplest term so what do you do to isolate nothing but semi connecting well first if you look at what is needed if I have a chip with just as a back and a back-of-the-envelope a billion transistors and three nanotubes per device because you're going to need more than one of those in each device to get enough current out of it to drive things on a chip then that's about three billion CNTs on the chip which means I need a purity of about six nines you know percent semiconducting nanotubes out of this that's pretty daunting all right and if you want to put that into perspective this is where we are now or close to now I have a more updated version of this but if you look at trends in what we can do to isolate semiconductor nanotubes in a solution process versus isolating them at growth which too important and hopefully eventually we'll work together approaches this is what you see now this can only this looks like we've made it right but this is I'll show you what this purity is right there this is the work from markers ohms group at Northwestern from 2006 that they developed into this company you can now buy a little bottle that is 99% pure semiconductor nanotubes so that's excellent that's that's amazing progress but the problem with it is that I guess I have it on the slide after this oh no here it is this is the problem the way that they determine that is using something like this UV vis spectrum and you tell me if you can tell how high that peak is down here in the red you see how high that guy is I don't know I mean you think Oh give me the numbers and maybe I can tell good luck it's not easy to tell and that's why 99 percent is the best we can tell you from UV vis it could be 99.99 but there's no way we can tell by how small this peak which shows up when a metallic nanotubes are present how high that is compared to the semiconducting so we have a characterization issue we have an inability to determine how pure these solutions really are and it's nice that we can get to the point where we see 99% but we have to have the ability to say a lot more than that so this is one of the techniques that we've been using most recently at IBM and a lot of other groups have worked on this it's a chromatography setup that allows the tubes to have diverse different densities going through this column based upon their metallicity and that's just a matter of what that how they bundle with different surfactants present and that gives you a very high throughput technique that the UV vis side gives us as good of material as the stuff that does not give high yield so that was an important thing for us but as I said most important was determining what the actual purity is and this is not a final slam-dunk solution it just gives us to really one or two more nines and that is make devices out of them actually to build a mere 10,000 transistors and put them through a semi automated probation let them run Ave or so and then determine how many of them were metallic and based upon that give ourselves a more comfortable figure and in this case the best we have that I'm showing on this slide is 99.9 percent and that's good that we can give some real data towards that but we're never gonna build enough devices and have enough hours to test something that gets down to the five or six nine range so this is a real big materials issue that we've actually started a new collaboration with folks at NIST because this is what they do this is material measurement and characterization to try to figure something else out they can give high-throughput better accuracy on knowing what type of purity is present and with nanotubes solutions okay so that's the one of the materials issues the other way is the ability to put the nanotubes where you want them and do that at a pitch that is at least ten nanometers are lower and that way you have enough of a current per width of a transistor device and are able to rely upon exactly how many channels you would have based upon where you build the device on a substrate so that's a that's a daunting target when it comes to nanotubes and this is I'll show you why on the next slide nanotubes are not rigid structures when they at least not in most of the ways that they are placed on a substrate and I have a comparison down here I like to think of them as sort of al dente pasta noodles if you just spin them out on a substrate from a solution they're most likely going to look something like this guy wrapped around there instead of nice and rigid like something that is not hollow like a nano wire would be so this is something that has to be dealt with not only from controlling the orientation of the material but also keeping it from interacting with its neighbors there's a interaction the van der Waals force unless the nanotubes join together with the depending on what solution they're dispersed in and unless you put something on them specifically keep them from doing that so those are the two biggest issues with respect to controlling the material when you want to position it on a substrate so I'll highlight one of our approaches actually a few good papers have come out in the last year or so that have unique approaches for solving this problem or at least on the path toward solving it this is the one that we've done a lot of development in IBM really over the years have been good work there on it and that is using some type of functionalisation either of the nanotubes or of the substrate or both in order to attract them selectively to different surfaces in this case using an MPI molecule that selectively attaches to a high K dielectric like hafnium oxide and will not attach to sio2 and then having the nanotubes wrapped with one of the more common surfactants SDS which provides sort of a positive charge end where the in MPI has a negative charge in so you have a coulombic bonding that takes place putting the nanotubes on those surfaces the selectivity on this actually is near-perfect it is one of the things that's not a problem with this approach the nanotubes we'll just stick where that hafnium oxide is and in an MPI and not on the sio2 the hard part about it that is still being worked on and I have to SEM showing parts of this this one has some lines added to show you where the tubes are but that is giving them to be placed close enough together the smallest that we have in this work is about a hundred nanometer pitch that is a really reliable approach so ten nanotubes per micron and about an order of magnitude away away from where it needs to be because you start having issues with nanotubes jumping across the trenches but this is this is one with 70 nanometer trenches at a 200 nanometer pitch and you can see the tubes like to align up within these trenches fairly well and if you restrict them in the other dimension then you can start to make devices at a large scale and this is the sort of platform we use for testing those six thousand devices for looking at the purity of the solutions so that we can nominally make sure we have one nanotube and that's a whole discussion about whether we know if there's one or more than one and if you're curious you're welcome to ask about that okay so those are the two materials one those are the ones that most people know about because they know they're hard but there's nothing fundamental that suggests they're impossible they just are hard and because some of the people to get out of the minivan on our little road trip analogy the device challenges are also important and I have four here but now they move rather quickly and they're the ones that I think are the primary bottlenecks when you're looking at it from a EE standpoint one of them is the variability I want to give you an experimental idea of why this is so bad and this is someone showing somewhat here and on the next slide variability what I mean is if you're building devices out of carbon nanotubes and you have a bandgap that's pretty consistent let's say you have the diameters that are close to each other so your band gaps not changing a lot what would the device characteristics look like well this is only fifty six of them on a chip and you can see and this is over a full volt 4 volt range there's a spread of over a volt in the threshold voltage for these devices just having the same gate to high electric the same device structure on the same chip has a lot of variation the other thing that varies is the on state even if these shifted together there would still be variation and the hysteresis the fact that sweeping these devices in different directions shifts the curve or threshold voltage which is problematic when I want these things to work in a digital logic application over here is the sort of a schematic picture looking at why this is the case nanotubes are these tiny single molecules so with all that's happening on their surface nothing is protected and because of that they have a lot of sensitivity to what's going on around them and that's makes them great for sensors that pretty much changed their conductance in the presence of almost anything but it makes a problem when I have a transistor that needs to stay the same and be the same as his neighbors so there's a hydroxylated charge you know ended surface which is on most of these oxides different traps and charges that are likely part of the dielectric structure and all of these are going to have some contribution so one of the things that we did to try to figure out what the main source of this variation is is we built a lot of devices along the same nanotubes this is a long nanotube and this is about 10 devices and the IV curves because we figured well at least we can make sure the diameter is the same and the devices are identical then we can get a feel for what's being caused by the surroundings and this is how the curves look this is from a solution nanotube with four devices and this is from long CVD nanotubes with eight to ten and the variation is high but we wanted to see how much of that is due to the surface and how much of it is due to the gate dielectric how many charges and impurities that are present there so we did a pretty crude passivation layer and I have another one I'll show that's better but this is just an HMDs layer but deposited in a dry vacuum environment where you have some elevated temperature to help drive off the adsorbate and then the HMDs serving as a protection from keeping the adsorbate from coming back when I put my sample back into the air and what was amazing is putting this sort of a crude layer down did a miraculous job of pushing these curves together it's they're still not perfect but just by passivating these same devices before and after tighten considerably this tells us that a lot of that variation this present is caused by the interaction between the nanotubes and all the stuff that's happening on the surface around it so protecting them in the proper way is a very important step to having the path towards getting a transistor that makes technological sense so where are we now this is some very new data that uses more robust layers that were Ald oxide deposited and if it curious about these layers I'm happy to talk about them a greater length offline I'll talk about this one again in a moment but the hysteresis suppression is really it's near-perfect the devices if they have hysteresis is very small in any of the ones with this passivation technique and the threshold voltage distribution is tightened very well the red is before and the blue is after one thing to keep in mind here is that we're still dealing with non optimized dielectrics no one has there's no you know engineers have taken this challenge like I have with silicon and said we need to make this perfect this dielectric when you get the anneal conditions down and all the other important parameters so we're still using stuff that's sort of off the shelf and that could be what's remaining in terms of this variation okay in fact so that's variation this there's three others really quick and then I'll summarize this for you it's a lot easier to make a P FET from carbon nanotubes it is a mistake that people say carbon nanotubes are naturally p-type because they are not they are intrinsic semiconductors they have no natural doping or charge present you have to put that in to the nanotube and so the way you put it in determines the polarity and getting a high work function metal like caladium or gold is a lot more straightforward than a low work function metal like erbium that oxidizes very readily so that's why most of them almost all of them have been P FETs okay and in this case that shows the band diagram look at that very simple picture of injecting with a high work function metal into the valence band with holes so what I want to get to is a metal that can be as robust and compatible with processing yield in FETs as opposed to the P FETs one thing to keep in mind here at the physics transport level that a nanotube is very friendly about is the fact that the effective mass for the carriers is identical between the electronic levels there's symmetry in that in that struck in the dispersion relation so this is a piece of great news for me if I could just get them in there in the same way or similar way to the to the holes then I can have electron transporting devices that are very complementary so where we are well there's been some good progress made in the years it started with kind of some one-off demonstrations where people would do some type of a dopant not substitutional and interstitial the way that you may think about it with silicon but a dopant where when put in the vicinity of a nanotube creates a charge fluctuation or a a permanent sort of charge shifts like an electrostatic movement of the band structure and that way effectively dopes the Nano - these are some examples of that there's problems with this type of a chemical doping it's just if one is in terms of reproducibility consistency across the substrate and robustness to air especially these earlier ones where they use potassium and the devices turn out well but these these sort of things have shoes in the manufacturing sense so what's happened most recently is people have looked at low work function metals which creates the picture that I show in the bottom right here sort of the inverse of the P fat but the poor air stability if you've ever worked with these materials if you have them in an evaporator and you have them exposed to air and you come back a few days later you'll probably have a little crucible of powder left in there these are very temperamental the metals and so you have to be careful about how to use them and how to make sure that your yield can be consistent because they're gonna oxidize and some people have shown good work on this mostly lynn mal pegs group from picking University in China that have done great work on scandium and nutrient but there's still this you yield question of getting it to the place where it's compatible with comparable with what you get from palladium and the P fence so this is some results that we did and we've modified recently Sox skip to this next slide to show some of the slightly newer data this is using erbium it hadn't been explored before and one we just wanted to be a little different to it works better than it's room for us so we decided to stick with it but we wanted to look at this from a more technologically perspective and that is getting the yield higher not just getting a few really good devices which we did but looking at yield you could see if the erbium device is here the NFS the variation is a whole nother topic which we have some interesting insight into now but it's a lot bigger than it is for the Palladium devices but the performance and the yield on a chip when you spread the same density of nanotubes out and create the random devices the yield for erbium contacted ones was very comparable one in this spot it looks a little confusing all you're looking at is current at the bottom the on current and the count number of transistors with that current so the based upon the area under the curve you can see the yield comparisons and the erbium is very similar to the Palladium this is lanthanum and it really and this told us if we cap this material most appropriately and passivated immediately after deposition then we can start to look at devices they approach the yield of what we can get off of these non oxidizing high work function metals contact scaling this is one that's near and dear to me because it's one that we looked at when I came to IBM early on a lot for years and I talked about this earlier in the talk we only looked at the channel which would be the under the gates right here the gray areas this may be a confusion picture to you you should look up here at the top the channel is the area between the metal contact bars up here the contact is the length over which the metal covers nanotubes for years we never even paid attention to this and I think the motivation was that the biggest problem with silicon was short channel effects from making the channel small so what should we fix well it's making better devices with short channels but all along the way is in the back of the lines of the technology people but we have to make small contacts too and there was some people who actually felt that based upon some proper motivation that small contacts may even be better for nanotubes because you enhance the field there there's Schottky barrier controlled so maybe injection improves and so we looked at it experimentally to get a feel for how good or bad the situation is built a set of devices along the same nanotubes and scaled the contact length so the channel length remains about the same and this is the result the most important one in the bottom middle here which plots contact resistance versus contact length and you can see at below 100 nanometers you see a dramatic increase about a 1 over LC relation in that contact resistance and this is not to say oh well great you know a hidden huge problem with nanotubes it's never going to make them work whether it ever keeps them from working or not is an unknown but it's not unique to nanotubes the any type of transistor including the standard MOSFETs throughout the ages have the same type of a trend in fact it has a similar one over LC dependence but the physics are entirely different what I get out of a 3d to 3d silicide type of a contact in a MOSFET is very different from a 3d to 1d contact to a little carbon nanotube where you have Schottky barrier and other issues that are likely playing role so there's so much work that could still be done to understand this and hopefully by understanding it provide some improvement for this scaling trend one of the things that we've done most recently I won't and I'm missing actual we have a couple more curves on here that that are interesting but we're looking at how different contact metals scale compared to palladium so the orange scaling trend is the one that I showed on the previous slide our other work we've been doing now is looking at different metals and different interfacial layers and how it affects what the scaling behavior looks like because what I want more than anything is to get some devices down here in the lower resistance and small contact length area and that requires changing this type of scaling behavior so there's a lot of work that remains to be done in this particular area where a lot of material science good good work with interfaces could play a big role okay finally this is where I'll wrap up on my experimental details and then summarize the talk this is about fun animations there but the idea is when I'm building a transistor for technology I have to end up with a gate that is self aligned and I also started the talk telling you what the ideal transistor is and then you should have a gate all-around channel and those two things come together in this recent work that we did and this is the process flow for us so it's so new I actually show some of the experiments of details here instead of skipping over it we one of the hard things our nanotubes is you can't put them in a reactive ion environment really virtually any or they will etch their very reactive being all on their surface and having their bond there their bonds sort of stretched tight with rolling them into the cylinders they are reactive to virtually any species so if I want to etch something anisotropic it becomes a real challenge so what we did is we decided we want to suspend the channel and we want anisotropic but we can't do the dry environment edge so we used an SOA wafer and made use of the crystal orientation of the silicon where when you h it in a wet environment it will actually etch anisotropically and the etch that we used was a Koh etch which we tested the tubes and they survived just fine without degradation and it enables me to suspend the nanotubes across this channel area where I put the source and drain down first and they mask it off and you can see these SEM show it really well where the nanotubes is sitting on the SiO 2 it is charging so it's glowing and then it lifts up goes across the channel and goes back down so they're nice suspended across the middle area and this is following an Ald which in our case we use this adhesion layer which is a modification of a layer that was used actually by IBM colleagues that are now here when they did the first gate all-around device and they use this sort of no.2 functional layer we modified this to keep it from degrading the transport properties and from contributing to traps and other issues in the dielectric stack and you could see how the nanotubes coat nicely when they're lifted up off the substrate in this gate all-around fashion yeah the self alignment I'm not going to get into in great depth what we've done most recently is more exciting than what I have here so I'll tell you what it is and that is we designed this structure so that what you do is backfill the whole thing with something like tungsten where we would sputter it on and it would cover everywhere and fill these little trenches and then polish down the tungsten and a CMP process and we've now done this on our 200 millimeter wafer fab that we have at our facility in Yorktown Heights and shown a selectivity between the tungsten and palladium where it gives a nice polished surface like this this one is actually from liftoff a little trick that keeps the gate self aligned to the contacts but it has a much better manufacturable tie okay and this is a pretty TEM image of that device showing the uniformity of the gate all around so the nanotube is right in the center there and then you have this adhesion layer of about a nanometer or less and followed by the gate stack and then eventually a tantalum nitride gate metal so that it also encompasses the channel this is just looking at at TEM at an array where you can see the uniformity on the different nanotubes and here's the device results another thing I don't have a lot of time for but anyone who knows the field would be curious why this thing is an in fed because it has palladium contacts and yet it's a really true in fact and there are really good explanations for this now after we've done some further device work on it but it does look like a good device from the generals perspective in terms of on currents and switching behavior with the need for improvements in the dielectric still because we're do using an as deposited Ald film there's no one kneeling to eliminate the charge issues in the dielectric but so based upon those non idealities it performs very well this is a comment that I like to make sure and make and that is regarding why gate all around because it's easy for me to tell you is I did for many years this is actually a plot from a paper that worked on with Tim Fisher here that I like the paper because we were working a lot on these gate all around surround gate and back then I motivated it almost predominantly for the electrostatics because it's a best electrostatics but the fact is it's not entirely fair for nanotubes they are only one nanometer making a single gate below it is a plenty of amazing electrostatics for making a sub 2 nanometer channel and we showed that with the sub 10 animator device we made with a cylinder on plate type of a gate geometry so gate all-around is not so much needed for the electrostatics from nanotubes is it is that you get an isolation from those straight charges that I talked about with respect to very variability it gives me the chance to control exactly what's encapsulating the each of the channels and even cap them with their own metal or conductive gate so that they're not interfacing with each other ok so let me sum this up this is another discussion from that that I just don't take the time to get into because I want to wrap up here my this is now my two cents from me personally when people ask me all the time since here I am still working on nanotubes from predominantly why do I still work on them and do I think they'll ever actually reach a technology my answer is twofold one what do you be my technology because when I look at the next generation of electronics I don't necessarily see Moore's law anymore as I told you in the beginning of the talk I see bizarre stuff like this right people want their phones to be flexible and their windows to turn into electronics and all of these crazy application oriented things not performance oriented we're sort of making a shift there and in that space of nanotubes do an amazing unique job enabling devices that could feed at that type of a new field so that's the thin film devices mostly TFTs that it would be applicable there but there's no reason why in the long run they can't have a need for more high performance stuff so my my summary of this I like putting it this way this is my answer to can you replace should you replace silicon with nanotubes and why or why not now related to my kitchen remodel so I'll show you why here's my kitchen this is my kitchen you know circa three years ago it's a nice kitchen somewhat inviting and the you know it worked we were able to cook food in there that was edible and everything they seemed to be perfectly fine with the kitchen except that the user didn't like it mainly my wife it was you know it was a subpar kitchen it was old outdated not flashy people didn't come over when we said to you have you seen the kitchen right it was not a big deal to us it was just a kitchen it wasn't getting any better so we wanted to change it so change we found out requires a lot of hard work it requires a lot of money and a lot of time and more money right and eventually you get a new kitchen and you know it's great it makes the user very happy and it still works it still makes food just fine very flashy people come over or like you've got to see the kitchen right because we're proud of this change we think it was cost us so much that we're proud of it but it costs a lot of money and it will not last forever so when I think about this question well well nanotubes replaced silicon in high-performance space I have to I think the answer is how much do you expect to get out of it and is it worth the cost for our kitchen I think it's been worth it but when you talk about making the paradigm shift that would take in a technology sense from what we know in silicon to something that has a lot of unknown still in nanotubes I don't know the answer to that yet and that's why I think more people should still be concerned with how to fix the problems with nanotubes to come up with that answer so maybe it's more like remodeling a basement where you don't have to mess with the kitchen you can just do something in a space that is not currently existing and remodel it provide some new functionality that nanotubes uniquely enable and not disrupt what people are afraid of with respect to change so this is a this is a plot this will come out in about two days I wrote this little viewpoint here that talks about nanotubes I've tried to scream really loudly to get people's attention about why they should still be considering nanotubes and I think this may get some people's attention at least it's just a little blurb where I show this plot about whether or not we can ever reach what we need from nanotube technology and one of the things that I think is the biggest misconception is people say oh well you'll never get to the type of low metallic nanotube percentage or high purity semiconducting which is the target here or oh you'll never get them to place at the density that you need them to place and they say here this everywhere and so I said okay well let's believe in scientific trends and plot data points that are real based upon the literature for both how I place the nanotubes at a certain pitch and how pure they are and decide whether or not we feel the trajectory suggests the ability for a solution and that's what I show here whether or not this will happen is a complete unknown to me and the fact that it will get harder as you get closer is not an unknown to me the problem is people don't realize that it did not flatten out yet and they have to come to realize when they look at what they spend their time and money investing into what is the end product and I contend the nanotubes still offer something better than virtually any of the other competition the problem is that so many people have gotten out of the minivan and need to get back in and put more work into getting to the goal or at least figuring out why we will never get there alright so this is a summary that shows all those challenges I highlighted for you with some of those promises that I spent time on in the beginning of the talk and thank you for listening to me go over a lot of information and I also acknowledge the many collaborators that we have at IBM right now working on this thank you happy to answer any questions oh yes it was all the same narrative it's a great question honestly we attribute it to the carrier's injecting over the other end the when you when you're switching it at that bias which we were I think a half a volt on those curves and are pushing the bands low enough towards the off-state that we start to get an electron injection over the other side that and well why does that become more prominent at the smaller channeling so there's a lot of discussion about that but a lot people want to attribute the source train tunneling and we similarly see no evidence of it being source rate tunneling with devices and those are the two things we can come up with it would cause a clipping of that of that minimum put them on the substrate where you need them the placement well I showed some of the work that we've done with the functionalisation of the surface in nanotubes for placement there are other people who work on trying to grow the nanotubes into nice aligned arrays which is excellent work but what what has to be considered in whatever process is used is not only the end goal of getting them at a sub 10 nanometer pitch but also making sure that what you use to place them is compatible with what you use to purify them and that's why the work that we're doing with the functionalisation is a solution process approach because it gives you the most pure nanotubes so we can start with high purity semiconducting and use a chemical process to place them into little trenches and be able to maintain that purification level does that make sense so there's a lot of approaches out there is the real answer to getting them where you want them nothing has gotten better than about 10 per micron so far in a controlled pitch shift because of thermal concerns have you looked at the at the factors for nanotubes versus other alternate future technologies in a thermal sense and in particular I'm interested whether this ballistic transfer of transport has any advantages or disadvantages or money it's a true it's a terrific question that someone Rico advised by mechanical engineers should have an easy answer for and I don't I know there's been work on it I know there has but and you probably know even better than me so I don't know how that picture compares to the competition I don't know when you look at the scale devices and here these are reliably ballistic where I'm dropping all of that voltage at the contacts and what does that do with my heat issues I actually don't know the answer to that it's a good it's a good question thank you for asking that yes the reason is what we do with the dielectrics so these devices have spacers source drain extension in space or they we call call what you want but little areas that aren't gated by the electrostatic gate and what happened is when we put this aluminum oxynitride we called it it really comes down to about aluminum oxide once it's annealed it's an adhesion layer on the nanotubes to get the dielectric stick it's less than a nanometer and then we put hafnium oxide on top of that that creates this dipole at the interface between these two materials nanotubes are pretty sensitive so it doesn't take a whole lot to cause a disruption enough to switch to move the bands and so that moves the man's enough to force Injection even though it's a huge Schottky barrier it's a thin barrier based upon the amount of doping right that moves those bands so electrons are able to inject more readily than holes because we made them almost come a thermal barrier to the holes right so with the way we shoot we showed that is we took a device that was not gated all around it was just sitting on a substrate the the nanotube was put contacts on it tested it with the back aid it's a P FET we knew it should be and then we put those layers on top of it not as part as the gate stack but just on top of the nanotube and it turned to a nymphet as well so it pushed the bands down and once again had the injection of the electrons so we were able to make P FETs with the gate all around simply by using an aluminum oxide gate dielectric instead of hafnium oxide and now there's there's new issues now we have a spacer that is not doped right and there's a whole discussion about that but it does still have a leaning towards hole injection based upon the contacts another question mark yes they are very attractive and in fact most of the funded work in academia for nanotube transistors is thin film devices for flexible substrates or just thin films in general that's where most of the work in the last year or two has really happened we have some of our work focused there our end goal has to be high-performance computing because we're IBM and but everything we do towards that end benefits what you do in the thin film space because the requirements are so much more lenient you're typically dealing with non-ballistic you're dealing with micron long channels or more and we actually have a paper they'll come out in the next couple months that shows the low voltage potential now low voltage is relative for TFTs most of them run at three volts are above on backplanes for displays we show that hey you can make TF G's from nanotubes and have the same type of mobility of amorphous silicon but running in a vault which you know that kind of creates a know a new uniqueness of what you can do there but yeah the requirements are much more lenient and I know it's interesting it's it's interesting and enabling a new space primary yes primary vantage voltage scaling I mean if you if you follow the trends we should be it like 300 millivolts right by the time we hit seven nanometers or so I don't think anyone's gonna give that no no never get I I think nanotubes will struggle under 400 millivolts personally I just I think they would but I think they could deliver half of all and I think that is unique still experimentally unique and and with obviously you could appreciate with your tremendous work throughout the years in the area that showing it experimentally is a very different thing from being able to show it in a projection and nanotubes are still the only ones that you can experimentally show for sub 10 that it could work not and then we like that any other questions great questions
