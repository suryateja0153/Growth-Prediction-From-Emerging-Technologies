 welcome to the city teen ultra-precision at the interested for manufacturing today I'm going to talk about the production of carbon nanotube base field emission devices but first what is field emission it is basically the extraction and election for material we do this by putting the device in a vacuum chamber where an electric field is applied this is from the emission points of a nerd as well as the geometry of the device are important because it needs to concentrate electric fields event the work function of the material allowing electrons to tunnel through it some applications include electron beam lines for particle accelerators field emission guns using high-resolution scanning electron microscopes and also the generation of microwaves for non-lethal weapons now there is a need for the miniaturized systems in the military some approaches have been made using lasers like the personal halting and simulation response device civil applications also require the need to have portable x-ray devices instead of having big machines like the ones we see at airports just imagine the capability of having a small portable device that can be taking any where it's needed and this project will enable these technologies the targets of this project are to have high emission reproducible devices and a scalable production route using available industrial technologies I'm using carbon nanotubes because they have high current carrying capacities the nanotubes are made at the Department of material science which are made by a chemical vapor deposition process on one side we inject a liquid source of carbon and iron catalyst into a furnace and a black cloud condenses are seen in this image this cloud is then spun out with a rotating spindles from different variations of the material such as films and fiber problems arise in great part by the material as it has impurities and up to today there is no way of controlling the chirality of the carbon nanotubes so you'll always end up with a mixture of tubes with different properties another problem that we're encountering is the handling of these fibers and films because of their sprinting presence storage some of them end up having bends which will affect our field emission to solve this problem I've developed a new manufacturing which stiffens the material make an easy to handle and then it has process to manufacture a repeatable array which then undergoes quality control and field emission testing the great thing about this process is that we have full control over geometry and dimensions which allows customization for compact reliable devices thank you for listening you
