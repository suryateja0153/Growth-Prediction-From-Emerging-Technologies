 welcome to white space weekly look at the news in the data center industry so thanks is this processor news this week yes yes very big bro sister news now personally been waiting for this for a long time it's an AMD arm chip excellent so these AMD armed ships they can promise for a long while and then made to be good firm low-power micro servers that could change the way data centers get filled up ah nobody said microservers anymore basically during the presentation they haven't mentioned it once i actually had to ask them so do you think macro servers are well and truly dead and it was like no in some geographic markets they're really popular so that's pretty much it yes okay so they've delivered this and nobody needs any more or is it not quite that bad we'll see basically it does it all the puns it's good because the idea is great right to have large banks of relatively underpowered chips that consume virtually no power and then and can still do you know like any pretty much we testing in them to do these are not you know like they can fit computing chips but for example for a database server where you need loads of ramen pretty much no processing fantastic they have these are systems on the chip as well so there's loads of stuff integrated on the die they have like Ethernet sorta the PCIe with loads of lanes is it sounds nice and its Sun under 150 bucks and and what I mt wants to do it doesn't want sort of like you know a wealth of commercial products based on this but it wants developers to get involved it wants people like Susan and rep had to get involved to get their bomb loans distributions to work on arm properly because that still it's a pretty exotic solution so it's not going for commercials and is gatekeeping its artistic integrity pretty much your ing and I think you've been on that call when they said you know like oh yeah we'll have so much more plans so this is this is just step one all right there's more to come right so more AMD in future weeks I'm sort of my heart bleeds for them I mean good luck mm-hmm okay I've heard more news from an old friend this week yandex the Russian search engine who I met their data center manager Harry Kirby at sea bit last year and he was talking about their data center in Finland which would be producing waste heat to heat the nearby city of masala and last month in December they they they flip the switch and turned on the recovery plant if I remember correctly he said that the sort of like he'd in a datacenter is almost as important the resources compute right yes yes so numerous people have said this and so this could it could even affect the priority you give to efficiency over as opposed to reusing the heat if you can reuse the heat it can be a source of revenue and so in his data center he actually had to install some extra air handling to pump the hot air to the heat the heat recovery plant which technically reduced his pua of its in the process sorry increased is period within the process and an egg butter it's what it was worth doing because the earth which is the greater efficiency and the bottom line okay and they have a district heating system and place oh yeah literally plug then so those it's a great thing you can do but you can't do it everywhere yes yes as when one of the things re said to us last year is basically to build an efficient data center in terms of reusing the hickey you're better off if you building near to an existing district heating service basically you need to be in Scandinavia that's kind of gets kind of it speaking of air and one thing I like about this if you look at the end the aerial view of the data center it looks like airplane wings it does even angled like airplane wings what it end in cross section they have a like a sort of a curve like an airplane wing which is designed to create exactly the right pressure on the inlet so that the exactly the right amount of air comes through to call system brilliant good stuff so this week the European Union has done an interesting deal with a telecoms provider yes yes and where we've been sitting scratching our heads because it's our own homeboy BTW and it is now going to provide exclusive private cloud services to 52 European organizations including the European Parliament you're in defense agency and European Commission they also got another contract where they're going to be one of the five organizations providing public cloud services so ET is really capitalizing on EU they've the worth of the contracts is 24 million euros in total or each year or no no no no I think that's all over molality but this follows another two contracts they got last year to provide telecommunications services including voice communications and broadband so essentially all of the EU machine is now going to be supplied by bt and BTW just happens to share country which put GCHQ which is one of the most aggressive spy agencies in the worlds are like closely resembling an aside so privacy advocates also pleased because still and what they might prefer telecom to get it yes yes yes and it's all so strange no whenever we hear you know one company getting all the contracts for a particular serve like tender it's just boom they're either really really kid or or really really cheap yes or some deal being down the bee gees already had quite a lot of Chris's impervium over each provision of bduk broadband across the UK that was viewed by some people as being a bit monopolistic exactly exactly was the bidding process included just two companies BTW in for jitsu and like a halfway through 42 dropped out so it was a contest where nobody elevated but VT so they want yes I long shall they produce the most competitive price that can take care well according to the government they did yes and the service is there and we're all in juice or pass broadband now right we've all got super fast broadband because they decided that superfast means 10 megabits oh um amazon web services going from strength to strength the giant cloud provider has opened a facility in canada yes or planning to open a facility sorry yes it's announced that sometime this year there will be a new AWS region in canada by region it means data center or set of data centers because sometimes you in one country or area you can have more one amazon web services data center which gives you different availability zones but essentially it means if you're in canada and you want your keep your data in canada and you want to keep it on AWS you can potentially if you read between the lines of the announcement it could also mean that if you're in America and you rather keep your data in Canada UK absolutely exactly because I guess that's that should be a pretty big use case because our friends from techweekeurope literally a day before this announcement they've published the feature with the title why isn't AWS coming to Canada and they made a good case is sort of like throwing against in terms of like it's still it's a very large territory but it's a very small population so running short of hyperscale datacenters in Canada is tricky because you need customers from somewhere else yes but they I amazon is not by any means the first company in there a lot of the big players are already there iBM has two data centers in canada oracle has sites there salesforce have sites and it's yes d there must be a lot of activity presumably from American customers thanks for joining us that's white space this week let's see you next week
