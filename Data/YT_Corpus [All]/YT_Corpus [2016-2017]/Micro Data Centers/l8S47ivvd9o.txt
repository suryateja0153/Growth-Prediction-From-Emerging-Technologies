 hi everyone my name is manny estaba i'm a platform architect in Intel's data center security product division and i'm excited to present the project talk about enters open security controller so here's a legal disclaimer that Intel wants us to display and now so okay so let me let me step back and talk about you know what is the business from I mean why are we doing this and I have like three perspective right so one is as we see around this week and you know we've been hearing you know that Enterprise enterprise operations and end-users really want to start adopting OpenStack right and there's a lot of things that are happening to bring you know from a business perspective reduce costs increase agility and all that and amongst other problems you know when lot of the discussions happening the last few you know like today and tomorrow in next few days are going to be to covering the lot of those and entails addressing some of them but one of the things which are also critical from that perspective is the security part right so you know from from end-user operations perspective how do they provide the security in a similar fashion that they have been doing for their current environments so that's one challenge now secondly if you're a from a perspective of a service provider whether yours cloud service provider or your firm you know like MSSP or if you were you know just a telco connectivity service provider you want to be able to offer security service as an add-on and you should be able to do it on demand scalable as part of a value-added service and today it's not easy to do that in OpenStack and then from us if you're a security vendor you want to provide the same solution that you were providing on other environments to on OpenStack for your customer however you know you have to do several point-to-point integration and you have to rapidly in this rapidly well we guess the end technologies and it's like a high barrier right because you're doing multiple integrations and it's going to cost you at the end of the day so why is Intel doing this and what is the intent right so the overall the main purpose for Intel right now is to accelerate the adoption of virtualized security function for this project and then the other one is you know being able to how do we do it is to deliver seamless integration between virtualized security functions and there's the end controller and go more details into the deed as we go in the next few side so from a technology perspective what we have seen is you know we have seen evolution in data center from a traditional hardware where we used to have the paradigm of one application per system to you know where we have discrete compute Network and storage applications storage devices and the traditional hardware to a virtualized one where we are going into one application per virtual system and were obviously we're virtualizing the abstracting the hardware and going into the software-defined data center right in the software-defined data center at the application divides the system and the whole storage network compute become nothing but a resource pool and you're abstracting the data center so how do we provide security in this you know where we are going into this software-defined infrastructure you know if intelligent scheduler is taking application and then you know scheduling it on top of this resource pool how does it do that in a scenario where how do you provide security on top that so something has to really automate you bring the intent at the beginning you know how do you protect your workload how do you protect your security or provide security on your application and then something has to completely orchestrate all that that into the data center right so what is this what is this really what is this role of the security controller in a data center and this type of environment so you know the so-called software-defined security orchestrator so first and foremost is automation orchestration of the security from symptoms so as we said you know at the end of the day you know we want to be able to automate security in a way that we are going to be available for the software different infrastructure so taking some some of this security functionality like for example of multi-vendor weather is IPS next-gen firewall or any of those security functions being able to map those and automatically orchestrate them into the into the infrastructure the second is the centralized coordination of the security policy again over here were coordinating the policies as is applies to our infrastructure but we're not really managing a policy themselves so the IPS manager still going to define what is what a signature means or if it's a next-gen firewall it's still going to define what the application control policies are what we're doing is really coordinating the policy as it applies to the workload dynamically as the things are changing so as we get ski-doo then I more about this later the third one is were interacting with the infrastructure so we're interacting with the virtual infrastructure so in this case OpenStack and there's the end controller so what here we're doing you know things like you know making sure we instantiating the service security service in the right place based on the policy and the intent and then we're also interacting with SDN controller because we're trying to bring the actual you know insertion whether it's a simple service security insertion or it's a bumpy the wire or maybe a third van service function chaining and then the final you know pcs you know doing the elastic scale out of the security so here the example is you know if your web store you know has like ten WebM and your policy says you want to protect the web VMs using a bear application firewall and you know you have a patient firewall from certain vendor with a certain policy and now you're you know your storefront needs your application to to actually scale up so you're going from ten BPMS to 1,000 Williams now what about your policy which says now you have to go through the web application firewall so something needs to be able to scale up the security and scale down you know when it's not needed and then finally so sorry about that I guess change in the but you know I'll talk to the two bullets here so basically I we're enabling the east-west data center security which is you know basic by doing the orchestration and then we are reducing the threat of the attacks at there's the NFA environments so it's very high level of what the security controller does so next let me talk about a little bit of a conceptual architecture on how where it fits in the data center so this is where we are multiple virtual environments are being considered so you have the virtual infrastructure management whose main function is this is the OpenStack and the SDN controller on the on the top so there's a data center a which is OpenStack with let's say sdn on top and then you have a data center B which is you know the vmware nsx and then we centered on the top and then you have the OpenStack with some mana or some other layer on the top and then you have the you know general compute virtualization and network virtualization maybe container as a service or something else in the future so now you have all these different data centers and a top you have your security functions and then which is really something that you have been used to you know this is the IPS managers the firewall managers and you know over here also you have the physical appliances so you can have physical appliances like for example you could have like a firewall at the edge of your data center in the North South and so on so forth right now here's where the security control comes in so the main function is it's the security service automation and orchestration so you taking you know all these different virtual IPS virtual next-gen firewall virtual web application firewall virtual application delivery controller all these are you know let's say in the service function catalog the city controller is coming and this are multi-vendor of course and this is security control is coming in and taking that and you know distributed as a distributed virtual appliance you know it's actually doing the orchestration across all these different data centers so that's the function that it provides and then the distributor what your pious is nothing but a logical entity here that is used to you know let's say a single vendor like a specific vendors next-gen firewall across all of this data center and then you're able to centrally manage the policy on this distribution virtual appliance so what does that give you it's a very powerful concept because now the security administrator can take the distributor virtual appliance and manage it you know like the security policy it needs across all of these data centers so if you if you take it one step further is ability to you know enforce your security policy no matter where your workload is so that's that's the ability it brings to the security administrator so next let me talk about the technical benefits i have already covered a few of them but just a real quick so first is the automated provisioning of the security itself so this is very important because as we say you know the security is becoming a more and more important and we cannot really live without security the advance for the for this type of environment for software-defined a dynamic scale-out i already cover some of that and then the policy assigned workload so this is where you are giving the intent at the top you know you're able to provide a solution where your policies are still enforce no matter where your workload our applications are being hosted and then finally separation of duty this is where you know you can use the familiar tools so a security administrator doesn't have to really you know get into the network or the dev dev ops or cloud out administrator but secure administrator can use the security controller to describe the policy that he needs you know for the different work clothes and then the security control will make sure that it will do it across the multiple datacenters so next let me walk through like a quick yusuke is so this use case is you know let me just print it out here so this use case is let's say there's a three tenants so three three tenants it's a finance HR and production now if you were if your service provider this school as well be your customer a B and C okay and then you have your perimeter firewall which is the knots out and then he of your network which is the public know right so now you're say let's say here's the policy that you want for this type of work let's say for your finance workload and then on the left by the way there's a security function catalog and there let's say three different vendors that you want to use one for 50 one for ADC one for IPS and let's say the policy says that you want to be able to protect the finance workload and there are three layers of course web application and DB these are the different VMs in a different layer tears we call it now this could be subnet or they could be on the same subnet doesn't matter but there are two different tears and you want to do micro segmentation now for the finance workload let's say you want to be able to provide you know next-gen firewall being inspecting traffic between each of these three layers okay the idea is now you are providing a policy called the finance pharma policy and then you're enforcing that you know in between the three layers on the finance work on the HR let's say you don't have the need to do actual far wall but the requirement to be able to protect against application layer attack so you want to provide certain signature you know I PS type of insertion so let's say you want to do a bump in the wire insulation for a PS and you also want a you know l3 boundary you know whenever it goes out of the tenant all the traffic is still want to go through the firewall and then let's say for your production workload because you're exposing this to the Internet in addition to be able to do the micro segmentation at the firewall level you're also using a web application firewall which is what the application delivery controller is and then you're using that to be able to provide you know the web application if front end for your Web Store or for the web layer so now how does that happen so the security controller is going to take all the definitions which are there in the security function catalog for each of these vendors for the three different BNF devices we discuss and then it will interact with the OpenStack and there's the end layer and be able to provide the inner connection into the so basically it's going to interact with the SDN layer and it's going to interact with the OpenStack and making sure that those policies that we describe are being met okay so let me just quickly walk through a very high level architecture of why how we would do this and I'm just going to paint it real quick in so let's let's start with the top level which is the application itself and the user intent and the policies and we have the not binary interface interacting with the security controller which is where it's going to you know take that this is the policy that we described right you know protect my application with this vnf with this policy and so on so forth then we're interacting with the virtualization connector to the virtualization virtual infrastructure we're interacting with the SDN controller again we are not doing in the SDN controller we're not really going to do any of the SDN functionality but if the SDN controller has sfc api we're going to use it or we'll use the lower level API to do the flow programming and then we're interacting to do the policy mapping with the security function manager and then also with the agents on the vnf salma the agent is possible to be optional but if the manager allows you to do certain functionality then you don't have to go to the asian so this is the high-level I will cover and then the question is where where are we going with this project so i'm just going to just quickly show so so whatever i've discussed here is not just an idea we have working with some prototype and we are working with certain security vendors in sdn vendors and moving forward we want to take it to a proof-of-concept and working with eddie early adopter customers and then eventually we want to start working with a new build the community for end-user sdn and security winters and make it like as open source project and we we have some information on this right now on intercom /o SC which is open security controller and I also like to call out you know if anyone is interested in helping out with this project again this was a very very high level top-level view you know there'll be more details on this you know available soon but I just wanted to you know if anyone's interested from the community whether it is a security vendor or the end user or no from sdn or general from any OpenStack related you know i'll be happy to engage with them and I think that's all I had
