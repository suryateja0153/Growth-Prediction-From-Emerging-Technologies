 it's interesting are you trying to evaluate if you were to expand and try to support this trend or these type of applications like where and how big would you want to put a facility for clients is that some of the things that are going through yeah so in fact the where question in every session i sat in I asked that question where are you putting these where are you thinking of putting these I think the how big is again kind of what I the what I refer to earlier is that what we know we don't know as we think of edge we really do think of it also in a couple concentric circles you know the ultimate edge literally could be a micro data center and an autonomous vehicle driving up route 95 yeah and that could be the edge or the edge in that and therefore it it's it's a you know a 200-pound data center collecting real high velocity data from all the sensors on the car in a car around it and and that's where you put it or it could be a local facility 2,000 square foot that's taking some of that data and that data doesn't require the same amount of velocity so you could have a hundred of those within you know ten square miles and then you could have a another aggregation point that's kind of within a 25-mile radius interacting as a 4,000 square foot data center so it's really one of the perplexing problems for us as we're trying to exactly figure out that the answer to that question is you know what level of edge do you want to play on and what level edge as a service provider providing colocation and or other data center services where do you put it what does it look like what are the resilience ease what are the you know some of them have to have 2n plus 1 to some of them just have to be generated there only to some of them you know if they fail who cares you know the car crashes but so that it all has to kind of be determined to kind of figure out the where yeah and you don't want to get into too much of a science project and get too far out for the market right
