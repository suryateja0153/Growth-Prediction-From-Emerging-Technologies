 okay on our panel we have ready jog win he's the principal engineer in chief SDS architect at Intel he is responsible for developing software to find storage architecture and technologies he has over 20 years of software development architecture and systems engineering expertise he joined Intel in 1995 when he was responsible for delivering automation solutions across eight process technologies we have Thomas hazel he's the founder CTO and chief scientist at Deep information sciences I'm going to go through these pretty quickly guys just so we can get on with the panel over 20 years of experience and prior to deepen for Sciences he was the chief architects startups at acaban and virtual iron we have mark Callahan he's the software engineer of database infrastructure at Facebook marks focuses database and storage efficiency he previously led the MySQL development teams at Facebook and Google we have Kyle Bader he's the senior architect senior solution architecture right hat provides expertise in the design and operation of petabytes scale storage systems using Seth we have Peters aight civ who you know would wall well and then our moderator or moderator Matt Yankovic so Matt's been working at relational databases since the mid-90s DBA you're not to come up sweet he worked at mysql and sun microsystems as a solution architect he is our chief nerd in residence is the vp of awesome is the mighty matt Yankovic I thought they were going to play all right so we wanted to talk a little bit about data in the cloud where data in the cloud is going and so I had a lot of questions people ask me a lot of questions so I wrote them down and I thought we'd get these experts to help answer these questions for us so one of the things that I've been reading about is you know how explosive the amount of data in the cloud is now right now it's estimated that you know as much as fifty percent or more of all data is already in the cloud so what are the biggest challenges that we face right now by running data in the cloud so if you guys could just kind of chime in what do you guys see is the biggest challenge why don't we start down with Mark here at the end oh I'd like to have better compression better compression yes so smaller data in the cloud yes okay all right Thomas I guess I like to have better visualization of what your date is and what it's doing and what it's all about okay yeah it's all about storage efficiency so we are looking at you know can you compress the data can you actually use white weight idea of techniques to reduce the data ingestion problem so it's all about data growth how do you reduce the you know optimize the storage you know and achieve the data efficiency okay all right I think the last keynote really touched on it we really need to look at the way that we're storing data analyzing data processing it and make changes to do all those things more efficiently we're not going to be able to solve the problem just on any of those individual friends well for me the interesting question is a security and privacy and not essentially innovative of the cloud is insecure because a lot of cloud providers have much much better security teams than any small company or even large enterprise would ever had but I think it's more of a legislation and legal questions right if for all the you know questions in the u.s. in terms of a government abilities to reach out to a data I think that means to get some people worried right because if I keep the data in house I can you know always blow up a hard drive so I don't want the government to see it if my data is stored somewhere in the cloud I may not know even know what that's been accessed by the lobby government right if the laws in the country require doing that thing and I think a us in this case it may be actually be there the nice country right from legal climate there are a lot of it look like countries around the world which have much more the government reaching much more in those kind of things okay so down here we heard about compression and with data going into the cloud there's already a perception that virtualization cloud performance doesn't meet bare metal performance how do we continue to ensure that performance from our databases and servers and infrastructure that's in the cloud stays highly performant if we're looking at ways to try and do compression keep the data footprint small and continue to push into that virtualization space we can start down here if we want and work our way down yeah so I think the question is going to be I do want to compress the data but I want to make sure that the my latency is not going down one of the things that we are actually working on in on Intel side is you know essentially looking at it's kind of a it starts off with compression in the software and then you look at certain workloads and say you know what it can't actually handle from a latency perspective it's not the right fit then you essentially move into more of hardware based compression so the question is going to be how do we take certain latency workloads in a virtualized environment move it towards maybe offload bunch of those data processing functions into the hardware I people okay so I agree with that compression is obviously very important but how do you compress data in the most optimized way and obviously I believe a machine learning and doing some self configuration to best minimize that information so from my viewpoint having tools and technology that analyzes it in real time and make independent choices without having to rebuild a rethink at that scale that complexity that data comes in as big data all right I want good monitoring and in the Facebook patch for MySQL we spent a lot of time enhancing monitoring as Percona has done and then we want good people looking at the monitoring someone if if the data is there but you're not looking at at them there are no problems yeah yeah I mean when you brought up the performance on bare metal versus performance in the cloud I mean you really need to instrument ever layer of your stack and you need to get instrumentation also from your cloud provider and see which layers of your system or the bottleneck and try to optimize those or remove those layers and push it to somewhere else in the infrastructure because it's never going to go away you're just moving it so anything you can do to reduce layers that maybe don't make sense anymore in modern systems or with recent advances in technology then you're going to see a good increase in performance so as we're layering technologies on top of each other sometimes it's really really things that are in that stack of technologies to find out which ones are introducing inefficiencies okay okay well I think there are actually two questions different here one is a role performance and the other is monitoring and transparency which mark Callaghan touched on in terms of raw or performance which you can read on virtualized hardware versus not I think the gap will continue to too narrow and actually in the database space we had something similar years back if somebody knows you know 10 all probably 20 years ago a lot of high-performance database veyron on the road storage file systems were just introducing to match our hardware not flexible and so on and so forth right where many large database would use raw storage and then gradually changed right because the file system became the good enough so they don't introduce that overhead anymore so and they're not ready to pay for inflexibility of overall storage for you know almost non-existent performance gains and I believe as virtualization will improve your able to achieve those things and that is relatively easy issue of a bigger issue for me is what marked as done as a transparency because then you are operating in the cloud especially public cloud where your visibility in terms of what is going on is a is significantly significantly more are more limited right and you may not really are understand things and so not able to take as good decision children things as you can in a fully control environments so Peter you keep the mic for a second so you touched on security issues and security in the cloud and we know security is a really hot topic what can we do to keep our data database is secure in the cloud are there tricks are there things are the technologies we should be looking at right now to provide that well I think it is in the interest in the topic right I already spoke about the big picture question in there and the legal flow climate but but if you guys think what exactly there are security he is or when the data gets exposed is about not getting basics right right you guys know some security researchers would essentially like scan clouds right or Internet in general and found ton of MySQL servers or MongoDB service just exposed out where with no passwords are very weak passwords right this is a just getting basic things right right which already can I help you to avoid those disasters and I think that's the most the most important things to to start with right so I think any mature modern cloud provides you a lot of security features you just need to know or have some good advice about how to enable them and how to deploy thing security in the crowd in the cloud I like to add to that back to the visualization of information if you don't know where it is and what it is it's hard to secure it it's hard to know if it has important date or not so you know knowing where your data is and what it's doing is part of the security story okay yeah I mean I think Peter really hit the nail on the head when he said there's you know we can make think we can make our organizations much more secure by just making sure that we're doing the basics right making sure that we're following best practices in terms of you know using using keyless authentication with possible using encryption and transport using encryption at rest you're making sure that our systems are patched we need to you need to get those things right before we can start to think about higher level things so yeah keep to the basics you can secure your organization so before I go down here real quick I'm keeping to the basics is there something you guys maybe who have already responded feel that why we miss the basics there's something that we've done to miss them you know is it that we're just too busy you know too much information flow I mean I think some of that is is is visibility and visibility into your infrastructure and and knowing what you have deployed where and whether or not the pathways between different endpoints are encrypted a lot of times organizations don't know that they have systems that aren't up to patch levels or that they have information transferring between these systems and they've moved from one place to another where maybe it was in a more secure environment that was more acceptable but now because the the game has changed the it has changed on them it's no longer a acceptable practice so it's kind of the encryption by default for all transport encryption at rest unless you're going to need you need access to it in an unencrypted format so it's somewhat what Thomas was saying about the visibility into those different security areas because the data is so spread out yeah absolutely okay oh yeah I agree with the you have to understand what data you need to actually secure so understanding the profile of types of data that is actually sitting in your environment and trying to figure out what makes sense what doesn't make sense and then the question is going to be who needs to control the security aspect re whom are you going to trust is it going to be is it a multi-tenant environment where every tenant has to help control over it or is it going to be a data center admin controlling controlling over it so it really depends on the security strategy and it has to be part of the deep corporate DNA to really be able to secure the data as opposed to really after thinking where a someone ur ability happened and then you are starting to figure out what to do visibility and strategy and have a right right architecture in place to do it is the right thing to do all right mark do you want to add anything or just encryption at rest and encryption on the wire someone else has said okay okay so we're seeing like attending 10x increase in expected data sizes over the next 10 years with data is predicted to double every year so with the explosion of data and we heard from the Amazon folks on how they're planning to you know use micro services to try and analyze that data how do we effectively analyze that amount of data what sort of tools what sort of tricks what sort of things do we need in order to make sure that we can analyze that amount of data we'll start with mark down at the end so fortunately I'm small data not big data so analyzing that is not not my problem storing it might be and for me tiered tiered storage so a combination of maybe 3d crosspoint nand flash and disk to allow me to be efficient when you know if it's doubling every year in 10 years it's going to be more than 10 x yeah yeah I guess it's a question on do you see p power to figure things out or use your storage and you know new technologies new science to to do it in real time and so I think you know innovation is key to any of this stuff that's going on with the big data and you know the classic get more nodes and use more nodes it's very costly so hopefully uh people in the crowd ourselves up here are going to invent new things I can solve some of these big data problems yeah I think so when it comes to actually managing the data explosion it's all about tearing your data so that you have a cheap and deep maybe capacity tier as a way to store your most of the capacity or enter data and then some intelligence on top of it to be able to say i'm going to read certain portion of this data and i want to cash it may be in the 3d cross point-based dims so in other words for you to do analytics it doesn't have to be that blazingly fast media that you have to deploy and do the fraud detection you can have tears but the software needs to be intelligent enough to be able to say I'm going to read this data to do the real-time analytics I should be able to pull this end much more intelligent way so it's not going to be a brute force software implementation that may exist today but it got to be a lot more advanced in terms of predicting the data patterns and pulling that data from the capacity so that we can actually manage the data explosion part with the best and optimized tseebo but at the same time software intelligence needs to evolve too yeah I think we need to take kind of a multistage approach to solving these sorts of problems I mean on one hand you want to as you're collecting the data synthesize it and send digests of it back into into your storage systems whenever that that's possible and that makes sense so you know reducing the amount of data that you have to handle doing some work at the edge as opposed to trying to do it in a central location and then also keeping track of some sort of metadata about the value of data so that you can make decisions about what to do with that data based on how much value it provides to your organization and that value can change over time and that's when you can move it to different storage tiers put it in a colder storage if it's if it's high-value data that needs a really really seiki workload then flash is obviously a really good suitor for that if it's really dense data if it's really large files that you need to stream from place to place to process you know hard drives are a perfect fit for that sort of that sort of workload so you know understanding your data understanding the value of that data and then being able to manage the lifecycle of that data based on the value that it provides your organization I think will be important ok so I'll tax on two points here so the first one I think is it is our choice in many cases in how much data we produce right and I choose to store I remember the times again maybe 15 years ago there we would store much much less data right in terms of city operations and the sons of off right or even from visitors going through a free website right as our abilities to store and process that data increase right we're able to cost-effectively extract their value from from more data and I think there is a balance we will be find in a later on right as we generate more and more data we may have to become more selective in what we choose to store and analyze may be summarized certain things and and so on the other thing is I think a great question about where your ability to do something right and sort of scalability and an efficiency and what is interesting i think what right now we see what a lot of in new technologies emerges which not just allow us to process huge amount of data by rolling out my massive cluster as Hadoop for provides for example but thinking how we can tackle some particular use case is very if we effectively for example there are a number of engines coming out right now for time studious data which are able to really storm very very efficiently with much higher compression than conventional databases can and around certain operations on them right or I hear there are graph databases which also can run much some operations much more effectively people are talking about what kind of data vision for the algorithm we can do to support the machine learning and their artificial intelligence in many cases those require things which your traditional relational database if he be three indexes may not be best suited for and I think that is there a lot of growth investment and changes happen right now so there's actually been a lot of growth in the public cloud space in in that public cloud space I believe the last estimate Gartner threw out there was like 20 x growth compared to only 3 X in the private cloud is there a point at which we're going to be running most of our data or all of our data in the public cloud versus the private cloud will the private cloud always have a place in that infrastructure or is it something that we're going to continue to push into commoditized systems that are outside of our own data centers Peter you want to start with that one yes well yeah i think there's a big difference between always right and in most cases i think if you look at a lot of companies starting right right now the public cloud is really default choice for our mm for many of em right so i think that that is a that is coming but I believe we are still going to be a lot of folk or which are going to run some things in the private cloud whatever that is for a kind of security kind of an government trust trust reasons or wherever is because they have some very special requirements for example for Hardware Iranian right or something like that or just because the change take times right it is a very interesting for me was to recognize what there are quite a few folks are running the environments on mainframe stills right maybe now internet environment you think oh those monsters are alone gone what you know is still they still out there right and still plugging along and the other interesting question is are wherever public the cloud will always be a cost-efficient we can see some some companies after they grow they choose to move to their own environments right some don't for example which is I think very interest in the Netflix which is a very big company but it is still uses Amazon Cloud very aggressively on the other hand Dropbox is talking about moving a lot of storage from where amazon because they can store stuff more effectively these days so i think it's interesting what we still see this kind of dynamics right now yeah i'm i don't i don't see private cloud going away in the near term either and and I do think increasingly the the default choice is to go to the public cloud for these sorts of resources and as kind of the the pendulum of technology advantage Nino swings back and forth at right now you know because of the operating model that the public cloud provides where it's just purely operational expenses it makes sense for for many organizations especially if they are unsure of theirs their scale requirements early on or their their longevity of their you know the operations that they're doing so you're not making an investment that that you you know wouldn't pay off in the long term because it becomes an asset that that then you would have to sell off because you're having contraction of your business but if technology advances to a certain degree were especially on the side of storage and we have the ability to build systems that can do what we need to do in a very very minimal footprint I think there will be many organizations that continue to choose that and and just have a you know a smaller set up of of their own hardware and continue to run it that way okay yeah i agree with Kyle so I don't see private cloud ever going away I know we have lot of debates over public versus private and all that stuff but in general you will see certain workloads fitting a bill very well with a flyweight public cloud space as well as certain workloads have a excellent fit in the private cloud for example if you are looking at the security compliance and all those things you really don't want to put certain data in public cloud but on the other hand let's say if you are going to do certain batch analytics and then there is a project that is coming up it requires bus capacity it really does not make sense for you to go invest that type of infrastructure in a private cloud one-time investment so I think project-by-project basis you may see certain scenarios where it may be a very good fit for the public cloud but in general I don't see private cloud ever going away for wide variety of reasons but the what I see is you know essentially a blend of public versus private so your workload you will see a trend where certain workloads and you know the software ecosystem maturing where it kind of blurs the line between public and private but rather you have data that is actually in both places you should be able to do things fatally seamlessly and transparently that's where we see industry evolving over the course of time as I was really public and private being a very rigid boundaries I definite think both um i think for the compliance security but those things can change I think as a developer I want services so wanna be in the cloud I've talked to so many DBAs and they want to control everything cuz they're responsible for everything and they want it out of the cloud so I think you know there's going to be both because services sometimes good but full control is sometimes good okay I'm just ready for Thomas to speak about MySQL what comes next all right well I did have one more question I just wanted to know does anybody know when we're gonna actually run out of space so actually I liked your title and I thought about and I thought about it and cloudy with a chance of running out of disk space I think it's more cloudy running out of time or money this space is always going to be there it's the money in time that I'm worried about all right yeah I think the question is gonna be can you afford it yeah okay all right well thank you everybody appreciate the time thank you
