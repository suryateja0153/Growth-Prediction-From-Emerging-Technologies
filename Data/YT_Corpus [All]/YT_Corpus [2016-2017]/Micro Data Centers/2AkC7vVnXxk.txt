 today we're going to talk about security an orchestration for heterogeneous network and we've spent the conference talking about the different platforms and different technologies that the network is now built on and I wanted to talk a little more about that my name is Maya Malkovich I'm director of product marketing for Toofan and today I want to introduce you to bill bill is a security administrator bill is managing security across Palo Alto panorama cisco vmware nsx and recently AWS bill has to manage all these different technologies and he feels like he's losing control over network security and he needs help so let's talk a little bit more about the heterogeneous network a few years ago most data centers were physical okay we had a physical network with cisco juniper checkpoint others and we the the InfoSec teams had to manage zones and subnets in order to make sure that the network was protected then came next-generation firewalls right and all of you are here because you're using or thinking about using next-generation firewalls so there's another aspect to the security policy there's applications there's users there's more more complexity to the security policies that you manage then King the software-defined data center right with the expectations of productivity from the business expectations for agility a lot of companies adopted the software-defined data center and with that the software-defined network and then it's there's a need to manage micro segmentation right the perimeter has moved or shifted like we heard in the opening session and there is also a need to manage segmentation within the data center within your virtual data center so this adds to complexity of what you're already managing now a lot of DevOps teams are also using public cloud right a lot of applications VMs coming up in public cloud again for better agility provided to the business and the security teams are expected to manage the security aspects right the security the responsibility for the public cloud is shared between the public cloud vendor and the security team so the security team has to be also aware of security groups and how to manage security groups for the different VMS and different applications and if that's not enough there are a lot of applications today that span across these different technologies these different platforms so I can have an application that is in public cloud but I have my application server in my database in the virtual database in sorry the virtual datacenter so how do I manage security and connectivity for that application so let's have a quick show of hands how many of you manage security and connectivity across more than one management system okay so a lot of you so there's a challenge with that there's a challenge of knowing exactly what's going on in between all these different platforms so let's look at those challenges the first one is complexity and we've talked about that there's multiple platforms multiple vendors a lot of management systems it's very difficult to understand what exactly is allowed or blocked on each of these systems and for public cloud there's even limited visibility just to know which VMs and applications were set up now add to that the constant change and there are changes all the time new applications that are coming up the business requires agility from IT in order to make sure that the that there's that all new applications are up and running in a very rapid in aspect and there's also a need to manage all these changes because if you don't manage the changes if these changes are happening at or if you're using say an Orchestrator for the specific change just just to run the change without any audit and control for that change then the change can introduce risks to your network okay all these changes in complexity bring in a challenge of cybersecurity that can put your network in jeopardy because there may be some overlooked gaps of access that a cyber attacker can try to exploit so with all of this with all the complexity and change you have to make sure that you're still protecting the network that you're not opening access that is not required that you're not creating the the gap that the next attack will try to exploit but with the security there's also need for connectivity okay we can't have security blocking business revenues that's not going to happen there's a need to maintain security but you have to make sure that you're providing the right agility for the business so connectivity must be maintained you can't break an application in order to secure the network okay an applications require connectivity and that's often a balance between connectivity and security and last but not least this is a compliance challenge so a lot of companies have to comply with either industry regulations or it could be internal best practices and you have to not just enforce these standards you also have to prove that you're enforcing them so you have you need either reports or some type of documentation to show that you are indeed enforcing this compliance so to take a closer look at these challenges we recently ran a survey with Enterprise Strategy Group ESG and of course we found that cloud adoption is that wasn't a surprise for us we found that 69 percent of respondents said they had private cloud in production and 49 percent of respondents implemented Sdn software-defined networks and 65 percent of respondents were using public cloud significantly so there was no surprise with these numbers we knew that cloud adoption was imminent I think the surprise was when we found out that most organizations will have more than one platform so most organizations are using hybrid cloud not just private or public and they're using multiple platforms they're using AWS and Azure or the they're using OpenStack and VMware NSX so there's a lot of platforms that you need to - - you need visibility and control for we also found out in the survey that info security teams are not prepared to secure the cloud infrastructure so 69% of respondents agreed that they are still learning how to apply security policies in the cloud okay that's worrying sixty-two percent agreed that they find it difficult to get the same level of visibility in cloud as they do with physical networks of course the public cloud is a lot of times not owned by the security of network teams so maybe they didn't get the memo of a new VM or a new application that was just set up and 56% agreed that it was difficult to audit network security controls in the cloud environments poor bill there's a heavy impact for all of these challenges of the heterogeneous networks first of all he's facing growing exposure to cyber threats okay he's he's not sure how everything is protected he feels like there's there's a lot of chance to to use the new cloud platforms in order to try and launched a successful cyberattack and he also doesn't feel like he has the right visibility and controlled to these new platforms that he's managing he's tasked with managing the security but he doesn't always have the visibility that he needs in order to do that and again like they said in the opening session you can't secure what you can't see of course there's also a risk of non-compliance and we all know that there are significant penalties for that if you if you can't prove compliance either because you were too busy with other things in order to pass the audit or because you couldn't you didn't have the right visibility you needed and the right reporting in order to prove compliance then you're facing some consequences and just for the daily changes there's a challenge on how to manage these changes on-premises usually these changes are manual so they take some time so on the cloud everything is happening that is everything is very dynamic but when you need to make a change to your either physical or virtual data center it might take some time because you have to understand exactly what you need to change maybe go through a security check make sure that everything is audited so it could take time and on the other hand in the cloud changes are happening ad hoc there's just changes happening all the time as soon as the VM is up it's added to a security group and a lot of times you lack the audit and control that you need for these changes so what is Bill going to do he's confused he is he needs a solution for these challenges so first of all he's mapping exactly what he needs and he needs a single console that will allow him to manage security and connectivity across the systems so that he doesn't have to manage security and connectivity in Palo Alto panorama and then with Cisco and then with AWS he needs console for that okay that single console needs to give him the right visibility and control to all platforms so not just panoramas where he can see everything and he controls everything but also for AWS and NSX and all the other platforms that he's using he needs the single console to reduce the attack surface so to ensure that he is in compliance with this with a baseline security policy and with the regulations and standards that he needs to comply with and finally he also needs to implement changes in minutes so he needs to fulfill those expectations of productivity and agility from the business so he needs to implement the changes very fast so he mapped his needs now he wants to take a closer look at what that means the single pane of glass a single console what does that mean it means a way to abstract the security policies from all the different platforms right so we said Palo Alto panorama Cisco is a Cisco routers AWS and vmware nsx any fee in the future if he wants to also use Microsoft Azure and OpenStack he would like to have those supported as well so he needs this abstraction layer in order to be able to view and control all the security policies and he wants to see them in muddled a certain way so he doesn't have to figure out how to work with security groups and then how to work with micro segmentation and how to work with next generation policies he wants everything to be modeled the same way so that it's easy for him to understand and control it in addition to the security policies that he wants to control he also wants to control connectivity to control connectivity he needs to pull in routing information from all these platforms from all of his routers and switches and build a topology simulation for his network this is the way to manage connectivity across platforms if I know exactly what my to Paulo is I can run a path analysis that will go across my software-defined data center and my the public cloud okay so I can know exactly what is the connectivity status and I can troubleshoot connectivity across these systems so in this example if you look at the at the PowerPoint you see a path okay and the path goes across AWS palo alto cisco a SA and a Cisco router okay and for every point on the path I can see whether the policy is allowing or blocking traffic okay I am checking this path for a specific service or in this case any but I can check it for a specific service and I can tell you can tell on the left-hand side you have either a little red icon or a little green one to say whether or not policy is allowing access so it's very easy to troubleshoot connectivity if suddenly something is not working I can see immediately where my traffic is blocked and I can change that okay I can enable connectivity across systems okay not just for a single system so I have the visibility I have the abstraction layer for security and for connectivity now what do I do with it I want to reduce the attack surface and ensure continuous compliance so I need a baseline security policy an enterprise-wide policy that says what is allowed and blocked between my security zones okay I have security zones on the axis okay and and each cell and the matrix will say whether traffic should be allowed or blocked this is not for a specific device this is for the entire enterprise okay this is what this is my security policy this is what I want to comply with in order to make sure that I'm not providing access for potential attacks so I can use this to strengthen my security posture okay I can use this to help make sure that security is maintained but I can also use this to ensure compliance because if you can see in the in the drill down okay there's a way to say whether access between these security zones need to have a comment or whether you allow any or not or what is the the permissiveness level that you allow for this rule so how many IPS do I allow in source or destination so the granularity here allows you to also ensure compliance with specific regulations either a PCI Sox Newark and others and this is not just used to find violations in your existing policy you can also use it moving forward for every change that you want to make so every change I want to make I can check against this matrix to see whether or not it's introducing potential violations and I can make a decision based on that on whether I want to make the change whether it needs to go into any kind of a security approval process or if I want to add an exception a pretty periodic exception that will expire in three months for continuous compliance I also have to make sure I maintain an audit trail and the audit trail needs to again go across vendors and platforms I need to make sure I capture all the changes who made these changes were they part of the of the change window or outside the change window is this change allowed or not and specifically in Palo Alto for example drill down into the rule profiles okay the security profiles for each rule because that's something that's it's very important for me to know if someone has changed the vulnerability profile of a rule for example so I need to know that I need to know who made the change when they made the change and I need a full audit trail for all of my systems now that I have security and compliance it is time to take care of agility right which talked about agility you can't have security blocking agility so I need to make sure that changes are made in minutes how can I make sure of that I can build a workflow I can build a workflow that can be completely automated that workflow can have embedded security and compliance in it so like we said every change will be examined against the security policy and when that workflow is automated and all changes are made from that workflow then change changes will happen in minutes very short time so let's look at the process for example a sample process okay this is just an example of course every organization will have a different process different guidelines on what the process should look like what type of approval levels are required but in this example the change ticket can come from different sources it can come from a ticketing system if organizations are using remedy or service now that's the standard change process it's not you can't use a different system that is a ticketing system that the organization has standardized on and that's what we are going to continue using so the ticket will either come from one of those systems the ticket can come from a portal a user portal okay so some service providers may want tickets to come from a user portal or it can come from a higher level of abstraction from an a change in an application so if I have an application connectivity model and I want to make changes to that application like adds load balancing or I want to mirror the application to another data center or anything that I want to do with the application I can also drive a change from that so once the change request is in the system we can check it against the security and compliance standards okay is this change violating my security policy if the answer is yes then it either has to go through approval I can add an exception for it or I can reject it together if someone opened a change for HTTP access you probably want to reject it and tell them to open the access for HTTP so you can do that or you can add an exception that will expire okay and then it will expire in three months and someone will have to request this axis again but there are different ways to manage that you know that to make sure that security and compliance are built into the process okay I want to make sure of that because I don't want to make ad hoc changes that might undermine my security standards after I know that this change is legit or it has been approved I can design it now bill when he needs to design a change today he has to first understand which devices that change has to go through okay so which devices are in the path he needs to understand whether or not this is implemented on a specific device and if it's not implemented how to implement it and it takes him a long time to do that if there's an automated mechanism that can identify the right policies and the right changes to make that will make Bill's life a lot easier so you remember the topology map that I showed earlier with the path analysis this is where we would use that this is where Bill would leverage that path analysis to say I know which devices are in that path I also know which devices are blocking traffic today so I can tell what changes need to be made so again it will be an automatic way to get that information based on the topology simulation after you know what the changes are that need to be made it would be great if the system kudos will push them right have the system push the changes for me this way I it's it's reduces complexity because I don't have to go to different systems to make the change and it reduces the chances of human error because if someone is designing the change and someone else is implementing it it sometimes is not doesn't look exactly the same so I want to make sure that the implementation is completely aligned with the change design and the way to do that is to automate it and finally you need a way to audit the change so there needs to be a complete audit mechanism to make sure that changes were made based on what was requested that they were that that they went through the right approval process and that they go into the system to be documented and authorized so this is what I need for my change automation and if I can automate all the steps and automate each step in itself I can make changes really really fast ok I can skip approvals for changes that don't have violations and it will go completely automatic and the changes that do have violations will just go through approval and then will be implemented automatically the last thing that was bothering bill was visibility into public cloud he wasn't exactly sure how he could control security when VMs were just set up overnight and he wasn't always aware of that so he needs an automated mechanism that will discover everything that's happening for on the public cloud he needs to understand which VMs were set up what applications were set up which what what type of tags these VMs have and what what are the security groups that each VM belongs to so he needs to get all that information and he needs to be able to manage it and there has to be an automated way to do that ok because no one is going to send him an email for every VM that's set up so there better be an automated way to see that and after he gets the visibility once he has the for the application to know exactly which VM this application is using and what is the connectivity between them he also needs to be able to change that okay if the VM is now part of the wrong security group or it has to be part of another security group that needs to be able to make that change from the system once again in order to make sure that there are no human errors and that the change is made automatically so bill knows what type of solution he needs now he has to go and find it when he finds that solution that addresses these things that these challenges and these functions that he identified then he will be able to manage security and connectivity across the heterogeneous network so across all of his platforms he will be able to enforce security and compliance he will also be able to automate all his network security changes right with the process that we saw and finally he will be able to orchestrate application connectivity because he can get all the application information from his public cloud and from all of his other platforms so to summarize what we talked about today where the challenges of heterogeneous networks and how to maximize agility and security across the heterogeneous network and the way to do that is with network security policy orchestration what network security policy orchestration gives you is first of all visibility and control for all your platforms ok and most of you answered that you are meant that you are managing more than one system it will give you a way to reduce the attack surface so the strength and security and to ensure continuous compliance because you have a central view central control for all of your systems and because you have an automated process you can implement changes in minutes instead of days so if we check on bill bill is now orchestrating network security policies across all of its platforms palo alto cisco nsx and AWS bill is smart we like Bill if you want to discuss this further then there's a discussion panel for ignite that you're welcome to to look at and I will now take any questions that you have yes wait I think there's a microphone that should be on its way so same bill now has to deal with a slightly different world his applications have adopted this continuous integration continuous development lifecycle so they keep changing every two to three weeks when their Sprint's come out and so their security posture keeps continuously being updated and the challenge here is that not only do you have to know what their current security posture is but they're evolving security posture part of that has to come back to the application owners actually having visibility to their application and what the network is doing to it does to fit or anyone out there in this in the vendor space has that ability to say what is really happening to this application latency I mean you're talking that was a perfect example you had AWS and you had maybe the application looking somewhere else but how do you see your SLA being provided to that to that application how do you deal with continuous change through security posture and bringing that visibility back so that it's no longer just bill that has this problem it's shared across the entire environment so that's a great question there are at least two vendors that can address that need and Toofan is one of them so we have an application connectivity modeling product okay that allows you to also manage the application and it doesn't have to be the security administrator it can be someone from DevOps we have customers where the application owners are the ones who are logging in and looking at the information or even getting alerts from that system so they don't have to log in but they will be able to know what is changed with the application there's complete history of what is changing as well and of course there's connectivity troubleshooting for the application there's a way to add load balancing for example if so even if an f5 you added a load balancer you can see that in real time for the application sure so you can see that change you can see that that happened I think your question had another part to it of what happens if the application needs to change the security policy baseline and that's something that has to go through the security team so you can't make that change without the security team knowing about it and making that change so the application owner will request the change you know they can say I need this I need this for revenues I need these to enable the business and it will be approved with an exception and if it's something that you know that you keep using and you keep renewing every three months then the security team needs to make a change to the baseline but it has to happen between these teams it's not it's not one team and it's not the other it has there has to be collaboration between the teams and for that collaboration toofan has the we call the secure apps that's the product and secure app is enables you to view and manage application connectivity across the different systems thank you for the great question any other questions okay if you have questions I'm still gonna stay here for a while there's no session after us so so we can stay and thank you very much again for joining this last rake out session thank you
