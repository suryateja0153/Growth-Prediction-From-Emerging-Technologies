 good afternoon everybody and the thankss okay good afternoon everybody and this is have another stick up and we'll be making a presentation today as a part of a research cluster to be created by uce and today's topic is actually cloud computing so in this presentation I will be talking about the growing importance of cloud computing and why there is a need for research avenues within cloud computing and what are the general challenges of cloud computing at a global level and more importantly what are the cloud research opportunities for researchers in India and what are the resources are available for a researcher would be about to start his research progress see cloud computing has become a central force today so it is very difficult to ignore cloud computing and do whatever that we want to do for example even if you're a citizen then you are using a product like Facebook or Gmail and even if an enterprise or even entrepreneur then you are going to use the cloud computing here are certain examples which shows that how cloud computing has entered into the mainstream of everyday life for example let us start with the American government see the American government has what is known as cloud first policy in u.s. what it means is cloud first policy mandates that agencies take full advantage of cloud computing benefits what it means this if American government here or any agency of that would like to have any IT infrastructure they should look at cloud computing first that means if there is a new solution they are searching out demand it says that you should search within cloud computing and if you are upgrading an existing legacy system into something new then you should look at cloud computing so cloud computing has become a fundamental option for anybody who was related to IT and not only in United States even in India back home in India meg Raj is the cloud initiative by the Indian government it is a very massive project so it is going to put entire range of citizen services on to cloud for form so you for example we have example logged is Locker other card and dog they are actually de fundamentally they are using cloud technology thirdly even biggest companies like Microsoft they have a policy called mobile first micro and cloud first that means they think that these two things like cloud and mobile are going to change the way we are be organizing our enterprises so cloud computing has become very cent and this is something that we should always look at having said that all new cloud computing has been widely adopted by the industry the research on cloud computing is still at early stage see we know that cloud computing entered the public domain only in 2006 okay in the last 10 years it has swept everything and actually has entered everything but there are many problems which are still there which are actually preventing the adoption of cloud computing although it's very powerful for example the issues of privacy the issues of security compliance and all you know the very recently Indian government passed the Parliament the other bill where actually which was one of the crucial question was asked let's see what is the privacy and security issues of citizens who share that information like fingerprint so this is a big challenge new challenges can keep emerging for an industry application and data storage see for example all the cloud started with the computer systems now it is extended to mobile devices and IOT now these additional things actually causing new problems many of the cloud computing problems have been already solved but when you get you connect it to an IOT device when you get connected to mobile then there are additional security power and other power consumption or other problems so this poses a great opportunity for any researcher so I will let me start with the first theme that means what are the global trends in the cloud computing research there are nine major trends the first trend is actually called automated service provision see today we know that one of the best and one of the essential quality of cloud computing is on demand so that means whenever user requirements goes up then the cloud computing will actually start providing those results I mean the resources for example if you start with one user and if there are 100 users and there are thousand users cloud computing says that it can supply those data without a prop the second important area where cloud computing needs research is called virtual machine migration we all know that virtualization is the backbone of cloud computing without virtualization you cannot either think of scaling or on-demand services so virtualization can provide a significant benefit in cloud computing by enabling virtual machine migration to balance load across datacenters so what virtualization does is if a particular process or an application is growing in demand then actually it would actually handle it will create more virtual resisters resources or instances by creating them on a different physical machine so this process of actually moving an activity from a location to another location is called migration so the challenges which come in this research challenges come in this area detecting the one workload hotspots and initiating a migration lacks agility to respond certain workload changes see for example the world is 24 hour business so now whenever there are some instances which are happening in during the day time in India they actually subsidy mean they become less or yuning so in that cases actually you should be in a position to detect what is this time instants what is the time interval during which actually highest activities happen in SE Asia I say in Japan or United States so since globe only is cloud computing operating any model which can detect workload hotspots is a great contribution or a research contribution to cloud computing in transferring in memory state consistently so whenever you create a virtual instance you have to transfer your activity or a process there so when you are doing actually you have to send the data as well as the process so this kind of the process is called in memory status consistently that means whatever there was happening on the previous virtual machine should be transferred inconsistently anything that misses will cause all the problems so the second area of cloud computing which needs research attempts is called virtual machine migration so here are certain references for any researcher these are the five references the most important one is the last one live virtual machine migration techniques survey and research challenges that you can consult anytime the third area where cloud computing needs research is called server consolidation server consolidation is an effective approach to maximize resource utilization while minimizing energy consumption see now unless in the traditional computing you cannot afford to waste your resources you need to use virtualization so that whatever the existing resource is they're consumed properly and optimized correctly so now there are certain challenges in this so server consolidation is the process of identifying all the resources that you and look at the demand and consolidate all the Amin all the resources into one unified resource and give it to them so those challenges which come under this category are the challenge of optimally consolidating service is often formulated as a variant of the vector bin packaging problem which is an np-hard optimization problem so now is also posed it is a challenge so if you can formulate a research proposition or a hypothesis which solves this problem what is the best way to consolidate what is the best way to consolidate your service I will I will answer to these questions okay and secondly dependencies among Veeam such as communication requirements so when you start consolidating service that means you are creating virtual instances on each of the servers then automatically this means whenever there is a demand for that dinner you are moving D coming you are moving the jobs from one server to another server through their virtual machine the virtual machines in that case actually communication requirements how do you establish the model where to virtual machines communicate with each other when you are consolidating this server so this actually becomes a second challenge within the server consolidation the third one the fourth one is energy management so what it means is cloud computing is based on data centers and data center is a very infrastructure intensive system and if you have been already aware Amazon actually maintains two million servers in their relevant data centers so just imagine maintaining 11 I mean 2 million servers and what is the consumption what is the space occupation what is the electricity which is needed and what is the maintenance that is needed so in this case actually even if you say a unit of current for each of these machines then you are saving a lot of things so designing energy efficient data centers is a perennial challenge within the data center management so some of the challenges are there how to achieve a good trade-off between energy savings and application performance while you are trying to save energy you should not degrade your performance so this becomes a serious challenge or a serious research opportunity for anybody who is interested to take that the next one is traffic management and analysis today no cloud computing essentially a form of network and we have started our network from land to van to internet and all so managing traffic that means understanding which node is doing what which node is sending what message is actually called traffic management day but today the scale of cloud computing is so big that it is very impossible to know where the traffic is coming how do you expect the next traffic element or where the message will come so density of links is much higher than in the enterprise network even the biggest networks like say Microsoft or they have a number when they have a less number of computers compared to Internet now how do you design a mechanism and algorithm which can give you at a global level or a cloud computing level are two predictable traffic requirements or trigger trends and manage them most existing networks can compute traffic matrixes for few thousand end hosts for example I told you say the if Microsoft has to say one lakh machines then they have a computing technologies which will predictive in traffic for them but when it skills up to global level it is not there so this also poses one serious challenge for the service provider at the same time an opportunity for these research people and finally existing methods assume some traffic flow patterns for example if you have a company like say Google then you know this is a traffic pattern from Asia because they know the working hours this is a traffic pattern from Europe because you know the working hours of that but if you are running a company like Google where actually such can come from any part of the globe so that's very difficult to predict that so that also poses a big challenge and because of these MapReduce jobs that means MapReduce jobs actually the paramedic control things so a query can come from Japan and the next query can come from Saudi Arabia so it's very difficult to predict that so if you can come out with a model which can mean helpful means which can mean to certain practically help companies then also it is a great service or a great research problem well the next one is data security which is well known see today one of the reasons why cloud computing is not catching up with enterprises many enterprises is a simple reason because there is an inherent fear in the people regarding data security and data privacy now although very important and very powerful algorithms have been designed there is a still a problem and now the security and data firm in a privacy problem has enhanced because now cloud is not alone it is get connected to IOT devices on one side and mobile devices on the other side so because of this now there is an additional security threat the original cloud computing problem it doesn't start with in the cloud computing or your computers it could be starting from the device that a user is carrying of the Nyota device which is installed so if you look at that one then solving these problems formulating then how does you have to have a security algorithms or protocols established when there are three elements like an IOT device and a computer device and a mobile device also becomes a serious or a very useful cloud computing research problem so the two fundamental things is confidentiality that means how do you ensure that your data is only known to you and the interested party that you would like to share and auditability that means how do you know what are the transaction that has happened on my data when it is stored on a cloud service provider this seventh area where cloud computing opens up research avenues is called software frameworks we don't want cloud computing is a flawed form for a large-scale data intense applications so traditional application or approaches don't work it uses MapReduce frameworks such as Hadoop so the key challenges that we have in this area is performance modeling of Hadoop jobs and at appreciating in dynamic conditions we know that companies like Google they actually operate at a global level so how do you mean create Hadoop jobs to execute them and adapt to scheduling that means depending on the requirement like see I told you know Asia is working when Europe is sleeping or something like that now this kind of a bad ones making MapReduce frameworks energy away now if some hard root system is working 24 by 7 acres yes yes yes sir yes sir okay sir okay yes sir yes sir yes definitely okay okay so okay so let me start it again with software frameworks see cloud computing is afloat from a large scale data intense application so it uses a MapReduce framework which is global in nature so the key challenge that we have in this is performance modeling of Hadoop jobs and add up to scheduling in dynamic conditions so I told you a request for Google can come from anywhere requests well-being can come from anywhere or an email can start stingy upon and end up in Saudi Arabia in that cases actually you can't predict and in that case is how do you have an adaptive shielding algorithms and approaches so that's the first question that would be solved in this software famous the second one is maybe MapReduce frameworks energyaware I told you see companies like Amazon Web Services they maintain two million computers and that is it and if you put each system on all the time then there is a consumption of the machine itself and also the processor so how do you make the Framus energy aware and also the approaches for example turning of Hadoop node into sleep mode when it has finished its job while waiting for new assignments see can you can you shut down certain machines at least the process which is running when there is no demand like we put may use a screen saver for our computers or other things ok and Hadoop and HDFC's 2 must made energy aware that means they should be able to use less than less energy I told you the the extension of cloud computing is IOT and most of the IOT devices IOT devices are actually they are very mean less in their energy requirements but they also need they also have an infrastructure which doesn't allow them to store lot of data like they don't have a battery supply at all so this connection also should be taken care because energy consumption and access becomes a challenge for such devices so this seventh area of cloud computing where research is needed is so well framework and the question that you'd ask I just I told you the next important area is normal cloud architecture see now cloud computing implies centralized huge data centers we know that Amazon has eleven data centers across this whole planet some in Europe some in America some in Japan and all now there is a research which is and the reason why this company started with centralized data center is it's called economies of scale that means they can put thousands of machines or millions of machines so they can using the communication like to reach anybody in fact I as I probably tell my students say so there are nearly 60 million Gmail users in India and Gmail didn't have a data center in India many a times our data goes out and come back so now there is a reason both technical and political to split these data centers into small things for example small size data centers may be very advantageous both technically research must discover optimal size of data centers now that instead of Amazon having 11 data centers concentrated in three continents is it possible to spread them across the world and also there is a political situation demand for example the German government has told Microsoft that this data of their it citizens which ever stood on Microsoft data center that data cannot go out of Germany that means Microsoft is not allowed to carry the data of German citizens and store it say in Australia America so that is not allowed for this reason there is a need to redesign your data centers both technical technically as well as for the requirement of the customers but at the same time they were very optimally for the use of by the persons or the organization so we need some novel approaches in designing and developing data centers so this actually in a sensory includes everything shaker when I say application for comments it is all the dimension both in terms of what resources it consumes at the same time what kind of ASL is it meets on the user end okay so this is a very main open spectrum of opportunities both at the consumption of physical resources and the meeting the requirement of a cell this is their includes actually see I am not actually a federated closer interoperable clothes I'm not separating but actually I'm taking cloud as a one intimate one complete Imam in form but this when actually we dissected further for example whether lease applies for a public cloud or a private cloud or a hybrid cloud that will go deeper that we will go at later stage but these are the general problems at cloud level okay definitely see auditability is a process when actually a particular function or activity has happened then somebody would be able to reconstruct it for example say suppose you're conducted say 100 transaction in your bank using your ATM card now the auditor will be able to find out like how many transaction you did when did you do that how much money did you return each of these transactions this is called audit audit ability the confidentiality is something that you today transaction only human bank should be knowing it no third part you should be aware about this part under the cloud computing major such as Google Microsoft and they make investment in the areas where they have value for them for example how to build a data center how to regulate the schema scheduling algorithms these are very important from the cloud computing perspective but from the India Indian national perspective we have a different kind of challenges for example the Indian Internet is very slowest so anything that is designed for American or Russian or say European networks will not work well in India so these are the bottlenecks that we have which actually pose a certain mean research challenges so as such there is a lack of sustained and focused funding opportunities on cloud computing for researchers within the India that will direct their cloud computing research efforts for the Indian context so that means now how do I customize the research challenge so that I can answer the question raised by the Indian cloud computing community or Indian curved computing the ecosystem fortunately for us a lot of hard work has been already done we have an agency called IT research Academy which is a part of Indian government which actually is preparing the list of areas where you need a specific research agenda within India and we also have another organization with a very wonderful organization called cloud computing innovation Council of India which is very specifically has come out with a list of research topics which if taken will help Indian cloud ecosystem very well okay now I will list all the different topics which are there within this cloud computing research area within India so that any researchers can actually take that so CCI has published a position paper on ongoing exercise of research domains which are in the context of ITR a and how this can be mapped into the context of the problem which is post bite or enlisted by idea the first and foremost question that we are talking about is performance quality of service we know that internet is there everywhere but the internet quality in India is a challenge so that means because of the low bandwidth because of these not connectivity and all we need to trim down the requirements both in the content and the quality of data so that we can reach everybody so any hasn't been any challenge which is concerned with comes under performance and this one see some of the research challenges which should work for India include scheduling algorithm runtime systems policy management to support the following and you know the Indian government has taken many schemes like health care and disaster applications and now in India we have more mobiles than computers so cloud computing started assuming that everybody would have a computer but now the opposite is true in India but fortunately it is through that cloud computing you can reach a mobile device also now using this unique combination which is there in India can we come out with some kind of research problems and here are the problems which are there how do we manage variable data rates from smart edge devices to cloud that means suppose somebody is sending an email from a very good in fact like Bangalore to a remote Kashmir village and now there are points where actually it slows down points were actually bandwidth gets congested now can we come out with a managed variable data rates within the country and this also poses a serious or a very interesting research problem using cloud elicited migration effectively so can I use the amending fundamental quality of cloud elasticity and migration to manage a cloud of big size like mega Raj India which spans entire India low latency access to texts and rich content see India actually we would like hem and we have many languages and we have very many rich content now if I want coffee if you government want to share this data across all the citizens simply example that for the Omega Raj is actually building citizen services to that so can we come out with different algorithms and different approaches rapid resource provisioning for QoS that means Quality Management energy-aware scheduling on smart edge devices and cloud mobility management algorithms so if you are talking about performances Claude of the Indian context we have additional restraints are constraints and these are the big problems that if you look upon can give you a research challenge which you can take the second one is primacy which is a well-known one level problem but in India it takes a different for example look at the third line we say sexual data sharing on the cloud across multiple stakeholders other data agencies with other data with the agencies government and protocols and access privileges that means the Indian government is collecting lot data about Indian citizens including that biometric now the privacy and security of dimension becomes more serious now see for instance the Rajasthan government actually has requested the Indian government to shave the other data so that it can start some social schemes now the question comes like see now with a good intention trust I have shared data with the central government can this be shared with the state government and what happens in such cases will there be somebody misusing that at all so if you can come out with a model which ensures that once data is stored in other it can be transmitted and it can be produced without being templed then also that becomes a research problem and already the Rajasthan government has asked for this and data where acetate provenance in the cloud environment see the data provenance is actually where does the data takes its birth and where it dies and between what happens for example other data is generated by a citizen it is stored in Indian government databases now a state government like Rajasthan wants it and they will use it for certain things then who will be the owner of this data so once and this is actually called province and that is to be taken care in the cybersecurity models for resilience against data center vulnerability the earlier terrorist attacks used to happen on buildings and railway stations now it is possible that terrorists will try to attack your web sites and the cloud centers so you have to develop certain approaches to men to safeguard those attacks so this data province is actually a general problem which is at one level for example look at this problem province of in the cloud that means until cloud came we had a very standard procedures of maintaining data because they're all inter they were all on our internal network like that belongs to a particular College that belongs to a particular company now that it has move to cloud computing it brings some new challenge and here is a research paper which gives you a basics of province of data which you can use and here is the second paper which you can use if you can use the link below you can access them the second one is scalability India is a huge country and cloud computing has come at a right time and you know the 1 billion people who already take another card they pose a big win big data deluge in a big platform to operate C will you know that Facebook took 8 years between 2004 and 2012 to reach a billion users but other no other enrollment has completed in just six years that means we have a data collection which is as big as Facebook itself now how do you come up with a different set of algorithms to manage this and in addition to things like that we have a linguistic diversity we have a geographical diversity and all this is reflected in the data that we have collected in the other who manages so these are the different research proposals for example cloud programming models for graph and network data analytics a model for time series data on clouds scalable computing EcoSmart I just devices and cloud because what we call the reaching the last mile in Hindi in India is a big College that is the second area the next area is robustness resilience and expected and unexpected accidents will happen whether you want it or not and in case that happens what happen happen to a cloud computing in India like my garage and what would happen to our digital occur so this are these different things which is to be taken care I'm going little fast because I'm just outlining the possibility accessibility see very recently there is a newspaper reports Isis India has the lowest internet spread in the entire continent now there is an ambition of cloud computing and there is a reality of low internet access in India so how do you combine that how do I design certain schemes were actually we can actually reach everybody share all data in spite of this low-intensity I mean low bandwidth available for as for example if you have been experiencing with YouTube and Gmail whenever there is a internet connectivity bandwidth problem hit display something on the right side saying that we are experiencing problem and you can use basic Internet connectivity so this is something this is a problem which is recognized by all similarly YouTube allows you to download a video and see because of the band width problems so now if you can take this as a research problem and come up with a model where this will not affect the quality of service given to an individual I mean I end-user it is very good the other areas which are there like multilingual and Unicode support for across services unlike the American are the European countries we are not a single language country we have many languages and now the translation between them transportation between them and almost becomes a challenge and these are the different for example multilingual and Unicode support across services rich content hosting on clouds like the cultural data or something like physical data are our local knowledge like Iowa the end dot this is a rich content now how do i host that how do i share that this becomes a challenge and a research problem for anybody who's interested to take that so in this these are the leading the problems available for the cloud computing researches now i have been working on this area for quite some time and I have created a resources of my for your people for anybody who is interested in research let me show you that and the conclusion is this cloud is an opportunity of our times don't want to miss it either as a consumer or the researcher or as a government or as an entrepreneur so we should be taking and I have certain things like see cloud is not attracted only Indians everywhere in the world actually it is helping and attracting people look at this cloud computing in pharmaceutical research and development even a very distant field like pharmaceutical also you started using cloud computing and our big neighbor China as developing a cloud computing medical intuitive and concerns say sex but they also have a privacy and other issues so we are living in one of the best times cloud is the best thing that can happen to us and it opens research problems which are not only at global levels also at individual and institution level so kindly take up this project and just try to figure out some important problems and you can always take further so here is the list for references which you can all the time use I will be sharing this presentation to sometime
