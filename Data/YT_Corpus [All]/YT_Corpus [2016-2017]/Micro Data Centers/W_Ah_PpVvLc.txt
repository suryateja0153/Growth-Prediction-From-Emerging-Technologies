 good morning it is really wonderful to see everyone here today and the stars of the show for my talk are you all presented with the data that you have submitted to the benchmarking Alliance and frankly the work that you have done back at home making your patients better off making your staff better off and stabilizing what is sometimes a chaotic situation in managing your emergency departments the emergency department benchmarking Alliance takes data from now 850 hospitals and those of you who just received your 2012 survey we will have over a thousand hospitals submitting data that provide us with the feedback that we need to tell you you're doing a great job or areas that need to be honed on and some project areas some of those projects sherry has brought together today and are reflected in the posters on the side of the room and many of you are doing projects at home that allow your staff to improve delivery of care and again allow your staff to be proud of what they do taking care of patients in the ED the the survey is is really one part of a I'm not I'm not advancing could you help me please Rick could you advance please there we go we have a big job in the emergency department even though we're not building it any bigger our patients are still moving into the emergency department growing numbers those numbers really increased November December January in most of your emergency departments when we saw our latest flu outbreak this one extending across all of the age classes but primarily affecting the seniors and for those who you didn't read the headlines from the CDC last week we have a we had a vaccine failure for the senior members of the population last year for reasons that the CDC still doesn't understand so these are our numbers the numbers beginning to be collected in earnest by the CDC in 1992 you see trend lines that that would point you in a direction that says growth in emergency department volumes continue and you'll see 2010 took a bump down from 2009 I will explain that in a minute the CDC's report is called the National Hospital ambulatory medical care survey or new hamp sus the CDC had a staff group that developed this survey published it about three years after the calendar year and that the data was collected and unfortunately they lost the funding for this survey 2007 was the last year that they wrote an analysis on it and now only data tables are available the data tables published last month were for the year 2010 I have summarized those and incorporated them into the talk here and for those of you who submit data for the benchmarking Alliance you'll get an analysis of this report back shortly in addition as you know CMS has taken a step to begin to collect data CMS's dedication about ten years ago was to develop materials that would allow their customers the CMS beneficiaries across the country to make better decisions about where to go for health care they insisted that they needed emergency department markers and they asked some of us to be to be involved in developing the markers that would be used for the emergency department they developed the pneumonia measures the acute MI measures and other things that you've been living with now for the last six or eight years this year they're reporting a new number they wanted a time parameter to be able to report on to represent the efficiency of the emergency department in managing patients that efficiency marker originally they were going to use average length of stay average length of stay in the emergency department as the marker for all five thousand Edie's in this country would that be fair anybody who runs a place under 20,000 would say that's a fair number anybody who would who runs an emergency department that sees over 60,000 would say that's a very unfair number and managing that many people per day makes it very difficult for you to turn them quickly anyone who sees an admission rate over twenty percent of the patients that they see I would say that's a very unfair number compared to an ED that emits one or two or five percent because naturally those numbers would be would look much worse and and then frankly urban emergency departments have a much more difficult time than rural emergency department is being able to process people so in and of itself even using average rather than median would be difficult for our staffs to be able to produce improvements and since many of you are faced with the issue of holding mental health patients in your emergency departments for very long periods of time whether they're going to be admitted in your hospital or admitted to it to another hospital if you use arithmetic means that can produce some very very long disproportionate numbers median takes that out and therefore for years based on the recommendation of some of the EDB a leaders we have used medians as the appropriate time interval CMS decided then to use the decision to admit and of course the decision to admit reflects boarding time in your emergency department and all of you recognize that boarding time is your enemy when it comes to being able to process people efficiently through the front door therefore a opportunity to focus on boarding times in your ED and when you sit with administration with the CEO coo CFO CNO is a really relevant issue and a really relevant marker for you be able to focus on to reduce those boarding times as we started the benchmarking Alliance we had no definitions frankly the original members of the benchmarking lines didn't even agree what an emergency department patient was and everybody used a definition that that included well we don't include patients that walk away we do include everybody who signs in on evening or weekend hours that's going to OB because they're an unscheduled visit so we include the none of it was defined equally so sherry Welsh led an effort in 2006 for us to host our first summit and the and the entire objective of the summit was to produce definitions uniform definitions across our industry and then from those definitions can come performance measures and things that you can actually compare with your peers and then if you want to compare with your peers we didn't want 20,000 by me DS being compared two hundred thousand by me DS pediatric GDS compared to adult ed s and so then cohorts were developed out of the 2006 work that work needed to be updated again and sherry hosted a meeting in salt lake city in 2010 and out of that came two papers published in the July issues of annals of emergency medicine and academic emergency medicine 2011 and with those three papers you have the definitions for most of the parameters important in managing your emergency department it is likely that in the next 12 months we will host another summit getting together all of the representative factors again that relate to emergency medicine performance and operation bringing CMS Joint Commission aaha ena a SEP etc into the room in 2010 2010 AHRQ was part of the formula and assisted us in developing performance measures that would allow them to do research and so bringing all those disciplines together in one room allows us on one day in one room to put together the markers that are really relevant to you all right New Hampshire's update from 2010 volume volume was down in 2010 relative to 2009 for a very very explainable reason 2009 was our year with h1n1 and URI DS typically set new volume marks in 2009 fortunately h1n1 was not fatal disease it disproportionately affected younger people and there were many days both in the spring a little all in the summer and then the fall where we had volume bumps in all of our emergency departments that was not matched with an admission bump because fortunately again most of those people got to be seen in the edn go home in 2010 acuity was up relative to 2009 should be no surprise and by however we measure acuity and last month's annals has an article by Steve Pitts who was one of my partners at Emory and Steve tried to go through and reflect that acuity bump was not about upgrading the charge masters it was about actually growing acuity amongst the patients being seen in the emergency department and the important demographic trend which continues unabated in our country thank goodness which is we're getting older we're getting older we don't have people dying prematurely and therefore we see an aging population we're matching most of the world in terms of aging our population everyone is chasing Japan which statistically has the oldest population on the globe and this is a reflection of better health and so we are following the trends of preventing premature death preventing people from dying too early of avoidable causes and watching our population age and learning to deal both with the health care side of that which is an elder population you have to do things differently and manage them differently and in some cases design your emergency department differently and number two look at the costs of providing health care as we get older we get more diseases it gets expensive to take care of ourselves Steve's paper reflects that in terms of acuity and aging and until we change the demographics it is unlikely we will change the finances significantly in healthcare alright your job is to utilize and assist the CDC and and getting their data for all of you who are asked to be members of the CDC data survey there are 500 emergency departments in the country that typically get asked and just so you know the CDC's new hamp this data comes from a sampling of about 45,000 charts from about 400 EDS because usually about twenty percent of you turn the CDC down when they asked to come and and use your ed as a sampling site the sampling methodology just so you know this study is the one that then gets reviewed by other people and they produce the statistics on how many fireworks injuries we have and how many ed visits come from children falling out of carts at the shopping center etc that that's what this database is about and it's an elegant sampling methodology but does not look at emergency department performance that's the emergency department benchmarking alliances job but I want you to know we we collaborate hand-in-hand with the CDC to make sure that we have data that makes sense to the public makes sense to the regulators and legislators and since we're operating two years ahead of them we tell them what their data is going to show when they go to collect it alright the next thing we have to do is at some point we are going to use our data on a much more live basis and we we made run run at this and the CDC couldn't get it funded but at some point they're going to string together our emergency departments and be looking live at what our volumes are what our acuity czar and what our local mixes are of certain diseases and then we are going to produce a live version of weather forecasting for the healthcare system because you're 5,000 dd's are a great sampling point for healthcare in your community and what diseases are affecting people at certain periods of time and just like weather forecasts we will have the healthcare forecast for the day and we'll say today and CN antonio that they're seeing snake bites and since the blizzard is blowing through the Midwest where they're going to see ice and snow related injuries and the flu is winding down and we can watch that live so just so you know what the future version of benchmarking Alliance and CDC activities are are to use the five thousand sampling points of emergency departments across the country to produce live national regional and local forecasts the benchmarking Alliance has to produce the data that you need to help you do your job by doing that we also don't put a SEP and ena in untenable positions we find places to put this out and share again is our leader in terms of finding ways to publish the information that we collect it's our opportunity to pull together the decision-makers and to do the summits the way that we have done very important is that we develop data that allows you to counteract street legend material and everybody knew that ambulance patients were bad patients and and we're full of people coming in for pharmaceutical refills until we produce the data from all of you that says that that's not true at all and then and then very importantly it's our opportunity to identify best practices and to share those best practices I brought one more piece and this piece is so new it is not in your handout and I apologized last week came a subtle study that talked about charges for services and and I put a lot more in here so if any of you want a copy of this you can get this from me I'm happy to share this but there's another CMS initiative through the HR q to look at medical expenditures and last week they put together a format that allows us to look at emergency department charges in payments all right and we have not had access to this kind of data before in a in a study that is not yet published but is coming out they looked at data from 2005 to 2010 and found it for Medicaid insured privately insured in Medicare patients average charges and for the first time this is all in this is this is facility ancillary testing and physician charges and then the payments made and they did this by sampling the insurance policies of individual patients all right so pretty clean methodology for doing this very large numbers average charges if you if you'll just run the numbers they're probably 2200 to 2300 in the years 2005 through 2010 average payments highest for Medicare patients lowest for uninsured patients nothing unexpected there and and that leads you to think through other sets of data i live in naples florida in naples florida we have the nice hospitals there and at some point I would like to know what the charges are if I'm going to go visit the emergency department in Naples Florida well the Florida agency for health care administration has queried all of the hospitals in the state of Florida and ask them about their charges this data has been updated in 2008 numbers and lo and behold the average charge if you're an adult to visit the emergency department is almost three thousand dollars anybody would have thought that number three thousand bucks for a child it's about 1300 for low acuity visits not not much difference in terms of the numbers here this reflects our chargemaster can't discriminate between low acuity and high acuity very well and then some data on based on presenting symptoms abdominal pain hypertension asthma headache including migraine they deemed about half of emergency department visits in the state of Florida as being avoidable and they have an interactive model so again I can look at Naples Florida and decide if I'm a CMS beneficiary or anybody else what is the likely to be the least charge facility that I can go visit for my emergency needs they counted 7.1 million visits in Florida emergency departments for the 12 months leading up to jun 2012 so this is updated their data run to that point produced an average charge of thirty-five hundred dollars it resulted in a total of twenty five billion in charges for Florida patients going to visit emergency departments 12 months leading up to june two thousand twelve if we said those numbers are the same across the country just so you know we get to use the word t the word beginning with T in our vocabulary if we make an assumption that it costs that it's that emergency department patients seen across the country 140 million of them have average charges of thirty five hundred dollars we now have half a trillion dollars in charges for emergency care in the united states per year anybody want to dream too that if we make a valid assumption based on the other data that there's about a thirty percent recovery great that's a hundred fifty billion dollars to manage our industry to pay our bills and for emergency care across this country Aesop has used the were less than two percent don't leave us or don't don't pay any attention to us this just reflects the emergency department we will talk later and you know that you manage about seventy percent of impatience that go upstairs that adds a billion or two to the bill in terms of financial accountability that emergency department leaders are responsible for we are a big industry and we need to be very responsible and the time article that was published last week you know took all of us in health care to task for how America manages the finances of the health care system so I slipped that in there and and and I apologize that as information that came available last week long after the books were published okay 1994 we began a process of looking at the the needs of emergency departments that were getting big and hard to manage in 1994 a big emergency department was one defined as seeing over a hundred and ten patients a day a really big ed was seen forty thousand visits per year at the time these days a 40,000 visit ed is below the median alright we produce data cohorts and the data cohorts and the reports that you all get have broken Edie's into what are still management challenged volumes they change at the 20,000 volume mark so we we cohort our emergency department zero to twenty thousand twenty to forty forty to sixty 60 to 80 80 to 100 and in the last couple years we've had enough emergency departments we had to create the supercenter size statistics which are over a hundred thousand visit emergency departments and then we take the the data from each of those plot them here and give you the results cohort specific in addition in the last two years we've gotten enough emergency departments that see a predominance or only children that we are able to define a pediatric emergency department group and the last line we have also created in last two years enough of you are now running standalone freestanding and urgent care centers as part of your emergency department we now have a data line for that group of facilities what you'll see in the slides here are box and whisker diagrams and the box and whiskers are a really nice statistical way to show you how wide the variation is within certain bands and by looking at the median numbers and then the spread of numbers you have the opportunity to very precisely look draw a red line in where your emergency department is and then use these as a report or a placemat to discuss operations in your emergency department with your administration the box and whisker diagrams are going to be the way that we represent a lot of data that's going to come back to the benchmarking Alliance over the years and this this does the introduction to that for example this set of data here is about the percentage of patients admitted to the hospital admitted to either admit status or observation status after being seen in the ED the way that this data is presented the left-hand column is for the entire cohort of emergency departments this was 840 EDS and then we spliced them up beginning with the Super Centers over a hundred thousand 80 to 100 and so on and then the last two columns adult emergency departments in pediatric emergency departments so you can draw your blue and red lines break up the data as you need to and and understand how your data at your facility interacts with the data for your peers another important data point for you is those patients who leave at any point before they're supposed to and a very important definition for us is everybody who leaves before they were supposed to leave and that leave before includes any definition you want to put in eloped ama before screening after triage before triage but after screening whatever it is they all have to be lumped in here together because there's no statistic that in the ED we cheat on more than this one all right and so we said lump them all together so that somebody isn't reporting data that's completely out of line as you will notice here larger high volume Edie's have a more difficult time getting people to sit and stay in small volume Edie's in general you can get them in plugged in and they stay adults leave more than pediatrics and the overall trend in this thank goodness is heading down we're doing a better job of getting people into our emergency departments and having them stay you have on your slides in front of you another series of these box and whiskers I'm not going to describe them all in detail but you now have a baseline for what those look like and I'm going to move ahead to what are the rest of the data how it applies to you and how you're going to take opportunities to strategize and manage this right this is a diagram that all of you should copy and put in your numbers okay the CDC says on an on and for a given population in a region about 450 visits occur to the emergency department per year for that population set 450 visits per thousand is our number about 80 of those come by EMS about 370 one of those will walk in we manage them in the ed and then they get dis bowed two percent get transferred seventeen percent get admitted eighty-one percent get treated and released about two percent leave before treatment complete so those are our big numbers but what you do with this diagram is you scratch out the numbers and you put in your numbers so two reflects your market New Hampshire says that three percent per year is our average growth rate across the country it says our injury load is decreasing it's now at about a third when I started in emergency care a long time ago it used to be fifty percent injuries fifty percent illnesses in our DD we are now sequentially shrinking the number of people who arrive who many of us like to manage we like taking care of sprained ankles and lacerations and other things and and therefore the population is moving away from that and you know the chart rack at home in your emergency department now at this time of the day probably says chest pain short of breath abdominal pain weak and dizzy headache repeat the sequence and somebody is finding gold now which is which is a chart that says ring stuck on the finger or sprained ankle or something and there and they're grabbing that chart eagerly saying man this is a definitive one I can do something about right away alright and then the person who's picking out the chart that says weak and dizzy and the next one that says weak and dizzy as they can oh no it's going to be another day okay injury rates not highest amongst the young people highest amongst the age group over 75 and those people are all on what class of medicines they're all on thinners and somebody at home right now is making the decision about do i scan them and when do I scan them for their head bunk on thinners and do I do this or not and can I justify admission so that they can be scanned again or ob's in 23 or 48 hours whatever it may be the most frequent visitors to our emergency departments are people who live in extended care facilities and they have about a forty-five percent admission rate and they account for about 2.8 million visits predicting volume ahead if your community is like most American communities they're getting older in your community and as they get older they come to visit the emergency department more frequently as we build more people into this population base and this is again a new hamp this opportunity they have all the population and census data and can look at utilization of emergency department based on age groupings as we push more people into over 65 over 75 and over 85 age groups those people will statistically use the emergency department much more frequently this is our those of you have seen me talk before this is my 30 year career in emergency care which is we grew up pumping on people's chests taking 16 year olds out of cars wrapped around trees I enjoy doing that all of my EMS career and now we see it very very rarely it's a success story all of American health care is about the success of us preventing premature death and letting people live more comfortable lives into a much older age we didn't think ahead and our big insurance company the federal government didn't plan ahead to say you know if we don't have people dying early they get old they get hypertension they get cancer they get diabetes they get some complicated diseases they get multiple system diseases and it is a success story and not a failure store what we should have known is that when prevention works people stay alive to get ill it costs more in things like our trauma population age and in my community taking people that are wrapped around trees out now are typically 80 year olds who probably were unconscious as they went up on the sidewalk and hit the tree okay the next piece for your staff your population changes and in most communities this goes injuries shrink mental health visits increase to the emergency department they have no place else to go in your community mental health agencies often know that M Tala requires you to see patients in your emergency department and they know that if they don't want to see them they can send them to the ED they can demand the tests be done on them and if there K is 3.4 they have a reason to say that person is too unstable for me to take and transfer to whatever my facility is is there anyone who hasn't had that experience yet they can tell you that they won't accept the patient until what test is done drug screen got to have a drug screen and your staff gets to fight with them and then they get a result that's that's THC positive and you get to tell the the the staffer there that has nothing to do with their current presentation they're suicidal threatening to kill themselves and and that they were acting even worse when they came in and that that result does not exclude them from being admitted into their service wherever that happens to be our payer mix really hasn't changed very much and despite the economics of the country the the percentage of Medicaid self-pay has not changed significantly what has changed significantly as the increasing percentage of patients covered by Medicare the utilization just so you know by the numbers number one users of EDS are nursing home patients the homeless and infants under age one we have a very different population of patients seen in pediatric and adult emergency departments and it is only fair for those of you who understand how your ed runs that if you have a high mix of pediatrics you see a very different population than an ED that sees a loi a very low mix of pediatrics therefore we do comparative statistics that look at Dalton PD adult and pediatric patient populations and understand that CTS and EKGs and and the high number of x-rays are not done on pediatric patients admission rates much higher in adult patients acuity much higher EMS arrivals much higher and any of the other markers that you want to use so one of the important differentiators of EDS is what is their pediatric mix okay flipping back to New Hampshire's for a second I want to tell you that our market has changed by their data since 1992 each of these bar graphs I could take 1992 and 2010 and show you the increases or the decreases instead I have taken the 16 intervening ones out and I'm just showing you 1992 versus 2010 and these are absolute numbers absolute numbers of cardiac enzymes that were done in 1992 are the left-hand set of bars in 1992 we did about two million studies on cardiac enzymes and emergency department big surprise in 2010 we did about 18 million sets of cardiac enzymes and emergency department EKGs similar trend biggest differences in use of CT scans we're dramatic increases have occurred x-rays haven't gone up so much and in many cases x-rays are replaced by CT scans and in many of your emergency departments that I've trended you over the years your number of x-ray procedures per hundred patients seen has trended down therapeutics this looks at wound care ENT care orthopedic care and IV therapy ok really our wound care hasn't increased at all and many patients who need stitches in your community may choose ago the emerge department re also may choose to go to minuteclinic or urgent care or something else we also have prevention that prevented a lot of wounds in the CDC's report on pediatric head injuries is one of the again very very very encouraging elements of what we have done in this country in prevention they marked a 75 percent decrease in pediatric head injuries seen in Edie's thanks to what simple tool bicycle helmets okay bicycle helmets that have reduced tremendously the number of kids and kids with devastating head injuries that we have seen in emergency departments why does E&T care go up because we see elderly patients on thinners in the winter months who come in with their nose is bleeding alright which leads me to one of our other very dangerous elements of data which is revisit and readmission one of your emergency departments is busy enough that this month this month you saw this many patients in your ed with nosebleeds probably most of them were over age 65 and we're on thinners all right your staff faced all of these people and said you have a nosebleed here I'm your I'm your doctor I'm your nurse I'm here to take care of you if we beat your staff up and say revisits are bad and you guys are bad providers if you don't take care of these nosebleed patients and prevent readmissions and revisits to the ED what is your staff going to do when they approach each one of you with your with your nose bleeding they're going to say I'm going to cauterize I'm going to pack etc if I'm bad I'm sorry ma'am you're going to need to be admitted to the hospital we're going to put you in ob's we're going to put you upstairs feed you hospital food is the environment of a hospital good for people with dried mucus membranes anybody want to guess what humidity's are inside of hospitals pretty darn low and I'm sorry ma'am you're going to stay here if if I believe I'm going to be dinged for revisits and readmissions many more of you are going to be staying in the hospital for many years we have all practiced nosebleed care talking to all of these people with nosebleed saying ma'am there's a five percent chance that you'll reap lead despite the really good job i have done cauterizing or packing your nose would you prefer to stay here in the hospital or which you prefer to go home you prefer to go home eat your own food sleep in your own bed have a humidifier in your room and i'm going to give you instructions that allow you to most safely care for your nose bleed ma'am there's a one in 20 chance that you're going to return to our emergency department that's not a failure on your part that's not a failure on my part and it but I believe you'll be much more comfortable and there's a ninety-five percent chance of success I believe that's good medical care and I reject the idea that readmissions and revisits in and of themselves are bad and oh by the way many of you are using revisits as a way to provide excellent emergency care for many of them mersa head bumps everything else that we deal with it you'd like to recheck statistically it's very hard to take planned revisits away from unplanned revisits and therefore this revisit rate around emergency departments and extend that upstairs to the orthopedic surgeon who does the knee replacement and send somebody home at three days because they're into rehab they're doing well there thinners are working their pains under control and they talk to that to that knee replacement patient and say there's a three percent chance that you'll have a problem I ninety-seven percent chance that you'll do better at home be more comfortable get to rehab in your pain control and etc there or if I'm going to be a bad orthopedic surgeon for sending you home we're going to keep you for another two or three days to make sure that we reduce that risk even further everybody get the idea revisits readmissions not in my opinion in and of itself a statistic that reflects bad quality care and we are going to put our people in a bad way particularly related to groups of patients like this that we otherwise have been very comfortable managing and accepting a very low failure rate for whatever reason ortho care not at much Ivy therapy is that much for those of you like to do critical care you're 30 years too late okay we don't pump on people's chests we don't intubate nearly as frequently as we use to these numbers have fallen precipitously what has also decreased our death on arrivals and those patients we don't see as frequently and and we make better use of hospice and palliative care than we used to 30 years ago mental health visits look at this 92 we used to see very little self-inflicted wounds we now see a lot of self-inflicted wounds that's that is a particular wound that is particular categorization of the amps asst mental health admissions to our own facilities and mental health transfers in particular have gone up dramatically all right back to benchmarking alliance data so this is the break out of all of the data supercenters seeing over a hundred thousand and forgive any of forgive my use of that nomenclature but really you are the Super Centers of emergency care seeing over 300 patients a day that that's a big place we then have the various cohorts down through the very smallest emergency departments and then again what I will call pediatric emergency departments or care facilities we have the freestanding urgent cares and stand-alones the survey for 2012 a thousand EDS will present data to us that will that will have 35 to 40 million patients I believe our volume will be up 2012 versus 2011 so far acuity is continued to increase and more patients globally are admitted we continue to increase EKG utilization and for those of you another big story as people won't read the text books anymore and know that they are supposed to present with chest pain when they're having an acute MI they present with anything but chest pain and you have to use your tool the EKG machine to evaluate many many many many patients who in prior years we would not have considered at risk for acs and so weakened izzy's I don't feel wells I'm just sick get EKGs done now and it is much more frequent frankly that they present with with St elevation than the patients who present with chest pain we will continue to see a plateau and usage of CT scans but what is bumping up now is the use of MRIs and in ten years ago if you'd have said we would be doing MRIs out of the emergency department I would have said that's crazy we can't do that and now we have one of the first CDs that reported this year is using MRIs five per hundred patients seen 500 EDS are continuing to improve throughput walk away rates continue to decrease eighteen percent arrive on an ambulance gurney and are admitted at an increasing rate payer mix a stable accept more Medicare for those of you designing emergency departments the old adage of two thousand visits per bed is dead it is dead it is not the right number don't let them build your ed at one visit per tooth herb one bed for two thousand patients CPOE usage is up dramatically and noted for 2011 is that 75% of you are using computerized physician order entry that is a dramatic increase in two years and has something to do with meaningful use and dollars coming from the federal government and new team triage systems now measure over twenty-five percent of emergency departments surveyed back to the data and we'll go through some of this the EDS that are seen have this representation in terms of urban suburban or rural larger EDS have a tendency to be academic in nature teaching facilities more frequently than small Edie's and a trauma designation is present in about ninety four percent of the very large emergency departments much less frequently in small Edie's fast-track areas are present in the predominance of emergency department seeing over eighty thousand per year a trauma area is physically present in over eighty percent of emergency departments over eighty thousand visits we're seeing an increase in use of CD use and knobs and as a design suggestion for all of you CD use are a very good way to manage patients over a longer period of care and to reduce readmissions and revisits and I think they're going to become a very important tool in the next two years as the federal government focuses hard on readmission rates computerized physician order entry and by size you see the numbers here but overall there are very few EDS being left in the dust in terms of implementing computerized physician order entry does anyone want to volunteer that this is made there ed more efficient does anyone want to volunteer that their staff are able to be more productive when CPOE is implemented hmm we have a problem we looked at greeting and about everybody but a few of those under 20,000 used nurse greeting processes and I believe we should change the name systemically and not use the term triage anymore greeting areas present with nursing and almost a hundred percent of Ed surveyed but you see overall Edie's about eighteen percent now using physicians and about eight percent using mid-level providers at some point in their greeting process I will talk specifically about that later this morning correct scheduled hours this is the inverse of the ena numbers but we asked you to report on your scheduled hours for nurses techs clerks physicians and mid-levels scheduled hours we took the volume that you see patients per day and divided it by the number of scheduled hours many of you are familiar with this on the physician side and we come up with the patients for physician per hour on the nursing side here's the data reflected in the left-hand column and we see great consistency amongst nursing utilization per patient across physicians this is a number that's a little higher than usually what gets posted but it is because we use the term scheduled and not actual worked hours per day and all of you know that physicians have a tendency to stay over at the end of their shift or come in early if it's busy but the numbers are running between two point six and two point nine patients per doc per hour unless you're in a very small ed in a very small ed they statistically can't can't can't get to two patients per doc per hour because they don't see enough patience to be able to see that number and then when we add in mid-level providers we get down to the number that usually gets published about physician productivity which is two point two two point three patients per provider per hour hi cutie visits going up most dramatically in v's that see over 40,000 and just looking at a trend here and finding some interest in this EDS that see under 40,000 are not seeing the same level of acuity increase and it may be that in communities that have busier emergency departments and not busier that the specialists and specialty services are coming available in the shops that have more specialty services available and the sicker patients are moving towards those higher volume shops worth everybody noting that it's getting most difficult in the bigger volume emergency departments managing higher acuity patients length of stay and walk away this is a trend line with the left hand bar being 2005 the right hand bar being 2011 and what we have noted is that our lake to stay was increasing and it got over three hours accompanying that statistically in a perfect correlation we were watching more people walk away as many of our hospitals and a key person for you to listen to Suzanne stone Griffith when she talks later today she led an initiative and they hurt HCA hospitals that reduced processing times reduced door to doc and dramatically decreased walk away rates in a hundred and 60 HCA emergency departments her success in doing that and your success the remainder of the emergency departments in the country we have trended in the right direction we're probably going to take a bump back this year because of flu and in our processing time so the first couple months are up and our walk away rates are going to be up this is a scatter graph of length of stay and left before treatment complete and you see there would be a correlation here that if you let people linger in your emergency departments and statistically we've shown that this is admitted patients leaving patients longer in the ED results in more beds being stuffed on evening hours and people walking away at a higher rate so it matches what inherently we would think about our emergency department patient behavior admission times very large emergency departments very busy EDS have a harder time getting admitted patients going upstairs in a small sampling of data from 2011 this is what you reported because many hospitals were not collecting this yet boarding times highest in the very large Edie's going down to this small and micro emergency departments higher in adult than pediatrics serving emergency departments EMS still bringing us patients that's about 26 million a year to American Edie's forty two percent of them are admitted correlating if you want to increase your admission rate invite the ambulances to come to your door statistically these have trended for many many years across all size emergency departments our important trends even over eight years of data from the benchmarking alliance EKG utilization has gone from 17 uses to 26 uses per thousand per hundred patients seen 17 to 26 uses per hundred patients and the the inpatients arriving upstairs fifty-eight percent of those in 2004 came through the emergency department where it's 67% in 2011 and for those of you who have no labor and delivery unit typically you're admitting 85 to 90 of the patients who are arriving in inpatient beds EKG increasing significantly and again in all size of urgency departments and there's that percentage admission that has increased steadily and dramatically when I first started about a third of admissions came through the ED in the late 70s and early 80's and now we're at seventy percent almost here's your square footage and patients per bed relevant to your cohorts there's really not much variation by volume of the emergency department and again the every CEO and COO in this country somewhere was taught that it's one bed for two thousand visits and that number is not relevant anymore all right putting data to work in your ed I want to let you know that this is a per day statistic that you can give to your to your staff and have them manage up to it so I took a day in our emergency department Cincinnati Ohio a 3130 patient day is as our average it's worse on Sundays and Mondays three patients per day want to walk away it's our job to keep them there for to go to the fast track 56 need to be put on monitors 23 are going to be admitted so mr. tech 25 patients per day worse on Sunday and Monday are going to need to be pushed up stairs to the admitting officer for our hospital on average 25 beds need to be available today to be bringing patients upstairs it's worse on Sunday and money will you please have beds available for us an important number i continue to share with you it is 9 excuse me aight use eight orders entered per patient seen so the docs have to be tied to their computers where we're doing CPOE they have to be ready to put in eight orders per patient this is our epic system we had no idea what the numbers were in the past and because the whole house has epic systems we recognize that twenty one percent of all orders put in to the emergency to the hospital today come through the emergency department and so on go home think about your numbers print them up do them per day understand them be able to compare them to cohorts be able to tell a story to your administration and to your staff that is relevant to how you run your place for any of you who want further numbers and want the discussion I'll be available for the next two days thank you for the opportunity to present and I'll be available for questions in the back as we move to our keynote speaker thank you
