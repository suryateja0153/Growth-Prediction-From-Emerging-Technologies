 okay alright hello everyone and welcome my name is rod Stella Muller and I'm the senior director of product marketing for the NS bu the network and security business unit at VMware and I'm really happy to be here talking with you I really can't see anybody but I want to try to get a little bit of a hand raised here how many of you all are virtualization specialists server virtualization ok how many are networking guys ok great how about security folks all right great so that's a big difference I've been here this is my fourth VMware VM world here in Barcelona and you know I came from the nasarah acquisition in 2012 where I was actually within the zero back in 2010 so I've been doing this network virtualization stuff since it was science fiction and its really great to see now at vmworld a lot more networking people coming to VM world to learn about NSX and and hopefully today you'll get a lot out of this introduction set session I guess I need to put the disclaimer up here on the marketing guy so you can't believe anything I said all right so we're what this is really about is we're going beyond server virtualization we all understand what server virtualization is and what server server virtualization has done from an operational standpoint in the data center but now we're going and we're transforming every industry out there through the use of network virtualization and just to get the get started to give you an idea of some of the customers that we have out there I flipped through a few of the logos up here but I wouldn't be able to even put all of the logos on the slide these days we have customers in every single vertical out there some of these customers are very large customers some of them are small customers but for instance eBay is one of our larger customers has 60,000 VMs connected to logical networks running on NSX we started in the service provider space where companies like AT&T and NTT and Rackspace and people like that have been using NSX since 2011 we then move to the global financial so people like Citibank and Goldman Sachs and JP MC and HSBC ing all of these are are using NSX right and so all of these customers have started to see the benefits and I want to make something very very clear because there's a lot that goes on in the media right the media absolutely loves a fight right especially a david-and-goliath fight so you read a lot about how VMware and Cisco are at odds with this network virtualization stuff so I want to make it very clear to you that we love Cisco a lot more than Cisco loves us but we love Cisco 85% of all of these deployments are running on top of Cisco gear right so this is adding a capability into the environments that you already have and sometimes this is old Cisco gear sometimes it's brand new Cisco gear so as I go through the presentation understand that what the underlying physical infrastructure is doesn't matter to us and it shouldn't matter to you you'll be able to use the gear that you choose to use whatever that is okay so there's a lot of things that are driving the need and I'll talk about a lot about security I'll talk about speed and agility but nsx is addressing a lot of the things that we've kind of had to deal with in networking and data center for many many years and now we're changing the way that things happen it's time for this new approach this is something that you'll find as we go through this presentation that this is a new way of thinking about how to approach the problems that we have in the data center environment what we're doing here is we're taking a new approach called software-defined data center now I'll describe that a little bit more as we go through but software-defined data center is often heard youhere from VMware as a VMware product it's not really a product it's a new approach that allows you to take advantage of compute virtualization storage virtualization and then key to the whole thing is network virtualization then that's what the session today will be about understanding what this is and exactly how it works so going back to that software-defined data center approach if you think about everything that we've grown up with we've learned over the last 20 years in terms of networking it's really been about services that are delivered in Hardware vendor specific infrastructure lots of manual configuration and management it's how we all grew up that's how we all managed networks over the last 10 or 15 years but now what's happening is services are being distributed in software right so that we can get the operational model of a VM for the entire data center construct and we're leveraging a lot of automated configuration and management to do this now the underlying physical infrastructure doesn't go away right and needs to be there something's got a forward packets across the wire but what happens is it becomes more of a pool of compute network and storage capacity that now through software has the ability to be provisioned and repurposed on demand and that's not Sdn that's not software talking to the hardware that's actually creating these Network environments in software above in above the physical infrastructure and that allows the physical infrastructure to actually become a lot more simplified and reliable right think about all of the troubleshooting that goes on in the physical infrastructure today most of that troubleshooting isn't because a Cisco switch catches on fire right it's because somebody did a manual configuration that now broke a VLAN or broke some ACL or added an ACL or put a firewall rule in or something that caused now an issue that people have to track down if you simplify the physical infrastructure and you don't have to do that configuration in it then you eliminate a lot of the problems that today we spend our time troubleshooting so if we look at a typical enterprise environment which many of you fall into this category we take the enterprise applications and we bind those to the services that are delivered through the hardware so things like isolation and switching and routing firewalling load balancing all of these are services that are typically configured in the hardware and then delivered as part of the application environment but become part of this long process of delivering that application environment to your business customer because those things have to be thought about and configured and reconfigured and troubleshoot and as things move around and become even more dynamic they become more difficult to configure and manage but if you look at what the big guys have done and I know you're not the big guys right I mean nobody is like a Facebook or a Google in terms of their data center but what these guys have done over the last 10 years is they move those services from the hardware infrastructure from the physical infrastructure into their software so they actually put it into their custom applications but this isn't something that a typical enterprise has the ability to do for a couple of reasons one you don't have the staff and the the people necessary to do this kind of coding and two you can't modify your applications right you don't own those modificators those applications from the standpoint of being able to change them they're typically off-the-shelf applications but what by doing this what the googles and Facebooks of the world have done is got the software automation the agility and speed the distributed network services in software that allowed them to simplify make more stable and lower cost in their physical infrastructure because they decoupled they put an abstraction layer very similar to the way we put an abstraction layer between the server and a VM so what VMware has done has actually moved those services into the data center virtualization layer so now you can get that same abstraction from the underlying physical network yet the same benefits of that abstraction but without having to modify the application in any way because now those services are running in software but in the virtualization layer and that's essentially the basis kind of for what we're doing here and the rest of the presentation will go a little bit deeper into exactly how that works so this gives us the ability to do the operational model of a VM so just like we can programmatically create a VM right we can snapshot it we can move it we can delete it restore it do all those things that completely transformed the operational model of servers now we can do this for the entire data center construct all of the networking all of the connectivity that's going on there so if you're like a lot of customers sounds interesting but sounds like a very big change not even sure we understand what network virtualization is yet so let's drill down a little bit deeper and start looking at that we want to move from sort of the traditional approach in the traditional thinking more into this software-defined data center approach so first think about the physical infrastructure that you have in place all of you look something like this you've got server physical infrastructure you've got storage physical infrastructure and you've got network physical infrastructure connecting all of these things together and like I said this could be for nsx any network infrastructure it could be Cisco it could be a risk Arista HP it could be you know Dell white box networking it could be anything underneath there as long as it forwards IP packets does anybody have a network that does not forward IP packets today ok good so we're in good shape from that standpoint ok then since you're at this conference the virtualization layer is likely these so you have your now you have this virtualization infrastructure running there it's already in place and now what nsx does is it adds those services into the hypervisor that allow us to create what you can think of as a network hypervisor so like a server hypervisor is a thin layer of software that allows you to create that software container that represents the x86 environment so I can put an operating system or an application on top of it but I can do all those fancy things about moving around and so forth that change the operational model now I can create a software container that represents the network environment so in that software container I have layer 2 switching and layer 3 routing and firewalling and load balancing and QoS and ACLs and everything that the connected workload is expecting from a network but now in software in a way that it can be programmatically created and snapshotted moved deleted restored all of those things that we do with a vm but now for this entire network construct and I can create thousands of these containers for each one of my applications now it looks like things are grouped together in this container but think of this more logically that these workloads that are connected here could be anywhere in the data center or across multiple data centers and be part of that logical entity whether that's an l2 connection or an l3 connection it's the entire network environment there now a lot of networking guys will look at this picture and say well that looks pretty cool but in order to do that you need to talk to that box you have to be able to configure VLANs and ACLs and firewall rules and all of the things that we do in the data center in the network all day long the reality is we don't and so think about it this way think of a physical network chassis it has sheet metal around it in a backplane and line cards that plug into the back plane nobody goes and configures VLANs or ACLs or firewall rules on the back plane the back planes job is simply to move packets as fast as possible from any line card to any other line card all of the intelligence of what to do with the packet is actually running on the line card right how am I going to forward this am I going to filter it what am I gonna do with this packet so now if you think of each one of the hypervisors in the data center as a line card plugged into a big backplane that's what the underlying physical network becomes it becomes a packet forwarding backplane right so that now I can simply move packets as fast as possible from any hypervisor to any other hypervisor all of the intelligence about what to do with the packet is actually running in the hypervisor so now we'll go a little bit deeper and kind of talk about how all that works so for one thing this is a distributed system so as I talk about these things don't think virtual firewall virtual load balancer virtual thing it's a distributed service that now runs on all the hypervisors so the firewalling capability for instance is not a virtual firewall running on every hypervisor it is a distributed service that now I can apply rules to every single VM and then apply that filtering in the hypervisor so it's like having a giant firewall than I'm managing from one place and since we operate these things using the kernel speed the kernel capability I now get capabilities like very high throughput rates and you do 20 gigabits per second of firewall and capacity per hypervisor with 80,000 connections per second with a hundred rules applied and this is distributed across all of the hype of us so as you scale out your application environment you're scaling out your security environment at the same time you're scaling out your layer 3 routing capability you're scaling out your switching capability all of this is being scaled out as distributed services among these hypervisors so let's take a look at what the end result looks like this is V realized automation Center back when it was called the cloud automation center but that's a quick video where I click on a three-tier blueprint here right it brings up the blueprint and I see app to your database to your web tier clicked on the web tier added a couple of workloads hit submit then the engineers give me a really useful screen that says that I hit submit and then I go to request and you see in progress there on the top less than a minute later it's successful ok very impressive so what did that do right what that did was created everything inside this blue box so this blue box is that software container that I'm talking about right so here I've created 3 layer 2 switches a layer 3 router that's connecting them together so essentially turning those into layer 3 subnets I've got 2 workloads on the web tier 1 on the app tier 1 on the database tier all of the firewall rules and everything that are associated with those so the web tier can talk to the app tier the app tier can talk to the database tier but the web tier can't talk to the database tier and the two web tier workloads can't talk to each other because I've said it so why do they need to talk to each other so I'm gonna eliminate that communication and then in this case I'm using that to get to the outside world through the routing but this could be static route this could be vgp dynamic route doesn't really matter and I do all that on top of the existing physical network without talking to it or reconfiguring it or changing it in any way in 45 seconds right so a typical enterprise so you guys think about how long it takes you to deliver this environment from scratch a typical enterprise this takes three weeks to a month when we first went to ebay it used to take them 30 days to do this they process re-engineered that down to 7 days and they were very proud of the seven days because from an industry-standard standpoint that was fantastic and then when we showed them doing exactly the same thing with exactly the same connectivity in 45 seconds their question was why isn't this in production now and soon it was and like I said now they have 60,000 VMs connected to thousands of virtual networks across eBay and PayPal and all over the place so what I showed you was in the second column here which is view realize automation kind of a self-service predefined click on it deploy that environment right but most of our customers haven't made it even to that stage most people are doing the first stage essentially doing IT automating IT so that instead of three weeks to a month they get a request and that afternoon they deliver it so now they're delivering services at the same speed that the shadow IT is going to Amazon and spinning up workloads right where a typical enterprise data center has been very handcuffed to the physical topology the physical infrastructure all of the processes of deploying new VLANs and configuring and doing firewall rules and everything where you could spin up the VM in a few minutes but it took you that rest of those couple of weeks to get all the rest of that infrastructure put together but we also see people doing you know end-user custom deployments where they're using OpenStack and big community clouds using OpenStack NSX is the underlying logical infrastructure for the largest OpenStack clouds in the world including AT&T and NTT Rackspace eBay Yahoo all of these guys use NSX as their logical infrastructure on top of pretty much every physical infrastructure out there okay so I want to show a quick video this is a two-minute video just to give you an idea of from a customer perspective this is Tribune media who's a big media conglomerate out of Chicago and it's he's got some interesting things to say with a total of 42 owned or operated broadcast stations across the US Tribune media has become one of the nation's largest independent broadcasters and as it continues to transform its content service and delivery data center security has become priority one I've lived the world as CSO chief security officer I've also been a CIO and I've been a CTO there's not many things I've gotten excited about where I could have all three hands when I saw NSX and I went to my team everybody kind of had their different viewpoints I'm like you don't understand this isn't a step this is an evolutionary leap in capability around operations around security we needed a platform to absorb SAS applications and we needed to have a platform that would change the security geometry that there was today the answer was pretty simple for us it was VMware with the hypervisor and NSX so we set up a pilot we put NSX in and the bell went off we can do this in five months we move the hundred and forty one apps onto the infrastructure and we had nine help desk calls so guess what it works with the NSX platform I can move networks I can move everything so after getting attacked I'm just going to move it so if I have something on my internal cloud and I want to move it to an external cloud all of my security moves with it and that's awesome I'm here to help the business units and I'm here to keep it secure but you step back a little and you look at literally we've gone from the Flintstones to the Jetsons in less than 18 months ok so now we'll drill down a little bit deeper right so we'll go down into a little bit more about how this works but that gives you an idea I mean this this guy did a pilot said ok this is we can see how this works and then move to 141 applications in five months with nine help desk calls most of you get nine help desk calls a week a day on the network right I mean these are these are lots of challenges out there so let's look at it what are you used to today right today you all have server virtualization you're all running VMs and if those two VMs need to talk to each other they're going through the V switch right we have more virtual ports connected to workloads than physical ports or two workloads we cross that back in about 2012 in terms of data centers out there I so everybody's already doing some little form of virtual networking you're using the virtual switch but if I put one of those VMs on a different subnet now what happens the packets flow out they go across the physical network they go across the core they hit the core router and they get routed back just to talk to that VM right next to it right so as we've seen an increase in east-west traffic because of application design right web to your app to your database here every time I move between those tiers I'm doing this kind of hair painting across the physical infrastructure so now let's look at it from a virtual network standpoint so in this case I'm representing the virtual network up there as a box a thing but it's not really a thing right it doesn't exist in any one place it's these little green boxes that you see down here distribute it out across all of the visa right so those little green boxes represent layer two service layer three service' firewalling and ACLs qsr all of those things so now if I have two VMs and I say connect those to a single logical switch the packets flow exactly the way they did before using the layer two service which is that first green box but now if I put one of those VMs on a different subnet what happens is the package flow down oops and then they use the layer three service as well so it actually routes right there in the hypervisor and hands that packet right back up right so now I'm not going across the physical infrastructure using the core router of the core bandwidth any of that to do this east-west route in for workloads that are sitting right next to each other right even if those are distributed a little bit it's just going to use the aggregation portion of the network and route using the logical infrastructure so then if I want to put another VM on the other side of the data center across multiple subnets and availability zones I don't go out and reconfigure anything to configure a VLAN to make sure that I can get to that workload or anything I can go to any available compute anywhere spin up a VM and say connected to the same logical switch and those two green VMs are now l2 adjacent anywhere across the datacenter even between two data centers and the packets essentially are flowing across the physical infrastructure to do that and I'll talk a little bit more about how that works as we go through so as I mentioned the way this works is you use a cloud management platform we use nsx manager when you go to deploy a VM you say I want to deploy this VM and it essentially uses api's to talk to the controller and say push down the network services that are associated with that VM right so remember if I'm saying that that's layer 2 layer 3 and the third ones firewall services so the firewall services are running right there for that VM and if that VM ever moves all of those little green boxes move with it so automatically the security services the network services no matter where it works where it moves completely independent from the underlying physical topology move with it all those services move with it so now when these two VMs talk what happens is the packets flow through those services and if like I said that third box if that's the firewalling service and it doesn't pass the firewall policy it would get dropped right there at the virtual interface it doesn't go out across the network can you hit the firewall and get evaluated out there gets dropped right here that makes it through those services then it gets encapsulated don't be scared about encapsulation right encapsulation just means that I stick a header on the front end of the packet fire it across the backplane and take the header off on the other side and pass the packet so the packet that left this VM and there's that VM on the other side right we've been doing encapsulation for a very long time MPLS OTV lists GRE IPSec on and on and on we've been doing encapsulation forever it's only become a visibility issue since Cisco doesn't like NSX right the reality is you don't have a problem looking at the traffic that's going across the network when it's encapsulated you can still use net flow you can still use all the things that you use today to look at that traffic and in fact we give you better visibility to what's going on in the virtual environment than you've ever had right okay one of the really cool things about network virtualization is the ability that every virtual network is completely isolated from any other virtual network so by default this isn't using ACLs or firewall rules or any kind of blocking of traffic there's simply no communication path between these right so that these can be a multi-tenant environment or that could be your dev environment in your test environment running exactly the same IP addresses running on top of the same physical infrastructure right so I can move from dev to test very quickly because the application is the same that I the address is same everything's the same just to give you an example of how kind of secure this is it the US Army used to go out and build to physical network infrastructures at a remote base completely air-gap one for US forces one for coalition forces right but if coalition forces needed some more of the compute capacity that was over on the US side they couldn't get to it it was air gap you couldn't couldn't even get to it now they build one physical infrastructure with all the compute capacity and they isolate US forces from coalition forces using logical networking so now all available compute resources are available to either side at any time right so this is a very powerful way of separating things again not doing firewalling or ACLs or anything just naturally decoupled from each other and from the underlying physical infrastructure so for example a VM running in that virtual network even if it became a rogue compromised VM would have no way to actually attack the underlying physical infrastructure because it doesn't even know it exists right so I could be running in that green network I could say those two VMs are actually ipv6 this is an ipv6 application running on top of a v4 infrastructure because when it comes down here it just encapsulate sin put a v4 header on it fires the v6 packet across the network so here's another use case we're starting to see a lot of people do and this is for disaster recovery right so how many of you are using SRM or something like SRM Beam or some other right so what happens here right is you snapshot the VM and it's storage it gets replicated over to the other side if you have a dr event right you recover the vm and what's the first thing that you have to do because now it's running over here in a different physical infrastructure change its IP address right so once you change the IP address now you're changing the security that's associated with it and all of this impacts the RTO so now let's look at it from a different perspective with NSX running in the logical network so now you have a logical network you do exactly the same snapshot you're doing exact the same replication but at the same time the controller that controls the network infrastructure is also being replicated and kept in sync between your primary and recovery data center so now when you have a dr event and you spin up that recovery vm you don't have to change the IP address because the network and the security that it's expecting is already running there and you can even run so that you have DNS being advertised out of both of these data centers and you just make the recovery site a much more expensive link so it's always going to default to the primary site unless the primary site it's not available and then it goes through the default site so this is one of the things that we're seeing people apply NSX to like I said there's a lot of use cases of NSX this is just one of them so I've talked a lot about VMs and how the VMS get connected and so forth but we also support physical workloads it's another bit of FUD that's out there in the window in the world and we do that two ways one way is through an x86 gateway so this is just a server running some NSX software and I can connect physical workloads and I can connect legacy VLANs of physical workloads or virtual workloads to that and essentially those devices become l2 adjacent to the VMs that are running here because essentially you're mapping either that physical workload or that VLAN into the logical network right so this is how somebody like to view media moves 141 applications over into the new infrastructure they just take the workloads that are running on the VLAN and vmotion them across the the gateway into the new logical environment right now they can utilize the capabilities of the logical environment the other way we do this is through our top iraq partners so a Resta brocade cumulus Dell HP juniper all of these guys have done OBS DV integrations that make it so the controller can talk to the switch and map a switch port to a logical network so whether it's a physical workload or a VLAN connected to it it's mapped in and they become l2 adjacent there's another C in there that does it but you'll have ask them about it okay so here's what many of your infrastructures look like typical three-tier Cisco 7000 environment right so just like we talked about it before if I've got two VMs running on a blade and I need to route between them I'm going across the oversubscribed core now we offload that routing into the hypervisor even if I'm on two different blades I'm only using the aggradation portion of the network to get those packets between the the VMS so what this does is it actually allows you to extend the life of your 7000 infrastructure for whatever reason so for instance let's say you are still depreciating it because you invested in it a lot here recently the last few years or something and you want to extend the life you can get this new operational model and do that on top of it and extend the life because you're going to not have to invest more into your capacity because we're offloading that capacity you don't have to buy more 7,000 s you can take that money that you're saving and apply it to your 9,000 s that you want to buy because you want to move to a leaf spine architecture most people do want to move to the Leafs buy an architecture so if you're moving to a leaf spine architecture the last thing you want to do is invest more in your three-tier architecture so one of the things that nsx does is allow you to extend that life and get to the point where you can move to the new architecture this is exactly the same picture except for now I'm here pinning out to the firewall in order to apply controls between these two VMs right today everybody's doing a good job of perimeter defense but doing the controls at the Verte the virtual machine is very difficult and this becomes the basis for our micro segmentation use case of nsx so what I'm talking about with micro segmentation is this if you think about every single one of the attacks that we've all read about going over the last couple of years whether it's Target or Home Depot or Sony or US federal government right what happens is the threat gets in however it gets in once it gets in because there are little or no controls for lateral lateral movement that threat can move from server to server to server until it finds what's interesting and then it starts pumping credit card data out that is common to every single one of the attacks out there so from a security standpoint over on the right side the security team it's been Nirvana to say hey I'd like to be able to do a zero trust infrastructure but be able to create this kind of honeycomb effect so that I can contain the threat to a certain area but even that certain area could be dozens or hundreds of servers because once you start adding more and more and more firewalls to be able to have the capacity look at all that east-west traffic it becomes operationally infeasible to kind of keep up with it and the reason that it becomes operationally infeasible is because the packet leaves the VM it goes across the network and gets evaluated and enforced at the firewall but what that means is that when I provision that VM I have to update the firewall I have to create the rule I have to look at the you know policy okay what kind of VM is this I'm gonna write the rule I'm gonna make sure might have some human error involved there who knows puts that in the into the firewall right and if that VM ever moves I likely have to update the firewall and if I delete the VM I should delete the firewall rule but you all know what happens there should I delete that firewall rule no why not because my phone might ring right so you leave the firewall rule and then what happens a few months later you're spinning up a new VM same IP address application doesn't work everybody's trying to figure out what the heck's going on until somebody digs into the firewall and finds out that there's this rule that's blocking the traffic or worse it's actually allowing a hole that nobody knows about and nobody's phone's ringing on a hole right so how do we fix these problems we make it so that when you provision the VM you're provisioning this firewall rule policy with the vm remember you've got now this distributed firewalling capability that's now at every one of your hypervisors so now when i provision the vm the firewall incapabilities right there so when the packet leaves it gets evaluated and enforced right at the virtual interface so now if the VM moves all of the rules move with it completely automated no human intervention at all this is just all automatic and if I delete the VM the rules are gone with it again completely automatic no human intervention so what I've done is essentially automated all of the things that made it operationally infeasible to do controls all the way down to the virtual interface I've made that possible by having security built into the infrastructure baked into it instead of being bolted on to it which is the way we've done it for years so one of the cool things about this is it also enables a way of doing security and security grouping that doesn't have to be based on IP address it doesn't have to be based on ports and protocols it can be based on you know what is operating system that happens to be running on this VD i workstation you know what's the Machine name if I'm really good at you know naming my machines and having naming conventions I can apply security policies to those naming conventions regulatory requirements is this a PCI workload is it have customer data what is it and those kinds of things can be applied and say I can apply these rule sets to that kind of workload because of the kind of workload it is not because of the IP address that it has right so for an example there with the operating system I was talking about let's say I've got a bunch of VDI workloads but I have some people that are running old let's say 2000 Windows 2003 operating systems and I don't want those things talking to anything maybe I'll allow them to get to email but that's about the only thing so I can create an unsupported OS group and whenever a workload gets created comes up with and unsupported OS then it applies a DMZ policy around that that doesn't allow it to get to the things that I don't want it to get to where other VDI workloads could spin up and have a more modern or a later version of the operating system and be able to get to things so part of the way we make this all automated is we make the policy machine readable or at least you can think about it that way right today policy is human readable document right I going to deploy this kind of workload what does it have as an assistant that I'm looking at what's the policy on that and I create the rule based on that policy here we allow you to define what the policy is for all these different kinds of workloads that you might have so that when I go and say I'm going to deploy a production workload on the database tier with customer data and PCI data the system already knows what the rules that are supposed to be associated with that kind of workload are so I provision the workload and I have the rule set necessary to be applied to it automatically and nobody makes any mistakes because that's already been predefined those things feed a log file that can be consumed by your existing audit tools so allows denies redirects all of the things that you're used to in your firewalls is happening at the firewall and capability that's built into the system now and you can do the same audits but there's some interesting things that happen with the audit so for instance if many of you have to do deal with PCI and a PCI audit basically says I need to audit all the workloads that are on this side of the the firewall whether they have PCI data on it or not they're part of that segmentation well if the segmentation is micro segmentation and goes all the way down to the virtual interface now I only have to audit the machines that actually have PCI data on it because now the firewall and the segmentation part of PCI is happening right at the virtual interface so it can reduce the scope of an audit so it's very important to understand that I'm not talking about replacing the north southbound physical firewalls those things have a purpose they're in place doing exactly what they're supposed to do getting 100-plus gigabits per second out of them but I'm also not talking about a virtual firewall right every firewall company out there has the virtual version of their firewall but you go from 100 gigabits a second down to one gigabit per second and you haven't changed the operational model at all you still have to update all the firewall rules and so forth so this is why you don't see virtual firewalls all over everybody's datacenter right what I'm talking about is distributed firewall inge that's now baked into the platform so I get this automated policy management operations I get distributed enforcement down to every virtual interface and I get kernel-based performance so I mentioned before but we're getting 20 gigabits per second per host right so as I scale out the application environment I'm scaling out firewall and capability and I get a lot of questions on ok so now the firewalls doing all of this stuff or the the hypervisor is doing all this stuff how does that affect the performance of the hypervisor on the left here you see no filtering vSphere is doing about 20 gigabits per second when it turned on filtering with the firewall doing its thing I'd go down to about nineteen point seven gigabits per second so very little effect on the hypervisors ability to move packets and I could do 80,000 loops 80,000 connections per second with a hundred rules apply and again this is per host right so it's only applied to the VMS that are running on that host and I get another 80,000 connections per second for the next hypervisor so you can see as this scales out it can become a pretty big powerful firewall that's managed from one place so as we talked about we can create these completely isolated environments that's one part of security keeping the whole thing completely isolated but then I can do explicit allow right so this is our firewall firewall is a basic firewall it's kind of a source destination port protocol type filtering right based on but you can base it on naming and so forth it doesn't have to be based on IP address now you can easily argue and I would agree with you that you need deep packet inspection next-generation firewall and capability on the perimeter because you're allowing things like HTTP port 80 you have to but anything can go across HTTP port 80 so you need to do deep packet inspection and not allow the things that you don't want to but inside the perimeter now you know you know that your application server is talking to your database server on this port and protocol so create the rule that says that's what should be happening everything else should be dropped and that eliminates that threats ability to move from server to server because it's trying to do it over other ports and protocols now that said this is the basic capability we also have partners that give you the ability to do deep packet inspection so you can see out there on the show floor there have demonstrations from Palo Alto from checkpoint from Trend Micro from Intel security all of these guys have taken advantage of the distribution and the automation of the NSX platform and are now delivering their advanced feature set all the way down to the virtual interface as well right and the way that works and I'll use Palo Alto is an example but this is how checkpoint works is this how Intel and Tran all of these guys work is the management console registers with NSX and pushes down the VM series of their products so in this case with Palo Alto this is their VM series this is a virtual firewall right this is the same capabilities of the north southbound firewall running in a VM but you go from 120 gigabits per second to 1.2 gigabits per second right so now what happens is we have the ability to map the security policy for those workloads that need that deep packet inspection onto our firewall the distributed firewall here so now when the packet leaves the VM if it needs the advanced feature set we steer that traffic into the Palo Alto VM so now it can be done now you can apply Deepak inspection but the nice thing is it's only having to look at the VMS that are running on that hypervisor and actually a limited set of those whose policies say they need the deep packet inspection right so when you combine this distributed firewalling performance with the automation and the audit compliance and the deep packet inspection capability with our partners all of a sudden you have a micro segmentation solution where you can apply controls down to every interface inside the perimeter in a way that's operationally feasible so in the end within a sex you have the ability here to create isolated application environments apply stateful firewall and capability down to every virtual interface apply advanced capabilities where those are necessary deploy those anywhere in the data center completely independent from the underlying physical topology in any way even between multiple data centers have things like you know your web tier and your database tier running on the same hypervisor but not even able to talk to each other have the application portion running somewhere else in the data center but looking like it's all clustered together and if anything ever moves nothing changes because all of the networking all of the security everything that was associated with that workload moved with it again completely independent from any kind of topology that's going on in the underlying physical infrastructure so there's all kinds of different use cases I kind of heard a few of these you know the micro segmentation under security the IT automating IT media and spinning up these environments very quickly in speed and agility and then disaster recovery in application continuity but if you look there's other ways to apply things like micro segmentation so what we call DMZ anywhere this is essentially VDI workloads that you know when you spin up a VDI workload today you're having to say ok I need to make sure that this thing spins up and physical topology behind this firewall so that it can only get the things that it needs to get to when you apply that with NSX you can spin up that VDI workload anywhere and essentially create its own DMZ to what it can get to from wherever it is in the data center secure end user is our combination of AirWatch with nsx so if you take care watch today you know today mobile devices you create a VPN and pretty much the applications on the mobile device can get to anything that's on the other side of the VPN right now with NSX you can say this application can get to these resources and this application can get to those resources but they can't get to the other resources it's a very powerful capability to limit exactly what each application has access to in terms of the data in the data center developer cloud of course is something where people are using the speed and agility to spin up their dev environments to do testing to do things and a lot of times this gets driven directly by the API so you see it involved in DevOps and so forth where people are spinning up the environments themselves a lot of times we see OpenStack being deployed in that kind of environment multi-tenant infrastructure you know whether that's an enterprise that has the need to separate different groups or it's a service provider who actually has different tenants using the same infrastructure we have the capability to do that and then I talked about disaster recovery in the active standby mode but we also do what we call Metro pooling which is essentially the active active so now you can have two data centers and instead of having to have OTV kind of capability to to do connection between the data centers to stretch the l2 now you can take a logical network and stretch it across two data centers just using an IP connection right so now you can have an active active environment for an application where if this data center goes down the application keeps running over here and vice versa and then of course hybrid cloud where things like vCloud air we now have the ability to move workload with all its security all its net capability and move it over into into vCloud air move it back and it keeps all of that security as you move things around so again a lot of great partner ecosystem we see more and more partners actually integrating with the system you'll see a lot of them on the show floor I encourage you to go by ask him what they're doing with NSX these guys are all showing demos about how their products work with NSX and how it makes things a lot easier to use some very powerful capabilities from a lot of our great partners out here and these guys are represented on the show floor so please go take a look at what they're doing so one last video X estar serves the identity and access management verticals for aerospace and defense and life sciences and we also do secure collaboration and supply chain in the cloud for our customers for X estar NSX has been strategic in a number of different ways primarily it allows us to have a lot of control a zero trust model at the network layer network virtualization for us is kind of the holy grail in terms of having a portable workload that we can move from one data center to another and do it in a secure model and that has been something that we have not been able to do until we have come across Santa sex we've seen VMware take a great interest in in evolving the products I think even today probably beyond what other competitors prior to NSX we like most IT companies you know had a workflow that involved you know physical firewalls a lot of processes and these would span weeks at times and now with NSX that goes down to hours or minutes at most because of the automation involved because of the virtualization and our control we chose NSX over the competitors such as Cisco ACI simply because of market adoption NSX has gained much more momentum in the marketplace and seems to have broader acceptance by the partner ecosystems than the competitors that are coming up NSX has been game-changing because it has a demonstrable reduction in level of effort so when we're reducing our time to deploy my 80% that leads to savings that we can deploy folks on other projects my job is to work myself out of the job I want to make my job so easy that I can do other things for extra star and its customers what we're seeing is for disaster recovery the bar is getting higher and higher in terms of the data we're protecting and how fast we can bring it back online with NSX now what we're able to do is basically take that container always have it in our D our facility and when we need it we can basically at a push of a button bring it online and bring our customers back online so my advice and getting NSX deployed in your environment is to is to start from the bottom up to start with your regular network administrator's your regular sis admins it doesn't have to come from management once you start to see the visibility that you get you'll never miss the command line so we've got a lot of support out there one of the things I want to make sure I get across to you is that NSX is unique in its way that this is something that you can try right this is not something that you need to decide I'm gonna re architect the data center and we're gonna do something big you can get a few hypervisors worth you can start seeing what it can do you can let people get used to it and this is where a lot of people do they start they deploy it they see what you can do they get people used to it they get understanding how they would move applications into it and then they expand from there this is something that you can start small and grow from we've got a lot of support out there we've been doing a lot of interesting things in terms of how to operationalize NSX since we now have over more I think it's about a hundred and sixty customers now that are in full deployment capability out there we've been interviewing them about their best practices and how they moved through the process of getting that deployed and so we can help you we're writing a lot of documents about that and how to help your organizations understand how they will move to this new environment and so lots of services out there are lots of partners that can help you do this and so I encourage you to give it a shot give it a try you won't be disappointed so you can start by looking at a couple of different places out here get some some training identity when we're gonna have different events in your cities that that you can go see get hands-on lab go to the hands-on lab while you're here at vmworld for the last four years NSX has been the most used hands-on lab at both San Francisco vmworld and Barcelona VMworld by double of any other hands-on labs so lots of people checks in and out see what it can do so that's my presentation I'll be happy to take some questions I think we've got maybe five minutes and then and then I'll be I'll go out on the side as we exit anybody has questions out there as well any questions comments cuss words yeah okay well thank you very much for your time
