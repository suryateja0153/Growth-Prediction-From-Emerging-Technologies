 hello everyone can you hear me fantastic well, delighted to be here delighted to be onstage to talk to you today about about blockchain and it's not easy being a software engineer whenever tell people i'm a software engineer they'll either walk slowly backwards away from me or and and this is worse they'll try and get me to fix problems with their pc every so often a technology comes along that makes me truly excited to be a software engineer technology that has a real potential for societal change blockchain is one of those technologies a lot of a lot of grand ideas related to block chain a lot of hype a lot of really important use cases that we hear about in conjunction with blockchain here just a few of them that we see so misappropriation of aid is a huge problem in the world it's preventing many many economies from growing and also causing a lot of people to die now according to a 2009 UN report twenty-three percent of Afghanistan's GDP is spent on bribery and corruption and in Sierra Leone a the GAVI organization who are a distributor of vaccines actually founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had to recall 530,000 dollars of pledged aid because it again it was being misappropriated now imagine if there was a way of for individuals and governments to donate money in such a way that you could guarantee that that money is going to be used correctly that would be huge second example now and those who have been watching the news you'll have seen the devastation caused recently by Hurricane Matthew and it's true to say that there's just an increase in the number of extreme weather events and globally now part of the problem with these extreme weather events is the fact that no one insurer is able to adequately cover the risk associated with these events Californians for example only twelve percent of Californian homes are covered by earthquake insurance and in Florida the state has had to step in as ensure of last resolved now you may have heard of these things they called the catastrophe bonds which is a negative way of trying to pull together lots of different insurers to spread the risk now the problem is you've got all these different systems all these different insurers getting the money to where it's needed is a big problem it's a very slow manual process now imagining again if there was a way of completely automating that process so that all the way from claim all the way through to the distribution of money so that you could settle claims in hours rather than week's final one the dispute resolution is the corner stone of the legal profession how did you settle disputes over who owns what or and this example that I've shown here is actually the court case that followed the year 2000 u.s. presidential election which you may remember between bush and gore it was so close it had to be settled by a judge imagine if there was a way of being able to settle these disputes as in who owns what or what the state of a vote was in such a way that means you you could do it without requiring a trusted third party imagine a world without lawyers So these are just three use cases so what is blockchain blockchain is all about the business network businesses don't operate in isolation they always operate as part of a wider business network and the way that wealth is generated in any economy is by flowing goods and services over a business network as this basic economy 101 - and what enables that process well it's all the sequence of transactions them and when I do a transaction with somebody else that transaction is typically recorded on what is probably the most important system of record in any organization and that is the ledger ok so the ledger is the most important system of record in any organization ledgers have been around actually since 1494 there's a Franciscan monk called luca pacioli he created double-entry bookkeeping and all the ledger is is a sequence of transactions and so for example and if i wanted to buy a car and sir, say I wanted to buy a car from you What car do you drive "a Mazda" a Mazda? ok What car you drive? Skoda! lol Skoda, ok let's go back to the Mazda let's say i want to buy a car from you and and so I would give you money in exchange for the exchange of the car and that would be recorded my organizations ledger and as a credit of one car as a debit of some money, and similarly be recorded in your organization's ledger similarly - of course we may have a contract is associated with that particular transaction and that contract could say things like well if the car breaks down within six months as decided by a third-party arbitrator then I get my money back now there are problems with both Ledger's and contracts now with Ledger's the number of problems with legends i'll just pick on one and the problem being that how do we agree that the transaction is recorded in my ledger is the same as the transaction was recorded in your ledger reconciliation how do we reconcile the transactions that's a huge cost in many businesses we all know but the problems with contracts think about contracts is that they required armies of lawyers to create their ambiguous in their nature and and require lengthy court case in order to describe what the actual meaning of the contract is so let's go into blockchain what is blockchain now there are number of definitions blockchain depending on who you're talking to now the most popular one that is in common usage today is this is three words shared replicated ledger so firstly it's a ledger it's a description of the inputs and outputs of a of a business a and effectively description the little liquidity position of a business but it's a fundamentally a ledger, a transaction log it's 'apend only', you can only ever right things to the end of it you can't go and modify items in the log you can go delete items and so on however and this thing it's shared so all the participants of the business network see the same measure so there's immediately no reconciliation however it's not a single point of failure and that's why we say is replicated so even though there's only one ledger every participant in the network sees has their own logical copy of it is kept in sync that's what block chain is all about and if anyone asked you what blockchain is those three words will probably get you by closely associated with a blockchain part of the blockchain fabric is something we call the smart contract and a smart contract is the representation of a contract in code in computer code so the smart contract is a really important idea because let's say there was a and i was buying a car we had a contract that defined that transaction and that contract was written in a smart contract it is defined in code now if we were part of the business network and we chose as part of that business network that all of you could see that contract that it makes it impossible for me as one voice in this business network to renege on that contract because the contract will be run because you will all run it gives us something we call the guarantee of future execution so they're really the two big things that that constitute blockchain there were also a couple of qualities of service as well the first one is privacy or maybe the lack thereof now many of you have heard about blockchain food bitcoin bitcoin is really the first mainstream application of blockchain technology and bitcoin is to all intents and purposes an anonymous ledger think what an anonymity means anonymity means you know exactly what's happened but you don't know necessarily who did it anyone can go look at the Bitcoin ledger go to block chain that info you can see the entire log of Bitcoin transactions but you don't necessarily know who didn't know they're meaningless sequences of numbers and that's fine anonymous ledges are all good for certain set of use cases there's another set of use cases that require privacy now many of the organizations that I work with can't touch anonymity you may have heard of requirements like know your customer and anti-money laundering these requirements that require businesses to know exactly who they are dealing with and so for those organizations and anonymous ledger doesn't really cut it they need privacy you think about what privacy is it's the total opposite of anonymity with privacy you know exactly who you're dealing with but not necessarily the transactions that have happened and so there are two classes of blockchain we can consider here they're the quality of service that we often talk about with blockchain it's consensus is closely related to privacy so how do we agree on the state alleges how do we know that the transactions that have been recorded to the ledger are good now on an anonymous network like Bitcoin you don't know who you're dealing with and so you need something that's quite heavy weight in order to guarantee that the the network isn't trying to be manipulated in some way so if you ever hear about single proof-of-work cryptographic mining this is what it is it's a way it's what bitcoin uses to inject an artificial costs into the system to disincentivize people from trying to default it from doing things like spending twice or put in fraudulent transaction and so what proof of work is it it's adding the cost of electricity it's forcing you as a validator of the Bitcoin network to burn electricity in order to have a save what's going on what's on the ledger and that removes any incentive it's like me saying and well take any questions from the audience but so I don't get swamped with with bad questions while I'm going to first say is if you want to ask a question I'm going to give you a Rubik's Cube you have to solve that Rubik's Cube before you cannot still quite ask a question yeah it like what proof of work is now again that's ok for a certain class of use case think about the privacy that the use cases that require privacy she don't need something quite a heavy weight as and as proof of work and the Bitcoin network reputedly takes more power than the country of Ireland in order to learn it's a huge huge cost on private networks you already know who you're dealing with and you'll suffer reputation damage or some other kind of monetary damage if if you start adding in bad transactions you have a blockchain that covered banks talking to other banks you don't need something like proof of work and so you can get away with which lightweight forms of consensus so what's happening now in the in the blockchain community is we're trying to take those four main features there and standardized them i'm sure many of you are familiar with HTTP HTTP the cornerstone of the internet it allows information to flow from any one entity to any other entity is completely revolutionized how we work now imagine if there was a similar standard for the flow of assets whether tangible assets like and houses or cars or whatever and intangible assets and like financial instruments such as bonds or the right to listen to a piece of music that you have downloaded we need cash so if there was a standard that allowed you to flow assets completely frictionlessly that would that would be huge in it would revolutionize how business happens and give an example and conveyancing those of you who have bought houses think about what conveyancing process actually is in the conveyancing process and if i want to say one to buy a house that lets say I was buying a house from you and then i would go to a solicitor and i would give the money to a solicitor and you would go to the same or different solicitor and you would get the deed to the house and then on a degree date and time the solicitor as a trusted third party would exchange the deeds and the money so i get the deeds you get the money what value is the solicitor adding in this case well there was a third party now if there was a way of bringing together the buyer of an asset and the seller of an asset we don't need a trusted third party if we could if we could guarantee if we both had visibility to a data structure somewhere that said who owned the asset at a given date and time we no longer need a trusted third party imagine a world without lawyers! or think slightly slightly wider you know if there was a way of bringing together the central bank in a country with consumers what is the need what is the purpose of retail banking because what blockchain aims to do is the aims to completely bring together business networks whether their supply chains banks talking to other banks whatever happens to me that's the aim of blockchain so how close are we well it's very very early days - what we can see here is the Gartner hype cycle this is what Gartner the analyst produce every so often and if you look at the very top there blockchain is currently heading towards the top of the peak of inflated expectations Forrester another analyst they predict that mainstream adoption of blockchain for end-to-end business processes is not going to be from the five to ten years so we are very much in its infancy the technology is still being developed still being written still being standardized however there's a lot of goodwill there's a lot of people at the moment a lot of businesses looking at blockchain looking at the potential and then looking at the potential because they can see what it can do they can see the fact that this will revolutionize business networks and how business happens so when it comes to anything I don't know and only think I think has a huge amount potential and the reason why i think it's got a huge amount of potential actually goes back to and something that happened a couple years ago my daughter she was too at the time and she asked me what I did for a living and had a think for a bit, at the time was working at an area of computing called 'systems integration' and I try to think about a way that I could explain to her in terms that she would understand what I did so I thought about that and said well I knew she knew what computers were because that was the medium for which peppa pig was delivered to it so it's kinda like it it makes computers talk to other computers and that kind of satisfied and she went often did what she did but he did get me thinking think about all the technologies that have stood the test of time database stores information messaging systems might move information all these simple ideas stand the test of time and they can all be explained to a two-year-old because if you can't explain a technology to a two-year-old what hope do you have trying to explain it to a business executive and I think blockchain is one of those one of those technologies and because it's a really simple idea this idea of its a lot of transactions it's a log of what you've done this shared replicated ledger very very simple idea but an idea that I think has a huge amount of potential thank you very much
