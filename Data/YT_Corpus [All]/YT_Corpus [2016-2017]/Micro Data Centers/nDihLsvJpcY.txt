 okay hello good afternoon so thanks for joining I electric expose Hulk's presentations so this afternoon i'm going to introduce something here but not that much about our product details lots of specifications different from some other presentations what i'm going to do in the coming 10 15 minutes i'm going to introduce about the house and I electric understand the hyperscale data center and how we make our offer development no fitting to these kind of trend and a co-worker is the industry's so it's going to like present some of the challenges we are facing right now so before the lunch time you know lots of bunch of my colleague and said hey the Google join that bring another kind of version of ocp drag like 48 volt DC a totally different from ocps excited oh it's like weed though but we treat this as really a in common right now is special for these internet web joins so every customer is like seeking no unique product and customized product for themselves try to be more efficient fit their own application fit their own data center to be that you know flexible enough to support their business so we are facing kind of but as a traditional supply chain likes like more common needs more like principles more standard products so that we can go volume game easier to do but right now since nowadays lots of changes happening especially I mentioned for hyperscale data center customers so try to be as a slide Schneider check we try to be more open innovative and collaborative with all the customers together try to move the industrial head in no minutes i'm going to introduce what we what our changes and how we going to look at the english channel some of our experience there so we have some of the modification of our offer development process and try to bring our experience for the large scale data centers to these you know the ones the modern companies like Intel wife joins big customers like collocations so we customize some of the product for them we you know at the beginning we talk a lot like engineering to engineering some of the new ideas when we think that's a really good idea we have a quick prototype some of the skirt small scale pilot I try that then we do our best you know experience like we manage managing the English translation we managing manufacturing manager quality well so we have a very quick process to make it as most tender but still customized for customers tail the tool customers so we try to be lean and agile then customer oriented so develop all the hyperscale data center solution nowadays so you know I'm going to present to put that so you'll find that you have a booth but as i mentioned i'm not going to talk lots of the detail but a little bit so you can understand what we are doing and how how we can wilco work with the customers so this is a an integrated rack I've been sitting here for hours lots of our friend the company's you know bringing the same product I are very close like ocp v1 or v2 it's like IT Service space power shelf space like oh like pasta power distribution bus bars so it's it's really a almost a something new really new to the customers new to the different from the traditional rag that fit into the new customer needs which they want a rag pre-installed in the factory it was integrator so that because the business needs like customer want these drag could be you know turn down to Porter business as soon as possible so all these requirements comes from the customer needs they want these things happen in the integrator not in the data center so that's why they want power chef install they want busbar there so they can do the protesting the in the server server factory then they can turn on very quickly in the india data center so i'm going to introduce hear about the history well right now we seek we think this is quite common but come back two three or four years ago it's really new to the industry no one is doing that like 2013 it's and we talk we find one customer come to us how we have a something new we are we try to support our business which can deploy our latest and very quickly I want to pull a 100 rags within a dying about in my data center so they come to us how can you do that then at the beginning you know I I went with this customer then so what do you have to have a spec so that we can develop together so to have some some know something so the customer show me is only a video high level concept this is I want to do and like once one page of spreadsheet list like this is the dimensions this is the power rating this is what I want oh that's all at the beginning phase so I just got how you how how can that do that can we do that so but as I mentioned three years ago we try to do that we try to co work with the customer so nowadays customer wants some innovations are we going to be in there as an electric and you know i will provide the total solution vendor and expert in this industry so we decided to come up with that and it changes some of the styles you can see here we have as I mentioned we only have a spreadsheet list all the things they want but nothing like 2d 3d drawings so we spend a month sitting have our team program manager and engineering sitting customers I like lots of back and forth discussion what we want like to like this to like that so finally we come out a chair concept with like almost a lung walls files with 15 pages all the details so after that only like months later that organization that customer published the first version of the specification hey this is going to be our drafted specification for Iraq so support our service support our business in the future so we the expert we contribute a lot with on these specifications SoCo work with the them together so later then after for two to three months after specification in the same time we do some prototype testings and lots of love lots of things to have first sample testing co-working with customer and the lots of working with our friend you can see actually you can see our product in ink purpose I pretty sure that's our product talk to total guy there so we got the first prototype lunch and validation within half a year from one page of spreadsheet then after that we go work with customer and the working group there's a bunch of people quite a fighter similar as ocp group we developed the specification that's version formal version pointer one then we release that and the code try to move the industry fit into their requirement that just as the ocp version right now so after year since the first meeting so we have the mass production so this actually changes lots of the Tibetan no matter and how we could work with customer nowadays so fitting under standard requirement quick testing code work and lots of joint innovation so come out to this product it's an by far last year with almost ship out three thousand rags it's good business but still like we wink together and the cousin also appreciate that how you helped me to move all these tender the move ahead so this is a real example how we deployed like Prada developing our offers co what was the customer together nowadays so and it's the beginning we have the rack ready are we finished so here's some news then customer said I want to deploy my rag once 100 a day in one data center but the problem they face it like after they ship the rack there's they have to pull the no powers networking cables everything's so but still take a day like how they do that they'll make it a more efficient and the traditional I'll can L containment takes time to install like for the expression for these internet with giant web join for the social media customers their application like booming they in some application China and when they got very widely used it could be like expanded like two weeks there they need like 200 more server racks they can they need a accomplish so you come back to us hey can you work with us they try to us all my new problems how can I really deploy that product within within a week so this time I hate we like to contribute where our expert we we are you know the inventor of the hot aisle containment but right now we think the customers are using differently they want that pre-installed stand alone then later you can easily slide in the right and the mood Iraq you know immediately so which enable their their work their job easier so the team here the Schneider Electric team there we know as I mentioned the same process we did with co walk with customer hey what what's your problem you are going to face right especially for the larger data center you cannot duplicate every part very easily because the cited situation eyes that are totally different you can for once I do maybe you have lots of colony in this corner in the middle of the other data center you don't have any column you can put everything there pas de hope holders for some other problem the meet like they were more spacing the IT rag they don't want the servers in occupied too much I rear axle and the ID the networking part is going to be pre you know testing preloading first then later then really support their quick deployment of the data center so there is lots of discussion and no brainstorming and lots of sparks there and so for sure some argument there so it generates some new concept hey this is going to be very good fit product fitting to our climate so we generate a new concept about the aisle containment here's you can see here we have also the standalone concept but we also have a quick installation design so we prefer most of the components in our Factory the shape of the whole pack there the people just the work again the stuff working there can very easy pick up and use these kind of the quick installations tools easily to install them so I'm going to tell you how fast we can we can do this you know el containment very quickly in our customer data center like the case won the pot new part like 16 part the customer you know issue the order then we started a fabric for fabric king of factories then totally from the design for a requirement they want and including the production increase shipping including audit all the unsightly installation takes only eight weeks so think about after eight weeks you put pulling order you finish order like a power loading and finish the network networking loading what you are going to do is just sliding the rack you just now you see the all you want i track then you can do your business now it's fitting to the larger scale you know data center like Internet giant's about also the collocations you can do business anyway you easily slide in easily slide so even later like we do or we also just lots of optimizations and okay we know this there is some problem there's are questions so we optimize like this is the second case I'm not I'm not going to mention the when the customer name but we really have even faster later like a 30-30 to part with deploy that only like six weeks with all these these part you know you can't check any vendor who can deliver that but we are proud that we first one invent that we understand that the customer needs and we deploy that together with customer and I think the custom is very happy like they can do a business regarding their requirements they can easily expand their applications very fast so they stay really don't know how should I the lecture nowadays no talk to the customers understand their needs and the co walk oneco innovate twist with the end users and the moving actually moving to eat that straight ahead it's a trend that we would like to support all the customers here so I'm still come back is a ocp summit so here's major offer we provided a fall for ocp so we have as I mentioned a new IT pass solution it's a total power solution fitting to large hyperscale data center and for big colocation for internet web joins stand alone so you can pray install anything you can put your log pre-tested preloaded protesting the last thing you do to run your business is sliding the rack how long and no plugging and networking cable and we have some really simple and efficient architecture about the cooling system we're together with this part system you can put over here cooling there so it's quite a simple and quite easy to install and really high efficient so you don't have have additional fans there you have no co-op with the rack there it's easily to run so for sure we have as a no top vendor of the UPS or the power supply we have the power supply show we just finish announcement that Chanel lecture will support the leysomme ion batteries in our future offers so we also have the listen I on PB use running together with the ocp offers or similar product so we have OCD right way around with different architecture with flat packing there so it's going to be easily to be stored in the warehouse then you can ship out like 100 without within a week so it's a little bit different from others we won't be innovative like supporting customer business so here is a major offer of Schneider Electric support the ocp supporting the hyperscale of data centers so lastly is the sum of contact welcome to the booth just on your right hand to Schneider Electric so thank you everyone
