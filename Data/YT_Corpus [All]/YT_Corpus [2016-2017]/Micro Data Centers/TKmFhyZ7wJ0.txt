 um I'm going to talk about some strategies that we're using in California to try to identify where the populations and providers are where we should focus increased TB prevention efforts and I'm going to tell you all about these various definitions that I'm using throughout the talk because high risk and TB prevention have different meanings for different folks but I will get there so the goal of course is to use data available to us at the state and in the form of public databases in this case specifically administrative data sets to figure out where should we prioritize our efforts we are going to tell you why we're going to need to focus down because there's a very large population of lately infected individuals in the state of California and we really would like to start with those that are at the truly highest risk of TB disease in our new efforts so let me tell you a little bit about on the context of the populations in California and our TB epidemiology we have about 39 million residents 10 million of them were born in other places outside the United States and that the foreign-born comprise about twenty-seven percent of the total population in California and about a quarter of the foreign-born population in the United States we also estimate that there's about a two point two and a half million undocumented persons and these this is a group of folks that we know are highly vulnerable because they are less likely to access care and to be available for TB prevention services in California we report one-quarter of the TV cases across the nation so we're a pretty high incidence state in in our low incidence country um and you've seen these trend graphs before for New York City California's trend grass memmer look very similar we have a different magnitude because we're a state and not a city but at the peak of the TB epidemic we had a case rate of about seventeen point four per hundred thousand which has declined to about 5.6 in the year 2014 I do want to point out though the area of the curve as you see there was a great decline from the peak but through the years and definitely recently we no longer see a decline in fact I would say that we are in our surveillance folks would agree that we are at steady state we really have the same number of TB cases from year to year probably starting since 2011 we have 2100 little over 2100 TB patients per year reported so this slide I barred from dr. paedon bury our chief of surveillance and epidemiology and I think it's a really nice graphical representation of the impact of TB on our California residents each little person in this graph is represents a TV case in in the year 2014 and we append an estimated that what this really means is that TB is diagnosed in California every four hours and you can see also that seventy-seven percent of our TB patients are in the foreign-born the countries on the main countries where are foreign-born TB patients originated are the following five so Mexico and Philippines are places that together fifty percent of our foreign-born TV pace take cases were born and then Vietnam China and India the next highest countries of origin with a remainder mixture of many other countries so how do TB cases occur in California this is an important question because it helps us decide you know gene talked this morning or the earlier session about recent transmission being another way we can prevent DB we need to intervene there to prevent TB but if we look in California at the relative contribution of these three different mechanisms to how TV cases occur in California we see that using CDC's plausible source case method that was recently published by a marie france and her colleagues at the CDC their estimate for recent transmission in california is thirteen percent now when we look at the data when we talk about importation of TB cases what we really mean is that if look looking over the five-year timeframe of 2010 through 2014 835 of the eleven thousand cases report in that time frame were within foreign-born persons who arrived in the US and their TB diagnosis was in within one year of arrival and so again this is just an estimate it one can argue this but clearly it's a much smaller number and percentage than the seventy nine point five percent of our TB cases that we estimate to be from reactivation of remote infection because they are not attributable to the other two mechanisms so for the rest of my talk what I mean by TB prevention is looking at patients who are at high risk of both infection and disease and the goal is to identify them screen them test them and treat them for latent TB infection I will use the terms TB infection and latent TB infection interchangeably um so the questions to try to guide this presentation I chose where the following number one what is the magnitude of TB infection in any given jurisdiction and i'll start with california as a state to what is the public health department's contribution to TB prevention so what is going on currently in the state of california to address TB prevention through screening and treatment of ltbi how many high-risk patients are tested and treated there and are there missed opportunities what are they and can we address them finally what is the contribution of private providers to TB prevention so we can look at you know the Affordable Care Act and the fact that a lot more foreign-born folks are becoming insured again unfortunately missing the undocumented in this case but we do find that there are more foreign-born persons who have insurance under ACA and hopefully we can access them through partnerships with private providers who can extend the capacity of our ability to do TB prevention and so again we need to find out though where are the highest person seeking care outside the Health Department so which providers should we be looking at and finally is TB prevention optimized in various settings outside the Health Department so to estimate the magnitude of LTV i took this slide from penn and Barry who basically applied the N Haines lt-vi prevalence estimates from the recent study published by Rocky miramontes and his CDC colleagues and he applied the various prevalences for by Nativity and race/ethnicity across the estimated population of California using to be honest with you don't remember of a population survey or American Community Survey there's different pros and cons to using those but they're both census data products that are useful for identifying denominators and understanding our populations underlying our TB cases um and um pen and felt strongly that it's the iGrow positive tests that reflect true ltbi prevalence for the foreign-born whereas it's TST positive results that reflect prevalence of ltbi in the US born and he'll be talking tomorrow maybe you can came exactly what his reasoning is there but we do know there are some differences in performance in the different groups so by applying by doing using this approach we estimated and this is a very rough estimate because we also want to look at age structure of our population which will impact these final numbers we're working with our UCSF modeling group to actually model maybe give us a much more robust estimate but using this very rough approach that I just outlined we have 2.2 million persons who are infected with TB in the state of California 0.6 million of them are us-born 1.6 million are four and one okay so how do we even begin to think about that you know doing prevention work here so let's go back to those questions what is the health department currently doing so in the state of California we have 61 local health jurisdictions about 30 to 40 of them serve about eighty percent of our total TB cases these health departments are responsible for screening so doing case finding in TB prevention work among recently arrived adults who have abnormal chest radiographs from overseas screening we call these the B notifications also among the notifications are the b-2s these are the children that are screened overseas with either a TST or a and they also do the contact investigation so any index TV case they will do a contact investigation if they are infectious on the local health department's also do a lot of other TV prevention work in other types of populations and substance users however we at the state don't collect those data so I'm willing at a focus on the three groups so let's look at how much TV how much testing is going on for latent TB infection among the recent arrivers I wanted to orient you to this graph because what we have in blue is the total number of arrivers who had abnormal chest x-rays in the state of California in 14 so about 3500 um the new arrivers that were children that were found to have ltbi on testing overseas or about 2000 and those the the number that were actually evaluated of a proportion that were evaluated were sixty-two percent of the adults with the abnormal chest x-ray and forty-five percent of the children so there is a drop-off here in the potential for assessing all potential patients that are at increased risk of having progressing to TB disease then if we look at all those that were fully evaluated to the point of determining do they have active disease do they have TB infection or do they have none of those this group was infected so a little about 1,800 folks only thirty-three percent of that 1800 folks the a of the 1800 were started on treatment okay we're getting this data Phil Lowenthal generated these data from RB notification data set so the question is can we improve our evaluation where we see the drop-off and that of course our treatments start and we're not actually gathering robust data on treatment completion in this system okay so we have missing data we have questions about what more can be done okay so this is one of the pieces of the puzzle to help us say maybe should we put extra effort here next group of folks are our context and in California 2013 is the nearest year for which we have our data about 17,000 contacts were elicited we don't know if that's truly a hundred percent of all the potentially exposed persons and contact investigations but if we assume that um eighty-seven percent of that group were fully evaluated twenty-two percent were found to be infected sixty-four percent of those who were found to be infected started treatment and sixty-two percent of those that started treatment actually completed treatment what that means is that only forty percent of infect contacts completed treatment all the way through so this is a demonstration I don't think this is news for any of you at TV programs that there are potentially missed opportunities you know why are these folks not starting treatment there may be actually some valid reasons but for sixty percent to not complete treatment of infected persons that's probably not completely explainable by you know valid reasons and so these are things yes valid in the sense of the resource environment but can we do better is the question okay so in the state of California we have estimated our huge under estimate of only these two types of populations the B notes adults and children and contacts there are twenty-three thousand high-risk persons that were screened in our TV clinics and we may have an opportunity we have data that tells us now that only thirty-three percent of new arrivals with ltbi started treatment and forty percent of the recent contacts with lt-vi completed treatment so moving on to the next question is what is the contribution of private providers to TB prevention so here is where I really get into the exploratory phase this is really just the beginning of us trying to figure out how do we do this there is no recipe but I'd love to hear from you if you all are doing different things what kinds of things you're thinking about what types of methods you may be exploring and I think that that we can you know work together as a nation potentially think about this if we think it's a worthwhile process so where are the high-risk person seeking care outside the health department first let me talk a little bit about what i mean by high risk for this set of people so this diagram just shows you the Venn diagram the intersection of those who have TB infection risk and those that have TB progression risk and really the folks we want to start off with are going to be those who have the intersections okay so a TB infectious infection risk would be folks who are born in countries of medium and high TB incidence I'm in a progression risks could be any one of the following so here is just a table that shows some of the again the known risk factors for TB progression and the high relative risks from 22 up to 12 relative risk for these different conditions so in a patient that's infected those purse these persons are at higher risk to develop active disease than someone without these factors so how can we answer this question so in California the providers you know our main different categories of providers are we have this large HMO serving northern california in southern california we have community clinics called federally qualified health centers and these are organizations clinics that get grants from the federal government through her sir and they one of their goals their mission is to serve underserved populations so they mainly serve folks on Medicaid or uninsured persons and then of course there's the individual private practices there's a lot of university based practices in the state of California as well as these individual practices so how do we even begin to think about where to start in terms of providers in populations so there's potentially two streams one is start with the TV patients okay and so in the left-hand side of the panel the question is who provides primary care to that TB patient who provided primary care to that patient prior to their being diagnosed with TB because that suggests a potential opportunity for the primary provider to have determine whether this person had TB infection and prevent the infection from progressing to disease the right-hand side of the panel looks at this idea of who are the major providers that serve the highest volume of patients who are at high risk so to look at data sources to identify providers that serve high-risk patients if we look at let's see I wanted to see if okay so i was going to shift over to here we go San Diego okay so I'm on it so up until this point I've been talking about California statewide data now I want to give San Diego as an example San Diego was one of our local health jurisdictions it has you know the second or third highest number of TB cases in California and it's on the border with Mexico and this jurisdiction their TB program actually queries their TB patients on their intake form to say where did you receive care in the two years prior to your having your TB diagnosis and so San Diego's well it recently implemented this form and so I haven't seen any data from them yet in terms of looking at it but this is the type of form that we could look at you know analyze the data and determine do certain providers show up more often than others and if so those might be the ones we would want to start to work with okay what about using administrative data sets so here I'm talking specifically about those federally qualified health care centers because there are some data available on them through the her so wet so we have a poster on my summer student marina when Kim and Peter oh who believe you saw MTC a last year who spoke at our setc meeting last year has done majority of this work basically what they did is they identify data for federally qualified health care center grantees who run more than one clinic usually they merge those data with census data to fight it where the clinics were located and they were able to identify characteristics of patient populations because these data are collected by the funding organization so this is just a diagram of putting different kinds of data sources together and trying to link the facility or the clinic itself to patient population risk so this slide shows some of the data we get at the grantee level so in San Diego in twenty fourteen nineteen percent the estimated population of San Diego was served by 313 federally qualified health care center grantees those 13 grantees operated 122 clinics and so you can see we were able to collect data on the total volume of patients per grantee not only this the slide doesn't show it that's shown in summer in the next but we're also able to collect the proportion of patients served by each grantee that had diabetes HIV homelessness and a few other risk characteristics that we consider you know those that are markers of vulnerable populations who would be at risk of disease and so this just shows a summary slide of some of the information that we could share with San Diego about risk factors and populations by FQHC grantee and so here it really what I just want to focus on here is this idea that we also get data on race ethnicity which is sometimes correlated with birth status we're not able to get data on nativity so no birth status is collected in these data sets but sometimes race ethnicity can be a good marker particularly in San Diego which is on the border with Mexico um and so we are able to start to identify different clinics that serve populations having these conditions that are risk factors for regression and we are also able to map the location of those clinics and look at census data to say are those clinics located in census geographic areas that have a high proportion of persons who were born in another country okay so as you can see we keep getting more indirect to try to get at our question because we still don't have exactly the right data that we'd like to have um but it's again an estimate and so the other thing that marina did is what she actually mapped the location of these FQHC clinics in San Diego and so the panel on your left is showing shading of geographic regions by percent foreign-born so the darker shaded areas are areas where there's a greater proportion of foreign-born thirty to sixty percent in the darkest areas and then the lighter shaded areas have a lower percentage as you can see there are many FQHC clinics located in those areas the panel on the right shows a map of the actual TB cases that were reported and so the shading van is actually showing on the darker green represents a higher number of TB cases reported in those geographic locations and again lighter shading is fewer TB cases these two maps are somewhat overlapping in terms of proportion foreign-born and number of TB cases reported but not completely and so we want to continue to explore what are those differences are they meaningful and can they help us maybe again make priority decisions about the kinds of providers we might want to work with for increased TB prevention activities in San Diego umm finally is TB prevention optimized how many minutes we have thank you so here we were able to work with our large HMO we did a research study with them in partnership in pen and berrian Koch's salcedo were very involved as well as our registry stuff um basically investigating of the TB cases that were reported in a two year cohort or recent two-year cohort um how many were within the HMO system up to at least a year prior were they patients and they did not receive screening for latent TB infection and did they have risk factors that should have alerted those providers at the HMO to do some screening and these HMOs and we've estimated observe fourteen percent of our TB patient popular nation and what we found is I'm not going to give you the details but basically yes indeed there were missed prevention opportunities there and so again as TV programs are grappling with decisions about which providers should we work with we can't make assumptions that may be larger providers who have good policies in general still may have some places where improvement could be useful and where if they were improvement there could be a high impact on our prevention activities positive impact finally I just put up this slide to go back to this idea of the undocumented and those patients who really are not accessing care we really don't even know how to look at this group we do know that for example if San Diego's question related to where was your primary care before you came here we can identify what is the percentage of patients who don't answer that question and we can make an assumption that perhaps that means they do not access care before they had TB diagnosis so that might give us a sense of the frequency or the total number of folks who are not accessing care but in terms of how to access them you know folks without a medical home that's a whole other question but we can't forget about this population we need to keep it on our list um so finally I as I said I just wanted to walk through some exploratory strategies about how do we start to focus our efforts on the highest risk folks for TB how do we prevent TB what kind of data can we collect so we are able to use our health department data we should probably be doing that routinely we have it it's available and we still need to figure out how best to go into the private sector and figure out what's happening there so very specific limitations of the FQHC data sets include this idea that the grantee level data is not equivalent to clinic level data so there's a lot of you know potential miss classification their population risk intersections are not equivalent to end of vidual patient risk intersections and so that's another potential issue we're making mapping assumptions when we start to say clinics located in a certain census tract of a high proportion of foreign-born we don't know if the foreign-born folks in that particular geographic area are going to that FQHC clinic so that's major assumption right there and really I wanted to point out that just looking at the FQHC data is really only a piece of the larger puzzle the FQHCs in california serve about eleven percent of our population so you know eleven percent is smaller than the fourteen percent that our HMO serves and of course we have a changing landscape so when marina ran the numbers for the FQHCs in 2013 compared to 2014 already there is a huge difference a lot more clinics we're getting granted funding and so then they're changing changing hands too so what are the next steps we'd like to further explore these administrative data sets as well as others we're trying to work with our médicale which is our form of Medicaid office to see what kind of data we can abstract from them about the current testing practices in the state of California for folks with médicale we'd like to figure out how to validate some of these approaches we are working with our modeling partnership well the modeling partnership as a whole is going to help us have much more robust estimates of latent TB infection for our jurisdictions there's the four state model they're working with California Florida Texas and New York to you know get to this point where we really can have better estimates of lt-vi so what's our denominator who we really going to need to work with and the CDC funded TB epidemiologic studies consortium is planning to our next steps there are to assess current health department TB prevention activities as well as methods to identify private providers with the goal of eventually working interventions with private providers to increase TB prevention activities so a lot of folks contributed to my presentation and most of them from my colleagues at the state and of course San Diego TV program folks recent more Kathy Moser thank you and if I'm out of time i'm going to introduce j
