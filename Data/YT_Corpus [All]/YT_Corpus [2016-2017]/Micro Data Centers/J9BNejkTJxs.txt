 thank you very much for the organizer inviting me it's a really nice location I'm really happy to be here so what I'm gonna talk about today is the vaginal microbiota and what we've been doing over the past few years but before I start I'd just want to give you some some little background not as provocative as as gregor has been but kind of a what I call the the common wisdom about the human vagina so people think that like two bacillus his characteristic of the LTE normal vagina in reproductive age woman and and I hope that this this might be challenged throughout my talk and you'll be able to understand this the the thought is that like two bacillus and other lactic acid producer in in a vagina can fend off the growth of knowledge genus or gain ism and that include pathogen the problems that we don't really know how this is done and that's the big problem is mechanistic it's thought that low pH which is driven by the production of lactate mainly by produced by lactobacillus and other actor Cassie producing bacteria here's actually driving this this mechanism there's all the organic acids that are also produced in the vagina but those are not thought to play actually very good beneficial role a lot of people talk about a Trojan peroxide but that's also a big problem because hydrogen peroxide is mainly the result of the Arabic make metabolism and the vagina is definitely anaerobic and of cuckoo Gregor mentioned bacteria sin which also are produced obviously by lactobacillus and could actually contribute to this protective mechanism so the the vaginal microbiota is actually a very interesting microbiota to study because as opposed to to the other microbiota it has its life as an of its own throughout a woman lifespan at Birth the vagina is is actually sterile but it's rapidly colonized actually by lactobacillus and this is driven by the maternal estrogen that's circulating into a baby girl or baby boy to that matter but in this case a baby girl that that estrogen is going to trigger the maturation of the vaginal epithelium and that maturation comes with the accumulation of glycogen this glycogen becomes a good source of nutrients for lactobacillus and ends the colonization by lactobacillus but after three or four weeks this estrogen is now used up and lactobacillus and it's hard to grow in the period from for three to four weeks to two puberty you can't really see much like two bacillus you mainly see strict and aerobes in the vagina have puberty you have an increased level of estrogen production of estrogen now we have a complete community shift in composition we see like the bacillus coming back and we're gonna get microbiota that's going to be pretty much similar to what you're going to see throughout the reproductive age where a lot of glycogen is metabolized to produce lactic acid and you can think about pregnancy actually as a eiper extragenic state where you can see actually a lot of lactobacillus as well and then at menopause we have the opposite happening again less estrogen less glycogen less lactic acid and a shift a very slow shift where lactobacillus start to disappear and other strict anaerobes are our coming back but what I'm going to talk about today is mainly about women of reproductive age so what is the vaginal microbiota looks like so just to to look at at this I'm gonna describe a study that we've done in an asymptomatic Elfi woman and this is a cross-sectional study and it was a pretty well powered study where we had over 400 women that were asymptomatic and healthy they were represented in four different ethnic background Caucasian black Hispanic and Asian and those women self collected vaginal swab using validated methods they also measure their vaginal pH we collected information that's called their nutrient Gram stain or grams stain score and you just think about it there's an estimate of vaginal community disturbance this is something that's done by Gram stain so it's only morphology so it's a very rough estimate vaginal community disturbance and of course we had a lot of questionnaires involved and we did to mine the composition using this is actually an older study so we use full five full power sequencing of the v1 v2 region of the 16s rRNA gene and I guess that I don't have to go into the methods so what does it look like and here's what we found so I'm just gonna walk you through this this figure what you can see here it's each vertical line represents one woman and so we have four hundred women the colors on this heat map is indicated here so yellow means one of those 25 taxa here is present at very low abundance and red means it's present in very high abundance so clustering those microbiota based on their composition abundance of their different members led us to the identification in this particular study of five major group which we call community state type and those group differ by their microbial composition and abundance what was very interesting is that first of all those cluster were pretty clear as opposed to what you find in a gut which is still actually very the point of many debate the stories if there are any actually state type or Antero type in the gut but here those types were actually very very clear four of those types were actually dominated by one species of lactobacillus we had lactobacillus iners Chris POTUS guesser I or Jensen I which form those four different types and then we had a fifth type which unfortunately is called comunist a type four which lacked very much significant number of lactobacillus and comprised a pretty large diversity of bacteria that were pretty much anaerobes and strict anaerobes so if you do the statistic this you would find it's in pretty much 95% of Elsi women in those ethnic background that we study so one of the thing that with those type of eat map is that you can't really see the relationship between the different groups so if you plot this in three dimension using principal component analysis methods what you can see is that the different state type actually are going to be clustering at the vertices of this tetrahedron shape while this community state type for which likes lactobacillus tend to cluster in the middle of this tea tray drum but what you can see here is what I call the microbiome continuum it appears remember this is cross sectional study each dot here represented woman it appears that this this microbiome of this vaginal microbiota is more than flux than we think you know you can see woman which microbiota is for example here between a state type 1 and state type 3 which is dominated by chris patterson inners meaning that this particular woman here is about 50% of Chris bodice and 50% of a nurse about and so is this a state that this woman has at all time or is that a state and flux for for going for example from a state dominated by Chris poorest and is now dominated by a nurse and so the question that we need to ask is can we can a woman at any time in her life beep be present in this space at in any place in this base so kind of a community dominated by Chris Potter's be one day dominated by dr. Seuss Jensen I and Swan can this community this microbiota navigate throughout this space so what I'd like to to talk about when I think about this I could this the vaginal community space so it's it's the space that a community might be able to enter at any given time so on top of this figure you can actually plot some of the interesting metadata and one of them is this nutrient score that I mentioned and you can see that this community state type 4 is actually very much associated with what we call high nutrient score which is often associated with actual veggie nosis so it's used as a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in researched setting mostly but remember those woman's were completely asymptomatic and otherwise Elsie and you can also see this association was but both with high ningen score and pee so what we see is that this commuter type 4 is a shaded with high notions corn high peach so for us this is the question that becomes very important so how long does this state persist over time so if a woman is in this community state type for how long is she going to be in that state when we start adding time because we feel like and we are policies that this is how frequently the frequency at which a woman is going to enter this type of microbiota is going to be key the frequency and the duration in which a woman is going to stay in that state is going to be important so to study this the only way to do it is by looking at what we call the dynamics of the vaginal microbiota and you have to study to do a longitudinal study and you have to follow a woman over time so the study that we did we enrolled over a hundred and fifty woman and it was a prospective longitudinal study so those ones were enrolled and followed over time and whatever happened happened during this study the woman collected daily self collected mid vaginal swab and they did this for ten weeks every day we also got vaginal pH measurement we got a Gram stain so one of the swab was rolled onto a slide and we collected daily information such as sexual activity and hygiene and so on the woman came back twice after enrollment at which we actually perform a clinical assessment for bacterial vaginosis and any other condition and we did the same study that we did previously this time we use the v1 v3 reagent so little updated on 454 technology and we did this for 50 of the woman because obviously this ought to be some pretty large number of sample to process so I'm just gonna summarize this very briefly we pretty much found three groups of longitudinal pattern the first group represented by those two women looked like this and you'll see you later you this is a woman in red here is like - this is Chris Paris those two spike of of orange here is elective assists a nurse and here's you have time so those two spike you correlate with menses varies nicely here you have lactobacillus iners pretty much Omni dominant during the the ten weeks and a little spike of actually streptococcus during those menses here so we have very stable pattern which are only disturbed what in which the community change only during menses the second type of pattern that we observe could be represented by those two women and those two women here have what you could call somewhat stable pattern over time but one of their highlight is that they either have no elective assists or have very few elective associates and he kidded here by this orange it's a little bit of lactobacillus iners so this woman's we did not detect like the bacillus and this one would detect it a little bit of interest but mainly gone irrelevant Alice was the dominant species here and at the problem Virginie was also the dominant species here so those two woman never reported any symptom never sought medical attention but if they had gone to a doctor looking at their nutrient score they don't have like two whistles they might have been diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and then treated by it with antibiotic but those woman's never sought medical attention and I can guarantee you by looking at their daily activity actually were never really bothered by this by their vaginal microbiota and then the third type of woman that is this kind of patterns which are very erratic patterns we keep changing all the time and alternates from some dominance some of lactobacillus and period where lactobacillus is pretty much absent so three types of patterns some of those woman's and I did not include it in there actually we're diagnosed with spectral vaginosis clinically and were actually treated and but that's for a complete different talk one of the thing that we were interesting is trying to understand what are the factor that drive this variation of stability that we see into those patterns so we modeled what we call the Jensen Shannon divergence index which is if you want is how fast now that we have we can see how this this index change over time so it's if you want it's how stable the community is how fast is changing from one time point to another and this is what you get so the Jensen Shannon is a very nice index because it for us it goes from 0 to 1 it's normalized and you can see that here during the first 5 days of a cycle the the index is very high meaning the community is changing very fast and high index which then tend to become lower mid cycle and then the second minimum about the second the middle of the second part of the cycle and then it comes back up which community become a little more unstable so unstable and stable during the middle of the cycle and one thing that you can do is map on top of that the level of estrogen and progesterone that a woman experienced throughout the menstrual cycle and you can see very nicely that the two minima meaning the community are most stable is when Astra estrogen is at its highest and the second peak with progesterone but one thing that's very interesting is the the this this idea of having this community state type 4 in LT woman what does it really mean we see this quite often I would say in about more than 50% of the woman experience a community type 4 for at least more than 5 days and in our study so what is this community state type 4 and I like to call it an Elsi state that carry risk and this is the reasoning that I use at any given time if you take the study cross-sectional or longitudinal we have 25 percent of women who have this non lactobacillus dominated state this state we know is often associated with high Neutron score and high pH and we know that those two value no matter what how you calculate them have been associated with increased for sexually transmitted infection acquisition and transmission that include HIV and it has also some relevance to preterm birth so a state that might be healthy but might be associated with some risk so those women's are often normal they appear otherwise healthy but they're definitely at this they have an increased risk of those at for adverse outcome so this is our hypothesis we feel that community stability and dynamic meaning the frequency in a duration of this state might actually represent better the risk to disease if you go into that state once every two month this is your window of risk but if you in that state every day of the month your risk is very high as soon as you get exposed to a pathogen you might get infected the chance to get infected if you only there in that state one day a month is is much lower so we think that lowest ability equal low resilience and equal increased risk so really it becomes community ecology so what we need to understand is the molecular basis of this association between stability and susceptibility and this we've done this using some more elaborated omics technology so stability and the community genome so the question we're trying to answer is is there a correlation between the genomic content of some of the species mainly of lactobacillus and the community stability meaning that if good is lactobacillus dominance what is it in that like - bacillus that can actually maintain dominance and being resilient versus some strain might not be able to do this and you might have low stability so we use a metagenomic analysis of microbial community and using a pipeline that we developed you can actually end up with full assembled genome of the main member of that community and perform comparative genome analysis with the known genome in a in a database before I move forward I want to just set up the stage for the that one of the slide that will be coming one of the things that we interested in is obviously the risk of sexually transmitted disease and one of those diseases chlamydia we have an ongoing study where we enroll women who have chlamydia we sample them we treat them and then we see them 3 months later and then every three months for nine month and I just want to show you what does the vaginal microbiota of a woman who has chlamydia look like and what does it look like three months later here's the to study so here you have a group of a hundred woman here when they have active chlamydial infection and here you have them cleared of infection three months later what are the major different difference number one is that if you compare this to LT woman and those humans are mainly african-american in Baltimore so if you compare to the same healthy population first of all we only see two community type community type guy dominated by lactobacillus or this community state type four which are dominated by lactobacillus by donor or vaginal in LT woman we see of you see women who have crispa electrometers Chris Paris activist Jensen I and gasser I as well now cleared of infection three months later the only thing that we notice really is a little bit of increase in in lecto basis Chris Paris which is still less than what you would see in a a never infected population and a much increase of lactobacillus community type three and is small in a decrease of community type for the one that liked lactobacillus iners dominated by Governor LePage in house okay so this stir up our interest for lactobacillus iners it looks like if you can think about those woman's being a subset of the woman and Elfi population that are susceptible to chlamydia if our hypothesis is true those lactobacillus iners here which you can find pretty much in every single one of those women actually might put a woman at risk because that like to visit sinners might not be as resilient as and being able to dominate a community at all time lactobacillus iners is very interesting it has a very large pan genome meaning that every time you're going to sequence a new genome of lactobacillus you're going to discover new genes okay selectable sinners is very diverse so a very interesting genome a very interesting association with chlamydia so let's look at all those genome of lactobacillus iners so here is a study where we picked women where we've seen them several times so some of them are longitudinals collected and you can see women who actually have lactobacillus iners that's associated with Ginola vaginalis so those will be what we call CST four then you have women who are pretty much dominated by lactobacillus iners and you have I think one of them you can see it a little bit here as some like to assist guests right with it and a third one where lactobacillus iners kind of share the the dominance with lactobacillus Jensen are three groups we were able to using metagenomic so this is not a 16s composite based composition heat map this is based on the meta-genome and you can actually reassemble the genome of lactobacillus iners and build a phylogenetic tree and this is where we see so right away by using the the count the the gene and the region there are still shared among all those lactobacillus iners what you can see is that the lactobacillus iners are associated with derivation alice are more similar to one another than the one there are for example shared dominance which led to the sis Jensen I and so on so there is some genetic basis in the association that we see in the composition and the genome of lactose listeners but what's more interesting and like I said those women's the one that we have to all came from community for which we had launched it soon all information is that now we can map the longitudinal stability unto this this map and this is what you see so the first to woman here so I didn't plug the the to sample from the same one because they are same and I'll discuss this in a minute what you can see here is that those two sample came from the community which we're lactobacillus iners is having a hard time dominating it's mostly dominated by in this case at the pogium and gonorrhea and here at the pogium however if you look at those community they come from community where lactobacillus iners is almost always dominant and here in brown is actually elective assist Jensen I'm here is the woman that I showed you earlier that has lactobacillus and inners and streptococcus Viking during menses and then you have this woman six year which pretty much cannot has a very hard time in maintaining dominance so this is high frequency of change and here is pretty much high duration of community stay type for okay so it appears that there is an association between the genetic of lactobacillus iners and the stability that it induce it has in the community so now coming back to those lactobacillus that are coming from women who have lactobacillus iners here's their meta-genome compras is derived composition and you can see that all those samples have like two positioners so they're in colored here are the one that comes from a woman with chlamydia and in black other one from the other woman and some reference genome so you can see that we have lactobacillus iners to associate with karela there are by themself or associated with either Chris pada Sorensen I here and so we were able to repeat this analysis and this is what we found here's a big fallow genetic tree and the first thing that you see is that first of all there's different branches meaning that lactobacillus iners might have different follow genetic origin but the first most important one is the fact that in the circle here are the they are from the chlamydia infected there are chlamydia infected and you can see that those woman those those like to positioners clustered only on three branches of this tree okay on this tree you have in blue here you can see the lactobacillus iners from the study for which we have the longitudinal sample which I've already showed you in black is genomes that come from a gene bank for which pretty much we have no information gene bank it's it's really bad for this so having those blue genome allow us to map on top of this tree now the the stability of the community and this is what we find so you can see now that the genome where chlamydia is associated with has been infected you can see are associated with community there are either pretty much in a constant state of they'll act like to bacillus very often or they have a very high frequency of state of community state type for while those other branches still maintain their trueness if you want to stability as well here sorry as well here this is a lactose of sinners that's associated with Crispus and I'll talked about this in a little while so why is this important so one of the thing that we know now is that there might be some lactobacillus iners the might put women at risk so we'd like to know if those lactobacillus iners and others may be Chris Vadis and so on actually are associated with those was a woman for a long period of time because this is going to be important when we want to start thinking about therapies like probiotic therapy can we actually displace the community to replace it by another strain that might dominate the community so the thing we did remember that first study that I showed you was 400 woman some of those woman's came back and were enrolled and that longitudinal study so we had the opportunity to look at the genome of the lactobacillus of those women which were involved two years prior to the longitudinal study and I'm going to take you very quickly very briefly for those and you can see that we have a genome of lactose black - bacillus gas right that we had prior to the study and after so in 2007 and 2009 those woman's only those two electives genome differ by 43 snips so very stable over time on top of that this genome is also very stable throughout the ten weeks period of study now here is lactose is Jensen I same thing there was only 14 snips separating the genome isolated and that woman in 2007 versus the one in 2009 lactose is Chris POTUS 35 snip separating between genome and lactobacillus iners we had two genome those two of inners we're at 17 and 21 snip while the third one was at 7,000 snips meaning that it is possible to acquire their new strain this is definitely a new strain this is not evolution over two years this is definitely a new strain of lactobacillus iners which is colonizing this one how can that happen and this is when this case study comes up so here's a woman who was dominated by lactobacillus Chris bodice and then experienced about with spectral veggie gnosis and you can see she report vaginal odor and vaginal discharge and then after this is kind of like I've dominated by lactobacillus iners like 2 vs. gasser I and like to possess Chris bodice but then all those different organisms on Arella topo beyond Prophet Allah and so on we did qPCR on sample that were collected prior to this event and after this event and we could not find all the gunnarolla Prophet Allah at the probiem were not found into those sample were found in those sample even after most importantly like the business owners was not found in the sample prior the was found in the sample after so what's this before and after if you look carefully this woman during the entire ten weeks had one sexual intercourse vaginal intercourse unprotected sexual intercourse and that and on top of that this little circle is blue meaning in our coding meaning it's a new partner meaning that this new partner delivered pretty much an inoculum of lactobacillus iners and all the other BV associated organism for this one so meaning that you can have sexual transfer of vaginal microbes so if you can have sexual transfer why not that opens the possibility for truly manipulation of the vaginal microbiota by us administering probiotic so with that I'd like to conclude that just to summarize that we find that the type and abundance of microbes found in a vagina can vary over a short period of time in some women one in others it can be actually very stable the change can often coincide with menses but sometimes do not and we find this actually a very personalized type of change to some extent we also I didn't mention it but sexual activity tends to destabilize the community and I think this this last example was a good example of that genomic content of individual member of the community might actually predict community stability and we have this this hypothesis that commute stability dynamic actually my representa a better risk to disease but most importantly lactobacillus strains appears to be very personalized and if you compare all those strains even the gasps Ryan one woman - gasps Ryan another they are just definitely not the same and they can colonize for long period of time and we can also see that they could be acquisition of novel strain and this is the potential for novel vaginal probiotic and was that I'd like to thank some of the my collaborator at the University of Idaho I've been working with Larry for over 10 years now my group had at IGS some of the clinical group that's been involved in collecting the sample at the University of Maryland and of course the funding through the human microbiome project and other grant from NIH thank you very much please thank you for a very nice talk I have lots of questions but can I ask - maybe yes one of them is already mapped the relationships between the difference L in s you know the different genomes with lactobacillus crossbodies have you mapped that out like similar to the way you did this with innards so the different you you are you present the data on relationship it's been different you know that like the emails is very variable so you're finding lots of snips yeah so what asking is yeah lots of steam across centers but not within overtime but did you look at relationships with lactobacillus squares fathers which so in Chris bodice it's the same thing so it's within a woman it's it's when it stays it's very stable and it evolves very very slowly just a normal rate but you mean in terms of stability of the community and and a nurse and yes not us yeah but then so between the two different types of lactobacilli in terms of co-occurrence and stability over time oh we school currents when a nurse is present you find it in when in community that are dominated by Chris POTUS you find them during menses so you don't see them kind of like Co evolving or COO happening the vagina that much outside those time and I think it's mainly because it's an environment in terms of both nutrients and so on and some of the the the the gene that enters has actually could predict some of this but they don't really compete with in outside the menses my second question was you did not mention how Candida species play into all of this and obviously you mostly looked at the 16s gene didn't pick up on that but have you thought about doing that in your future work because I think Candida species play a very important role in all of these dynamics really nice yeah so we we have all the diagnosis of Candida's candidiasis or candy doses as you say here and and we actually don't see when we have 17 event out of the 160 women that experience yeast infection and we don't really see an association between dynamics or even the type of of community that you have in Candida so you you have you have women that have Candida and that the community is not changing while they experiencing symptom you see like to assist spot is being just unchanged but then you have another woman that has a nurse and things keep changing during during the the yeast infection so it's hard to decipher if the microbiota plays a role in with interact as much with yeast yeast likes low pH and I think the two micro Abbott pretty well there's been some studies that's published that shows there's little relationship between the microbiota and and the event of yeast infection so I don't know if that that would play a role actually not in this study this we haven't looked at at any any Union correlate and this particular City but that's something that's a calling and make I mean this is what we going now and that's what we're doing with our new our study but sample needs to be collected appropriately to do this kind of analysis and you know when we started we didn't really think that way but now we realize how important the immune system is and in driving a lot of them yeah we've done we had only a brief questionnaire at study entry and they are it's it's not very clear you know it's it's it's not the best way I mean we would like to be able to follow this over time but I truly believe that that food is gonna is gonna play play a role what we see is that fat intake tend to be associated more so higher fat intake tend to be associated with community state type four so the more fat in your diet the less lactobacillus you end up yeah you have in the vagina so that's some of the association but it's with you know getting a very gross estimate of what what women eat in general it was not just particularly during this study so some of the women had high latent score right and with the observation that lactobacillus iners as contributing to unstable communities would you recommend clinicians to stop using Newton score is Newton score useful in any way oh so I guess the question is should we continue using Newton score and is it a reliable diagnostic for vegetable businesses so my understanding was Newton score is that it's actually not very much used in clinical practice I mean physician don't take the time to do a Gram stain and and go they do wet mount they're gonna do what it's called Ansel criteria where they going to be looking at odor clue cell pH and discharge and that it's physical thing they can the clinical things the parameters that can actually evaluate and that's what's done in a clinic Nugent scores poorly down it's mainly done in the research and I do believe that Nugent score is not a good estimate obv and I would not recommend using Nugent score to drive diagnosis and antibiotic treatment now the the big question is is you know like I said it's it's a state that's potentially at risk what needs to be done and we've gone treatment by antibiotic and it works well for maybe a month and then it comes back I mean Gregor just showed showed the data 28 days 28 weeks later it was all back we said that within a month women come back to what they were before so there is something else that needs to be done and and so treating they on the basis of Nugent score I don't think it's gonna be a good thing but what to do is the big question yes yes and so we do and I showed you one for example the one that is dominated by gas right so we have some of those women in in every lactobacillus group and and they can have I mean some of them have very intense or frequent sexual activity and there's absolutely no disruptions this disturbance of the community menses just as little blip so those those like the basis for us are obviously very important and we've been characterizing them to potentially see if they could actually be good probiotic to use yeah so what one of our idea is that that association between for example Chris Patterson and the host that last over time even if it doesn't last over time there's something between host and Chris POTUS that started way early at birth and we know that from all the study that it's the mothers that provide the lactobacillus and so the idea is that if you have a Chris bodice that's not able to maintain dominance at all time we should provide you a Chris bodice that is dominant not a gas ride that gives dominance so that this idea of personalized treatment will come by well if you you know group four or no sorry group red let's say we're gonna give you the red probiotic if you could grain you get the green probiotic so but it will require annual exam to be typed and make sure that things are still there it's the right strain and if not you can be complemented so that that's the idea behind this but those needs to be rationally selected and evaluated before they even move into the probiotic
