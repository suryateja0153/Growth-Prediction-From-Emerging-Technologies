 and i'm joined by Kevin Brown from Schneider Electric VP of data center am I gonna do interesting so Kevin we're talking about micro DC today there's a lot of different emerging definitions at the moment how would you define it well it is interesting because my gridania Center is a term it's being used a lot in the industry and it's as typical in this industry that it's not always well understood what it means so we've actually worked to try and help the industry to find what a micro data center is and really ultimately comes down to is a data center that can ship in one box in one enclosure with all of the power and cooling that is necessary to provide for the data center so okay so what would make an organized they should choose up to use micro don't datacenter over the other options there are there it's a great question because Micro data centers are very much an emerging trend so it's not that there's an established use that people have already identified but what we see happening is there's certain challenges that our customers are having and it's really in the under the umbrella of edge computing and that as we have the Internet of Things and as we have more data coming on to the network trying to manage that deal with that becomes really quite unique depending on the application there running so what's happening is that we're seeing people looking for data centers what I call application-specific there in certain application they want to be able to run it and they want to be able to do it in a way that's a very cost-effective and secure and easy to deploy well do you always want to do that of course that's remote fit in that way so over the last six months we've seen the Internet of Things really emerging from just high but there's been a lot of talk over the past few years it's coming up to reality now as a lot of use cases of being implemented it's exciting but how do you think they're prepared for the tsunami of data that's really going to come with that I you know again it comes down to something that really depends on the application you know if you think of big cloud applications you know there's already an infrastructure in place to handle that of course it's still getting built out very quickly but today we can stream video we can get our email we can do all that work so you really have to look in my mind what's more important is where's the new data coming from and your favorite example I like to use is industrial process control which historically has been run on proprietary networks there's always lots of sensors a proprietary network all of that data is now coming on to an IP network which is also going to be connected to the internet so that is what is starting to drive this increased interest and maybe I need some more compute out at the edge in some cases of things that may have already been there but now they're coming on to more standard IT technology and as a result you know they really have to rethink what's their data center strategy it's no longer just well everything's going to go to the cloud or everything will be on premise it's really turning into much more of a conversation of you know where should I be running certain applications and you're going to see very much where they want to call the hybrid mix it's probably going to be personalized for everything he's gonna do that's right it's going to be very much we see companies today really taking a look at what should our strategy be for certain applications and certain applications we treat it differently and some of them want very close to the edge something we'll put into the public cloud and somebody might put into a private cloud that's being hosted in a colocation provider there's really going to be a mix of those and it's going to be very much a conversation around which application makes sense to treat which way right okay so organizations need to rethink how they utilize in a sense but how do you think the data centers need to change you think that they're going to have to adapt to this transformational wave of IT that's coming well David centers always need to adapt to the trance transformational wave of IT and over the but you know what's really interesting here is that we're starting to see a standardization or commoditization of the IT a little bit whether it's converged IT whatever term you want to use but that's also starting to very much blur the lines between the IT and physical infrastructure so the good news in all of this is we're going to be able to start designing data centers that if the application is going to determine what's the IT that I need once I understand the IT I can design a datacenter that's going to fit exactly the requirements of that and it and I hope for the industry that will stop doing some of the bad practices of the past of overbuilding overcapacity we end up with things that are inefficient there's this is really you know your unique opportunity where we're going to be able to get the right size physical infrastructure for that the application needs and that's what I think is going to be a different flavor we're not going to necessarily just have a generic data center platform that I build so that any IT can come in in this evolved emerging area it's going to be very much get me exactly what the requirements are what my availability requirements are what my power requirements are my cooling and have it match and that'll be a little bit different I think than what we've done in the past okay so much more consultative approach basically in case my paper case I think so I mean that's uh you know we're working with customers today and they really are sharing you know here are my problems here's what I'm trying to solve how can you help help me solve it and it's again it's not limited just physical infrastructure in there working with the IT players to and at the end of the day they want to be able to deploy compute on the edge and as we've always been concerned is how do I do that easily and then how do I make sure it's done it's secure and so we've got some unique options now I think available to our customers of the versus what we have in the class okay and what do you see being some of the challenges that might crack up for organizations in terms of bandwidth and storage well I think this is what becomes interesting is it's an age-old conversation that's becoming renewed again and yes is you know it's going to be the trade-off of do I pay for bandwidth or do I pay for physical infrastructure is ultimately what it's going to come down you're in applications that have a lot in a large amount of data it might be possible to run that application in the cloud or right or locally and what's going to drive that decision is what is your bandwidth connection and how much do you pay for it and can you tolerate that cost or is a cheaper to distribute physical infrastructure I'll closer to the edge and let the processing handle it there and lower your bandwidth requirement lower your bandwidth costs so that conversations always been there but I think it's going to be more prevalent and talked about more broadly as you have this large amount of data coming on as we bring all our sensors on to the the Internet of Things it's a it's going to be quite interesting how that plays out
