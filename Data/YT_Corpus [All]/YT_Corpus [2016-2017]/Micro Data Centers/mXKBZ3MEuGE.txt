these are all features of ServiceNow which make ServiceNow totally different from other competitors and that is the reason nowadays days most of the clients customers they are migrating to ServiceNow from different tools versions of ServiceNow now ServiceNow was founded in 2003 but it came up with the different versions which everyone does so it started in you can see we have 2008 summer 2008 and then the main naming convention it started with Aspen then Berlin the category then Dublin Eureka Express Fuji and the current one which was launched on December 2015 there was Geneva version it's it's totally new version as of now I think they have come up with the first release I think first batch so that and they have come up with a new themes new customizations new functions in Geneva so it's totally different so the thing is if you will talk about the versions also of user interface it's totally different for all of them like if you will find Eureka you will find some different kind of user interface if you will find in Fuji you will find some different kind of interface and when they come up with the eg never version they have come up with a different user interface so we have UI 14 UI 15 and the new Iife is 16 now these are all major customers of ServiceNow so currently they are using ServiceNow so you can see we have lot of customers in various sectors like manufacturing and health care utility and energy transportation various sectors in technology financial services retail IT services higher education now ServiceNow architecture so ServiceNow platform as a service is a hundred-person design and developed by internal development staff under the direction of CP o Fred Lodi there is chief product officer and VP of development the David Osmond it is a Java based platform using a tomcat web server and running on Linux generally speaking most customers run on a mais SQL database although some customers are running on oracle microsoft SQL server in Sybase so it is not only running on one kind of database it is running on different kind of database see it's not sure that which customer is on which database the architecture you can see here I have I have shown two types of architecture it's kind of same there is no difference in them but it is just to make you more clear so you can see this is your customer side so for example I'm working in any organization and my company has taken or implemented service now now everything is hosted everything is developed in service now what you are doing you are just using its service they have provided you the link and the website URL and you are directly using those URLs are you applications through that URL so you can see we have load balancer web server databases then you have firewall this is customer firewall and this is the architecture of service now same here so everything database application everything is hosted in service now you are just using that particular application so data center everything is of service now what you are doing you are just typing the URL on your computer on your browser that you are as hitting the data center of ServiceNow and I'm giving you the webpage or the homepage of ServiceNow that's it now ServiceNow integrations ServiceNow is designed to be integrated to virtually any third-party application or data source a variety of techniques are used to achieve third-party integration most notably Web Services JDBC JMS and email this is an industry standard technology that also uses names such as soap and WSDL all of our tables are exposed as a web service document ServiceNow offers more than 50 released and supporting integrations and that's that's really high number for additional information on our external integration capabilities and techniques we can go to ServiceNow integration portal so you can see different kind of integrations and if you want to integrate any application in your service now you can just take a look from there so you're just giving you the kind of a brief like single sign-on CMDB monitoring service user so what kind of applications which can be integrated into ServiceNow like you have Active Directory or LDAP Microsoft SMS ultras then IBM tivoli HP openview operation IBM micro muse net cool right answer so clears is all different tools which can be integrated with your service now how to login to ServiceNow so users can log into ServiceNow with the following link in which instance name is your company name or instance name provided by service law while subscribing for the instance so if you are requesting or you have implemented ServiceNow in your company ServiceNow will give you a name in an instance name to you either you can select it or they will provide you so you can select the name any company like you have XYZ company and you are requesting an instance or implementing ServiceNow in your company what he can do you can just give the name XYZ and with that instance name you can try www X Y Z dot service - now calm when you will press Enter it will ask you or it will show you the welcome screen in which you have to put your username and the password when you hit enter after putting username and the password it will come up with this page and this page depends on the roles so this kind of ServiceNow page you will see over there the final topic here is walk through a ServiceNow application so I will just show you that how we login to the ServiceNow and how we can navigate to different applications and different icons on the ServiceNow so we will start with putting the URL of ServiceNow so what I am going to do I will put my ServiceNow instance 1 1 3 4 9 1 dot servers so this is my instance this is not my company instance this is the personal developer instance provided by ServiceNow free of cost so this is my instance and this is the completely URL when I hit enter it will take me to the home page of the welcome screen of ServiceNow and I'm sorry it's not a home page it's a welcome screen it's asking you for username and password so when I hit a username in the past when I put user name in the password I click on login now it will show me the home page of ServiceNow so this is how ServiceNow looks like and I have logged in as administrator so it's showing me this page so the view of this first page depends on the role of the logged in user if the user is ITL user if user is just like an end user so it totally depends so as I told you we can just navigate through different applications so here is the name which is coming as a logged in user then we have this image you can you can put your company's logo if you want to put any name here you can do that it's global search and then these are all applications let you do service administrator then then you have different applications you have self-service this is edge this is banner this is content frame so we will talk about this later where we do the complete details and what all these things are in service now so this is just a first view of service now and how we log into the service now so thanks for watching this video
