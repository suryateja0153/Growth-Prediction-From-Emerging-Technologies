 oh I'm Frank Palumbo from Cisco I'm here today with Xia's Caravela from ZK research yes how are you great Frank it's great to be here all right hey so we're gonna talk a little a CI and Sdn today and you know because you've been hanging around as Sdn market for a long time what do you think's happening out there in the market that's an interesting time for Sdn there's actually an industry joke that Sdn stands are still done nothing oh and I think it's deserved in the way that the technology's been around about five six years now and it took us a long time to get at this point we're actually seeing deployments and I think what happened early on was the term software-defined got very overused the value prop was literally everything it was gonna solve all world problems I remember and frankly it didn't do that right and but I think what we're seeing now is better best practices right good knowledge of ROI and payback and a good understanding of where to use Sdn and where not to and the value prop it can provide so I'm seeing a lot of proof of concepts today and I think over the next five years we're gonna see those proof of concepts go into betas and then full customer deployments and I think the next five years we're gonna see just thousands of customers move to Sdn we're really over the last five years we've seen just a handful you know some people thought Cisco might have been a tad late to the Sdn market but we are seeing now a huge adoption with our offering around ACI yeah well there's two sides to that coin I think you were weird in other vendors have solutions out before you sure right but I think when I look at what Cisco has done with ACI you tried to develop a solution it's much broader than just network automation and understand this digital era right speed is the new currency of business and all of your data center components need to work together and so addressing just network automation maybe solves a few problems but not the entire data center province so ECI was meant to do that and from what I saw in your last earnings call you guys have crossed the 1,800 customer mark sorre congratulations we're happy and I believe that there is no other vendor that has a number even close to that so I think even though you may have been a little late to the game you caught up very quickly and frankly you became a market leader at a pretty short period of time yeah and we're really talking about production deployments and really bringing this concept of policy to the infrastructure yeah and I'll give you a good example a customer that loved the policy part of it well that's Mantic so if you know semantics they're a huge software company big security vendor and they were looking for a solution that was built on the network that could modernize their data center and allow them to streamline operations and do things just much more efficiently and actually they wanted to bring most operations back in-house which is unusual today because you see so much cloud first sure but they actually used it for that so what they got was a hundred and forty five million dollar pay back in business benefits not bad that wound up being 11 months and so that's a tremendous ROI on a on an IT project and you think in this day and age of every kind of CFO counting every dollar being spent eleven month payback is tremendous yes eighty-seven percent faster application deployment cycles so again in this digital era you want to be able to get solutions up before your competitions I've been able to do that almost 90% faster so not only the payback but also the agility correct yeah network operations was improved by 83% so now in network operations to spend more time doing more strategic things 40 expert improvement in bandwidth and overall a 441 percent ROI that is awesome so Jose you're out there talking to a ton of our customers what do you think the main reasons are they they go with Cisco's ACI solution I think there's a number of reasons why customers look at a CI one of them is that it's a turnkey solution so if you think about IT projects in general I have a general rule of thumb that says if your solution is more complicated in the problem don't do it right and that's that's that's a big problem with a lot of solutions and if with with Sdn if I try and bring together a bunch of components or a bunch of disparate vendors the complexity level is so high that it might take me years to get to the point where I am actually able to use it and get some kind of payback I think the turnkey nature of a CI masks that complexity from the company from the customer and allows them to start enjoying the benefits much faster I think second Asya is a huge ecosystem around it right it is not a Cisco only solution there's a number in fact if you look at the ecosystem it's a veritable who's who and the data center between load balancers storage vendors servers vendor security vendors almost every major data center vendor is an ecosystem partner of subscription together I just kind of seen that fantastic yeah I think third it has a very fast payback I gave you 11 months for semantics but I've seen other case studies as low as four or five months so general in general customers that deploy a CI get a payback in less than 12 months and that's huge in this era of IT also I think the automation capabilities are significant and again customers looking for ways like Symantec to streamline operations the only way you can do that today is automate I know historically automation has caused a lot of concern for customers because you have to trust the system to do it but frankly it's the only way to run IT today is to automate a lot of those day-to-day tasks if your staff is running around having to reconfigure things manually you're never going to be able to keep up in the digital era and lastly I think ACI addresses the needs of the entire data center not just a network not just one layer but the entire data center from Network all the way up to the application and that's why customers like ACI you heard it here from Z is the right technology the right payback the right ecosystem Cisco's ACI the most comprehensive Sdn solution in the industry thanks for listening today and look for more on Cisco com take care
