 well hello everyone and thank you for coming to my session I know I'm sort of the thing between you and an ice cold beer so I appreciate you actually coming to my session this is the introduction to VMware NSX so i'll be going over what NSX is and how it's different and some of the things that some of our customers are doing with the product one of the things I like to do just for my edification is get people to raise the hand it's hard for me to see with the lights but get free blu rays hand how many of you are virtualization guys classify yourself that way right okay how many are networking guys okay some good security guys all right good this is this is a really interesting and great for me I was here four years ago when nasira had just been acquired by VMware and I think I had a room maybe one fourth of the size and a bunch of people had no idea what NSX was and now we're filling up rooms of hundreds and hundreds of people that are networking people coming to vm worlds so this has really been changing over over time you know I'm a networking guy from way back when I started in networking it was big thick yellow cables and vampire taps that you had to sort of Wrangell like an anaconda to get into the walls and so forth so very big changes that have happened in networking over time and this is a really exciting time to be part of networking whether from the virtualization side or from the networking side so hopefully i'll give you guys an understanding of what we're doing here and everybody leaves kind of with a an aha experience about what what it is NSX is so the first slide of course I think it says something about me being a marketing guy therefore you can't believe anything I say but you know forward-looking statements so forth so we're going to talk about going beyond server virtualization all of you are familiar with what we've done in server virtualization and how that's changed the operational model of the server now we're virtualizing the network and this is transforming every industry out there I want to show one slide very quickly that shows a bunch of our customers now we have now I think over a thousand customers probably a couple hundred of them that are in full production mode this is just a sampling of some of them that you might recognize here we've got very large customers like NTT and 18t people like eBay EV has 60,000 VMs running on thousands of virtual networks running on top of NSX our first customers were big service providers who wanted the speed and agility to be able to deliver the services that they deliver in the network but do that in a more software to find way right so those were our first customers and then we moved into global financial so you see people up here like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs and HSBC and ing these are all companies that are using NSX right it moved in from the global financials down into you know more general enterprise customers like Starbucks and columbia sportswear and direct TV and others right that a lot of the use cases they started seeing weren't as much the speed and agility although that became very interesting for them it was security and so the security that's delivered by this new kind of infrastructure became a very attractive initial use case but even as those got attracted those companies got attracted by the security use case they started finding out what you could do from a speed and agility standpoint in the network and they very quickly moved to that use case as well and as you'll see as I go through here there are many use cases of NSX and it just depends on what's most important for you as to how you will justify NSX being put in one thing I'll let me go back because there's one thing I want to mention here because there's there's something in in the in the media yeah the media if you read the magazine to read the articles and so forth it sounds like there's a big fight between VMware and Cisco right the reality is the media loves a fight they love writing about a fight they love creating a fight right this is what gets readers to read things the reality is we love Cisco a lot more than Cisco loves us but we love Cisco because about eighty-five percent of all of our deployments are running on top of cisco gear right we as you'll see as I go through the presentation what we require from the underlying physical network is that it forwards IP packets right we don't care what it is so it can be old cisco gear it can be new cisco gear it can be Arista or brocade or juniper white box networking doesn't matter to us so from that standpoint don't let this belief that you're making a decision of nsx or cisco you certainly can do nsx on top of whatever cisco infrastructure that you have and and we love cisco so i just wanted to make that point early in the conversation so that's not stuck in your head so lots of different reasons that is being driven you all are experiencing these kinds of things in your data center and it's now really time for a new approach a new way of doing some of the things that all of us have been doing for 20 years in terms of the way networks are configured and managed today and that new approach is the ability to virtualize the whole data center construct not just the server and getting the benefits that we got out of server virtualization but now applying this across the data center so that we can become more agile and more efficient and more secure and to do that network virtualization is a key to making all of that happen it's the thing that we have not had in the past so one of the things I want to do is define a soft to find data center because there's a lot of definitions that go around sometimes you'll hear software-defined data center from VMware being like a packaged product that you buy the software-defined data center the reality is this is more of an approach than a product and it's also not Sdn a lot of you hear and read about Sdn sdn is next generation network management right every hardware vendor you talk to has an SDN approach it's software that talks to their hardware software defined networking right what we're doing is network virtualization where in the past you've had services that run in the hardware dedicated vendor specific infrastructure and lots of manual configuration and management what we're doing is moving those services into software distributing those services in software making it so that we can have the operational model of a vm for the entire data center construct leveraging a lot of automated configuration and management so what's left in the physical infrastructure because it doesn't go away right I mean we're not just running on air packets need to flow across physical switches and wires and everything that's in the network but this becomes the physical infrastructure becomes a pool of compute and storage capacity that now in software can be provisioned and re-purposed on demand in a much more flexible way it becomes vendor-independent right it becomes best price performance whatever you want to in your physical infrastructure in this pool of capacity and it actually becomes very much more simplified because you're not reconfiguring the underlying infrastructure anymore it's providing services to what's running in software so if we look at most of your data centers today the traditional enterprise data center what you have is the applications and those applications are bound to these services that are configured and managed in Hardware things like isolation and switching and routing firewalling load balancing all of these are processes that you all go through in terms of configuring those services when you build out an application environment right but if you look at the biggest data centers in the world the most efficient the most agile data centers in the world what they've done is they've moved those services into software in their custom applications in their data center and what this has done is is created an abstraction layer between their applications and the underlying infrastructure so they can choose any compute any storage any networking they want and it gives them the agility and speed and software capability at the software layer and it simplifies makes more stable more reliable and lower costs the underlying infrastructure now this is great but not most of you can do this for one thing you don't have an army of engineers that are developing all those services to put in your applications and to you don't have control of all the applications you're buying applications you can't just add services to the applications so what vmware has done is move those same services into the data center virtualization layer into the hypervisor so now those services are provided to the application without having to modify the application but you now still get you get the same abstraction layer that people like Google and Facebook and Amazon take advantage of to get the agility speed security and capabilities that they have and now you can do that on top of any compute any storage any networking so what this does is it gives us the ability to create the operational model of the vm for the entire data center right so now where I used to just spin up programmatically a vm and snapshot it and move it and delete it and restore it now I can do that for an entire data center construct so this is kind of the strategic thing that's happening the reason that people are moving to NSX is the ability to do this to spin up an entire environment in 45 seconds as opposed to three weeks or a month and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about how that works so if most of you are like a lot of the customers I talked to your here at an introduction to NSX right you're thinking well it sounds good but it sounds like a very big change and I'm not even sure what network virtualization is and it kind of sounds scary right and if you're a networking guy you're sitting there going what the heck are they talking about right so what we want to do is we want to talk about moving from the traditional approach where you are into this more software-defined data center approach so first let's start with the infrastructure that you already have in place every one of you has compute storage and networking capability connecting those things together and as I said this network could be any network it needs to forward IP packets does anybody have a network in their data center that does not forward IP packets okay so we're good there so any network there if you're at this conference your virtualization layer is likely vSphere so vSphere becomes the distributed platform that we allow these services to ride on top of and allow you to create what you can think of as a network hypervisor so just like a server hypervisor give you the ability to create a software container that represented the x86 environment so that an operating system and that Apple patient could run in this software container but you could programmatically create it and move it and delete it and restore it and do all kinds of really cool stuff what we do is give you the ability to create a software container called a virtual network that represents the network environment so layer two switching layer 3 routing firewalling load balancing qos acl's everything that a connected workload expects from the network but now in a software container that i can programmatically create snapshot move delete restore everything that i do with a vm but now for that entire construct and i can create thousands of these logical environments that are completely isolated from each other now it's very difficult to draw in a picture so when I draw it like this it looks like these things are all clustered right together in that part of the data center the reality is these are logical constructs so the workloads that are built into that isolated logical construct could be anywhere in the data center they could be across multiple data centers and still be in this logical container that can be moved that can be snapshot that can be deleted that can be restored and I can apply rule sets to that entire construct and have it operate as a independent construct from everything else now a lot of networking guys will look at this and say that seems pretty cool but in order to do this you have to be able to talk to that underlying infrastructure you have to be able to create VLANs and do a CLS and do firewall rules and do all of the things that we do all day long in the data center today for the network the reality is we don't and the way to think about that is think about a physical network chassis you've got sheet metal box with a backplane and line cards that plug into the back plane nobody goes in configures vlans or acl's or firewall rules on the backplane the back lanes job is to simply move packets from one line card to another line card as fast as possible all of the intelligence about what to do with that packet all the services are actually running on the line card so I decide if I'm going to drop the packet or router or do whatever I'm going to do with it right so now if you think about those services being moved into each one of the hypervisors and the hypervisor becoming like a line card plugged into a very large IP backplane that's essentially what we're doing so now the underlying physical infrastructures job is to simply move packets as fast as possible from any hypervisor to any other hypervisor right because the intelligence about what to do with that packet is now running and the V switch as part of the hypervisor now what that does is it simplifies the underlying physical infrastructure because now I'm not reconfiguring it to add a VLAN or put in an ACL or change the firewall rules are doing all the things that breaks the network a lot of times I mean seventy percent of the troubleshooting that goes on in data centers today isn't because the Cisco switch catches on fire most of them don't right it's because somebody fat fingers a configuration file and now it breaks connectivity and I got to figure out where so when you stop doing that configuration you get rid of a lot of the problems that are happening that you're troubleshooting today a lot of that now you eat the problems but all of that automated configuration goes into software and I can screw up one logical Network and it has absolutely no effect on any of the other logical networks so the way we do this is we move these services right into the hypervisor so things like routing and load balancing and switching and firewall get moved into the hypervisor now a big point I want to make here is don't think about these services as if that's a virtual firewall and a virtual router and a virtual load balancer because that's not what is it's not a service running as a vm this is a distributed system where the function of firewalling is now distributed across all the hypervisors right it's like one big giant firewall and I can do about 20 gigabits of firewalling capacity per hypervisor so if i have a hundred hypervisors what is that I don't know two terabytes of firewalling capability managed as one big firewall but applied at an individual port level all the way across the infrastructure and this you'll see as I talk about the micro segmentation solution how we leverage that capability but we're doing the same thing for routing we're doing the same thing for load balancing in the future we'll do other services like distributed network encryption that will be run in the hypervisor and be able to be applied to the virtual construct so in the end let's take a look at what this sort of looks like this is a quick little video it's v realized automation center back when it was called v cloud automation center but i clicked on a three-tier blueprint see the app tier of the database tier of the web tier clicked on the web tier added two machines hit submit the engineers give me a really useful screen that says that I hit submit and then I go to requests you see that it's in progress on the top line there less than a minute later it's successful okay so what did that do that deployed everything that's in this blue box so this blue box is the software container that I'm talking about it's three layer 2 switches right a layer 3 router that connects them together turning them into later three subnets I've got to work loads on the web tier 1 on the app tier 1 on the database tier all the firewalling rules associated with each one of those vm so that the web tier can talk to the apt here but it can't talk directly to the database tier and the web to your applications workloads can't talk to each other I'm getting to the outside world in this case using that but I could be using static routes or BGP dynamic routes whatever from the edge of this logical environment in the outside world and then deployed all of that on top of the existing physical infrastructure without talking to and reconfiguring it or changing it in any way right now for most enterprise companies and think about it for yourself how long does it take to deliver that for most enterprise companies this takes from three weeks to a month when we first went to ebay it took them 30 days to do this they had processed re-engineered that down to seven days and they were very proud of the seven days because from an industry standard standpoint that was actually really good then we delivered exactly the same thing with exactly the same connectivity in exactly the same security in 45 seconds so they raise our hand and said we have one question why isn't this in production now and soon it was and like I said now they have 60,000 VMs across thousands of virtual networks all over ebay and paypal and everywhere right so this is what people are doing today in terms of speed and agility of delivering network services now we can do this in a bunch of different ways I kind of showed you this second column view realize automation and user predefined but a lot of our customers in fact most of our customers haven't gone even to that stage in terms of self service provisioning of a system they're using more the nsx manager type or maybe using vol eyes automation but it's about IT automating IT so that when the request comes in for the new infrastructure instead of waiting for three weeks or a month to get it done it happens that afternoon and so this answers the questions of all of those shot oit all of that shadow IT that's happening where people say I can go to Amazon and I can spin up an environment this afternoon how come I t can't deliver that to me well today I T is handcuffed they wanted to be able to do that but it's-- handcuffed and can't deliver that because of the processes associated with their underlying physical infrastructure so now you can deliver and give the same sort of business response the same service delivery that an amazon or somebody else can deliver but do it on your own internal infrastructure and then we go to end user custom capability we have lots of customers using OpenStack we're actually NSX is actually the underlying logical infrastructure for the largest OpenStack clouds in the world AT&T ntt Rackspace ebay yahoo all of these guys use nsx as the underlying logical infrastructure on top of all kinds of different physical infrastructures so let me show you a quick two-minute video from a company in the US this is in chicago tribune media but it's it's a really great video and talks about you know his experience of going to nsx with a total of forty two owned or operated broadcast stations across the u.s. Tribune media has become one of the nation's largest independent broadcasters and as it continues to transform its content service and delivery data center security is become priority 1 i've lived the world as CSO chief security officer have also been a CIO and i've been a CTO there's not many things i've gotten excited about where i could have all three hands when i saw in a sex and I you know went to my team everybody kind of had their different viewpoints I'm like you don't understand this isn't a step this is an evolutionary leap in capability around operations around security we needed a platform to absorb SAS applications and we needed to have a platform that would change the security geometry that there was today the answer was pretty simple for us it was VMware with the hypervisor and NSX so we set up a pilot we've put NSX in and the bell went off we can do this in five months we moved 141 apps onto the infrastructure and we had nine help desk calls so guess what it works with it the NSX by phone I can move networks i can move everything's right beginning intact i'm just going to move it so if I have something on my internal cloud and I want to move it to an external club all of my security moves with it and that's awesome i'm here to help the business units and i'm here to keep it secure but you step back a little and you look at literally we've gone from the flintstones to the Jetsons in less than 18 months so pretty exciting I mean 141 applications in five months with nine help desk calls you probably get nine help desk calls a week on the infrastructure today right so this is the kind of thing that you can do here so now let's take a step down that's kind of the overview of what things are let's go a little bit deeper talk about how some of this works so you're all very familiar with having a couple VMs running on a hypervisor and those two VMs need to talk to each other so the package flow through the V switch right this is the first stage of virtual networking there are more workloads connected to virtual ports in all of your data centers then there are physical workloads connected across the world we cross that that that level sometime in 2012 in terms of the number of virtual ports being used versus physical but if I will go and I put one of those VMs on a different subnet now what happens the package flow down they go out across the physical network they go across the oversubscribed core in your three tier architecture hit the core router come back just to talk to the vm that's sitting on next to it now this is increasing more and more this is what we talk about is east-west traffic as application design has gone from you know to web to your app to your database tier now I see a lot more traffic going east-west than coming in and out of the data center north south and every time I have to go from the web tier to the app tier to the database tier I'm doing this and going out across the core in order to move between those packets so we'll talk a little bit more about that later so now let's look at this from a virtual network perspective now I'm going to show the virtual network here as a thing this box that has those routers and switches and so forth in it but a virtual network isn't a thing it doesn't exist any one place it's actually the little green boxes that you see in the hypervisor so think about those little green boxes as later to service layer three service firewall service qos ACLs right and so when I provision a workload I apply those services to the workload that I provision so in this case I'm saying these two workloads are connected to the same logical switch therefore the packets that flow between them are going to do exactly what they do today and use the V switch using the layer to service that first green box but if I now put one of those VMs on another subnet I'm now needing to route between them but with virtual networking what happens is the packet flows through the layer to service and the layer 3 service and with the layer 3 service it gets routed right there in the virtual switch back to that vm so it doesn't go out across the network in order to get that routing service from a physical router right it neone Lee needs to do this and then if I want to spin up another vm somewhere else in the data center across multiple subnets and availability zones even in another data center somewhere and tell that workload to connect to the same logical switch it does and it looks like it's l two adjacent it looks like it's running right next to it in the same hypervisor but now the package flow across the backplane if you will so that I can have this connectivity between these two workloads and I'll talk a little bit more about that as we move forward here so the way this works is you saw me use V realized automation Center as the cloud management platform but this could be open stack or cloudstack or a custom cloud management platform are just using you know python yourself and writing api calls to the controller when you provision the vm you talk a restful api to the controller and the controller pushes down the network services that are associated with that vm now if that vm ever moves vmotion it over onto another hypervisor all the little green boxes move with it so all of its security all of its network acting everything associated with it all the policies associated move with it with no human intervention at all and no modification to the underlying physical infrastructure now when those two VMs talk what happens is the packets leave the vm they go through the network services and let's say for instance that third green box is the firewalling service so based on the policy if that packet the left the vm needs to be dropped it gets dropped right there at the virtual interface it doesn't go across the network and hit some firewall to do this the policy and the ability to do the enforcement is happening right there in the virtual switch once it gets past those services it then gets encapsulated now don't be scared of encapsulation encapsulation only means I'm sticking a header on the packet so that I can fire it across the physical infrastructure to the other hypervisor and then I take that header off and hand the original packet off so the packet that left this VM shows up at that vm right now people like Cisco like to make a big deal about ovx land encapsulation you lose visibility we have been doing encapsulation for a very long time mpls Lisp OTV GRE IPSec on and on and on these are all encapsulation protocols right visibility only became an issue when we had NSX and Cisco wanted something to talk about right so we actually give you better visibility into what's happening in this entire environment then you've ever had before and I encourage you to go down to the booth and ask somebody to show you v realize operations where you can see exactly what the logical network construct looks like and exactly what the physical Network construct underneath that logical infrastructure looks like and you can do Trace flow and say this logical network is going through this specific path in the physical Network we can see both the physical and logical and remember that as you move to something like this you simplify the underlying physical Network you don't change it therefore you don't break it therefore you're not troubleshooting it as much so there's actually some real benefits as you move to to this kind of capability one of the really cool things about network virtualization is the fact that each one of these virtual networks is completely isolated from each other right so this blue and green here could be a multi-tenant environment or this could be my dev and test environment where you see I have overlapping IP addresses so I have the same IP address on a blue workload as I have on a green workload but I can do that across the same physical infrastructure because they're completely isolated from each other so I can move from dev to test to production like that instead of having to change the IP address and do some interesting things that you have to do today right very powerful capability and this isolation is really strong isolation just to give you an example the u.s. army used to go out and when they would build a remote site they would create two physical networks completely air-gapped one for US forces one for coalition forces the problem was if coalition forces need more compute capacity they had no access to the US side of things because it was air gap now what they do is they build one physical infrastructure one pool of capacity and they isolate US forces from coalition forces in logical networks and now either side has capability to get to all of the available capacity that's in the network storage and compute very powerful capability so now let me show you another application of it right so 4dr how many of you are using SRM right or Veeam or anything else right to do kind of active standby today what's happens is you snapshot the vm essentially put its storage in the vm in the sand the sand replicates it over to the recovery site if you have a dr event you recover the vm what's the first thing you got to do that vm change its IP address right because now you're sitting on a new physical infrastructure unless you're stretching l2 and doing OTV and a bunch of complicated stuff this is what you're having to do now let's look at this with nsx so now with nsx i have that vm connected to a logical network i use exactly the same product or technology that i'm using today to rep to snapshot that vm to replicate it across in my sand but at the same time I'm maintaining my controller so that any changes that happen in the nsx controller are replicated over in the recovery controller I may not be using that logical network that's there but it's already there in the recovery site so if i have a dr event i recover that vm click there you go and the network and security that that vm is expecting is already running so it just connects to that Network you don't change the IP address you don't change the security and you can reduce your RTO time by eighty percent so pretty cool little use case of nsx now i've talked a lot about virtual machines and connecting virtual machines together but we also support physical machines right so the way we do that is to different ways one with an x86 gateway and all the next 86 gateway is is a server running some intersex software that you can put multiple nick cards in so i can connect a physical work load directly or i can connect an entire VLAN whoops whoops see an entire VLAN of physical or virtual workloads and basically what the Gateway is doing is putting a header on the packet when it comes into the logical network and taking a header off the packet as they go on it's a layer to bridge right so now when you listen to like Tribune media say moved on 41 applications into the infrastructure over five months got nine help desk calls what he did is connect the VLAN based application environment through a gateway do vMotion move it over into the logical network that's running same address space same everything another use case that uses this is a lot of people are doing a data center move for instance so what's the biggest pain in the butt of a data center move changing all the IP addresses especially if you have workloads or applications who have hard-coded IP addresses because now you're doing regression tests and all kinds of stuff right with nsx you go to the new data center you spin up a logical network you use the same address space as the VLAN that's running in the old data center you connect it through a gateway you move that stuff over and in a weekend you've moved everything over into the new data center so it's a big difference in terms of what happens the other way that we do this is through our top Iraq switch integrations so this is a rest of brocade cumulus Dell HP juniper all of these guys have done the obsd be integration that makes it so that now the controller can map a physical port to a virtual network so now if there's a physical machine connected to that port itself to adjacent to that logical network if you have a VLAN it does the same thing oh by the way I forgot one other see in there but you'll have to ask them about their integration whether they have okay so a lot of you will look like this in terms of your infrastructure typical three-tier cisco nexus 7000 type infrastructure if you've got two VMs running on a blade and they need to route between each other we talked about this earlier right the package flow up across the oversubscribed gore and come back down with nsx we offload that capability we move that into the hypervisor even if you're between that far right column if you're in two different blades I'm only going to use the aggregation portion of the network for those packets to flow between the VMS because i'm doing the routing in the in the hypervisor now one of the things that this does is it actually allows you to extend the life of this infrastructure because one of the things that you're seeing is a lot more east-west traffic and as you get more east-west traffic and that traffic is having the route across the core they're having to invest in more capacity in the core now what most of the customers we're talking to want to do is move to a leaf spine architecture let's say the cisco 9000 architecture right so the last thing you want to do is actually invest a lot more money in the core of the architecture you want to move away from so what we do is we offload that capability and you can bank the money that you would have spent on that other 7000 and spend it on your 9000 infrastructure as you move to a leaf spine architecture as you as you depreciate your 9 your 7000 infrastructure and now this picture is exactly the same picture right except for now the firewalls there so in order to do controls down to each one of the virtual interfaces I'm having to route that traffic out to a firewall now some of you may have put that on the aggregation portion but most of it sitting in the core as well so again you're going and you're putting traffic and capacity across the core we offload that down to the virtual interface so we're doing the firewalling at the virtual interface and this becomes the basis for the micro segmentation use case so let me talk about that a little bit all of you are doing a good job of perimeter defense you have your checkpoint firewalls your Palo Alto Networks firewalls whatever you have on the perimeter that's looking at your north southbound traffic most of you are not doing a very good job at all of controls inside the perimeter and you're not like you're like everybody else nobody's doing anything inside the perimeter because it's become operationally and feasible to do things inside the perimeter for all this east-west traffic now if you look at all the attacks that we've all read about target and home depot and Sony and the US government everybody what happens there is the threat gets inside the perimeter once it's inside the perimeter it can move from server to server to server fairly freely because there are no controls inside the perimeter right so then it starts pumping out data and that's pretty easy to make happen and this is what's common to every single one of the attacks every one of the attacks is different from a hacker code standpoint but every one of them takes advantage of this capability inside everybody's data center now from a security perspective security guys have loved for a long time wanted to do zero trust infrastructure essentially create this honeycomb effect so when the threat gets in it gets contained to a very specific part of the data center but even today people have tried to do this that can still be dozens or hundreds of servers in that particular segment right and it becomes operationally infeasible as you see increased traffic to actually try to do that further down further down especially all the way down to the virtual interface and the reason it becomes operationally and feasible is because the packets leaving this VM it's going across the network and it's being evaluated and enforced at the firewall which means when I provision that vm I had to create the rule and put it in the firewall right and if that vm ever moves i have to update the firewall in many cases and if i delete the vm i should be updating the firewall but you guys all know what happens then right should we delete that firewall rule no why not because my phone might ring right so the leave the rule in there right and then what happens is a few months later a vm spins up it's got the same IP address and now it's blocking everybody's going why doesn't this application work everybody's troubleshooting just to find this rule that was left in the firewall or worse it's allowing access to something that allowing access to and nobody's phone rings on that because nobody knows that it's happened right so this is the problem that we all live with today how do we fix that problem with nsx we make it so that when you provision the vm your provisioning the firewall policy with it right so now the packet leaves the vm boots blau jump through a bunch of them there now at leat now it leaves the vm and it gets enforced right there at the virtual interface so if this vm ever moves all of those rules move with it completely automated no human interaction at all you can't mess this up right and if you delete the vm the rules are gone for that vm and you could have a unique set of rules for every single VM you likely don't because you'll define ok app to your workloads get this and PCI workloads get this right but you have the ability to be unique for every single one of them now one of the things that we do is we kind of move away from the notion of applying this to an IP address right that's kind of old school way of doing so we can define custom groups here group things based on an operating system are a machine name or regulatory requirement or an apt here whatever it might be i can define that name and so now i can say i'm going to deploy something that is a on the it's a production workload on the database tier and it has customer and pci data on it and i've defined what that means and i don't know what its IP address is at all it could be anywhere but because it has those characteristics it's going to have a security policy applied to it and if i decide to change the policy for a regulatory requirement like pci i decide i want to add something else to that policy I change it centrally and anything that has the policy gets updated hey so for example using VDI as an example where I might have some workloads that are running let's say an older operating system like windows 2003 and I don't want things that have a windows 2003 running to be able to access a lot of the things in the day so maybe I'll allow them to get to email so i'll create an unsupported OS group so if I see a workload that spins up that has contacts meaning it's got I know it's got a windows 2003 operating system well then I'm going to create a DMZ around it that only allows it to get to the things that I want a 2003 operating system to be able to get to anything that has a more advanced operating system I'll let get to other things so what we've done is essentially turn that policy the human readable policy that most guys look at and say okay I'm spinning up this what kind of workload what's the policy for that kind of workload okay I need to create a firewall rule that meets that policy and do all this and it that's there's a lot of human interpretation and stuff like that here or what we'd allow you to do is essentially create that policy as a machine-readable document so you've defined what it means to be in the policy for a development work loader at else workload or production workload and so forth so when I say I'm going to do a production workload database to your application type customer data and pci data now when i deploy that it builds the rule set right then and applies it to that vm and now it's tied to that vm wherever it moves and this feeds a log file so i can get the allows denies redirects everything that you're used to getting from a firewall log and that can be consumed by your audit tools so the same audit tools that you use today can be applied to these so for instance in a PCI audit one of the things that happens for PCI audit is you have a firewall that creates a segment in an audit you have to audit all of the workloads that are in the segment that firewall is protecting but once you move that segment that micro segment all the way down to the virtual interface now you only have to audit the workloads that actually have pc i did on because that's what the segment is it's as small as that workload so one thing I want to make clear is I'm not talking about replacing the North southbound physical firewall right that's going to stay in place it's going to be managed at exactly the same i'm also not talking about a virtual firewall i mentioned that before but i want to make sure everybody understands that i'm not talking about putting virtual firewalls all over the place because basically you move from physical firewall doing 100 gigabits per second to a virtual firewall doing one gigabit per second and you don't change the operational model at all you're still having to update all the firewall rules and so forth what I'm talking about is distributed firewalling the verb that actually is now in the platform part of the networking platform right so now I get that automated policy and management as things move around I get distributed enforcement down every virtual interface I get kernel-based performance so 20 gigabits per second per hypervisor that scales out so as I scale out my application environment I'm scaling out my security environment I'm not waiting and saying okay I'm overloading a firewall I need to go buy another firewall and I'm overloading that one I need to buy another one it's part of the infrastructure so I get a lot of questions my clickers there about how that affects the performance of the hypervisor if now the hypervisor is doing all of this you know firewalling and stuff in it what does that do well a vsphere firewall our vsphere hypervisor pushes about 20 gigabits per second of packets without any filtering just the V switch running itself when I turn on filtering when i'm doing filtering i'm getting about 19.7 gigabits per second so very little impact to the actual ability to move packets because essentially the infrastructure to move the pack is already there i'm just doing a little bit of filtering in there and i don't have to do the same kind of filtering that a big firewall is doing remember i'm not looking at all the traffic that's coming off the network and going out of the data center for instance i'm only looking at the ruleset that's applied to the VMS that are running on that hypervisor and i can do 80 thousand connections per second i think there we go 80,000 connections per second right with a hundred rules applied and you could compare that to a typical virtual appliance that's doing about 6,000 connections per second so you can see as I scale this out I've got a huge capacity in terms of firewalling now inside the perimeter so going back to network virtualization this ability to create completely isolated application environments right this is the first step in securing an application environments second step is I can do explicit allow so our firewall and capability is basic firewall in capability source destination port protocol type stuff right not deep packet inspection and you need that kind of deep packet inspection on the perimeter because you're allowing HTTP port 80 and so forth going in and out you need to know what's in that so got to dig a little bit deeper but inside the perimeter you know that your app server should be talking to your data center your database server on this port and protocol and that's it nothing else should be going on there so you can do explicit allow and you can say app tier devices should be talking to database tier devices on this port and protocol and you could eliminate the communication between the app tier devices because they shouldn't be talking to each other at all they're only talking to the database into the web tier workloads right so now you can actually make it so that you eliminate the path that that threat would take to move around the data center but if you want to do deep packet inspection this is where our partners come into play right so people like Palo Alto Networks in point trend micro and Intel security McAfee all of these guys have done integration into the nsx platform so that you can apply their advanced services their next-generation firewall and IPS all the way down to the virtual interface as well right so the way that works and i'll use palo alto networks is an example but all of these work the same right is basically the management console registers with nsx that then pushes down the vm series of their product onto each one of the hypervisors so this is the virtual firewall you go from let's say palo alto networks physical firewall doing 120 gigabits per second now you move to 1.2 gigabits per second in the virtual firewall and so that wouldn't be enough if i was trying to look at all this east-west traffic but when now i make that available on every hypervisor and now when i create the policy i can actually define the policy in panorama and then it gets mapped with our firewall so that it's right here so the policy says for that vm i want to do deep packet inspection so now when the packet leaves that vm the policy steers it into the palo alto networks vm or into the checkpoint vm or into the trend micro vm running there so that i can do those advanced feature sets and let them move and the integration is such that when i define a security group right like i say these are for app to your workloads I share that name so that now in panorama in the management console that group shows up so i can define what the advanced feature said is and it gets applied here and distributed even if that vm moves mid-session it's going to do vMotion and go over there and then it'll start moving the packets into the vm on the other side right so very powerful integrations from all of our partners and i encourage you to go check them out they're all demoing this capability in there boo so when I combine the performance with the automation and all of this stuff i have an operationally feasible way now to do micro segmentation down to the virtual interface all over inside the data center very powerful capability so in the end what you get is the ability to create these isolated application environments apply stateful firewall and capability down to every virtual port that moves around the data center with those VMs put advanced feature sets wherever I think that's necessary and then deploy those anywhere in the data center right across multiple subnets availability zones even between data centers and I could even have for instance my web tier and my database tier running on the same hypervisor but not even able to talk to each other have the application portion running somewhere else in the data center and looking like it's clustered together in the same pod and if anything ever moves nothing changes because all the security all of the networking everything that's associated with that VM and its logical construct moves with it right so this is the power of nsx and there are a lot of use cases i talked about micro segmentation but then you can apply that micro segmentation to VDI workloads you can apply it to mobile devices so for instance are with our AirWatch product for mobile used to be you would have a VPN connection from a mobile and basically everything on the phone could have access to anything on the other side of the VPN right now we can say map this application to those specific verses in the data center and this application to other resources in the data center and not vice versa so you can actually get down to fine-tuning how that works right we'd see people moving very quickly into developer cloud a lot of times after they've done IT automating IT they go a little bit to self service or DevOps where they're using the api's and spinning up their own environments for Devon test multi-tenant infrastructure is very big for a lot of service providers and for larger enterprises who have groups that need to be completely isolated but you might need overlapping IP addresses and things like that disaster recovery we showed real quickly there for an active passive but you can use nsx across an IP connection and a metro ethernet for instance and do active active data centers stretched layer of to without having to do o TV and all of the things that you normally would have to do so you could have things running in multiple data centers looking like they're running in a single data center and then of course hybrid cloud networking is we move to things like vCloud air and if you saw martinez keynote this morning you saw some tech preview for some capabilities that will come in the next year or so where we can basically spin up a workload in any cloud anywhere and have it connected into a logical infrastructure this running in your own data center pretty darn cool stuff right so I encourage you to take take a look at it go take a look at all the partners I mentioned a few of them earlier but all of these guys are integrating into the nsx platform right being able to take advantage of the distribution in the platform the capabilities there to do some really unique things that you've never been able to do before so let's see I think that one more video here from a customer and then just to keep you here I've got a whole box of NSX t-shirts really cool looking t-shirts virtualize your network and so forth up here so the people who were willing to sit up front will probably get to them quickest i don't know how many i have exactly but don't run over everybody also i want to really encourage you to fill out you know the the form the the what you thought of the the presentation the content what you thought of me I'm in competition with some of my you know co-workers I'm my goal is usually I get about twenty percent of the audience to fill that out let's see if we can get that to fifty percent just so that you know at least fill it out I don't say something bad about me but just fill it out okay all right here we go x estar serves the Identity and Access Management verticals for aerospace and defense and life sciences and we also do secure collaboration and supply chain in the cloud for our customers for x estar nsx has been strategic in a number of different ways primarily it allows us to have a lot of control a zero trust model at the network layer network virtualization for us is kind of the Holy Grail in terms of having a portable workload that we can move from one data center to another and do it in a secure model and that has been something that we have not been able to do until we have come across a no-sex we've seen VMware take a great interest in an evolving the product I think even today probably beyond what other competitors can do prior to NSX we like most IT companies you know had a workflow that involved you know physical firewalls a lot of processes and these would spend weeks at times and now with NSX that goes down to hours or minutes at most because of the automation involved because of the virtualization in our control we chose nsx over the competitors such as cisco ACI simply because a market adoption NSX has gained much more momentum in the marketplace and seems to have broader acceptance by the partner ecosystems than the competitors that are coming up NSX has been game-changing because it has a demonstrable reduction in level of effort so when we're reducing our time to deploy by eighty percent that leads to savings that we can deploy folks on other projects my job is to work myself out of the job I want to make my job so easy that I can do other things for x estar and its customers what we're seeing is for disaster recovery the bar is getting higher and higher in terms of the data we're protecting and how fast we can bring it back on line with NSX now what we're able to do is basically take that container always have it in our dr facility and when we need it we can basically at a push of a button bring it online and bring our customers back online so my advice and getting nsx deployed in your environment is to is to start from the bottom up to start with your regular network administrators your regular sis admins it doesn't have to come from management once you start to see the visibility that you get you'll never miss the command line alright one last slide we've got a lot of professional services a lot of people that are out there that can help you do this so I encourage you you can start small NSX is not one of those things that you have to decide I'm REE architecting my data center and ripping everything out this is something that you can put on four or five ten hypervisors see what you can do start showing others bring in the security guys bring in the networking guys let them see what they can do and this is what a lot of customers do and you move very quickly to doing some pretty cool things so thank you very much for your time fill out your forms come grab a t-shirt
