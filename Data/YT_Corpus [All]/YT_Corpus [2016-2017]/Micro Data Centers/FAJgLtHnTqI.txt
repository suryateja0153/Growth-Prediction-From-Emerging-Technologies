 welcome to the engine X armed and ready panel we have some distinguished panelists here so let me go ahead on my I'm laxmi man diem and I run arms server strategy with us we have David Harmon who is a strategic alliance manager for amd's server business unit and he's responsible for providing AMD technical and marketing leadership for the enablement of x86 and arm software ecosystems during David's 20 years of experience in enterprise class computing he has held leadership positions in both engineering and solution architects roles next we have Kumar Shankaran associate vice president of software and platform engineering he's responsible for software architecture development and platform engineering for the x-gene and x we family of products from applied micro he also handles the software ecosystem development and promotion within the arm community he's been a member of linaro Enterprise Group and he has a Bachelor of engineering degree in electronics engineering and a Master of Science in computer science and an MBA degree in marketing finance that's two more degrees than me but anyway we also have shade Galan he's the principal engineer at cavium prior to cavium che was at embassy was embassies director of software engineering and leader of the embassy technology center responsible for the creation of many industry standards he's had several roles in the microprocessor in industry including performance and analysts at pmc-sierra where shay has influenced the design of new processors and a variety of other places che holds a CS bachelor's degree from technion-israel institute of technology so thank you for joining us this morning so what we'd like to do for the format of this panel is each of us will give you a bit of background about our companies and what we're working on and then we will have some questions and we'll throw it open to the audience so with that so many of you have actually come up to us in the course of this event and asked us arm what are you guys doing here what's what's the connection well actually they're the face of computing has kind of been changing slowly but steadily and is definitely accelerated over the past five to seven years arm has is well known for our presence in the mobile and consumer space and we're starting to see that our products are actually delivering performance levels and are able to address a broad set of market applications in the infrastructure space as well in networking and server applications so the business model for arm is we are actually the global leader of semiconductor IP development so our partners that you see here today actually licensed our technology and develop chips and systems that go out into the marketplace and some things that you may not know about on there are over 1300 licenses and every year we license a hundred additional customers there are more than 400 companies that have licensed our technology and last year alone we shipped 12 billion with abbie processors and over the life of the company which is now around 25 years we've shipped around 60 billion again with abbie processors so over the course of the time the arm product has actually evolved we started out with 32-bit microprocessors and we now have a large number of 64-bit micro processors that are addressing applications as diverse as mobile phones all the way to servers and hence our push to come and talk to you today so the arm server ecosystem has actually been evolving for the past four or five years and more recently there's been a focus on 64-bit platforms coming to the market to address the kinds of applications and performance points that are needed in enterprise applications and so this is an example of some of the ecosystem partners that we have working on arm so I kind of built this diagram as a stack because you need many components to make a very vibrant ecosystem so from a semiconductor perspective we have partners like AMD applied micro and cavium that are actually starting to ship to a broader set of customers we also have partners like Broadcom marvel Qualcomm's announced so there's a rich ecosystem of soc partners who are going to be bringing hardware solutions to the market we have also made a lot of progress in terms of having a number of OEMs that are starting to offer platforms and actually if you walk over to our booth when you have time later on today you'll see that we have platforms from all of the partners sitting on stage here and and some of the the well recognized names in the industries are starting to offer platforms as well but most of you here probably being software developers care about the software ecosystem so one of the key things that we've always focused on is open source and so we have from the get-go said that the arms server applications would be well-suited for open source applications in web storage networking and actually one of the reasons that we here today is we see a great benefit of the engine X ecosystem and the RM ecosystem working together to deliver real value to end customers and so we have a vibrant support for Linux from ubuntu suzay and of course Red Hat as well as well as some of the open source communities should you choose to take stuff directly from them we're also sure we also have seen a lot of the applications that we list here running well on arm-based servers and delivering significant value whether it be in performance per watt per dollar per cubic foot all important metrics for end-users and we have a number of end users that are going to be deploying based on arm servers so with that I'm going to turn it over to David who's going to give us a bit of a background on what AMD's doing with arm all right welcome thank you for joining us today as you can see you know AMD is a rich history and server with a x86 market first to market with a 64-bit and that platform we're doing the same thing with AMD opteron in 64-bit ARM we've got the a 1100 series which is our first arm offering AMD's really focused on the enterprise aspect of things associated with arm we're you know it's it's all about choice and sense of different architectures different opportunities require different solutions and so this offering here is really designed around you know lower total cost of ownership really open ecosystem industry standards with an experienced server you know with excuse me sir server vendor we pride ourselves on really being open source friendly and you can I spent this week here at linaro connect and really doing a significant amount of work associated with enabling this platform for the open source community and the as lecture you mentioned the different OS vendors that we have out there there's a good handful of high quality os's that are currently available and running on this platform as of today so the current offering that we've got just available as of today is the AMD 1100 opteron on a soft iron platform this is a development platform yet its enterprise class I mean it's a development as an intro to really understand what you can do with arm in the data center AMD's design was really focused around you know making a transition as seamless as possible from an existing environment that everybody knows and loves in the x86 environment but offering a choice with an ARM architecture so this is just a it's a 1u rack system very quite quite impressive for what its able to do with the four to eight core different options to 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports sata3 ports sports pcie gen3 with up to 16 gig oh you know it 16 gig of memory that is installed and like I said these are available at this point in time so we if there's an interest in arm and your kind of kicking the tires is an officer awesome platform to kind of really check out and test on I recommend you take a look thank you thanks David so moving to the next person in line here so my name is Kumar ran from applied micro and applied micro specializes in the x-gene family of armed 64-bit processors and we have been in the market for several years working with our in promoting arm servers for the data center market and we think there's a long huge market here in the next few years and we are out there to to capture some of it so what we've been doing here is making multi-core arms 64-bit CPUs what we call server on ship we like to call it server on chip rather than system on chip the reason is majority of the features that servers need today in terms of interfaces PCIe sad are networking and are all embedded within one single die and that's the same offering from md or cavium or all my colleagues you're sitting here we are all trying to do the same thing we just build us a server on chip so what we feature with x-gene is multi-core 64-bit CPU is depending on the product that you're looking at your multiple skews and each of them is a multi-core CPU with the typically a three level hierarchy of caches so we have l1 l2 l3 cache is very similar to Intel or anybody else in the in the data center market segments out of order execution hardware virtualization and coherence networks for SMP or Linux smps very critical in the data center which is supported in the architecture so I will touch on the hardware side briefly and then for all the software guys will dive into why engine X is important here and what we're doing to improve the engine X performance and on servers which is very important for us on the connectivity side all these CPUs feature multiple PCIe or SATA USB 3 dot 0 mainly for booting and integrated 1gb or 10 GBE going forward it will expand to 40 gb e 200 gb and you arts low-speed peripherals i squared C spy mdio gpio these are pretty standard offerings and our products these days on the memory subsystem ddr3 ddr4 channels a very important requirement on boot power management so arm has architected this body called SBB are and that and enforces some compliance amongst all the vendors that are literally sitting here on this table and all the other arm vendors out there so we comply with those standards in terms of boot loaders like UEFI and a CPI for power management and even booting now moving to others production servers that are available today David talked about some of the systems from md these are some other systems that are available in production today so the first board that you see on the left is the applied micro Mustang or XC one platform available widely as features aren't 64-bit CPU is in a multi-core environment the HP moonshot m400 platform in the middle is a HP product in production today so you can actually order this from their website and the last one is the gigabyte MP 30 platform it's a motherboard based on an arm 64-bit architecture from applied micro x-gene very similar to an intel motherboard that you see out there we can buy from any vendor moving to the software ecosystem as i'll actually mentioned so some of the OSS vendors that support engineer today in production are Fedora 22 Elsa which is red hat enterprise linux for arm servers so the one version that is out there today seven dot one cent OS 7 dot one which is based on Reza 7 dot one and then lastly 12 1404 LTS which has been out there for over a year so all these support engine X in production and commercially supported today so very good progress for the engine X community and getting these into these production distros so moving on I just wanted to touch on some important oh that's all okay so some important performance that we have when we run engine X on x-gene so the two charts here it might be difficult to read this chart but I'll maybe walk you through this the red line is the engine X performance in the blue line is the Apache performance so we compared engine X performance with Apache running on X gene in pretty much an identical configuration while running a web server benchmark called work so we ran the benchmark measure the performance with varying data sizes so what you see on the x-axis is the data size and bites or kilobytes going from 1 K 2 64 K which is typical when you do a web server and then on the Left chart on the y-axis is requests per second so on the Left chart the higher the bearers if you see higher number the better is another right chart is TB 90 latency which is the latency for ninety percent of the requests to be serviced by the web server within a particular period of time so on the y-axis is the time in milliseconds the latency and the x-axis is again the data size so you can kind of see if you look at this chart one by one the engine X performs significantly better yep I'm sorry what it's the blue line is Apache so watch a web server so the blue line is a the Apache web server the red line apologized for the formatting here so the red line is engine X the blue line is a project and so the Apache web server is to dot for dot seven as you see there and the engine X is version is one dot for at six so yeah we don't yeah we need we don't we don't have those those data here but it's a very you mean you're talking about arm engine X on our own versus any other architecture right true yeah yeah the question the question then will be the question the question here is is there any performance data comparing engine X on arm versus engine X on any other architecture the answer is yes we do have a lot of data that we are not showing here today so what we're trying to address here today is to just show the maturity of engine X on arm versus apache on our so that's what we're trying to show you okay so so anyway so to conclude the whole idea here is that engine X performs provides about 2x greater performance and have the latency so with that yeah Alejandra or two touche on from cabin hello my name is chai I work for cavium and specifically I work on a product called Thunder X this is a product by cavium a processor an ARM processor with up to eight forty eight cores so this is something we believe in that if you take a processor and targeted at specific workloads you can do a lot better than processor which is aimed at any possible workload in particular the Thunder axe family is aimed at data center type workloads engine X would be a perfect example where it's a web server or a load balancer and the question is what do you need in order to make something like that work and work well well obviously it needs a processor to the processing but as was pointed out you also need maybe a network interface pcie you'd like all that to be in one package something that John has brought up in the previous talk if any of you have been here is that the secure web is really important so it could be really useful if that processor also had the capability to offload the security processing part whether it's for establishing connections or for compression or four for encryption and decryption so this the Thunder axe family gives you the ability to do all that in one processor offload whatever is needed and you don't need another chipset in addition to that another thing that may be interesting is that we've divided the Thunder axe family into different SKUs depending on what kind of workloads you believe you'll have to do so for example the Thunder axe st school looks at storage and for storage you might need more channels to work with more disks the Thunder axe SC skew looks at the secure web where you want to do you want to be able to establish lots of secure connections so depending on your on what you need we have devices that are capable of answering that need in particular again talking about engine X and the secure web you want to know that you have the capability to scale up in performance so the Thunder axe can do from four cores up to forty eight cores in woonsocket and we have dual socket systems as well available all the encryption is integrated and we have actual if you look at this slide it has invented my tack gigabyte asus penguins computing system we when of those vendors are our building systems and you can go and get a fun direct system that you can put in iraq and immediately work with it you can install Ubuntu go sudo apt-get install engine X and you're up and running with engine X if you have engine X plus obviously you get all the features that come to that come with that how do you use the secure capabilities in this processor if you're using openssl all you need to do is in the engine X config file say SSL engine cavium bang you how you're connected to the kvm acceleration and that's basically the idea is to have a single solution targeting specific workload in this case engine X and make it easy to work with install manage and it's all built an arm so with that I thought we would perhaps have some questions to start off the conversation of course all of you are welcome to ask questions as well so one of the things that all of these three companies bring is a vast experience in different spheres whether it be in networking or servers or or other areas and this is the kind of innovation that's being coupled with with with the server solution to bring some differentiating solutions so I guess I'll throw it to all three of you may be starting with with Kumar what are some of the innovative solutions that people can do with some of the soc features that you guys have integrated into some of your applications yeah so in terms of integration for data centers we feel it's very critical for any SOC bender to provide the majority of the interfaces that are primarily used right so those would be things like integrated 10gbe integrated PCIe or lots of eccie and also integrated set up right so with integrated features let me just take the example of 10gbe for instance so you can have variety of applications like acceleration of NF v network function virtualization as she mentioned a secure SSL is another application that can be accelerated as ODB in the community that is getting very prevalent for arm architecture for accelerating both crypto as well as networking performance so yeah variety of applications can be accelerated by using these buildin accelerators that are there in these associés great anyone else I you know i'd have to say just the overall you know standards and ecosystem enabled that amd's done is really around the transition and usability of the platform so the you know the basic requirements like tomorrow mention of the ethernet it's there pci es there as the maturity of this platform continues to grow from the OS level up to the driver stack up to the solution stack and just the the seamless migration from different architecture choices depending upon the workload that you're looking to target at this platform yes about elevation I think something that the arm ecosystem helps with is easing the innovation so Thunder X has 48 cores and they all run seamlessly and run ubuntu all the services and jennex and you can bring it up very easily the ecosystem that's there to for support of AR x64 I think was very key enabling that innovation yes it's quite interesting one of our I think everyone on the panel knows him but one of our great technology colleagues John masters has been known to say that arm servers are boring and some of the times people at arm nor like what do you mean they're boring well they're boring because everything just works on it and it's easy to integrate and deploy at least that's what we've heard from several end users so for some of the developers that are here that are looking to start developing on ARM based platforms you know what are some of the avenues that they could pursue to make that happen I guess we'll start with since you're holding the mic sure actually it's a great question we've recently announced a partnership with OVH which is the biggest cloud provider in Europe and you can go to the OVH sign up for the Thunder xlab and fire up vm on on the Thunder axe and with 248 16 cores just choose your flavor bring up a vm and you can start playing with it very easy you know i would say target whatever your solution is and really you know throw it throw it in any one of us to you know identify that you know ultimate solution with arm as we as we progress with this ecosystem we want to see you know what the end users really going to do and the cloud environment for spinning up VMs well we've done that with some of our NDA partners at this point in time and as we release more hardware we're looking to do that as well but I it's an awesome solution to be able to do that there I they recommend just sorry David just to add I shouldn't be doing this but I'm going to do it anyway you guys just announced a developer platform and we actually have that in the booth here and people can pick up information on how to order those as yes exactly and to add to what both gentlemen you're set so we applied micro we have a partnership with data center so that's a data center company based in the UK so you can exactly do the same thing Lee's out a cluster or lease out a vm they run OpenStack on top of our XG narka tech chure so you can lease out a vm pretty much download ubuntu on their run ubuntu or reza or sent to us on that vm and and as just do apt-get install an engine X and you're done it's that simple so we have made at that boring which is important but any questions from the audience sure okay let me let me repeat the question for those who didn't hear I think the question was for quite some time cavium was using MIPS cores and why did they move over to arm so cavium also continues to develop a mips paste of the octagon family we didn't switch we just use whatever the best for the particular target were targeting at the arm ecosystem is very strong and with meeps being acquired by imagination I think the company felt that it was wise to diversify any other questions ok so how easy is it to deploy and manage arm based solutions in an existing environment sure there's a lot of cloud infrastructure on managing and deploying x86 based systems and we found that the arm echo system makes it really easy to do that on arm we've had to do we've had to get in touch with a variety of companies like engine X like Ubuntu the canonical or Red Hat foundation but once we made those connections there was very little that was needed in order to enable exactly the same management stack as used with your current solutions to work on the Thunder X platforms which is arm-based just to kind of add to that the RM ecosystem actually created the server based system architecture where it supports existing standards like UEFI and a CPI to enable that kind of standardization and ease of management on the AMD front you know it's it's no different than an AMD x86 server hey you know it's the specs might be a little bit different obviously from the core count perspective overall features or an ISA instructions but it's simply it's simply the same I mean it's just literally you're racking it ipmi functions bios aspects of everything of how it's how is deployed and enabled so it's just roll it in and and kick the tires yeah just last lasting was it's the consistency is critical so we try to make sure that that change that you have is kind of minimal or next to zero right so that's what we aim for and all arm servers due to the standardization as Lakshmi mentioned of a CPI UEFI boot process and all architecture of management itself we made it pretty much identical between the traditional infrastructure of x86 versus on servers and it applies for all the our vendors and there are actually a few partners that have already deployed that where they've deployed arm servers within their existing infrastructure and there to manage migrate to whatever they need to do in that environment sorry David no worries one other comment too at John masters obviously from Red Hat is has been instrumental in the SBS a you know pushing the the standards aspect and he's right i mean trying to make server or keeping server boring and then it rolls in its usability as is standard everything as as as defined just works and you know it the boring aspect of what we're doing from an ecosystem perspective behind the covers behind you know all the work that's being done from linaro from the partners up here it's let it's it's it's exciting to see i mean so as as all the excitement behind the scenes it is it is creating some boring infrastructure that just works just one thing i wanted to add was so at the Red Hat to summit last year John masters he had done a site-by-site real installation of rel on an AMD x86 cluster with an egg applied micro x-gene cluster side by side there are 12 notes and the installation of rel was pretty much identical the kickstart process the installation the Installer the pixie pixie server was identical between the two server so there's no difference at all and even the boot time was identical and actually bring up a good point because I think at the OpenStack summit in May I believe I think Mark Shuttleworth from canonical demonstrated orchestration using OpenStack for both x86 and arm together and in fact from an ubuntu perspective they certainly have support from as in juju and other orchestrations tools that allow you to easily deploy and manage these servers that's correct yeah so at the ocp mark shuttleworth is the CEO of canonical so company that owns 12 so exactly what the Lakshmi said he demonstrated the identical functionality of OpenStack on ubuntu on arm versus x86 so kind of for any questions before I ask the okay so one of the interesting trends that we're seeing in some of the disruption we're seeing is around converged infrastructure right where we're seeing applications in the telco space like sdn and NFV come to bear and also we're seeing you know software-defined whatever whether it's server storage or networking and our belief is that the arm ecosystem because of our heritage in those spaces and some of the unique functionality that the variety of partners can bring can offer some significant benefits over just taking a vanilla approach to solving all problems and so with that I'm going to throw it over to shy so can you talk a little bit about some of the how some of those aspects in terms of what the arm partnership can bring can can can deliver value to end users okay so here maybe I'll talk about a little bit of a challenge we when we started looking at these services we found that the industry has spent a lot of time optimizing these on x86 servers and while you work on the arm ecosystem everything just works still it's not maybe as optimal as it could be a lot of these services have for example x86 assembly code in them and not the not the same forearm so we actually had to go in and say oh if you want to do this and do this well you also have to have a little bit of code that's arm specific or Thunder egg specific and we're working with the partners to upstream those so it's part of your normal you prison let's say you have a cluster and you have an ansible playbook to provision that faster with everything that's needed how to make sure that you get optimal performance out of that cluster I guess I was also trying to get to some of the innovative things like the heterogeneous processing elements that you're bringing into play which can actually deliver significant performance when you look at end applications so that I sort of touched on that before what we've done is make sure that the only thing you need to do is for example if you look at offloading compression or offloading encryption or sender session establishment the only thing you need to do in your configuration file just redirect to the correct device driver so you go ssl engine cavium on an engine X configuration you immediately get to that you turn compression on gzip on you immediately get to the offload 44 cavium it's not any you don't do anything you don't have to do anything special to take advantage of these or devices yeah I mean I hate to reiterate the point but it's it's you know as the converged you know moving from transitioning from either an extra using environment or to the arm environment it's it's it's simply just working there and so it's you know it's it's mildly you know it's mildly difficult and as you transition over from a converged environment or into a conversion environment it's it's it's works it just simply works yeah what I wanted to say is I think arm here has played a very critical role in promotion of the ecosystem itself arm as a company and the overall open sores ecosystem and linaro right so these two companies are joined together in defining standards that would get the best optimal performance from arm servers right as i mentioned things work but you wanted to work in a manner that's optimized for that particular target application right so things that i mentioned before like ODP for instance that's an organization that or a standard that's being promoted by both armed and linaro and dpd k for people who have been using dbdg on x86 they're very used to DVD k right so the resistance to change is high so we are again working within our own arm to have DVD version of DVD k forearm that'll look exactly identical to the x86 yeah i think the arm arm and linaro have played a very important role and the ecosystem maturity so i guess we have time for one last question because I think we are down to like three or five minutes so with that I'll say what specifically are you seeing as being an advantage of working with engine X what are some of the benefits that you guys are working on with with engine X to make it you know really offer a compelling suit solution to end users I'll start with with tomorrow so from the engineer's perspective for applied micro that's been very important to get engine X working the primary reason is engine X the performance of engine X right the speed and the latency of engine X is critical in majority of the applications we target our servers for right so latency is critical so in financial applications with other arm servers are being positioned latency is very critical and so what we envision and genetics is at this point in time we we think the front end servers application servers we're very high performance and latency is a critical thing or speed as a critical factor engine X is very important to view that's the reason you saw in my slides that we have done a lot of work with engine X an Apache and comparing them sort of side by side in a variety of market segments we go after so yeah engine X is a pretty important factor for us for data center penetration now web service for AMD for this specific for the AMD 1100 opteron is is a key target for sure and in genetics running on that and high optimization is critical for us we've just with our recent announcement with our soft iron release with that platform we've just started working with engine X and finding that we can do a lot of different optimizations and looking to provide some potential benchmarks to the community based upon what we find there so engine X is relatively thin as a code base which makes it easy for us to take a look at what's there and make sure it's optimal for our platform or if not it's easy to work with and next engineers and upstream whatever is needed to make it optimal does that I think so I think just from from my perspective from the arm perspective we've been working with engine X it's been it's been a great relationship for us and we see actually a lot of end users who are interested in deploying on engine X with arm and again the the the value proposition that the partners bring in terms of specialized functionality in terms of lower power will actually enable end-users to experience better performance per watt per dollar in terms of applications like these web tier of applications that that engine X specializes in so if you have any questions feel free to come up and chat with us we'd be more than happy to do that over lunch at the food truck but thank you very much for attending and delaying your lunch to listen to our speech so thanks a lot
