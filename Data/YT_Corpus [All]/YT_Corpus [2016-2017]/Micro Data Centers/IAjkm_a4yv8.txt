 the National Center for Environmental Health protects you from harmful exposures in the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat and the world that sustains us we do this by investigating relationships between environmental factors such as hazardous chemicals and radiation and health and using this information valve guidance in order to minimize or reduce these harmful exposures to fulfill this mission we work with local estate partners by developing guidance that's evidence-based and providing technical expertise in this video you will hear about some of the important work we do here at the National Center for Environmental Health while monitoring is the measurement of environmental chemicals in human specimens like in blood or in urine and it's especially valuable because it integrates all the exposures that people have to different environmental chemicals if it comes from air or water or soil food wherever it comes from once it gets into the body we actually measure what gets into the body the level that gets in the body is probably the most health relevant level so that's the level we're most concerned with when we're trying to protect the public's health in our laboratory we have lots of bio monitoring measurements we can measure over 350 chemicals in blood or serum or urine and these range from things like lead cadmium and arsenic mercury to all sorts of pesticides to persistent organic pollutants like dioxins and furans and PCBs to polychlorinated biphenyls to a whole lot of different compounds that we're exposed to an environment today for which we want to make sure people are protected from harmful exposures all Americans have a right to clean water one of the things that we have here at the National Center for Environmental Health is a program called safe watch saved water for Community Health and what that is is a program where we help state health department's improve their environmental health programs and talk about drinking water how do we improve those drinking water systems here in the United States and make them healthier and safe to drink one of the things that can happen when people get water from a huge water body sources is that they're subject to whatever is going on in that water body and Lake Erie over the last couple of decades has been subject to very extensive Microcystis blooms and it produces a toxin called micro system if you're exposed to micro system in large doses it can cause liver problems and kidney problems what happened in Toledo was that they were drawing water from an area that had an extensive bloom and when they treated the drinking water it did not get rid of all of the toxins so there were very very small amounts of the toxin left in the drinking water in the community CDC had a big response in terms of helping them get enough drinking water to the community and we also helped with issues like whether or not a hospital could use water they had my persistent in it whether or not children should be playing in the water whether restaurants could use the water to cook food so there was a lot of different things that we were providing technical assistance with CDC's climate and health program is tasked with preparing the US public healthy infrastructure for the health consequences of climate change we do this in numerous ways we develop the science to assess how climate change will impact health we also work with our partners to identify regional threats that they might be experiencing within their jurisdiction we help them understand how those threats might play within their within their area identify vulnerable populations and understand how patterns of disease or disease epidemiology change into the future as a result of climate change environmental Public Health tracking I tend to think of as Public Health surveillance supersized is the ongoing collection integration management analysis and dissemination of data on health on environmental conditions and on exposures it encompasses the people have both at CDC and at the state and local levels who are engaged in the program it encompasses the resources to make things happen and it encompasses the national environmental Public Health tracking network which is really the cornerstone of the program we have made tremendous strides in the area of childhood lead poisoning prevention so what we do here is a lot of childhood lead poisoning surveillance we work with state and local health departments to make sure that they are collecting data screening their children and collecting the information they need to really find those children that are at high risk we call that primary prevention we do a lot of secondary prevention where we fund state and local health departments to have a childhood lead poisoning prevention program this year we were able to fund 29 States five local big cities and the District of Columbia the national center for environmental health is on the frontlines of protecting the public's health we work a thousands of dedicated local and state health department officials in order to implement programs to promote health to prepare for and respond to emergencies to achieve our vision of healthy people in healthy environments you
