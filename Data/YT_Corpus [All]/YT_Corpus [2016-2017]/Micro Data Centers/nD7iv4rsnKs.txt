 so here with the open EPC so who are you so I'm Turkish fingers and I'm a co-founder and CTO of the spin-off company of a pink Research Institute in Germany and what are you shy here yeah poor Network on a simple Raspberry Pi so we're thinking everything that big operators are having in big data centers and we're showing that actually we can have it on a very efficient platform and yeah power it over USB in practice so you what is it that you have that's like a LTE broadcasting solution or what is it yes it's actually you can establish a small mobile network on remote islands or for public safety purposes and so on and here is the whole mobile enter here we have the base station so here's the LTE base stations it was over 2g 3G and Wi-Fi base station this basically connects you phone that is inside of this fair light box and we close up so we don't even on mobile networks inside there actually we have a standard galaxy s4 device and yeah we're just putting it outside of the box no we have real empty radio where's the network's here and this is another Raspberry Pi actually that just shows us what happens inside the box what's inside stays isolated so the Raspberry Pi is an armed 11 CPU right is not even a very high performance it's actually an armed seven I'm seven so yeah no actually it's it's really really low power and everything and how do you make it work so you should software efficient software efficient Linux off you rewrite everything or use the same software that's used on big machines exactly so we took a team of ten researchers and we gave them a challenge and I did was typically a big letter if equipment providers would do with hundreds of engineers so what is open ap EPC is the entire platform the entire software platform so jopen is open source no it's unfortunate that the source but we do license the source code customers have all the functional enemies we have in the normal network in this demo we are using just acting but it's capable also parties in future my point and has the latest sort of 5g core network features so who you customers our customers are the special purposes guys so Public Safety in IOT me operators that need something really different from the from the standard equipment for what the standard equipment providers would provide so what do you think about arm the ecosystem oh it's great I mean you know we're typically running this on a cloud platform but to be able to go down in such a very low platform when to demonstrate that even such a very very small and USB powered device can provide 10 to 15 megabits per second it's just awesome so you could optimize for any of these arm networking solutions coming out 64-bit yeah stuff like that right well with that are you working on this tens of gigabit per second and the wire speed performance this is really just power efficiency at its best just a demo right yeah it's just a power ship power efficiency at its best and it's basically let me just turn it on a little bit so that actually it will attach the network so this goes into the direction of creating mobile mobile networks because we can bundle the core network with the cell and put it for example in every vehicles and so on so for this disaster relief this will be an ideal and cost efficient and energy efficient solution
