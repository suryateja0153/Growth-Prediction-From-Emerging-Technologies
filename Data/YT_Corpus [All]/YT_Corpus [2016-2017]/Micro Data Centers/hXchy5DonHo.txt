 my name is Rick van over I'm with Vemma function as an evangelist simply put I try to tell people to do better things with their data in a way my topic here for today is availability in the era of ransomware clouds and why a legacy backup is not enough okay so i think that the ransomware phenomena is legitimate is anybody ever bumped into it or help someone out of it you know you know vendor alike if you're using a computer I think it's it's a risk and even if you know the existing ones are very windows centric there's going to be more there's going to be other platforms there's going to be phones there's going to be other technologies that are going to be at risk of this and so you know the examples i'm going to show are very specific to you know maybe operating systems but the way of thinking is what i want to try to communicate is something that you all can take as a practical way to kind of improve what we do with data ok so i saw something come out from the wall street journal QR code if you want to go to it but basically it was about the risk of insider threats and they dropped an infographic which i'll go into in a second but it really got me thinking about that i mean the thought of an insider threat it doesn't necessarily apply to ransomware but it applies to that access of the data you know what could go wrong from an insider threat standpoint and i'll get to some practical tips around that here in a second but the the title was this is a bigger risk than many people may think you know we think about layers orchestration automation scripts it you know the puppeteers of these advanced technologies and data centers that we have have a lot of power and those strings and so this notion of an insider threat or of ransomware or the like I'm curious you know how real it is and it is real and then when we think about that in specifically to something like backup or availability you know of the data center I think these are significant considerations now we're in that article they also had this really good infographic and I love infographics myself I don't know about you guys but I do and their categories I'm going to zoom into this in a second where around data exfiltration network activity compliance stuff time and expense personnel external data physical security very big ordeal and then act access attributes and then a whole bunch of numbers about percentages of people that you know admit that they've taken sensitive data out I've done it you know I've put stuff that like my email my personal email I look at the jobs I had in the past I always saved a PST of that everybody ever done that no PO not but I mean the in 97 or one of these numbers was really high in that regard but the important thing is I think that a hundred percent of organizations have had at least one of these things happen and I think that's significant okay so when we think about this notion of an insider threat this notion of data loss I hate the conversation to back up and more importantly why just back up isn't enough so a couple of these I want to zoom into fifty-nine percent of employees who leave an organization i've done this take information with them best example is that email right ninety percent of IT employees say that they if they lost their jobs they would take information with them twenty-five percent have used emailed to do such these are just very interesting numbers in in the sense that like i said i think a hundred percent of organizations have had some sort of hit and these or other categories that regard are you know what i would call an insider situation a data loss unplanned but even worse unknown and i think that's the big problem so when we think about this type of stuff and that's just like a news element right of this notion of an insider threat what does this mean for backup and when I think about backup there's this old thinking and the new thinking when I grew up in IT my biggest fear right was a tape falling off the truck let's it's actually still risk but now with our advanced data centers in the like we have more things going on more advanced layers layers in a good way not layers in a bad way I mean there's layers that can make things bad but there's a lot of stuff going on right and in fact you know listening to Giuseppe like the OpenStack conversation is new to me but some of the concerns are timeless and when I think about when things can go wrong in regards to back up in regards to data loss in regards to ransomware the surface areas come into play and i would actually challenge that you know a lot of companies especially those in you know financial services or sensitive data that put a lot of effort to the production state of the data any access to production data very well controlled right there might be doing pretty good with that but I challenge that there's actually a bigger surface area in the backups because it's all there and what I mean by that is are those same controls in place you know you know this data protection strategy this data availability strategy it really has all the data does it have the same controls is there the visibility to ensure that what should not happen is not happening those types of things so that doesn't really come in so much to ransomware but it comes in to this notion of advanced data centers in advanced data movement where does the data go who's looking at it who's touching it and the like and I you know count countless examples of conversations I've had with like security people when they talk about the data that's in a backup because you know what I do it v ms talk about stuff and when we do such we have to answer questions like how data moves how is it accessed who can get to it and alike so when we look at the surface areas in this these risk areas I've long told people this notion of a three to one rule and it's not new but when we think about this notion of and somewhere when we think about this notion of insider threats we have to take this pretty seriously the 321 rules not new but when we apply it to the threats today I would actually change it ok so this three two one rule that I've said says you have three different copies of data two different media one of which is off-site I'd like to actually put extra rules in there for these new threats of today offline that would be a good way right you know offline storage for some of these threats isn't is a good way to protect when we look at these you know how many ways can you dial this up you can have tape that's a good offline storage of sorts I mean it's not exactly the most modern of technologies but the portability the offline aspect the acquisition costs are actually pretty good we also could think about storage snapshots okay those are pretty good ways we could also think about different protocols you know to kind of make threats have to go out of band by a factor of two or more to propagate themselves but when we look at you know backups and I'm always keeping this conversation very operating system hypervisor focused because you know what with what veem engages with that's where we protect and make data available right but when we think about these notions of ransomware and is this is by the way not just a PC problem I know a number of service providers that have like they'll use veem to protect everything that their clients run but they have this like separate little protocol whenever the client calls and says they've got lucky or whatever they kind of break all the rules and they shut it down immediately and they restore it back right this is actually very much a server problem currently so this notion of the three two one rule I like it especially with my extra rules about offline maybe out-of-band permission access controlled access to it if you think about the complexity there that really is good both from the insider threat and the ransomware threat but I like this this way of thinking no matter what you do with technology because a it can accommodate nearly any failure scenario and it doesn't require any specific technology so this is more of a way of thinking I'm sure we can do it at veem I love drawing up these types of things and before I forget if during the lunch or the coffee breaks if you want to talk more about theme stuff myself and then also Michael and Chris both from bmore here maybe give a little wave wave they're both there if you have any questions you know they can talk Veeam with you as well but this this rule rocks because like I said it doesn't require any specific technology doesn't require you to do anything specific yet it can accommodate any of these scenarios but I really kind of want to gravitate to this notion of offline and a couple of attributes come into play out-of-band authentication and communication I think that those are good attributes for this notion of some of these propagating risks that we might have so out of band communication would be something like a disk-based backup that is removed from an online system and then is taken offline and then to access it a different set of controls and persons would be allowed to reintroduce that back so first of all there's no live communication know you know replication of sorts when it comes to backups yet you've got this extra control you don't ever want to pull it out of there unless there's a real problem but you know some of those types of things can help you reduce that risk and tapes a good example the only reason to tape would come out of storage is you know only the CEO could do it or something like that because if you think about the insider threat plus the notion of propagation from ransomware these extra business controls can help you address that another kind of offline storage aspect and I kind of highlight is just FB brought up active directory I mean he said a lot of companies use it I'd argue it's the single most common authentication framework and business data centers today pretty qualified but I'd say that that's legit that's a great way to propagate okay because it's the same set of credentials sure we can have people with with backup approaches that lock in with different usernames and passwords and those types of things but still active directory in itself has a risk of permitting propagation so one of the things i actually have told people is and this comes into a very inceptive moment i used to advise people on how to design their backup storage and I'd say you've got all this you know stuff you're using Active Directory here and they have maybe a deduplication appliance or some sort of storage device and how they get to that they said well just use sifts logging in through active directory my what if you're restoring Active Directory you can't get to it because it's in there but you have to log into the storage with that which is not there so there's a inceptive moment so little things like for backup storage maybe introduce Linux authentication and NFS protocols or local storage with with no well that would be risk of propagation but the NFS part in particular would prohibit you know when you have to change authentication frameworks little things like that in the era of ransomware can be simple design changes that actually can make a big difference and then traversal of authentication I think that active directory is one it's a great framework don't get me wrong but if you take the risk of ransomware insider threat seriously if you have to have these hard different mechanisms it becomes a multiplier of complexity to protect against these ransomware and internal threat situations the one of the last things I want to hit on we got about five minutes left I'm going to keep us on time and one of the last things I want to hit on is activities and what I mean by that is you know if anybody uses any product you know if you get like a log of what's good like red yellow green what do you look for no no no you look at the green that's you look at the red and yellow that's what I'm getting at but I'd actually argue that the green is just as bad let me give you an example what if Joe the IT intern did a restore job of the sea well he shouldn't have permission for this but that that's another thing Joe the intern restored the email box of the seat I owe to his desktop well it was green it was totally successful job right but what the flip is he doing doing that right or it doesn't have to be Joe the intern it could be soo the semi disgruntled IT admin or Wayne the half-baked OpenStack architect that doesn't know what they're doing whatever they're can be successful activities that was at a 10 enrico ok there can be successful activities that actually indicate a problem so I think I know a lot of people that sort by the Reds and the yellows and triage that but I actually argue that the greens are good as well and you know whatever you do it could be a storage practice this is beyond backup what if somebody deployed a new lung but then you look a little closer what the heck is that person doing with storage you know those types of things so this is the visibility aspect is what I'm getting at who's doing what when you look at the notion of an insider threat when it and then you know coupled with the risk of ransomware coupled with the advanced data center technologies we have today I'd actually argue that the good stuff is just as bad as the bad stuff kind of a scary thing in this notion of redirection this is a one thing that I've had happen where a lot of people have you know data again that surface area it's all backed up but what about the restore I'd argue that the actual note task of restoring data is a pretty significant event sure it gets you out of a problem but there's a lot of conversations that come through that did they restore the right data where they are allowed to restore the data but more importantly did they restore it back in the right place this notion of redirection I'll take the CEO again if he has a file called payroll xls it's probably important and if somebody restored it not back to where it came from but again to their desktop that's bad news or if people are taking backups home you know on USB drives etc so we have to work when we look at the data center and the data we have we have to work backwards what access would allow one to do that what storage is in place that allows backups stuff to do that right so I have to kind of point two people to draw the lines of their data center identify our data look at their flows look at their patterns look at their architecture and my three two one one one rule is pretty nice with one being off-site and offline and with out of band access control when you look about a look at it that way that three two one rule can really help you protect against all of these threats ransomware insider threats and more and then when we look at old out-of-date inventory I'd highlight that that's actually a big deal there might be a point in time of backups on disk or tape or the old backup software might not have the same access controls but it still has all the data granted old but then again that's just a surface area that I'd encourage you you know to be aware of and as we round out you know this notion of cloud and service provider technologies you know this is another era where we have to do things like if we're going to go down the cloud and service provider model which is inevitable don't get me wrong I encourage people to look at practices like BYOD bring your own encryption I encourage people to look at the cloud and service provider technology not just because they have to what I mean by that is I get the question all the time okay I need to do cloud for my backups and I'm like what do you mean do cloud like well you know yeah yeah amazon and azure yeah that and I'm like okay well what do you want to do with it you know last time I looked at amazon azure 78 different services Nigel or something like that some okay you can run a vm you can do an object storage you can use the RabbitMQ what do you want to do not rhymes but the same thing with the azure example giuseppe brought up that example where somebody was given part of their ela a large amount of credits therefore have to use it how are you going to do it so my practical advice is to when you go down a cloud and service provider technology path know your surface areas the one practical tip be yoe bring your own encryption and then lastly be able to draw your lines of your data so that when it goes to that cloud and service provider model you have a full awareness of what you're doing because I it's a real risk I think a lot of people just I don't want to say go drunk into the cloud but go blind into the cloud and then you know as we wrap up here I got four and a half minutes or foreign minutes and 6 seconds I encourage people to provide more than backup ok now I've done my best to not make this a pitch for V but right here is kind of the word from our sponsor a lot of people go to backup products for these two capabilities high speed recovery and data loss of wings that's why people buy backups but in this world today I don't think that's enough I challenged everyone when they look at their data to introduce things like verified recoverability leveraged data and actually at the very end is most important having complete visibility having visibility into who restored what and why you know it was a successful job it wasn't yellow or red but why did Joe Wayne or sue get into that data those are significant questions also questions like you know how much time do we have left before we run out of space we don't want to do guesswork we don't want to over permission things like that this is that's this is the transition from just back up to availability and when we look at our capabilities in the market today and granted the veem answer today is very much focused on Windows and Linux operating systems as well as VMware and hyper-v VMs but this this mindset this practice is going to evolve over time and whatever we're looking at with modern technologies encouraged us to just take this modern approach to the surface areas to the risks and such so with that I have a moment or two for questions any questions on anything they've talked about oh whoa Julian well no the recording so yeah well you don't have the password it's not in active directory yeah it's out and bring your own password and these kind of issues which I think we're well put about where your data sets and where you can for example restore the ciose mailbox is that a business process thing or not just a pun for V more is that something that backup products are going to bake into that there's going to be some sort of policy driven thing about not where you can back things up but where you can potentially restore it to and who can restore it and all that kind of thing 3answers yes no and it depends now what I mean by that is any product can do any level sophistication it can be fully processed driven and it could be a capability somebody doesn't have its how its implemented I was telling Nigel just a moment ago it's like going through an audit it's like oh I'm using this technology well that doesn't buy itself meaning that it is or isn't going to let you pass that audit it's how it's implemented that that's the answer the implementation again knowing that surface area and knowing the requirements knowing maybe we do live in a world where we have policy driven as a requirement that will make the difference to that answer to the question good question was it you yeah could you pass this back guys I didn't turn it on yeah turki um you mentioned bring your own encryption can you explain what you mean if I'm going to cloud I believe that my data is encrypted in the cloud right are you talking about taking our own encryption on top of what the cloud provider actually does um that's an option this the best example that I can give you specifically for backup data is that when you Alex can you pass the microphone when you send data in the form of a backup to a cloud and service provider technology do you have the encryption therefore the provider cannot see it that's the test okay worst examples Dropbox they can open it up okay best example this is a V technology we have this thing called cloud connect when I put my backups in a service provider cloud if I'm the customer I have a password data that's a specific vm example but BYO e for cloud service technologies cloud and service provider technologies is a good approach for today
