 my name is Kevin Brown I'm gonna be moderating the data center panel here today my day job is I'm a vice president of strategy and technology for the data center solution within Schneider and today but I've got a much more challenging job which is trying to harness the talent and brainpower here for to hopefully make a useful and interesting interaction I'm gonna start with some introduction so first is Prithvi energy he's the executive vice president chief technology officer and a member of the executive committee of Schneider Electric an extra breath is Andy Lawrence Andy is an analyst with four or five one a long time lots of experience looking at the data center so thank you very much for joining us Andy next to Andy is Hal grant who is the executive vice president of the IT business next to Hal is let's see if I can get it right Knut Molag he's the CEO of Green Mountain a colocation provider in Norway next to Knut is Daniel Domo another schneider guy is the executive vice president of global solutions a member of the executive committee at schneider is over 25 years of management experience in the power quality protection and conversion marketplace daniel thank you very much for joining the panel and last but certainly not least but i put you there because you have the most difficult name for me to pronounce is vernon org and leon that close okay he's from Microsoft France he joined in 1999 he's the chief technology officer and has been appointed as that not only the chief technology officer of a chief security officer for Microsoft France since 2001 over the last few years most of our focus has been around responding to cloud computing that's what the industry's been talking about and one of the things that I've been hearing a lot of terms with is you know what we're starting to run up against bandwidth limitations that might impact what's happening in data center designs then there's this term IOT have you ever heard of it it's used from time to time edge computing is another term then there's industrial IOT convergence so all of a sudden it's not storage and servers but everything's converging together maybe you could help us get started here is is any of this real are these terms meaningful or is it really just the IT industry overhyping itself again it's not marketing hype it is a definitely a very real fundamental cluster of developments you know that we've that we've seen over the last 5-10 years and we can expect to see unfold over the next five or ten so what what's really happened is at the center at the cloud public cloud level we've seen the ability to create industrialized commoditized self-service automated IT on on a fundamentally realigned and reduced cost basis this in turn has sucked huge amounts of demand and traffic in and we're seeing a huge build-out of data center capacity at the center at the same time this has created a lot of demand at the edge there is not it doesn't make sense to bring all that compute back to the middle so it's now fueling new build-out at the edge so our all of our analysis shows that you know the cloud we often get asked the question is everything going to the cloud the answer is definitely no it is not a zero-sum game that every area of compute whether it's Cola of data center is being built out whether it's colocation whether it's edge of network whether it's the center so it really is quite fundamental and it's quite an exciting time there's a lot of devices and a lot of information that happens in this industrial segment and how do you see that IT and technology how do we need to adapt with this idea that you know what used to be industry and IT was separate now the two seem to be coming together in many ways so what has happened is the last 20 years the world of IOT has impacted primarily the consumer market right you and I we use iPhones and iPads and so on and it has allowed the two billion people on the planet to talk to each other the data centers in a cloud that we are talking about will be needed to support this industrial iot area and then oh by the way the whole data center area can benefit through IOT because to manage the data centers you need the software like the DC the data center information manager software that we already have so we were going to use the IOT technology to make our data centers edge cloud more efficient more energy efficient and so on applying data centers to analyze the data and using IOT technology to make our data centers more efficient and scalable in the future is that true it's not true it's not I'm surprised to hear you say that maybe you can educate us some on what you're seeing well first I'd like to say we operate two data centers today we claim ourselves that we are the greenest data centers in the world and to gain that efficiency we decided when we built these data centers that we have to utilize the technology and the systems that we are actually servicing it the IT industry and IT systems at the moment we have more than 20,000 measuring points in each of our data centers which means that we measure almost everything if everything was going into a central data center today if I I'm not incorrect I think it's there is about 2% capacity of the require acquired capacity if everything was going into one point you know I'm interested Bernard maybe you have a perspective with Microsoft certainly Microsoft's in a unique position in this market and has been transforming itself over the last couple of years what's your view on you know this hybrid environment that seems to be evolving and what's gonna be the right answer for customers so if we look at our customers today they are already running in a hybrid environment so our strategy is rounds hyper scale data centers like you mentioned where the the basic unic is around 70 megawatts to give you some idea about the size of the data centers but at the same time we understand that's for various reasons which could be we regulatory or legal some of our customers impose that there is some kind of data residency in their own country so as an example where an operating our edger which is our cloud environment from 30 different regions which is by the way more than Google and Amazon combined and if we look a little bit further ahead in the future we think that our customers themselves should be able to run their operation in their own data centers or potentially within colocation data centers in the same way we are currently running our own operations and if you look at what could potentially happen in the future well telcos where 5g becomes a reality will need to cope ways one name one millisecond latency in such an environment you cannot go to very big data center very very far away from your own location which means that there will be in the future ways for telcos for mobile operators to have their own cloud which will be part of a giant's infrastructure able to deliver 5g to their customers cloud by definition give the impression that everything is global and what people expect in a global world are is consistency predictability and agility capacity to adapt I mean you're the example of the latency time that's changed the way we design which brings the the concept of modularity and again flexibility to a different architecture the way we deliver the capacity to deliver a consistent experience who you know very clear processes and also the consistency in the way you operate this is where software are becoming more and more important different industry have different problems we help bring simplicity to a complex well because global means complex the future like we are the future of the data center it really is going to be a hybrid environment it's gonna involve small data centers dealing with edge IOT applications you're going to have people putting things into colocation facilities there's going to be trance movement between applications we may be between the cloud and on-premise because Microsoft's trying to enable people to do that do we all agree that there's kind of this hybrid vision of the future anything that we can do to ensure the quality inside the factory before it gets to the customer any testing we can do lead time is incredibly important time to market from the time the investments made till the time the revenue is coming in is incredibly important and we're listening to the customers and we're taking that into account and the things we're doing in a more agile way you
