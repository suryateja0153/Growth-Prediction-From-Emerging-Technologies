 allow me to interview myself again so edit oh I'm from Intel I manage the data center platform marketing team across the region and very happy to be here today thank you AWS we invite and I must congratulate them for what looks like another successful aw I summit I hope you guys have a great conference so today I'm going to talk about innovation and let me start and dive in and start talking about Intel's own innovation last year was actually the 50th anniversary of Moore's law and for those of you who know Moore's law Gordon Moore who's won the founders of Intel postulate that Moore's law way back in nineteen sixty-five and then it was the 1965 that he said that hey every 18 months two years we will double the amount of transistors within the CPU every two and and thereby bringing more economics 2d processor increasing processing capability in the same energy envelope so you can see here and I'll read it out to you it's a little bit small in 1974 we started with the 8080 processor that only had four thousand five hundred transistors you move on to 1978 four years later it's up to 30,000 transistors fast-forward to nineteen eighty-five with the 386 processor it had 225,000 processes and then if we go down from 85 to you know the year 2000 with a pentium 4 processor 42 million transistors within a single CPU with the pentium 4 in year two thousand and that occupy a space of point one in micron small right on you say and six years later with a core 2 duo processor 291 million transistors within the processor right and last year when we launched the Z on the cpu 4.3 billion transistors within the processor alone right in a 14 nanometer package so lots of transistors with a cpu lots of processing capability increasing exponentially and we foresee you know although the analysts and love analysts predicted the death of Moore's Law we had intel based on what we see from my engineering road map before seem also to continue for a few more years yet so and you know the key thing beyond just our innovation and how much transistors we pack into up into a CPU is the innovation that the industry has driven around the CPU and you see it from calculators to mini computers to laptops today to high-end high-performance computing systems to large data centers like like AWS powering things like the Space Shuttle the International Space Station last year the AWS summit we talked about the mass Rover and the analytics being done de in the in the AWS data centers data from the master over so lots of innovation being driven on top of what we do with the CPU we've talked for a few years already about you know that the growth that's happening in the industry around data data growth right Craig just talk about big data we talked about internet traffic growing as well with things like Facebook increasing users doing online shopping on aw on Amazon Google searches etc and that's all going to continue to grow you know over the next few years and you can see some stats here by 2024 more than 5 billion you know people on the internet more than 50 billion connected devices 40 fault said bite of internet traffic can't even explain how big that is right but the key thing with all the growth is really the new business and usage models that it drives it enables and create talk to us on the new innovative uses usage models in analytics that some organizations are deploying across the region and it's not just in you know he used an example in in real estate and and the the Vietnam manufacturing company but it's really spanning across the different verticals in Energy retail healthcare healthcare is a big growth area for for analytics and what you can do with personal medicine and and doing really one to one targeted treatment for individual patient and not you know doing the same treatment for for a patient as cancer they all go to a central individual one to one type personal treatment in healthcare okay and the technological shift that's driving all this is really the changes in the infrastructure you see in the bottom right the client continuum client devices continue to get a smaller better faster you know we had laptops or smartphones right you know iphone android samsung whatever and then we have the Internet of Things these are devices and I think Craig talked about it a little bit as well at the sensor network that's out there the multitudes of surveillance camera that's out there these are the things that get connected to the Internet they get connected to the cloud and the data that's collected that needs to be analyzed no that's where you know that's what's driving Big Data and without big data without any analytics the data we collect from sensors I essentially you know useless what you need to do something with data analyze it the Grove in cloud and of course security is a key pillar as well as we look to building new infrastructure to enable the new business models that we that we are the we see coming the first stage of cloud growth has really been driven by the digital services economy and what we mean by that our companies are born run on the internet amazon for online shopping create talked about uber Airbnb grab taxi these are d I'm companies bonds on the internet that is driving the first stage of cloud growth right Facebook is an example tremendous growth in facebook and and that's really leading to a it's creating a cycle what we call a virtuous business and competing cycle whereby you know as small services come on board we have more customers buying the new devices that's you know we had iphones couple of years ago smartphone people are not talk about wearable smartwatches and lots of other smart devices right so more devices will drive will need to be connected to the data center which is great for us in Intel we love it and there's more than the data centers collect the data there's an ability to analyze the data and roll our new services right and with new services then someone smile so hey I need to create a new device that can deliver this service in a better way right and so so far the virtuous cycle will keep going right so new services will drive the explosion of new devices a new devices or driving man phone for service and their Center leading to more services again and and so forth so we see that continue the growth growth the first phase is from consumer applications like you know Facebook Amazon but moving forward we think a lot of enterprise as the day shift down were close to the cloud will see a lot more enterprise applications come online to drive the next phase of cloud growth okay so let's talk about you know Intel and AWS and hood and the innovation that's going on to accelerate this cloud adoption firstly and you guys you know those of you I work in enterprise IT you know this already that's various workloads that you need to cater for they're all very complicated and they all have different attributes so on the x-axis you can see that's the i/o intensive axis and cpu memory intensive on the y-axis so the very top right you have hpc type applications that are very io intensive they require a low latency very lots of true put and very CPU intensive answer lots of cpu processing capability that are required on the extreme left on the on the bottom left dedicate the whole thing not so I were intensive not so cpu intensive these are standard websites with you know information you know who to contact contact us you know not so CPU intensive or I intensive and then you have things like a cold storage and cold storage would be something that the Amazon Glacia service that create talked about archival and I give you an example of cool storage when it comes to I'm your facebook photos right so if you bring the facebook if you can online with face over the last few years you know you get married you have your wedding pictures everyone goes in and look at it right you have a baby you post your baby pictures all your friends go in and look at your baby photos of the photo of a kid now when your kid grows up to 10 10 years old no one looks at those photos anymore right no one looks at your your wedding photos anymore but Facebook still needs to make it available online right and that's what cold storage is all about the photos are still online they still sit in in in a part of their Center like an Amazon glacier for archival and anytime someone you have a new friend who wants to know what you look like 10 years ago when you got married he'll go and look at those photos so still online it's not cpu-intensive saw the vaio intensity depending on when you know what how much gets used but again it's an example of another workload that you need to take care of in the cloud right graphics rendering very CPU intensive big data i/o intensive summer CP intensive and so far so you get the picture there right so lots of different workloads so what does that mean for Amazon then if I want to be a for AWS if I want to be a cloud provider for enterprise applications I need to build navigate all the different workloads I need to be ok the free and we look at the breadth of offering from you know AWS just on ec2 alone you can see that the different workloads that the different instances that can that's available and easy to can cater for all the different workloads that's out there you know our three instance for for memory optimized workload you have the sea for compute instant see for compute optimized instance that's based on you know our version 3 of the e5 processor we launched last year right that's the latest and fastest instance from from ec2 and you have to know the t2 micro instance or the hosting workload m3 is the standard instance or the end for instance when they upgrade a new cpu and so forth so different instances for different workloads and I think based on what aw has done the thought process in the innovation that they have they've got an instance for whatever the enterprise will go that you have that you're considering to move to AWS okay now specifically on the cpu i showed on prius light lots of different CPUs and again here it's another slide on the right hand side so the see for instance is based on e5 2666 CPU it's actually a customized CPU that Intel bills for facebook the M for instance uses different CPU similarly D to instance different CPUs for different workloads or different instances and while I'm showing on the right hand side of the slide are the features within the CPU that's been used by the instance now why is that important for you so for example in our CPUs we have a feature called asni which is a security feature that the instruction set within a ES and I accelerates encryption and decryption of data thereby ensuring that if you are running a security application that does encryption decryption you'll need that feature to be available on an instance and if you go to the AWS website you will find a listing of tables of the different instances and what cpu features are available in the instance for your particular workload you have things like turbo boost technology that's a real one on a lot of instances that they will enable more performing spur more computing power make it available to the instance when the application demands it our when there's a spike in the world load and you have things I ate up a VX 20 okay so let me put try and put that into a real example for you guys create talk about Netflix being a custom of amazon so netflix you know smart and cheers and netflix they actually optimize they are a video delivery algorithm on on with our cpu together were engineers such that they can deliver good service you as an example netflix made a commitment that they wanted to encrypt all the movie streams as they deliver the movie to the end users right this very important to them as to expand their footprint into a global reach they want to ensure that their content providers assure their content providers that the content is secure will not be no no one can steal the content way so they want to encrypt their video streams so they work with with us they they they optimize the algorithm and they spend a lot of time using asni to optimize the algorithm as to resolve the optimization with the version 3 cpu the instances you see here they're able to increase the encryption performance by two point one time right double from the previous generation right and thereby ensuring that they can now deliver HD video stream and cripta to the consumer with no degradation in performance right so they meet their commitments are encrypting for their content providers and they're able to meet the SLA to deliver HD string to you that you paid for in without any degradation in performance right so that is version to the version 3 now we've recently launched version 4 of the CPU of the e5 2603 which amazon will roll out soon and on versions for netflix again optimize it further with the new instruction set that we brought in and they're able to increase the encryption performance by another 2.5 times from version 3 right thereby ensuring even better performance for their customers for you guys when you sign up for when you buy a next netflix movie okay so that's an example of how a company or service provider uses the cpu features within intel to deliver great user experience to the consumers to their customers okay and it's something that we as customers don't see but that's been a lot of work a lot of time spent in the background to optimize to ensure that the customer experience is optimized and that the performance is good okay so that's the kind of innovation that Intel works does with the industry and what we do with with our partners like AWS okay so another example here I mean and you know novartis I'll just talk about Novartis so they're a pharmaceutical company and we look at the Amazon instance on feels like there's lots of different instances r IC for when do i do see for do i do see three rice III is a little bit cheaper obviously but what they found was that when they pick the high-performing instance the highest instance to be dead that guarantees the note that the users a high cpu from Intel with the highest frequency they're able to save more even though they're paying upfront for a higher cost instance they're able to save more money because they require less okay and this particular example they found that they could save up to sixty-five percent cost savings over signing up for lower-cost instance right and again this is in a way driving the virtuous cycle again right so see for customers today you know when c5 instance are available they'll be going to a c5 right because they see that the same money I spend I can get more processing or I spend less and I save money for the same amount of processing okay so that's how a a wsn user can benefit from using you know the Intel technologies that awss optimized or enable with India instance okay and it continues they recently announced a new instance called the x1 that provides a ton of a ton of memory for that particular instance up to two terrible memory and up to 100 virtual CPUs right and this is designed for the most demanding enterprise workload again enterprise customers if you have a very demanding enterprise photo you're thinking should I put it on AWS we all have an instance for you now they can cater for that okay things like ICP hana your sequel server your database servers and this uses our highest and ii seven cpus okay so this only available in the US for now but over time I'm sure EWS will make it available to worldwide to all their customers okay and it's going to get better on AWS I talked about you know the fact that we've launched the version for family recently so that was launched on 31st much the excellent instance is based on the e 7v v3 we're launching v4 in in June 2016 right so it's going to get better as Intel continues to deliver on our promise to improve performance improve energy efficiency in our platforms as we deliver the next generation of the cloud platform twelve customers like AWS okay let me switch gear and talk a little about analytics and Craig has talked a lot about well Craig talk only about analytics just now so i probably won't i won't spend too much time on these slides but we know this already right there are stats out there that says hey companies that do analytics do better right because they know what's going on they're able to make decisions faster xq on decisions better etc and deliver better financial results right and if analytics you get more insight more competitive advantage and you get measurable business value if I'm implementing a cluster to do big data analytics how do I know I'm getting value out of it right and you know Craig talked a lot about that already but this is why analytics is key and a lot of companies are embarking on that down that path okay so just like with the cloud instances a lot of our technologies are being used by AWS as you know este before all the analytics instances right Craig that I talked about AMR that's an example I pause Killa analytics he talked about the scale data warehouse amazon redshift scale-up analytics for things like in-memory computing and even analytics at the age right when I talked about in his keynote this morning as well right the Kinesis service where we can we can take streaming data from IOT devices gateways that's connected at the age of the cloud and use Kinesis to capture those data and of course do something smart things like analytics at the age so regardless of whatever is your analytics with crime on what you want to do AWS has to keep you delivery and it's all built on top of Intel and there's a lot more technology here which I won't go into okay okay so to summarize you know I talked a little Moore's law you know we think it's going to continue for a while yet and it's going to continue to be the driving force behind IT innovation right you know beyond just IT you'll see you know things that that's you know driverless car that's not really i t but a lot of its going to rely on what we're able to deliver from a compute performance capability okay cloud architecture is important because they'll allow you to be you know nimble deploy or your a civil resources cricket for your line of business it could be critical for competitive advantage and and lastly Intel and AWS we've worked together for many years for a long time and we will continue to collaborate more and innovate and deliver best-in-class user experience for you the Amazon customers
