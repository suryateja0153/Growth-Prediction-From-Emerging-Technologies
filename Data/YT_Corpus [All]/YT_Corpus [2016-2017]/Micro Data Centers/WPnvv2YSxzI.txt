 you everybody thank you for joining us today for this webinar we have a couple of presenters on Tom Ferris from Alliance corporation is going to do a brief introduction to Alliance and to our topic and our presenter and we have Roman krawchuk from teeny fiber am not sure if I've handset right realm and story and Steve start from Feeny fiber they're going to do the presentation and explained all about the micro armored fiber to us just a couple of housekeeping notes join the presentation everyone will be muted except for the presenters so if you have a question you'd like to get answered you can submit it through the go to webinar questions console and we will usually take the questions at the end of the presentation so the other thing to note is that i am recording this webinar so if you want to watch it later if you have to drop out have a colleague you want to share it with i'm recording it so as soon as I can get it out to everybody i will send you a link to a YouTube video where you can watch it as many times as you like oh that said I'm going to hand things over to Tom thank you Lisa good afternoon everybody hey before we get started I want to get something straight with everybody here Roman I have a question for you is it teenis or is it tiny it's teeny teeny teeny fiver okay all right I gotta like a motorway like martini it's the martini of LIBOR are teeny that's correct wonderful all right so everybody on the call this is teeny fiber what we're going to talk at it today is is about micro armored fiber my name is Tom Ferris I'm with Alliance communications we are a value-added distributor in the Americas and in Mexico I I recognize some of the names on the call today so I think some of you have been with us before but for the new folks out there we are a we are a value add to distribute in the Americas we focus primarily on wireless and also wireline telecommunications products for the cellular industry and also for the structure cable industry I have the opportunity to meet Roman it's been over 22 and years now at a trade show a couple years back and I saw this really unique product and I just you know like I just like went crazy at the minute I saw it brought it back to my product manager my fiber product manager he loved it and all of a sudden we started building some of our custom jumpers with this product right off the bat and we've been specifying this fiber in a lot of different projects across the United States we've been bringing it to bixi shows all across the regions and we've been getting some great some some great feedback on it so what I'm going to do then I'm going to give you a little bit about Alliance and then we're going to get right into a teeny fiber and Stephen Roman so on so what's exciting about today's presentation we did this presentation I think about four or five months ago and the excitement is still there I mean this is one innovative piece of fiber optic cable it's a corning piece of fiber optic cable just like most of the other fiber that you guys are pulling out there these guys have figured out a way to put it in a jacket that was incredibly flexible those so many other things for you on installation I think you're going to love this kind of stuff it's very strong it's flexible and it fits where others don't and you know I'm from the New York City Market I'm sure there's a couple of new yorkers on the call here but I'm your conduits are jammed in a lot of these big buildings that we have here in New York City and when you're pulling fiber through these conduits it's almost like going through a meat grinder this type of fiber comes in really handy in those types of situations and we've been using this a lot on outdoor installations if you run fiber on towers these days you know if a piece of piece of ice falls off a tower in the middle of the winter and hits anything on the tower it's going to it's going to break it so fibers and coax and other cables are very vulnerable on towers so this tau this cable comes in real handy on the outdoor side of our business as well so really excited about this I don't want to steal any thunder for my friends a teeny fiber so let me tell you a little bit about alliance so they said earlier value-added distributor we have products in a variety of different areas from wireless products to fiber the structure products which is all of the steel and civil equipment that goes into rooftop and cell tower installation we also have a variety of I'd ask an oday s product distributed antenna system cellular products and you'll see how tiny fiber fits into that is teeny fiber fits into that excuse me and then on the supply chain side of our business you do a lot of supply chain services for the cellular carriers in the Americans whereby we provide logistics centers scattered across North America and we provide in and outbound logistics for their construction projects in their major markets just a couple of other things here we we have direct relationships with several hundred different vendors and I'll show you some names of those in a few seconds and you see these are some of the top folks in the industry including teeny fiber we have extensive inventories and all of our facilities and we try to provide personalized expert assistance all of the people here work at Alliance have been in this industry for minimally 10 years personally here I've been selling wireless probably since the mid-80s I have other people in this business of doing it just as long as me so when you call in here you're going to get a qualified person on the phone who's going to be able to answer all of your questions we also have some overlap in our product lines as well so that allows us to become more of a an honest broker when it comes to recommending products to you so we can be a little bit of an independent recommender when you're out there trying to specify products for your customers we also provide a pre and post-sales technical support which includes on-site training for many of our brands and as I said early we have warehouse is located throughout USA canada and latin america on the technical services side of things if any of you all have ever dealt with microwave before we provide microwave path licensing services with the FCC and Industry Canada we also provide free network design and radio passed surveys and software for all of our value-added partners will do product pre configuration in our warehouses will do kidding and racking and stacking we also sell towers and we do complete power design so all you need to come to us with is what you're trying to hang on this tower and where you're where you're trying to put it will provide you all of the design work for it and then we also provide tier 1 and tier two tactical support and RMA support for many of our vendors so if you're working with a product and maybe you haven't worked with it before and it's your first install our folks will get on the phone with you and help you throw it on the broadband side of our business which is what I manage here in the United States these are all the active RF components and the active electronics these are some of the brands we represent and these brands encompass all different types of backhaul and transportation systems microwave to ymax to Wi-Fi we provide products that do point to point as well as multi-point that operate in the licensed and unlicensed frequencies and as they said earlier we also provide a full complement of towers and steel products that go with implementation and we also have an electrical division in our company where we provide a variety of different ACDC UPS's as well as all different types of renewable products if you see here this is just a brief list of some of the major manufacturers that represent and if you know these names you know these guys are some of the top guys in the world at what they do I'm going to turn it over to to Roman and Steve in a second here but appreciate you coming on board we try to do these webinars on a monthly basis if you go up to our website you'll see a list of those we have another webinar coming up shortly from a company named Cambridge networks which is a licensed point-to-multipoint radiating product as Lisa said earlier you can visit us on our youtube channel and we have Facebook LinkedIn pages and we also do a little tweeting here as well so if you use any of these social media platforms please come up follow us and we'll follow you and and we look forward to working with you all in the future thanks very much Roman and Steve it's all yours thank you very much for your introduction and the opportunity for all of us to learn a little bit more about your offerings basically everyone like to introduce myself my name is Roman Krawczyk I am an electrical engineer at a Stevens from back in the 80s and I've been in this industry pretty much ever since I got out of school my first job was for novell which is a software company doing local area networking and wide area networking back before Microsoft and I did my first fiber pull in 1989 so I'm pretty familiar with fiber optics and the actual physical infrastructure and technology that goes into implementing it in the proper way that being said I've had several of companies that I've owned and worked with the teeny fiber story basically comes from my experience in installations fiber optics has been more and more of a popular and high demand cable to be installed and protection and keeping the fiber optic cables safe is a paramount issue and armored fiber is becoming more and more prevalent basically because it's so important to have up time you can't have downtime when you have a fiber optic install so armored fiber has been a very popular up until recently the only way to armor your fiber has been the traditional bx aluminium interlock type armor are very big very bulky very cumbersome very difficult to install and doing a lot of projects also in the new york city area i was just thinking of a way how do we do this better how do we protect fiber better why do we have to deal with you know one inch and you know inch and a quarter Odie's and giant core holes that we ask that we have to put into these buildings and upon like travelling around and looking at different things and working with my partners we kind of developed this uh method of wrapping the glass with a stainless steel armor a very small very flexible very high strength we've developed this about three and a half years ago and we've been playing with this idea for a while and then we also took it to the Patent Office and for the last three years we've been pushing through the patent process which we finally achieved last November and that's why we are fully coming to market and working with alliance as one of our major distributors throughout the Americas and we're very happy to be partnered with them and are very pleased that they are embracing our product so that's just a little bit wraparound story yes sir have you put up your presentation yet I don't see it I'm just checking its up what is ok you have a control of us of the power point I'm just going to change things there you go yeah I didn't think it was up there you go yeah girls got it out all right okay you're all set okay good sorry about that but yeah that's the that's a basic first slide and you know basically what I'm going to you know go over is some of the applications that were implementing this into you know basically what's exciting about this today's presentation is it's a new product it's something new it's the fiber optic industry you know has better glass and Corning is always coming out with something you know newer and faster but this is different we're not changing the technology of the glass we're changing the technology of protecting the glass and delivering it to the client in a better more effective economical way so our stainless steel armor is stronger than copper than an aluminum armor that's uh that's out there in the industry and this look this so I just tells you basically a little bit about you know what we're going to be speaking about in the next uh you know 15 20 minutes or so our focus today has really been about the desk application of fiber optics as I'm under the impression that you know most of us on this call a familiar with gas so we're not going to get into the minutia of you know how des operates you know it's basically cell phone usage where end users want to use their cell phones within buildings or environments that Cohen antenna systems can handle so so dass is basically a net worth of antennas yeah proof installed throughout the facility throughout of building so that so I get a little feedback here so that cell phone users can have using of their phones within buildings within you know various applications and and locations there are various types of their system systems summer carry your owned and some are neutral host like a carry-on system is basically AT&T goes into a building and runs their own fiber-optic cables and has their own service for their own cell phones verizon goes in and runs their systems side-by-side right next to AT&T s two independent fiber optic systems within the same building or the same venue in New York City that's very common because the buildings are independently owned and these carriers have to come in and lease the space and the building owners want to lease the space to as many people as possible a neutral whole system is when a building take controls of the fiber optic system and is able to lease strands of a system for AT&T for verizon or sprint or whoever wants to be with in that facility so there's two different ways of basically hosting a system within a within a building or facility that really depends on the under building management type of company as an example is a specific example of add a system in New York City we recently were involved in a project where AT&T was coming into a large 40-story building in New York City that required add a system for the AT&T cell phones to work and in order to implement the ATM fee system 44 inch core holes were required in all the closets on all 4 40 stories of the building and it's a tremendous expense when we introduce our armored fiber optic cable into the into the scenario floor is needed either to or 14 inch core hole in all the floors saving them about of these six core holes within the building which is a tremendous of savings the savings in the labor of core hauling alone paid for the fiber-optic cable so the the savings is in the installation the application of this product line and you know continuing about gas it's a it's a tremendously growing market not only is it a important in within buildings because you know users can penetrate walls to get out to the antennas it's also a very prevalent in sports arenas concerts things of that nature if you're at a concert for example or sports venue there could be 70,000 people that want to use their cell phone at the same time what kind of a system can surprise supply that bandwidth it's almost you know I'm believable the amount of usage that people want to do they want to take pictures they want to send them and it's all got to go through add a system and these data systems all powered my fiber optics because fiber is the only medium that will allow this massive amount of bandwidth to exist at the same time another huge application for death is a public safety police fire department emergency systems tunnels they all require cell phone usage to be available within these different facilities like tunnels and you know subway systems so metropolitan type areas are very involved in that project this way they can feed similar cell phone signals to all the users and also emergency responders wherever they may be you know whether they're underground tunnels or within buildings so there's so many applications for the data systems that it's just have ever growing phenomenon really fiber optics has become the predominant communications medium because it a bandwidth it's huge for the bandwidth not only for dance other applications like cable television all your verizon fios i'm sure many of us know about files and depons concept of files huge huge huge growing market for broadband TV and broadband applications and and broadband transmission point-to-multipoint type applications obviously computer networks security surveillance huge huge especially now with the new 4k applications and the cameras that are so high res they need a lot of bandwidth to be able to transmit those signals on the real-time basis fiber is the only medium that's going to allow that on a consistent full-scale basis so security is a really huge application for all of this stuff industrial controls you know building management systems for example all the BMS stuff a lot of the new systems are designed with fiber optics to control all the different components of a BMS system for traffic systems utility grids yeah just about it you know any application is requiring fiber due to the amount of bandwidth wireless antennas obviously for death and and any other transmission applications are key to be connected by fiber to maintain the bandwidth availability example of a dance project like I just mentioned stadium 70,000 people most are on their cell phone whether they're watching the game or talking to a friend or taking pictures and putting up on Facebook the bandwidth it's got to be tremendous to support that type of demand that's a giant a man for a small time basis um so those types of applications are huge and we've been involved in helping design a few of those types of systems des over fiber is basically covers a little bit about how fiber is how this fiber is implemented basically this type of fiber is it like any other fiber so if your technicians and fiber installers are familiar with fiber optic cables they'll be able to use this type of fiber it's the same type of glass it's available in you know all the current cable types and you know single mode multimode and and things of that nature fueled termination can be either mechanical terminated like unicam connectors or fusion spliced with a single strand or ribbon a lot of different ways of feel terminating it basically we did not change the technology of the glass within the fiber we just changed the way of protecting it and deploying it prefab assemblies are also available to make installs go easier so with with alliance we can terminate you know 150 foot strands and basically the Installer could just go in take off a pulling eye and plug everything in so to make the install go in even easier so fuel termination is definitely something that's available and encouraged either field or in a lab now we're thinking our teeny fiber is a little bit unique because basically it's the same size of a conventional armor it's not the size of a giant aluminum interlock fiber so you're not sacrificing anything for armoring and protecting it but not only is it the same size the stainless steel gives it really good tensile strength for pulling and crushed resistance is tremendous because it's steel as opposed to aluminum our bend radius is excellent so you can get around tight corners and through small bands and pipes and conduits or wherever you gotta go and it's just tremendous at innovation in how to install this type of cable and have it armored it's dramatically smaller and easier to install an aluminum interlock and if any of you have installed aluminum interlock you know when you're pulling that cable through other cables it heats up and has the tendency to burn up and eat up some of the existing cables that may be within a tray or conduit or pipe our cable does nothing like that it's smooth jacket smooth walled it goes in nice and easy almost like a cat5 cable you know but it's actually stronger than that so we feel that our fiber optic cable is very innovative because it can be the same size of a non armored cable yet served a function of an armored cable and then actually exceed a lot of its characteristics in terms of this slide the application besides that is infinite one of the huge applications for us and for alliances security applications security cameras with 4k feeds require tremendous bandwidth like I mentioned before so fiber is key we've developed a composite cable that has fiber and copper power conductors under one jacket so basically if you notice you have a armored fiber optic cable here this is a two strand but we can make it six strand four strand 12 strand you know we can customize this to whatever application you may need and it also includes some copper conductors this is a common is at 18 2 which is our version of a siamese camera cable rg59 with 18 to well this is single mode 2 strand within 18 2 which will power up just about you know any basic camera antenna access point anything that you know that may need power and fiber to go to one location this might alleviate the root the need for running pipes running it additional cables having additional power supplies and again the gauge can be configured to whatever you need if it's 16 gauge or 12 gauge you need three conductors or six we you know basically this is built to order and built it to whatever specifications the application may require typically 18 2 with two strand is our staple that's what we stock and we do move quite a quite a volume of that for various applications um again just a quick reason of why copper I mean why fiber versus copper fiber-optic applications use less power if you look at a pond or a G ponds application the amount of power required to power a system is infinitely less than a regular switched based copper system so the power consumption is really a big issue when you come into using fiber optics bandwidth infinite bandwidth when it comes to single mode the properly designed single mode network has tremendous bandwidth and can handle amazing amounts of data instantaneously so copper is nowhere near the amount of bandwidth the fiber can achieve speed and distance 328 feet ethernet distance limitation fiber can go for miles and miles and miles and it can go between cities and depending on your application it's the distances becomes a not an issue if you have the appropriate hardware to go so so there's no need for a closet every 300 feet within a building or within a facility you can shoot five or thousands of feet and avoid having repeaters and switches where they're not really needed security issue data traveling over fiber it's been proven to be safer and harder to tap then data traveling over copper so the security aspect of travelling uh your data over fiber as opposed to copper is a great advantage centralized networks of course you can you don't need as many closets you can put them all in one location reliability extremely reliable especially when you took the armor into consideration you know fiber is lightweight it's then it's you know relatively easy to install um it's you can migrate the various speeds if you know if you go to gigabit networks and one single mode it's very updatable and your network can run on fiber for years and years and as long as you have the hardware that's compatible field termination feel splicing it's it's not that difficult to fix or repair or anything that needs to go you know happen on site and in terms of cost it basically the installations savings are tremendous and also the maintenance of fiber optic networks is is quite relatively inexpensive posted massive copper networks now we're going to get into a couple of different constructions of our specific teeny fiber the first one we're looking at the it's like an om three om four cable this for an example is a 12 strand cable and on our 12 strand construction typically comes with a 250 micron size buffer which is like considered loose tube are very easy to fusion splicing very easy to ribbon eyes if you're going to be using unit cams on it you got to put a breakout kit which is available to alliance in 6 12 24 and 36 strand varieties pretty easy to determinate as you can see there's glass this Kevlar there's a second terry jacket there's a steel tube detective we put another layer of Kevlar we have a metal braid which adds to the tensile strength when you're pulling on it and another layer of Kevlar this is one of our staple cables that is extremely popular the small size is the size of a cat 5 cable the strength as you can see with all the components is tremendous and you're getting 12 strands of fiber and it's basically a five millimeter OD so it's it's really small some people look I skipped ahead a little bit some people prefer to work with a type buffer type cable which is a 900 micron basically it's just easier to unicam onto it if you're going to be splicing you still have to get down to the buffer underneath this is for shorter runs smaller installs the size of the jacket on the six strand this is a six strand like for example is about the same as a 12 strand 250 micron a little less protection in terms of armoring and and braid but the 900 micron buffered cable itself is a little bit more beefy than the 250 so it doesn't really need as much protection as this one does and the other option is ribbon cable we do ribbon anywhere from 12 strands up to 144 strands the 144 is like a 12 millimeter OD it's still really small compared to the other armored solution so as you can see there were a variety of ways that this construction can be made and just for your knowledge all of the glass that we use within here is Corning Glass so we didn't change the technology on what we're using in terms of the medium we just change the technology of how we're protecting it and are able to deliver it to the client outside applications as Tom mentioned before we offer the teeny fiber in a pu jacket polyurethane which is a very high flex jacket this is perfect for deployables for areas where you want to roll the cable out maybe you want to roll it back in very high flex so with the bend radius is extremely tight on this you can get it into really tight spaces with that's got a lot of turns it's an indoor/outdoor rated jacket it's not a plenum rated jacket it's not a direct burial rated jacket but it's excellent for many applications especially in broadcast we've seen a lot of broadcast companies really take to it and we we do it in all the strand counts as well the second outdoor jacket that's very very popular for us is a polyethylene jacket that's basically a direct burial rated jacket it's a little bit stiffer it's a little bit thicker it can be buried all of our outdoor cables all of them feature waterblock tape we can do gel on a special order basis but in general we use a water black yarn which makes the cable able to be used indoors and outdoors and you don't have to worry about the 50 foot distance limitation when you're using gels within the building another very popular jacket type for outdoor applications is our indoor outdoor plenum type of jacket it's basically plenum rated yet still UV for sunlight resistance and though has the water block tape and the jackets a little bit thicker than regular jackets we don't recommend it to be exposed to the elements and we don't rate it to be directly buried but it's perfect for indoor use and outdoor use in conduit if you have two buildings or a tower you want to connect to a building and you have a pipe in between this is your best option especially if you're going to go within the building some distance after the fact so the indoor/outdoor plenum is a very popular one for us um here's a slide that just introduces of like who's using the product you know what it's about and you know where to use micro armored fiber we kind of covered a lot of these topics already so I'm not going to get too repetitive but basically it's a patented technology that we hold a pint and it's stainless steel wrapped around the glass it's basically the strongest solution out there in the market at this point it's available in a variety of strain counts i mentioned the six and the 12 but we manufacture teeny fiber anywhere from one strand which is a very popular fibre-to-the-home application up to 144 strand ribbon which is having an application for trunk runs and you know variety of applications of course om one om three om four and os/2 of the prevalent types with om three and os/2 being the most prevalent we com4 up-and-coming tremendously and os/2 as well as is tremendous especially in the applications that we're talking about like dads and ponds and security things like that in terms of jacketing which I touched on a little bit before it is available in riser plenum indoor/outdoor low smoke zero halogen for a lot of metropolitan and transit type applications directorial industrial harsh and fair environments so basically any type of application and jacket is available very about that annoys got a helicopter combined like um okay so this this next slide also just recaps a little bit about the different applications whether it's telco or CATV IT security bra man it's basically a great great way to protect your fiber optic investment it's a smaller and lighter than the interlock able and with it with the composite cable with the hybrid with the power it really allows you to custom tailor a solution that will really meet the needs of your client application and again broadcast communication security fiber-to-the-home ponds g ponds you know that there's a plethora of applications and as fiber becomes the mainstream in in the world from medium that's you know those are some of the applications that you'll be you'll be looking at some of this we already covered a little bit we use obviously Kevlar and you know we have the smallest OD for armored fiber variety of different strand counts and really the savings is in the installation the amount of man hours and installation time that you can save installing our armored fiber as opposed to regular interlocked armor is tremendous oh we're along with the Alliance we also provide a patch cord type solution so you can even get your patch cords armored very small same size even smaller than conventional patch cords but they'll be armored so you know if it's a fiber to the desktop application you can run up on my patch cord from the wall to your PC and not worry about someone stepping on it or kicking it that it's so delicate because it's they're quite quite firm and quite strong and the armored applications so that's that's pre-termination and fiber patch cords are a very big application for us as Tom mentioned they started building cords with this cable immediately we've had some media exposure last two years in a row we've won awards at the ISC show the security show in Las Vegas we won the governor ward one was for the armored fiber with the power and another one was with the trunk configuration we do offer 25-year Warren t for installers that are certified to install the cable properly so we are competitive with other famous brand manufacturers and ordering in their offering a warranty that will be able to make the customer feel secure and confident of their investment micro armor vs interlock homer which we touched on this slide really says a lot our fiber 12 strand interlocked armor you can just see the size difference you know same thing with with om three here these are our big movers the size difference is tremendous the installation of this cable is very difficult life just gets in a lot easier once the contractors put in this cable once or twice a they really never want to run this again because of all the problems and things that have to do with it here's like a fun slide that has 300 feet of interlocked armor a six strand and 300 feet of our teeny fiber so transport that to a job site in an elevator and forward truck where this a technician just can carry in so the advantages of the smaller armour being stronger than the bigger armor yet so smaller a tremendous tremendous this slide really shows the picture of what we're really talking about in terms of a thousand foot real a 12 strand count real of teeny fiber weighs about a hundred pounds a 12 strand count real of interlocked armor fiber where's about 400 pounds where we're at five point five millimeters diameter this is almost 14 millimeters in diameter bend radius or is this double diameter so not only are we small we can wrap it tighter because our diameter is smaller so the advantages of our armoring over the traditional armoring is is tremendous this is just a little rundown I'm not going to go over the details but of how much a installation can save when you're using our micro armored fiber as opposed to an interlock form of fiber in terms of no shipping and man-hours and labor we have came up with numbers that you can save almost have half the amount of money in the installation of our product as opposed to the traditional interlock product we have a lot of marketing information there are links to youtube videos which i'm not going to be clicking on but feel free to at some point check out some of our videos some of them are fun and and you know pretty educational in terms of how to handle and process and work with our fiber optic cable our spec sheets are pretty concise here's a spec see for the fiber plus power it shows a graphic shows a description shows all of the details here on the crush resistance the tensile strength the size the ratings and temperature operations and which glass we use corn and clear curve 652 d we also do a lot of 657 82 that's can you know that can be decided on you know at any given time here's a spec sheet for a single mode fiber for strand very popular you know just wanted to show you the spec sheets of how the specs are provided so when you're submitting your submittals to the client you have nice professional-looking spec sheets giving you all the informations and everything that they need to know to make sure that their cable is the appropriate cable so these are just a sampling of our spec sheets and and how we come about to doing this um you can also LMT pmpo assemblies is another application those are connectors that have 12 or now 24 and soon to be 36 strands and it's more connected the size of an rj45 perfect application for a 12 strand fiber we have a 12 strand fiber that we offer that's armored in a small three millimeter OD jacket making mpo cables and MTP cables very thin very small very strong perfect for data center applications or runs between closets where you can just plug in a cassette and break out into 24 strands or 12 strands or whatever you need to break out to so mpo applications are huge for us deployable reals or tactical flavor of fiber very very helpful with deplorable wheels they really have no memory once you lay them out you put them back in if there's the O king you know they don't budge other applications that we're working with is for example HDMI over armored fiber we have hdmi converters that we're offering that can send the fiber optic distance up to a thousand feet over an HDMI of 4k signal so there's a variety of applications and innovations that we're constantly working with and here's an example of some of the details of what the hdmi over fiber application entails and these adapters allow for your fiber cables to be customized to any length you may need so if you need 380 feet it could be done at 380 feet you know if you need 500 feet or you know 400 whatever you know the applications are infinite for HDMI over fiber can come on a real like this and easily employed and deployed we have a variety of accessories we have a series of stainless steel adapters so you can load up your panels with stainless steel adapters just making the whole installation seem a little bit more beefy and more strength applied to it a little bit more durable and ruggedized as opposed to using the the cheap blue plastic adapters that everybody's using we have some tools for crimping and stripping we have videos online that you can go on YouTube LinkedIn from from our website and take a look at some of the videos and how we can implement these tools and and work with the cable itself and at this point what I'm going to do is I'm going to open the door over to Steve stark these are a marketing manager and he's going to give it a little bit more of a marketing angle and let everyone know what else is available and how you can help market teeny fiber to your clients so thank you for your attention and if you have any questions just feel free to ask us when the presentation is done Thank You Roman again my name is Steve stock and i am the director of marketing for teeny fiber when you have best-in-class product you need to back it up with best-in-class marketing and I'm responsible for the web media awards stories and solutions that we're going to be able to provide the installer when you bring it to the end user what I'm going to be able to show you today are just examples of some of the things that we can offer I also now have your email address and I'll be filtering stuff over to you guys so you can see what we can do for you with regards to media stories testimonials and things that are going to help you with your story with this new technology the easiest place to start right now is the fact that Roman brought up that we have a patented technology that means this micro armor solution is the only place that you can get it the fact that we won back-to-back consecutive awards at the ISC show is really more on a testament to the product so what I'm going to do now is kind of take you through some of the things that we can offer you and it's just going to be a sampling that really gives you the strength to go to market and be able to confidently talk about what we're offering this right here States November 10 2015 20 50 received the US patent for the micro armored fiber optics that means we are the only company in the united states they offers this type of solution if you do see something in the marketplace that may look like it stay away because frankly that could be somebody is copying it and that could be an infringement upon our patents so I just want you two guys to be aware of what's out there and we are the real deal again everything is about stories this right here is one of the many press releases that we are offering in the mark place this is the one we won the actual Cubbies award last year at ISC it is a hot product that we offer which is obviously being able to provide power over fiber and as Roman mentioned we offer this in a number of different flavors and jackets it has nothing to do with the jacket it has everything to do with the armor and that is what our value is the next one is actually a story that just broke on fiber and gas this right here represents what's going in the marketplace we know that there is tremendous growth in death in fact AT&T has talked about 5000 percent growth over the last few years and dads and we see that growing so we're now being recognized as de facto and as the solution to market because of two things sighs and the solution to protect the fiber optic again it's always great to have stories this is just an example of one of the stories that we received from one of our integrated talking about the ease operation installation savings that it was able to apply to a job in New York City again it's always important to be able to provide these nice little testimonials because as i like to call it proofing concept so when you have best in market product always have something to back it up this right here is just a very small sampling and I like to look at it as a vertical market sampling of customers that have used teeny fiber and as you see we can talk about this from buildings to stadiums to telco casinos in fact we just did the Panther Stadium I was actually going to try to say if the Panthers won the Super Bowl it was because of teeny fiber that's an lol anyway this is just a slight sampling of what we do provide as samplings of customers that have used our product Roman mentioned a little earlier about some of these stuff that we did with the Super Bowl when you talk about proof of concept nothing can be better than having new york city as your backdrop in the winter time to use teeny fiber this brought to attention our crushproof and flexibility of the product during this one week at the event in the city with hundreds of thousands of cars running over the product trucks going over and pedestrians going over and we had zero downtime and because of that we were in 2015 as well as 2016 Super Bowl because we brought peace of mind to the NFL when they know knew that it was impossible to have any downtime solutions that's what we do so this right here is just showing one of the many solution we talk about fibre-to-the-home 5 into the desk this is a real project that we did with the AOL and again it was really about transporting huge amounts of data they needed to have zero downtime and they has a comfort and confidence that the microfiber from TT fiber would provide the right solution another project that we did that we were very proud of is one of the projects in our own backyard where a company out of Long Island in farmingdale this was in mineola one of the top hospitals in the area actually used a fiber optic network the whole backbone was done through the micro armored again to provide reliability and confidence that the system would not go down always got to have stories that's my job so right here are just a couple of articles and some of the different types of verticals that you would see our product everything from cabling to government video installation and maintenance magazine have all been running stories about teeny fiber so again when you think about who we are you know perception is reality and we know that we bring best-in-class product the stories are starting to build out we now have a number of media companies that do follow us you'll find us in from everything from AV technology digital signage as well as security magazine with regards to our products and articles that you're going to find out there so before I end I urge everyone to click on wewt fiber you will see our website we have a lot of great information that we provide to the installer with regards to our solutions we have a number of stories that you can use as testimonials we do white papers blogs and we're going to be building this out additionally for you guys i think is very important is that this is obviously our our homepage we will be doing now a number of landing pages right now I have one for security and before the end of this week you will find one for gas so what we're going to do is start building these stories out by vertical markets that will provide you guys with the solutions that are more vertical oriented so when you do show your end user and you cook your your potential customers who TD fiber is you can do it by the vertical market trying to think of anything else so I think at this point that kind of covers the story the products and at this point I think I guess I turn it back over to Lisa or present it don't anybody there sorry I nice presentation yeah okay that's okay yeah thank you think so
