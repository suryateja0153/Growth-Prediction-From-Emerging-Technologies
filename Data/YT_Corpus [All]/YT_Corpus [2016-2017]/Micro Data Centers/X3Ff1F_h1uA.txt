 now it's my pleasure to introduce the best tiempo with an associate professor in the Department of Geography at McGill he completed a master in economics at université laval and PhD in geography at the University of California Los Angeles he has worked as an economist with the conference board of canada and as a research associate of the canadian institute for research on regional development its research seeks to understand recent geographies of inequality and precarious employment more specifically is research program aimed first to identify and analyze special spatial patterns of inequality and across North America and European region and to understand which factors lie behind these patterns Sebastian good okay Nessie sit in pole dancer axilla what I would like to do my remarks today is say a few words about some of the work that I've been doing on the geographical dimensions of inequality in Canada and for this kind of work there is no substitute to the mandatory long-form census right it is the most important source of information available to geographers urban planners social scientists policymakers in terms of the spatial details that it contains it is thus a great relief that the long-form census is coming alive again right so the last five or so years every time I participated in a panel discussion such as this one or in conversations about the long-form census it felt more like a weight than anything else it's nice to see the winds now changing direction as a geographer I'm very much interested in why place matters right broadly speaking just means i'm interested in relationships between people and their environment right in terms of where the society in which they let live i limp read writing about social and spatial transformations in sweden back in the 19th century would have argued this is something like how the social becomes the spatial and the spatial becomes the social more specifically as a geographer interested in questions of inequality my main concern is about who gets what where and how right so following the Occupy movement of 2011 we've heard a lot about the increase in income inequality over the last two decades or so and in describing or studying this increase right economist and sociologists with all due respect my esteemed colleagues here I've tended to focus on the who question right in terms of inequality across occupational classes or ethnic or other groups the where question typically is overlooked right in terms of place to place differences in inequality yet what I would argue is that a geographical perspective can actually tell us a lot not only about the changes in terms of the spatial patterns of inequality but shed light in terms of what the causes of those changes may be but also in terms of the consequences right in terms of negative social health environmental and social outcomes and of course all of this is very important from a policymaking point of view in terms of figuring out what the right policy makes might be right you and use the term play space versus person based hype policies will come back to this later on to get a sense of how that geographical perspective may be important what I'd like to do over the next few slides is just go through some of those maps that we've been working on over the last few years to give you a flavor of that changing landscape in terms of inequality across the country so what we have here right is the evolution of earnings and equality across regions in Canada from nineteen ninety six to two thousand six now regions here are essentially defined as census divisions these are large counties if you prefer right what we've done with the census Micro data files is B is being able to reconstruct those boundaries so that they're consistent over time now in the red what you have are regions which have experienced above average growth in terms of inequality over that ten-year period and in the darker blue shaded areas we have regions that have experienced below average growth in inequality and clearly as you're scanning across the country you see a divide between eastern and western regions right inequality is typically much higher growing more rapidly in western regions compared to eastern regions where inequality tends to be lower and more stable right there are pockets of high income inequality in southern Ontario and a few other outlines but the primary divide is that east-west divide if we look at what's going on within the urban hierarchy we also see some interesting spatial trends here right so here we have the darker shaded air circles representing cities with higher levels of inequality in 2006 the lighter shaded area lower levels of inequality and of course the size of the circle tells us something about the population size of the city so there are two things that really stand out here one we can again see that east-west divide if you look at all of the cities in Alberta and in British Columbia with the exception of Victoria these are all very high inequality cities right compared to their eastern provinces counterparts the second thing is that we also see some relationship in terms of inequality and the size of a city typically cities with larger populations will have higher levels of inequality compared to smaller sized cities and if we drill further down we can also use the mandatory long-form census to say something about how the spatial morphology of inequality may be changing within cities themselves so here we have an example on the left hand side right of census tracks across the city of Montreal so in the red we have higher income neighborhoods right and so if we look at where these are located we're going to see that the west island communities are typically high income neighborhoods we have westmount and parts of Santa etc and in the blue shaded area we have those lower-income neighborhoods which typically are concentrated in the eastern parts of the islands much you all right if you would imagine a similar map right for 1991 then we can also track the movement or the trajectories of these census tracts and how they change over time and this is what we've done in the right hand circular histogram here there are four quadrants right so essentially all we're doing here is toning each census tract right in terms of where they are 15 years later are they relatively richer or relatively poor compared to their starting point back in 1991 and as you can see there are two quadrants which dominate rightmost census tracts or neighborhoods find themselves in this particular quadrant which is where we have census tracts that are relatively richer over time or in this lower left-hand quadrant right so what we have is a growing spatial polarization of pulling apart if you will of spatial inequality within the city of Montreal now this pattern is also one that we find in most other large urban centers Toronto Cal murray vancouver and to some extent even ottawa now you'll notice that all of the maps that i've shown so far use 1990 or 2006 data i have avoided the 2011 census so far where the survey right for the reasons that we're all familiar with lack of quality or the response rate is lower questions regarding the quality of the income data and also the fact that for a very large number of communities the data was simply not published because of high non response rates right so what i would want to do here just the show what happens and how geography can be of use in terms of looking at those quality data quality issues is go through a simple exercise where I have a little animation focusing on the province of Quebec right and we're going to be looking at those low income inequality regions again and how they have evolved from 1980 1 through 2 2011 right as we're shuffling through these maps remember that the blue shaded areas are low income inequality regions okay so let's start with the mat for 1981 right lots of blue as would be expected similar pattern in 1991 2001 2006 and then 2011 right so the picture is drastically different than what it was with previous generations of the mandatory long-form census now of course we all know this is related in large part to the fact that there are a lot of missing communities in Quebec 183 I think for which data was actually not published and that explains to a large portion what is going on and by the way the Institute's that stick through Quebec has done some really interesting work using Quebec's tax file revenues and comparing that in 2011 to the income tax data or the income data in the 2011 NHS and they find that same inverse relationship between the quality of the income data reported in indy NHS and the level of geography right so when we go to smaller communities there's a lot of missing observations as we would expect okay so just to sum things up right it's a big relief that the 2016 census is coming back now we have to deal with the data gap right I think it's going to be very important to revisit once we have that data a lot of these divides to see if they are still persisting right and also to try and identify the drivers to get a better idea of whether or not it's because of the industrial composition right the unemployment the education yet my composition or the age profile of regions that we see these patterns in spatial inequality and of course this brings us back to the optimal policy mix right thinking about how we move forward to promote more inclusive growth in terms of what approach is best person based or policy based approaches thank you
