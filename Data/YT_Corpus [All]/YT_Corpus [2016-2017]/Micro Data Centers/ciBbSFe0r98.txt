 what the well what to do but get started what else is there to do it started such a piece-of-shit device man such a piece of like just the shittiest made there are people that do this garbage for 40 dollars like $40 for anybody who wants to know why it is that I don't offer this ooh and because I get emails every now and then saying it and then there are some people that will just assume that I do this because I do other board repair they'll say you know but won't well by the way we sent you an iPad with this and like well I'm not gonna do that you go why not it looks like York well you know how to do that and like yes but what do you want to pay for it no like oh no I saw somebody else offering it for 40 bucks too so you know you know us and we have a discount with you so it's not you're not gonna charge the whole $40 right and it's like hey you you take that iPad and you shove it up your ass that's cuz there's this idea that like I don't know how to do any of this stuff which i think is really okay I don't have the most steady hands so I'm not exactly the person you should hire to do this but like I can't excuse me so I'm sorry who said that out loud that I'm not able to fix an iPad out of here alright now I just have to grab a jumper wire you can see the on the left the fourth pad down is missing so I'm just grabbing this over here battery wire from it'll do my it'll do the job it's got to cut off a little piece I'll do this to get data you know like yeah sure 300 bucks to get the data off of the iPad that whoever skull-fucked absolutely fine sure but like I'm not gonna I'm not replacing this connector for less than that like this this connector is 300 bucks not I thought since we had a wholesale discount with you that you were doing for the custom that's less than that lady upstate that does it for 40 are you kidding me I appreciate that you have the balls to actually say that out loud don't get a twist that I can appreciate that you have some balls but no suck my dick all right so this is hard because these tweezers barely work anymore they're kind of bent so I'm gonna try bending them back a little bit that didn't go the way I thought it would it's yeah I can't grab anything with these tweezers let's try bending him back no I always bend it too far that's close these trees were suck balls time to get new ones okay got myself some tweezers that were semi acceptable let's see what I can do here Semmy acceptable is the keyword here see this I can at least work with I can yeah here we go make that into a pad come on slide over a little bit I wanted to be in just the right position okay now that pad above it's got to get some something that I can actually sod it - there we go alrighty now this iron is a little too big for this so I'm gonna move on to the 2032 and on the 2032 I'm going to use the t30 - KN which is the largest micro pencil tip that I have hako stuff needs to shut the up other thing to do here is to rip off the excess on that wire huh I'm using a bad tweezer for that let's try a small screwdriver here we go have a nice little iPhone pentalobe I don't care if I run the screwdriver it's not like I ever use this okay oh I'll take that as a pad f I'll with that alright so now we have to get a connector connecters got sucked into the air filter okay now let's get a connector just fish them out of the air filter i know air filter i don't want to be doing this either trust me trust me our filter i know you know tell me that's my jumper that just came off no it didn't it's still there okay you piece of you tiny piece of this is the worst connector I've ever seen on any device ever like the worst this is just garbage total garbage the people responsible for the villi name is either this tablet it should just get this section of this tablet just need to get tossed off a damn bridge lining anything is fairly tricky for me well I have hands that don't listen to my brain I that are brain that doesn't listen to my hands I'm not quite sure which way it is either way sucks so scared of the line as best as I can hear I'm not going for perfection I know better than to do that a lot of people will say that this tip can't flow pads right because it's too small a micro pencil can't do this you see that I touch it a sec like tiny little second later and that has flowed so now we got to do the others well it's heating but let's get down in there let's get down in that mofo you know what I should do here I should decide of the damn digitizer to the iPad like why am I doing this I don't need a connector let's get the other one what's probably a joint right maybe a joint ISM sure doesn't strike me with confidence when I look at it that's for sure I mean the idea here is to touch the joint and the metal anchor thingy that's the way you're gonna get it to melt in may be touched stay down my hands don't listen to a word I say all right stay down touch the metal anchor thingy and the pad at the same time that's how we're gonna make this ship flow yeah mofo I know I got to do the same thing the other side that I did all up looking and push down so the reason I'm pushing down is because it's important that this be flat on the board this connector is such a piece of that the last time I pushed down the last time I pushed down on it I left an indent that's cool cuz I'm gonna recover the data off of this and you get paid and we're gonna throw this thing in a garbage where it belongs cuz a piece of alright so now we're going to go for the smaller joints which I'm not gonna dare do with this tip we want to do with a different tip and the hakko was going to remind me that I deserve to be punished because I returned the JBC gear the HECO is gonna remind me that it's cheap stuff my beeping at me instead of just allowing me to change tips on the fly Thank You HECO for reminding me that I'm a cheapskate all right so now we go for each individual pad so I started with the T 30 - KN tip now I'm going for the T 30 I think this T 30 - I they were gonna go for each individual joint here now the way you can tell if you solder your when you tap it if see if it moves around or if it's kind of or if it's soldered on also the reason I actually prefer working zoomed-out is so that I can see when my iron is in relation so like I can stop myself in time if I'm about to hit the connector come on hand make your way down there one Mississippi one Mississippi its back can you believe that this is actually like a forty dollar job the guy that the guy that we used to ignore our lawn and trim our hedges he's the only when I lived in a house charged more money than the market rate to replace this connector it's just disgusting its absence makes me sick totally makes me sick like tech tech people artisans craftsmen are it's it's it's all worthless now it's all worthless by the way you may notice that I'm using a different technique here than usual what I usually do is I have the connector as flat on the board as I can after soldering the anchor pads and then after that I solder each individual pin to the pad or I do drag soldering but the whole idea is that the pin is flat on a pad that has no solder here I put solder on the pads first and that's because I stand no chance in hell with the size constraints here of actually getting solder on each individual one so let's see what do I get here how many of these are not soldered one way to find out I guess you'll feel that if it's not soldered you'll feel it a little bit of plastic over there oh well that are you are you as good as you could be you at the end over there so I'm put kind of pushing the pinions of the joins with my tweezer let's get that little piece of out of there it's not rip the connector off the board while we're moving this now piece of connector I got and telling you this is the worst connector on any product I've ever seen alright so now we get the LCD I don't even know what you're supposed to plug in first on this I guess you plug the digitizer in first and then the LCD it's this way before I fixed an iPad 2 once is a bet just to see it show that I could without ripping the cable on the first repair but that's it I think I don't do this stuff I have a receptionist who does this stuff who's very good at it not like the whole soldering thing but the replacement connectors that's another great thing that this digitized that I was given had the old connector stuck inside of it so let's see yeah I'll use that now got some faith let's turn the air filter off move you out of the way all right so let's see this is gonna plug in like this is so funny I have no idea how this works like none whatsoever this is can you show me how you plug this yeah this the do I do okay you may not want to put your nail deep in there may have to push a little harder than usual to get that to plug in it may also be soldered on crooked like really crooked no not worse than it already is just smash there's a little plastic piece that's I'll get it it well at least I know it's not me it's it's this dip I mean it is me but it's not you get the idea it's my shitty ass connect all right yeah it could be a little better than what it is okay whoa it's not on fire you understand it not being on fire already as a celebration out of my way Oh what was the password that you wrote down to this it's usually in the notes but the the time-warner is actually so slow that we never put it in the notes look I want to say that the cameras to see that over there they're not gonna believe me yes we wrote it down on an envelope you Time Warner okay let's check this out we're in don't want to show you too much of it cuz you're gonna see stuff you shouldn't probably but yeah and that's that iPad Mini repair
