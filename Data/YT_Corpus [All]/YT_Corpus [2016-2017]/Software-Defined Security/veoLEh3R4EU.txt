 hi i'm andrea jaramillo and welcome to ideas connected minutes today I'm here with Kevin Walker vice president security CTO here at juniper networks so Kevin I want to talk about software-defined secure networks tell me what is this about how can our partners benefit yeah well thank you for for having me Andrea we're a a very interesting time for not just juniper before the industry with respect to cybersecurity and the approaches we need to take to better defend our customers their employees their customers and their families historically we've cobbled together a series of disparate solutions and we call that network security and in fact we have to change that paradigm to address building secure networks and that's under a framework that we call software-defined secure networks it's transformative in the following sense we have to use and leverage the entire network to defend and protect not just point solutions or specific areas within the network as we are today and our partners are crucial here because our partners need to leverage their local knowledge of their customers of fine-tuning the the various elements which we'll talk about later for our software-defined secure networks so Kevin what are some of the technologies that juniper has available today to support SDS n so SDS n is based on framework of three key components one is the intelligence and intelligence are the indication of compromise and the threats that are out there that that are not only in the industry but also in your ecosystem and that is fed into our analytics capabilities through sky ATP and finally the enforcement enforcement is based on the notion of being able to stop the activity at the route at their firewall the traditional way routers and switches we provide a scause spotlight secure today for intelligence it's a very good agri ated feed of intelligence and that goes into our sky TP for the analysis that is that produces actionable results which then will go into our enforcement capabilities again today is the firewall RS rx routers and switches will be coming soon so how does s TSN differentiate juniper from some of the other security players in the market today the approach that we're taking is holistic with respect to the network and to leverage the entire network to bring to bear again to the problem of security you can't do that if you're only a pure-play security player you can only focus on one element of security for example data loss protection or AV gateways well that's great if that problem if the attack traverses that enforcement zone but if it doesn't what do you do juniper is an all-in Network player with respect to bringing the cyber security defenses and that's where s DSM is the correct answer alright well thank you Kevin thank you so much for being here today well thank you Andrew for the opportunity appreciate it so you can find everything you need to know about s DSN through the link below and I'll see you all next time on ideas connective minutes
