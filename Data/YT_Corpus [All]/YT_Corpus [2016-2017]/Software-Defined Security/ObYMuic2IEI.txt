 as you watch this video you are surrounded by radio it's all around you but because the wavelength doesn't match what your eyes can see you can't see it what happens if there was a device that could transform a wide portion of the radio spectrum into tangible information that you could use the good news is that's exactly what this little USB device does this is an RTL SDR USB dongle from new elec its intended use with the decode digital TV signals but somewhere along the line somebody discovered that I can see a very broad portion of the radio spectrum about twenty five to seventeen hundred and fifty megahertz to be exact what this means to you is that with this little device you can monitor a huge portion of the radio spectrum if something were to happen that disrupts normal communications you have way to monitor a giant portion of it and actually see what's going on in the world around you in a world where normal communications are disrupted any communications might be like lighting a match in complete darkness devices with these types of broadband capability have been around for some time but typically costing thousands of dollars because of silicon ization in the consumer market this particular dongle sells for around twenty five bucks for your dollars you get the dongle in this small telescopic antenna which is okay at getting you started but more on that later a whole community has sprung up around these devices and many people have written software that utilizes them when I refer to seeing the spectrum I'm actually referring to using this dongle in conjunction with a PC and some of the software developed the best software that I found used with the SDR dongle is called SDR sharp it's a free download and the link is in the description below will cover a complete tutorial on how to install the software and get all this up and running in another video SDR sharp is basically an interface that allows you to control the SDR dongle not only can you hear what's happening in the radio spectrum but you can see a pretty wide swath of it almost all forms of voice communications are within reach if anybody is using radios nearby you will see it be an FM broadcast public safe dirty air traffic control or all VHF and uhf amateur radio the software is very easy to use and you'll see in the tutorial how quickly you can get started the second thing that you can do with the newer like SDR dongle is probably one of the most interesting for a lot of you watching predicting whether post collapse will be difficult but if you can see what our weather people see you might have a leg up on others when it comes to predicting the weather imagine a world where you didn't know when the next hurricane was going to strike or the giant El Nino storms that caused massive flooding in my case I want to know if it'll be sunny tomorrow so I can plan my power usage with my solar array there are countless reasons why predicting the weather is important to us today and even more if the lights ever go out luckily downloading data directly from satellites is one of the things that you can do with this dongle this one's a little more involved because you need to either make or buy a specialized antenna called a Quadra feeler helicoidal antenna and don't worry there will be a tutorial on this as well currently the US and Russia have satellites that fly over your location every day several times a day these satellites are constantly photographing the earth and relaying the information to ground stations luckily for us how to decode the satellite transmissions is public knowledge and some folks have offered free software to do just that to download data directly from satellites you need to previously mentioned SDR sharp and whether to image both in the links below the software will record a satellites transmissions as it passes overhead then decodes them to an image that you can use the sea far-off storms because these satellites come over several times a day you can compare the images to get an idea where the storms are headed couple that with some local weather data like from my accurate weather station and you'll have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen with your weather with a little practice and I know what some of you might be thinking but depending on the collapse scenario these satellites probably will be up there for a number of years you can also use this dongle to get a view of the aircraft within a hundred miles or so of your position every commercial and military aircraft has what's called a transponder that transmits the aircraft's identification altitude and air crap type to aid in air traffic control and to avoid incidents with other aircraft some aircraft transmit more information such as GPS location speed heading and rate of climb all of these aircraft transmit on the same frequency 1090 megahertz and this allows you to use the dongle to receive decode and display the information the software's you'll need to do this are called ATSB scope and RTL 1090 both are in the links below and yes there will be a tutorial and because the wavelength of the signal closely matches the supplied antenna it actually works pretty well well you can argue that military aircraft might have their transponders turned off in certain scenarios and you might be right with the advent of this technology it's already widely found that military aircraft often fly with these civilian transponders turned on even in war zones and with the ever increasing threat from the government spying on its own citizens with drones even today these drones will have to have their transponders turn on when flying in commercial airspace and they'll have to squawk who they are without their transponders they run great risk of colliding with civilian flights the point is nobody thinks you're listening every day I track military aircraft in my area and I think it's needless to say in a post collapse world any aircraft that is in the air is going to be of some interest beyond these things mentioned the possibilities are nearly endless for this SDR dongle new uses are being developed every day and I'll cover any of them that you want current popular uses are monitoring shortwave communications with an up convertor tracking ships at sea decoding digital radio communications listening to weather balloons trunking radio decoders and listening to Inmarsat's satellite communications and more for those of you can't wait for the tutorials to get started I've included a link to a site called RTL SDR comm that has a ton of information on getting up and running one thing I'd like you folks to think about is what other uses can we come up with for this device how can we use the radio spectrum to detect people cars or other possible threats please put your thoughts in the comments check out the new Aleksey are in the links below and stay tuned for the
