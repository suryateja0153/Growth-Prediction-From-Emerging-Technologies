 um William one again um I'm security research for me this is a picture from the place that gave rise to my professional career in computer security 17 years ago I worked that the world known usage insecure my research involves collecting large data sets and they will turn level and processing the data sets to reconstruct complex elective interactions this is a picture of particle accelerator near the building where I used to work one night as I voice crunching some numbers in the web I noticed something suspicious with one of the systems and as it began investigating I found out that a hacker had compromised the system and let's try it directs filtrate sensitive data just to give you perspective of the title data is stored in the certain the systems one of the scientists in the lab went on to receive a Nobel Prize several years later so I try to stop the attack by installing backdoors edwin stoughton system and by embracing the data that they had could have accumulated ports filtration that night I went home thinking I did a great job I got rid of the hacker well I was wrong the hacker with her upset with my actions and on my return to the web the following day I found out that the attacker had erased reformed to the dr where i had collected my day to the previous night and the day they have not been backed up yet so that they I learned that they would respond to threats that have to be in speed is that I went on to learn about computer hacking techniques eventual attorney did the professional career at pentester and I'm sure the hacker went on to improve his ways all stay still sealed assistance fast forward to today computer security breaches occurring in much larger scale and the key to realizing the exposure in the weather of reach is to anticipate your the threats as advanced as we take the leap into the soul into the world of software-defined networking I wonder what the threat landscape is going to look like for software-defined networking and this is what my presentation is going to be about I will talk about tax surfaced Oh SDM and I will present this deal threat model that could allow enterprises to anticipate this infraction is that Software Defined Networking the topics of the divine advocate has attracted a great deal of attention from service providers and enterprises just to give some statistics here Gardner did a study in 2014 and according to study 10,000 Enterprise worldwide will have deployed Sdn in their net box by 2016 another study by Cardinal Valley 2015 shows that seventy-five percent of the company planned on Sdn deployments in the next five years international data corporation reports that the worldwide Sdn market will reach over eight billion dollars by 2000 si tu so if we define networking hold great promise in terms of simplifying that deployment and management however dry a number of challenges that have to be addressed during the initial stages of SD and adoption first of all transition to the CM will requires will tell you support or traditional networks software-defined networks not only enterprise will continue to fight security issues in traditional networks but also don't potential will be dealing with security vulnerabilities in multiple as the end networks as Sdn simplifies fall out of multiple virtual networks on top of our physical infrastructure so overall the century temperature will increase the risk with prices secondly for vendors are jumping right now album on the SDM bandwagon by quickly developing sdn products so they can put them out there in the market space with side Shari cops music and concern that security could do one behind again we should expect an increased number vulnerability in the first wave of SDA fortunately our current knowledge unless the end of abilities bratz the tax is limited all we can do is to anticipate friends but how do we do that well the prizes should take systematic structured approach to SDF as identification one way of doing that is through threat modeling threat modeling is not going to eliminate the attacks however it will help enterprises to increase the level of preparedness in the death of attacks that end I wanted to contribute to the community by developing a novel SD attract model rat model requires understanding of all the systems and components interfaces involved in STM architecture so this slide represents a typical is the architecture the architecture is composed of several planes and interfaces the bottom line plane is the data plane that hosts network elements that transmitted traffic the plane is connected to the control of play dear southbound interface the control plane of controllers controllers manage the network elements but also communicate with each other to synchronize Network specific information the control plane is then connected to the app top monster playing application plane that hosts applications that will be accessing the resources network resources from the control plane all the slaves could be managed by operations we're playing never complain any of the systems within the planes and interfaces make potato abilities before they tire is the attack surface is going to be the sum of all the vulnerabilities and threats put in this place and into pieces systematically identified friends and software to find that folks I didn't post brats into three outlets the trapdoors the trigger similar ability seein vulnerability source is the a component that the way the book relative rises I'm sure this life that little cut oh so you probably don't see and find a little rat action by which is fred is carried out so let's discuss each of these elements in order what it is front sources let's make up for all external systems outside of the typical icing architecture spread Neos originates for all systems that attempt to be part of the legitimate architecture but they really not finally freznik health from the SDN specific systems management console occasions controllers and folk elements they may be the compromised by attacker or it could be jiggly user who is trying to engage in a more art activities as I have previously energy vulnerabilities need found in there is it systems management results applications controls network elements but also interfaces collecting systems to define threat actions I use the definition by this threat is any bank potential to adversely impact ionization operations and licensed through an information system via unauthorized access structurally disclosure or educational information in the denial of service therefore i thought i define five types of protections unauthorized access is when I source axis and the system which doesn't have access to imma throw this closure by the threat source access this information it's not authorized access for identification of SDN information young for each thread source local frys to modify your optional service may occur in the state system to prevent sdn system functioning I'm a sorry destruction of Bayesian information with systems is also a threat would you know the thread sources protections and vulnerability sources together I obtained them in the relationships between different sources but actions and vulnerability sources each relationship represents a potential attack bath sighing it's on Fred source taking effect actually begins the vulnerability floors there are the total or 240 friends in this model some of the threats are purely conceptual and I'm unlikely to materialize into realistic dangers at some of the threats actually have a serious impact of this via networks so in the next few slides I'm going to show you a few there are examples that can be derived from the model these are the strike scenarios that we will be discussing I would like to point your attention to the fact that some of this stress have in iteration or maybe in ticular iterations for instance and a thread force explosive ability and take control system and uses the system to explore the mobility in the system this is an example of a price axis track an attack is launching an attack against America soul attack is of an external system and is trying to conduct the password for City pacification attack case management good soul if the attacker is successful in taking off the management of soul he made for their conduct attacks on US unless their networks this is another example of an authorized acts of Fred in this case the attack I had already taken over the management console and trying to exploit the vulnerability to achieve unauthorized access to the application this is an example of disclosure of information that the attacker is engaging into the RAM scraping attack in a traditional right scrapper attack the attacker first takes control over the application server server and that scans it's never a physical memory to identify extract sensitivity nation in this example the attacker to call with application server and skiing the memory of the server to extract census information that could be for instance that workflow rules that have been previously sent to the controller another example of a disclosure of information fat controllers provide application program interfaces to the applications to make use of the network information available to the controller's the interfaces may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers in this case that conquered exploits a vulnerability to harvest information involved that flow rolls likewise the Thakur may exploit a vulnerability in the face to delete a netbook for the rules of the controller this would be the sample form of mass destruction breath the thakura took over an application but has limited privileges of application may try to escalate the privileges by exporting software ability in application this is an example of threat that's a threat so finally the attacker to call with application he has that been rides he looks like the application and he realizes that this is an epic stepping application so the application is able to observe the flow traversing the network adapters looking at the communication within two controllers if this communications happen to be unencrypted and sent in clear text the attack is able to extract sensitive preparation data and may further use it to launch attacks on the Asian Network authorized notifications right the attacker uses information obtained in the previous attack to set up a vol controller and is trying to conduct an identity spoofing attack by inserting new network flows into the laptop our left they said I could result in traffic flowing in the attackers direction example of destruction of service right let's go back to the management control the attacker had already taken control he may use that system to exploit software vulnerabilities to cause denial of service for instance in the controller controllers have service is running a local ports an attacker may send requests to the controller pretending to be netbook speech by overflowing the controller's table containing the speech information for instance the data structures that contain this information may not do the prophet validation if a trawler may become a responsive and eventually even crash Samoan attacker may launch an exploit ability in the network element by overflowing the network flow table on the network element and causing another continent the common sponsor example disclosure of information read the tacker here is trying to determine if the flow hole already exists on the network I'll left your side channel attack attack i sent a request to establish a connection to system moment that time and the measures the amount of time it took to establish the connection then the attacker sends another quest to establish another connection and times that request as well then the tiger compares two times that it took to establish the two connections if the time in second time is less than the first time that means that the network flows just at the thought of natural elements and previously did not exist instructional service rep packet tube over the network elements the natick old man becomes malicious the attacker is trying to use the network event to plug the control of with network specific messages I'm a for identification start again the network element had been compromised and the attacker is trying to poison and then the control is you of the network topology by sending some wrong information that long there is no to the network element so this is just a few examples of the threats and attacks that could be derived from the model I have developed each enterprise will use the model to determine what specific threats present the major risk to the network and use the identified price to specify security requirements to address effects and implement litigation measures just to give you an example how you would proceed with this exercise for instance the fact is that the attacker is conducting login attempts to pass for bruising attempts against the management console the security requirement would be an initial consult should not allow an attacker to successful launch as my first person attack against imagine so mitigation measures will be that all vendor before passwords for management and thought should be chief if you security recommendations at the high level to address the dress that I presented in my presentation as far as a network integration of all the separate sensitive critical system put them in the trusted network segments separated for that trusted networks all sdn specific user accounts full customer should be changed as well drunk passed complexity requirements should be followed for this accounts limiting the number of SDN specific girls would help well they let settle accounts you have the less likelihood that your account will be compromised as with additional system caption systems should be down in the time whenever all the communication channels should be protected fielding strong connection and application plane or application should be developed using secure coding guidelines the control plane limit the number of services supports that are open to outside systems again the morn services you riding the more likelihood that they will get exploited implement high mobility of injection for controllers while control is such service another controller should be able to pick up in bootcamp implement integrity checks on the controllers to Detective of verifications and all sentiment rate-limiting and packet drop into the controllers to prevent a lot of service attacks and the data plane all full in certain activities so generating activities should be controlled and now the network flow rules should be verified against the controllers to identify these references I'd like to conclude my presentation with people like I had sound bites this is the thread i have not anticipated the top most important was the portion slices cut out I should have so use the presented is the end Fred model to participate threads in your sdn science and that folks I have developed as I said before the security community so this is you can use them um the model allows for easy duration of security requirements and mitigation measures to increase the state of preparedness the multiple attack if you think that the architecture in that presented is not stir with what you have a nuisance science you may further extended by cooperating specific details of your implementation science but also by virtual via professional and Thurston I think that this model could be a very good foundation for playing in carrying out is the alliteration test so if the companies before me pal destiny is the network you may use the same fat bundle to discuss the threats that have been covered by that test you very much my time with that I'd like to take questions from the audience we're in my model the configuration files will be stored separately figuration files could be found on any of the systems let's say controller has configuration files the configuration files depending of the type of the attack that is being launched it put the launch probe within the controller it could be launched from external system outside of the controller so if we're talking about the Federation files that I be accessed inside the controller then this files could be subject to the five frets actions that I have showed so the files could be modified of Africa fication if all the good be subject to authorize disclosure could be destruction so that would be a circular type of attack controlling gates to controller with the local user engaged in attack you so the type of frats you are discussing first of all they that system that you are talking about is not in this model but it could have been added there and then you are talking about threats that would applicable from within the system itself so you can decompose the system that stores the code into further components and cinnamon before identical you know a simple infection could be 45 modeling for those components but the access system could be in my model would be reference to as an application server if you have any further questions I get outside
