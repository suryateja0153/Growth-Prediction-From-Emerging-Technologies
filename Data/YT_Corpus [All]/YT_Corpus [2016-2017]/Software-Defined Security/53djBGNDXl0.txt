 somebody's Software Defined Networking and what problems is it trying to solve data centers carriers and even enterprise networks have one thing in common they're getting more complex whilst at the same time being asked to become more agile we have faster the changing traffic flows and a bubble just get better at delivering what are constantly changing services ie think elastic and that's where Software Defined Networking or Sdn comes into play existing networks weren't really designed to be dynamic which makes a sort of difficult for them to react to change and they're complex too so the likelihood of getting stuff wrong is pretty high now Sdn helps by abstracting the lower level functionality of the network and moving into what is a normalized control plane and that's where all gets managed or in other words the applications themselves firewall low balancing virtualization etc well they sit as a distinct entity from the physical network and you just get to say well make this happen rather than trying to manage multiple proprietary network elements now the application layer still needs to communicate with the physical infrastructure and that's done via the Sdn controller which communicates northbound to you and southbound to the hardware either by AP is or was now becoming a global standard open flow a protocol license from the open network Foundation and supported by Cisco HP juniper amongst others so the benefits of Sdn are becoming clearer more dynamic networks easier to manage quicker to react and above all more efficient at delivering services when and where they're needed with or without elastic bands you
