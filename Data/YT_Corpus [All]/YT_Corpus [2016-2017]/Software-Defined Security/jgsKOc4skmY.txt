 those people do well naturally anyway I mean I've had people there some of the best people I've interviewed of always say hi everyone I don't think I'm gonna get it I'm gonna fun so uh what we're going to talk about today is really the process of moving from your secure on premise to hybrid and then into cloud I think as you've heard throughout next at Google we're invested in trying to reduce the obstacles the concerns that you don't need to have to accelerate and elevate the way you do development so that you can grow businesses grow your applications and be successful especially in security what we were talking about as always played out is cloud should be the immune system for you to protect you against cyber attacks something you don't have to actively manage something that in fact is there in the background always defending you now we recognize that not all of you in the same space in terms of moving to the third generation cloud many of you are have on-premise facilities have needs to have workloads that are both in an on-premise situation as well as in the cloud and really the key is to for us to give you the controls to allow you to manage to trust the way you need as niels pointed out beyond just the underlying security and trust built into our core platform beneath Google we need to continuously provide you the controls to access those capabilities so you can secure your workloads the way you need them to be so at the core of what we're talking about at Google the security is really based on four key principles trust and transparency control audit compliance and innovation and what we mean by this is it's not just sufficient for us to have superior technology trust that you have in us and what we do is really built and being transparent about things and that's part of Neal's his talk earlier today was one of the steps to give you a sense of what really goes on behind the scenes in addition for control from enterprises and businesses you need the ability to have access to the capabilities to configure and run your business and control the user service data access levels as you need fraud and compliance our commitment is to make sure that addition of the certifications that we have on our cloud we're going to be able to support you to get the certifications that you need to run your businesses and of course we're all focused on innovation right whether it's the machine learning that Jeff talked about the essentially the super power of having cloud machine learning added to your capabilities really the ability to have you focus on your business and then for us to take care of the rest so for today's talk we're going to focus however on folks who are not yet in the generation three cloud right and the common questions we get in security really fall into five main categories right how do you match identify and access control so that the policies that you already have today can be reflected in the cloud that you move to network security how do you create the isolation and trust zones that you need to segregate your users and information as you might like data protection how is your data your users data your customers data protected and how do you control that threats and vulnerabilities how really access to and breeches and intrusions are handled so that you are protected upfront and ultimately audit logging the things that allow you to know what's going on in your systems to know every access every action so in order to do this we're going to use an example to walk you through a step-by-step process of migrating from an on-premise application to a hybrid situation where part of the application runs in cloud and then finally to a full GCP instance now to do this we tried to pick a small representative example application so we've created a meme generation which is built on a lamp stack it has a my sequel database an Apache front-end and basically it allows you to start out in the cloud and in on-premise and we'll move it step by step for so let's go so the first step as we talked about was taking your existing identities and your policies and how does that come with you in cloud so you don't have to change and do other things so to help me talk through that and invite I meet Johnny who is the product manager for I Danny for cloud on to walk you through your identity Federation Thank You Andi your voice so Andy thought any night we're walking through a potential scenario here and we thought it would be kind of fun fun being relative you know last day of a conference kind of fun I guess but to walk through an actual customer type of example right to really represent what our customers go through Andy and I talk to a lot of customers and we've hearing very we switch the outside screen we thought it'd be fun to kind of walk through what that would look like so one of the things we thought we should walk you through is a typical scenario of a customer right you already have an identity provider you already have a source of truth for your identities where you've defined users and groups and what you really want is just to carry that with you into the cloud right and so what you're going to see let's do exactly that we're going to use a IDP we can talk to it insert your name of your identity provider here whether it's Active Directory or anybody else and we're going to fit right though your users and groups to Google and then the next thing we're going to do is just show you how those now exist they're federated all you have to do is assign permissions to your groups and everybody's there and then lastly I think just to prove that this is a federated identity use case we're going to delete a user and identity provider and show you how quickly that reflects so just to highlight what we talked about here you'll see these very complicated art graphics here but you'll see the non Google identity provider your identity user source of truth it gets federated to Google and then you just assign the users that better there so why don't we jump into the demo Andy's gonna drive us for a drive it for us here but you'll see this is our identity provider in this case we use ping you can use any open store you can use any identity provider that you like most of them come with a Google connector as ping does and so the idea is then that you connect ping to your Google environment and your source of truth is now connected so here you'll see in very simplified example we have users that are assigned here and each of these users are already assigned to a group and so Andy will show you here that these groups exist and I think the key wants to focus on are the network administrator the network viewer and the security administrator these are the sample types of groups that we've created and the users that we've talked about earlier which were Bob Bob Amy and AJ who are signed into each of these groups and we'll see how that carries over when you get into cloud so then I once you've federated it so here's examples of that group once those users are and groups are federated you'll be able to come to your Google console at which Andy will do now and you'll be able to see both of those things right - just to prove that it is in fact federated when you make a change in your identity provider the users show up here so here you'll see Bob AJ and of course Amy reflected here and they're already assigned to those groups because the groups have also been federated with you so as you click into AJ for example you'll be able to see he's already a member of this group in this case the network viewer group and the same will be true for Bob and the same will be true for Amy as well right in this example just just to quickly touch on those users those roles where the rules are network viewer is obviously a read-only kind of role a network admin is somebody who can create new networks and take networking type functionality and a security admin our hero of the story here is the one who can do security actions but not necessarily network actions so then why don't we jump into the iam windows so those of you who are familiar you come into the cloud console you'll see Andy's already created those the group's already there they pre populate when you do a search or when you do when you create a new member and he's assign them to a group so here you can see the roles already assigned compute network admin compute network viewer and of course computer the computer security admin so those are predefined roles that already exist within I am and you can just assign them to the group note here we didn't assign a single user to a role there that automatically gets inherited when you become a member of that group so why don't we we've kind of done the setup here why don't we actually live a day in the life of loose pretend we're a me amy was the security administrator so amy comes in she logs into our single sign-on system here and then she should get redirected directly into the Google castle the Google Cloud console or not you've got a console of that developer just as a show of hands how many of you are using ping just out of curiosity turn understand okay how many I'm guessing most of you are Active Directory okay that's what I figured are there others of note that we should you can scream I'm out whoa Google okay so here you see a now Amy's logged in you can see that she's in fact logged in she's because she's a security administrator she really has no business going through comment dashboards and GAE screens and GCE screens so we'll jump into the networking screen here remember she's a security administrator so when we come to networks as the option you'll see she cannot in fact create networks she can't do firewalls you can't do our student she can't do VPNs she can't do routers and things like that but in fact when she goes into firewalls she should be able to create a firewall she is a security administrator right and and take the action there so again she's already been assigned the role without having to explicitly do that if we were to do the same for a bob for example we can we can come in and be Bob for a moment you can see in this case that's me but okay here we are at Bob again bob is a network administrator so no need to be in any comment screen here but if you jump into the networking you'll find what you expect right that Bob can in fact create networks can create the VPNs can create DNS load balancers but when you take it to the firewall rules of course is unable to do anything there and then we can do the same for AJ as well right AJ again had a viewer role so we'd have well let andy jump into the yep here we go so that we can jump into the networking itself and you find in fact only read-only screens right you can take action it can only take viewership I can't do any actions themselves as expected right no rocket science here so I think that's kind of the high-level overview of the identity sync today most commercial and almost all open-source identity providers have a natural bridge into Google Apps and Google so that should naturally work but let's walk through an example we talked about concluding here with the showing true Federation so why don't we delete AJ and then when you go into admin console and do a refresh you'll find that AJ fingers crossed will have disappeared from all this there you go AJ is no longer there so it's it's a live system it happens instantaneously so you don't have to the minute somebody decides to go on to better opportunities and are no longer at your cut but you're able to remove them premiere identity provider and they completely get shutdown from access to the cloud console so that's that's the high-level summary here Andy why don't I transition it back to you yep so lesson number one from migrating from your on-premise situation to either a hybrid or cloud is that you in fact can bring your identities you don't need to recreate them you're able to federate and use the existing privileges and I am to enforce them so the next thing where you talk about is the hybrid cloud and so what do we mean by the hybrid Club so today what we're going to talk to you about is first from the mean jem app in the on-premise situation and those you probably can't see it but this is actually the on-premise server so if we go to that on-premise server this is the meme gem app for that server and it's a little tiny on-premise server it's live the other thing we'll talk about is the project that we just showed you the controls and I am for so it's the mean gen next 16 application and today we have a front end so we've split it now so that we're gonna move keep the back end on the server and have the front end showed up in cloud so this is the front end the instance PHP piece and right now though if I go to that one that web site you notice it's not connecting anything because we actually haven't created H VPN a trusted connection between the two so we're going to fix that so what we're going to do now is leverage the networking that we just talked about before so I'm logged in as kanji and kanji if you'll write remember whoops is one of the other roles that create it has both network permissions and also has security permissions oops so as someone who has Network Commission's and security permissions he's able to basically go as we said before not do anything with the main dashboard but he can create both Networks VPNs and routes so we're going to create a VPN so currently there's a VPN we're going to connect the front piece which was the instance to the back end and we're going to use the sub Network that's created leveraging the sub network technology we have it's in the US central region and we create a static IP address so we can do the VPN connection so we'll use that now on the other side we need a similar static IP address which we've locked in for the on-premise example it's i ke v2 and we need a shared secret now I would not recommend this shared secrets because it's a little bit simple but for the purposes of this demonstration we're going to go ahead and use that so now we have to use the local connections here and then connect to the subnet now for the sake of this demo we're showing this through menus but in fact you can have the run g-cloud in our sdk so the same commands can be scripted or if you're running purely in the services mode we give you the api's to allow you to run this - so at scale instead of in this simple example you would be doing this with automation so let's go ahead and create this VPN so now it's going to take a little bit time for the VPN to load so while we're doing this we'll talk about what's going on so as we said before from the on-premise server we have the my sequel database and we're connecting to a front-end instance each of the VMS has its own individual firewalls so we had to set the details for the firewall and we'll show that a little bit the web applications of the front-end now each of the individual identities has different control over the settings the ability to either control the VPN the firewall and underlying pieces so as what we're taking advantage of here is really several things in our now that the features on our network the ability to create private IP spaces so that when you connect to us you're no longer traveling on the open Internet you're travelling within our private network and your traffic stays on our private network encrypted as it moves for in addition we're taking advantage of the ability how sudden networks the ability really lock in and segment your trust the way you need to based on how you want to control the connections and access between roles and finally we're taking advantage of the VPN so as you notice now that the the VPN connection is green so we're going to go back and see if we can hit that same node before and see if it's connected so and so we are we're now connected and we're on our way to full clap so basically we have the database the my sequel database connected on the back end we have the PHP front-end serving up traffic so one of the steps of the ways they're using our network and our and capabilities to allow us to get there so lesson number two you can create the zones of trust that you need by leveraging the capabilities and network that we've talked about in addition one of the opportunities when you have the front-end now on GCP is also leverage the load balancing that you heard about yesterday in the networking talk which gives you both performance scaling and also amount of DDoS protection built in so the next thing we're going to talk about is going to full GCP so going back again to the is the underlying and so you'll make sure we're the right course so going back again to from a role standpoint to an owner role I can take a look at again they brought the overall project and with the go look at the overall project we have in addition to the front-end that we just triggered which is this one we also have the ability to go back and look at the full lamp stack version so we've done is set up a full abstract version we've migrated everything over the other thing if you guys were paying attention when I showed you each of the first two the on premise one and also the hybrid one those were actually only an HDTV P so at Google obviously we're big fans and implement TLS and SSH so this is actually a full HTTP connection on on our Google cloud platform implementing the my sequel database as well as the PHP front-end now once you get fully on our cloud the question is you have now moved your data here but how do we connect and continue to connect so that you can do this fast so we have a large number of different ways for you to migrate your data on to our clouds through VPN through direct peering through your internet working in addition once your data is in our cloud really the question is how do we protect it so we really give you three options of how to protect your data first by default your data is encrypted and it's actually encrypted three ways the underlying data is first charted and chunked then each of those pieces are encrypted the chunk key is then encrypted and a wraping key around the chunk key is encrypted and those are then stored in a key store which manages and rotates them as necessary or if you want to encrypt your data before you give it to us you certainly have that option you have full control in that case finally you can give us customer supplied keys and then we can go ahead and trip things for you without us being able to actually look at your data additionally yesterday I think we talked to you about audit logging so what we're going to show you is this is a screenshot we're going to show you the live logs again off of this GCP instance so what we're seeing here now is the events that created after the firewall we can look at the events that create off the meme Network which is the sub Network and all those things are accessible to you both in the activity stream you can search on them we can filter out purely on activity we can filter out and looking at a range of resources within all the resources within compute and if you look at all the different resources the choices allow you to look at a wide range of both packets changes in iam permissions therefore than other pieces so finally when you think about going on to a platform it's important that the underlying platform has the governance and the compliance pieces that you need in case you need to run those for your business so the Google cloud platform is regularly certified for sock to and sock 3 ISO 27001 and then PCI DSS 3 zero and we're engaged in supporting you to get the end-to-end certifications as you run your business on partially on our cloud as well as the other pieces that you that you're running in your own business so lesson number three if when you once you are comfortable with bringing the data on to our cloud you're then fully encrypted by default and your TLS everywhere but this is really just getting you to where you are now moved from offer on premise to a cloud environment but you're still at this point using the cloud in a way similar to how you would have before and your on-premise as we've talked about throughout next the next the what we really want you to be able to do is focus on building great apps and great businesses and let us take care of the operations and really live in a server list kind of environment so since we've been talking about security another thing you may have noticed is you know we talked about lamp stack but it's all in PHP so how do you deal with that all right so PHP has a range of security vulnerabilities that people try to exploit and part of that then is for us to implement as we have automated scanning so if you bring your applications to our App Engine product we have in general availability cloud security scanner it's an optimum its website scanner that basically finds some of the most common vulnerabilities proactively before you deploy an example here is if you look at the OS top-10 injection cross-site scripting components with known vulnerabilities those are all very common things that occur in Web Apps and cause breaches so our security scanner detects cross-site scripting mixed content insecure libraries and in 2016 we'll be rolling out in addition to sequel injection and also the bilious scan applications on GCE and other other installations in addition we'll be able to tie user features around notifications for you and the ability to automate those skins so what now we're going to show you a little bit is how to actually how the scanner works so what we have here is an application which we call firing range we open source that a couple years ago it is the basis on which most web vulnerability scanners test against to make sure they find sources of cross-site scripting mixing the mixed content and library pieces so we're going to do is show you what one of these scan results looks like so in this project we have an application called public firing range if you're in App Engine you get a tab that's specifically security scans and then you're able to look at a range of scan results so if we look at the scans that we ran last night it hit 657 URLs in the application and feyten to over 600 vulnerabilities and those vulnerabilities range from cross-site scripting 420 of them an old library mixed content so for example the particular application uses jQuery that's out of date so that would be an immediate flag and something you could fix in addition we have in detail for the cross site scripting errors the ability for you to drill down into each of these errors and in fact both replicate it to find out where it actually occurs in your code fix it remediate it and this is all in development before you deploy to production so it catches things before they actually hit production currently what we've seen with folks who've used the security scanner is that when it's a cross-site scripting error once identified 80% of the users go back and in fact fix it and remediate so that's a large number of potential vulnerabilities that have been eliminated before any of the code hits production so the lesson really then is continue to move to higher levels of abstraction right abstraction automation of your friends and we provide you the ability to leverage that today through App Engine through bigquery and through data flow so you're really living the server list kind of no operations mode and that becomes a next step of what you can do once you've gone from on-premise to hybrid to and then to the true third-generation cloud so finally you know what's next after this in recap what we've talked about is identity Federation the ability for you when you already have in place installs to take those with you for us for you not to have to recreate them and for us to basically respect them enforce the roles and access policies that you have in addition we talked about the network security needed to isolate and create the trust owns that you have through VPN through the sub networking talked about the data protection the built-in encryption as well as the control that you have to further encrypt and protect your data and then we talked about the logging and then the abstractions and automation so ultimately what's next after this from the cloud security side those of you have done some of the code labs the specific details of how we've built each of these pieces which we wouldn't couldn't get into today on stage you can actually walk through each step in the code lab in addition the cloud security scanner highly recommend that you guys try it out its ability to find vulnerabilities its ability to be very very low noise and high signal so that you can remediate directly and then on the app side once it's on ji-ae there's a couple different options so we talked about going to App Engine directly or to App Engine managed VMs where you can bring your own programming system that you're more comfortable and familiar with moving the my sequel to cloud sequel and that particularly for this application which is image centric to take advantage of the machine vision API is that we have so with that again for us the ability to go for a third-generation cloud is really the ability to combine security and innovation and really build what's next so thank you guys and both the meet myself will be around to have any questions you you
