 my name is Craig Mills I'm the global product line manager so HP has regional and global that basically means I work with customers and Ardie make sure that our Andy builds the things customers need and then walk things through the the process to actually get it out the door Sdn whoo-hoo has a definition they want to share for Sdn I still don't know we have a TV called sue dark she calls it soo dark networking Software Defined Networking what does that mean why do you care why is it a big term some people claim they've been doing it forever it's probably a little bit between all of those Sdn and what HP has built in the past and what we're bringing to the Aruba family is really kind of the capabilities around OpenFlow specifically HP started working with Stanford in 2007 on a research project that grew into open flow and so we have a lot of background and a lot of knowledge that we've been able to bring in to those types of solutions if you talk Sdn in the data center you're going to be talking to overlays orchestration some people talk about puppet chef ansible as kind of automation and scripting languages and those are all Sdn depends who you talk to clearpass I think is especially now that you've got some of the feedback loops through Palo Alto in there that's doing some policy pushes with some triggers that's a Sdn and certainly in the wireless networks the controller and what it does you know there's a lot of definition of what's happening on the network with the software so in the broadest sense I'd say the entire networking industry is moving towards Sdn if you think of it is just how are the software influences the network specifically in this talk or what we're covering is the Sdn solutions HP's built around open flow and its network devices so the wired devices we've got three solutions that HP is built and released we have a controller that's an HP controller we have a visibility app the security application and an optimization application is anyone familiar with what we have are you here to for the first time I know a few people at least from the teamís are familiar with it I hope this is my second at air heads my first one was about an hour ago so I'm looking for feedback if I've got the right level let me know if I should include more details less details more times on solutions this is the kind of the general representation of the portfolio the Sdn solutions over there on the side they work against think we repurposed a controller but we have a controller that doesn't actually look like that we have a software appliance and OVA and some packages to install if you want higher scale but basically it's our Sdn solutions work against the wired side of the network the open flow enabled capable switches mainly the Aruba OS so when we talk about Sdn especially in the campus it's all the Aruba branded switches okay this is a fifty four thirty eight and twenty nine series feel free to ask questions because that's what I'm here for this is a general diagram of where you should be putting the Sdn components so up here you've got whatever the master controller is that's again where you would put the Sdn controller in its apps a lot of conversations I hear around Sdn is people think of it as a management platform and so they want to be able to manage you know 500 sites all their switches with an SDN controller that's really not the right way to partition it in your mind a right place that it has it's really much more equivalent to like a wireless controller where it has a little bit more local geography that it's driving state or some state in the network so you want it to be there and be it have the right failure domain you don't want it controlling everything all over the place the term controller if anyone has a better name we've thought about Orchestrator controller it's not a controller in the wireless sense in that the data path is not going through this device okay the Aruba controller them the majority deployment model is to take all the wireless a fake send it to the controller and then process it and send it onto the network so you're in the data path on the Sdn controller it is supposed to take the control plane and then make adjustments to the control plane and push that back out into the wired infrastructure so that it does not participate in the data path okay there's sometimes people get confused around controller wondering if all our data is going through that that's not what it does with the Sdn okay so the Sdn provides us a raw building blocks to build solutions on top of we've been talking about Sdn for a while from the HP side and assuming some of its going to be new to the to the yoruba teams the uber customers we're trying to talk now more about a little it's a desti ends of technology it's a way to do things and we want to start telling you what you can do with it that's interesting getting down into the nuts and bolts we can do that if you want to but it's almost like having a conversation around ethernet it's there it works what can I do with it all right so what what can I do with it that's important um you know is your voice how do you get better voice experience how do you keep your user base doing what it's supposed to be doing and not letting them do whatever they can dream up and how do you have better visibility and understanding of what's happening on the network those are some of the things that we're trying to bring to networking and especially the wired side through Sdn I'd say on the wireless side with the controller you've got a lot of that you've got perfect visitability into the traffic because you have that central location that one controller where you're bringing everything back so there's a lot of these components and capabilities you can do on the wireless side at least in the controller model that's much more difficult on the wired side and Sdn and the apps we've built has bringing some of that capability into the wired environment so today rolling out new solutions or new applications it's a very lengthy process if you want to vote out roll out a new Kwas Paul see across your network you're touching hundreds or you know potentially thousands of switches trying to update it and now you've got two policies at the same time across your network it's a very laborious and and often let's say Arab phone process there's some automation tools to help with that Sdn kind of takes it and flips it's on its side is why do you want to have a static policy let's make it dynamic and that's really where Sdn starts to shine right you can use there's a lot of tools says to blow out policy where Sdn comes in adds values if you want that policy to be more dynamic and reactive have it be able to take in too you know having other things feed into that besides just a sign-on or just a flat quas policy you can now have it be reactive so for an example if you've got congestion on your link maybe you want to deprioritize some traffic reprioritize other and have that be automated and not have a human in the middle helping make those decisions this is a very high level diagram of what we have with Sdn I want to make sure we're all doing a level set as it has everyone seen this before first time or first time for people if raise your hand so I know where we are all right excellent then I hit the right level we're good across the bottom you've got your network devices these would be generally switches there was a few other things that do Sdn but for our solution space it's going to be switches we have an SDN controller HP's written its own controller we've been writing it for about four and a half five years it's in use it's one of the there's not anybody out there that does a performance testing of controllers today but we have customers services provide our customers who've looked at multiple controllers and settled on ours because of its performance and capabilities so we feel we've got the right one when there's conformance testing well we'll join in and show everybody and then the applications and orchestration those are kind of the three levels if you look into Sdn and you start talking reading up in the literature you often hear about a northbound interface and a southbound interface all that is relative to the controller so the northbound out of the controller will be essentially the api's that people write applications to the southbound is going to be the protocols and communication used to push policy into the network okay so it's all relative to the controller a lot of our customers who rolled Sdn now on their production networks have been surprised at how easy it was maybe this the protocol we use OpenFlow because it came from Stanford and we've worked with them it might I'd say it's still in its early days its mature enough and I think HP has enough experience with it to do the right things and we are but there's been a little bit of hesitancy because people don't understand how it works on their network and they're a little nervous the customers we've had who've deployed it said it's been extremely easy you can turn it on by VLAN by switch you can turn it off you can pull out the controller and especially with the apps we have basically those applications are no longer making changes to the network and so you might lose the value of that application but you're not impacting the data path you're not impacting connectivity okay so we've gone through a lot of effort to make sure our applications are at value add to your network and not getting down in and redirecting some of the early conversations around Sdn were wouldn't it be great to get rid of spanning tree and while I completely agree with that concept that's not what we're doing here we don't want to get down into the guts spanning tree does work as painful as it is OSPF works we don't want to recreate it we're trying to add value on top of what I've already exists in your network so today you've got this control plane it's OSPF spanning tree I don't know why someone putting that comp like this slide got out in the wild some time every time I find it I change it apparently I forgot that's supposed to be spanning tree so you've got this set of protocols that determines how traffic's going to get forward in your network how it's going to be marked that exists today what we've done with Sdn is we have a controller and some applications that are able to drive basically additional context into these devices so that you can add value on top of it and the way we do our implementation there's the existing ACLs the existing OSPF all of that functions on your network traffic and we go in and we make small tweaks to that to add value okay so I'm gonna walk you through how we do that the OpenFlow protocol has expects a series of tables it so basically the protocol allows you to reach down into the network devices and add entries into some of the hardware tables okay the way we use open flow is the controller will stick a single rule down in your devices would say match all the traffic and do what you would normally do to it and that's our baseline it's the last rule hit so that every all traffic will hit that rule and just take the normal path with open flow if you don't have that and you fall through the bottom of the table the spec says you send it up to the controller so the controller can decide what to do with the packet that's great and a little bit more of an academic or if you want to build something like a single appliance you take one switch and have it be a firewall you can do something like that and that would make perfect sense to send all new flows to a controller but for a general network if we don't know something special to do with it just do what you would normally do that's great but now nothing's getting sent up to the controller alright we've just said don't send anything to the controller just do what you normally do great performance everything still works you've got Sdn but your controller is completely blind it doesn't know what's happening to the network so as part of our controller we drop in a few additional rules we send copies of the DHCP s and some of the Arps up to the controller now the controller knows which device the IP MAC address and the device and which switch port that device is connected to so now the controller has some idea of where all the clients are in addition we do a steal so we take the original packet we don't allow it to transfer through the box be DDP is a lot like lldp it has the same packet contents just a different ether type and we use that to track connectivity between switches so now we identify the infrastructure links between network devices and all the hosts connected to the network so with that little bit of data now the controller has visibility into the network a little bit of understanding of how it's all connected where of all the hosts are ok that's kind of the baseline that we start with and that's how we get both capabilities all right this normal means you're going to go back and hit your normal ACLs and these allow you to have visibility and understanding so that your applications can do something meaningful ok this is pretty important I want to make sure we all get this any questions concerns you look concerned just stretching ok all right so then one of our applications inspects DNS and so we put down a match all the UDP 53 traffic and steal it to the controller so steel again means we take the original packet we don't let it traverse through the network and we send it up to our controller when it's up at the controller our application takes it compares the name that you're trying to resolve against a reputation database to see if it's worth resolving right if it's if the name you're trying to resolve is I can do it mancom which you should never ever type in then you will fail our reputation feed because that's a known malicious site it's got viruses malware botnets all sorts of bad stuff there and we can deny that we basically send back a no such network and you don't resolve the dns so a lot of people say well you can do this with URL filters with web content and that's true you can do it with certain dns servers which have a a filtered list of DNS the difference with this is if you've done this once or twice it's a bad click you didn't mean to go there it's not a big deal we just didn't resolve the DNS name it's fine if we see a bunch of those in short amount of time it's more likely a virus trying to connect back to command-and-control trying to download other pieces to help it along and then we detect how often you're trying to connect to that and who the user is and what the device is so the application keeps track and has memory of how many of these malicious hits you've done in a certain amount of time and then we trigger an additional action so the additional actions would be quarantine eing deeper inspection redirection all those that we can take yeah yeah so the app sorry is that I've been using them interchangeably but yeah the application would be the one that triggers the action and it's also doing the inspection yes yeah our controller you can either write applications that it's in Java you can do a Norris GI model where it basically locks it in or through restful api calls but most of ours are built into the controller these are the product lines that we work against the 54-hundred are the 3810 and 29:20 those are the current generations of the products if you have older versions the 5400 and the 3800 most of our existing optic I think all of our existing applications would work across those as well um as you go further back in time you get less and less capabilities and certainly going forward these would be the new products ok so I don't think we have any cap members in here every every year we get a group of 420 customers together selected from a hat make sure we get a random mix and we tell them about all the things we're doing we're thinking about doing we lock them away away in a room for like three days it's it's a little brutal they get nice nice food but that's about it and we walk them through what we're planning and then we get feedback and some of the feedback we got a few years ago I think March 2014 was there was a big concern in the room on the amount of time it took for the network team to prove that it was not a network issue all right and basically the quote that came out of that was mean time to innocence what's the average amount of time it takes the network guy to prove it's not the network and that was kind of the impetus for this tool it's for the network team is trying to give the network team a new set of tools to do their job instead of you know scraping through config files every time something is wrong to give you a different way to investigate what's happening so what we do with this application is we have the Sdn controller we have the Sdn capable devices at the edge of the network and we can reach into those devices and select specific traffic to take captures of them we do that the neat thing about Sdn is you can take data from outside the network and feed it in so for this example we've connected up to clear paths in Active Directory so now you can start grabbing data based off of those information so you can do you search through by user group and then by user you can say give me that users traffic for 20 seconds give me that users traffic that's telnet give me that users web traffic to this address so you can really narrow down in exactly what you want or you can go fairly broad and it's a hardware connection from the switch back to the application in a hardware tunnel we also support a of apposite Ori so you can send that traffic off and have it stored so you can have a repository in San Francisco and you could be working in New York you can spin up our capture to that repository and then download that it ends up in a peak app form on the repository and you can download it and take a look at it so this is first came out in June 2015 and then the latest version the 1.1 just came out in the next it's either out posted on the web now or in the next few days it will be and we also put in this one one the ability for clearpass to trigger these captures and that's where I think we're starting to really enable some of those higher-level capabilities so anything that clearpass can trigger off of whether it's a Palo Alto or some other trigger you can now spin up a capture so if you want to replay security events if you have a trigger and you want to just grab a security copy to go back and look through this would be a tool that gives you the API to do that and the thing that might make it different from others is we're not doing it as an IPS or a firewall as you leave the organization we're doing it right here as your packet hits that first switch and grabbing it there any questions of step so there's the controller and then the application there's a two pieces there's a I think are you doing just just visualizer or more than visualizer so there's a live demos tomorrow there's a session at 10:00 10:30 or 10:30 and Scott's gonna walk through live demos of some of the applications this is our Rd Network the green ones are the switches the yellow ones are the orange ones are the hosts and this is just there's some interesting things you can do we've because Sdn collects a lot of information we have all the MAC addresses IP addresses even usernames when you've hooked it up we have our just a regex search engine so you can type in part of the IP address and we'll highlight it where it is on the diagram so you can see it then you can you know click on it and say capture this traffic and we can go off and start capturing so there's a few ways to get to get at this data in addition we do a path trace and we do it a bit differently than some systems some systems rely on the route table and inspect that because we have Sdn and we have the ability to reach down in in match traffic we put rules down in the device to say you know this is the pattern I want to match this source IP this destination IP and we look for the counters on all the ports and then whichever port has counters that match you know it's gone up by 10 or 12 packets we know that's where the traffic's going and then we look at what's the next switch lay it down again and that's how we can walk the path end-to-end and so it doesn't matter what your PBR rules or your or SPF if you're having a routing loop we'll be able to see the loop and and find the packets in addition this is new R&D just came out with this a couple weeks ago so there's obviously still a few little gotchas with the GUI they give me the number upside down kind of figure out how they get that sorted but on top of that path once you've figured out how the path through the network that is taking to get to two devices the second one is down here I guess we can go and we put those same rules down on the links but we put it down at the same time and we say to count it for I think the default is 30 seconds so we put it down count all the packets that match that and then we can show you so you can see okay I've got 30 packets here 30 packets here and then if there's one link that drops down to 10 packets then you know which device you have to go look at in more detail to find out what's going on why am i dropping packets at that device so once again this is just a new feature trying to give you more visibility into what's actually happening on the network we have this down in the tech playground if you want to see it and also Scott's going to have some live demos tomorrow in this session feel free to ask questions not just the guy in the back he's so another application we have is our security application HP network protector this is the one we were talking about with the DNS and so we suck up the DNS off of the ingress network off of those access switches compare it against a reputation and then there's a few actions we can take one of the actions is we drop it so we send no such Network back to the host they don't resolve the DNS they don't connect we count it we can alarm we can quarantine and going forward we're connecting in with a tipping point IPS so we can spin up a hardware tunnel in the device and then redirect all that clients traffic to the IPS for inspection after it's been inspected we take it back to that network device and allow it to actually enter the normal network path so this would not be for all devices all the time you'd have to have a huge IPS to support that what this is for is to take an IPS and be able to have it round-robin around your network or as new devices come on the network look at it for the first 5 or 10 minutes usually if you have a virus it's going to show up and that was first couple minutes and this way you have a ability to keep your network clean the way I describe it to a lot of people is I ask them where do you have your IPS you know I go yeah it's you know right right in that DMZ you as we go to the Internet and like thank you so much you are doing a great job keeping the internet clean from all those viruses my bad dirty laptop connects to your network and it tries to get out to the Internet you stop it thank you well what are you doing for east-west with that virus and that the security guys don't like that right they they get upset the network guys find it funny takes it off today it doesn't today through our site certainly there's there's work being done to integrate this more with clear paths much as the visualizer application was integrated for the user information so you can get better user clarity yes so today this is very wired focus and certainly part of this HP or uber integration it's amazing ever these two big companies come together but that's some of the stuff we're looking at is how do we take these capabilities and make it applicable across the entire access network so you get these I think we've kind of walked through what we do here there's another example of something never ever to go - pirates must die comm is another you're sure to trigger all the security events you want when you go to that so South Washington County is the school direct with district with 30,000 students they've been using this for about a year and a half maybe two years they've gotten a lot of use out of it and especially with BYOD because you're not installing a client on the device that virus detection at least you have some level of virus detection built into the network now and your ability to take action at the edge any questions about protector yep you so I think at least in the air tech near-term ArcSight seems to be the spot that everyone's gonna feedback to much as we have the API around visualizer for driving capture sessions we do want to create an API around this to spin up either the IPS as a service or the quarantine II so if you have other security sensors you could use this to take the action part but again that would be through restful api is i know in the last session someone mentioned Styx as a security kind of configuration protocol that might want to integrate with hi no no that's fine there's a Fortinet built an SDN application it's available in our ecosystem that kind of extends its firewalling capability I know not an expert on that one but just for the rest of the audience if their firewall detects something that they shouldn't be allowing it drops it to the SDN application which then blocks it at the source so you've got less traffic hitting your firewall that it has to drop I think they've got three phases planned I think that's the phase one implementation yeah that's certainly on our list is how do we extend beyond just a tipping point solution into the other vendors there are some stuff that we've done in the technology we use that was a the route to market that had the greatest speed was to work with tipping point now that we've got that out and we've got some experience we're going to generalize it so it's easier to integrate with the other other vendors so this was all built on our wired product line and so it functions well today on our wired product line with the integration of Aruba there's a lot of thought around how do we bring at least the capabilities that these apps provide to that platform whether it be via Sdn or something else I think is still still under investigation but certainly the value of these the ability to grab packets off anyone no matter where they are there's a great value the ability to redirect through an IPS off triggers it's great value so those the value side we're definitely trying to bring to the whole platform so this application is very similar to the Ruby UCC yeah I think that sides Aruba the wireless side they have an SDN API that they listen to Skype for business on the uber one because they're in the data path they also do a lot more all right so they identify a bunch of voice calls based off of some heuristics so on the Sdn applications we only do it for Skype for business we listen to that API that's the only driver we have today and what that allows us to do is well we got some excellence in Sdn but what it allows us to do is go in and as a user makes a call from James to Linda they send a request up to the link or scribe for business controller the API gets sent across to our application the network optimizer this API includes things like this source and destination the caller and callee their network addressing what type of their connection is it going to be voice and video only voice desktop sharing and what TCP and UDP port numbers are going to be using so we get all the connectivity information about the flows that are going to be established between these two devices that's that message is sent right after the call is connected and so the first few packets will go through the network without any QoS in this setup but the next thing we do is we go down and we push QoS remarking rules into the two ingress switches so as the traffic enters the network it gets reset to the right dscp and an L to Kwas markings that allows us to dynamically set the QoS per flow for this application much as visualizer we're extending this we want to put the API around it so that anyone can make a call and set Kwas by flow there's a few unique things about it the Skype for business tends to use a very large port range for a voice video and desktop sharing so creating an ACL that matches it is the not theirs if you jump through enough hoops I hear it's possible most of the customers we talked to don't haven't been able to jump through those hoops so that's where this really comes in you can go through and you can set voice to a certain quality video to a certain marking and desktop sharing at the end of the call we also give statistics on the qqe metrics and so we know the QE metrics but we also can correlate those for you so the topology we have a topology diagram of the network and we color code the switches in that diagram based on how many calls of bad quality that you have so you can go through and say show me all the bad video calls and we can color code kind of heat map description of your wired network to show you where all those bad video calls were originating from so just trying to give you another set of tools to quickly go through and see where you're having linked many problems on the network yeah it's any of these certainly it's the access layer is what's required up above we don't take any action the only application that moves above the access is the visualizer one for the path trace but all the others just require either the 54 38 or 29 at the edge but it's another unique thing about the Sdn solutions we have a lot of Sdn solutions are talking about is it's basically like setting up a hardware connection from the edge all the way through the network to do certain things that's not what our solutions do we mark them at the edge all of our Sdn adds value at the edge device but not deeper into the network so you don't have to go edge to edge with it you don't have to replace your core or even your distribution you can give value just by putting it on the edge devices Delsin college it's an hour or two outside Amsterdam they've got 15,000 students 1200 staff they've been using network optimizer for about a year and a half and they've been getting a lot of value at it they came back and added a Kemp load balancer which is another Sdn application we have it it allows the Kemp load balancer looks at some of the packets the amount of actual network traffic going to each of the devices it's a load balancing for and uses that as part of the algorithm to determine how to share it so if you're doing a backup or you're doing an upgrade it takes that into account and moves some of the load off to other devices but they've come they found enough value and network optimizer to come back and get other solutions to deploy as well so the Kemp load balancer is part of our open ecosystem we have an SDK on top of the controller so you can write your own apps you might laugh but we've had several of sales guys and I guess they're the Technical Sales guys write applications one guy bought an application in a weekend just to prove a point the customer had a database a development database and every time a developer wanted to test what was going on they had a patch panel they had to get someone to go in and change the cables around and then that developer could see the raw feed of what was happening one of our essays brought an application in three days basically it said take everything that goes in port one sent it out port ten and then through this application you could say now send it out port five and so it became just a switch but it was a you know web interface they didn't have anyone go in the data center anymore just a simple ability to say everything that goes in port five now send out port two now send it out port 10 and they were able to take that same feed that they shared across all the developers that used to take a person to go in the lab to change now they could do it through a web interface so it's very simple little app but the customer was a static they're like ah saves us hours of time now we're not getting someone running in and out of the data center and so that's kind of the use of that SDK but you don't have to be a network program you don't have to be writing embedded C code there's little things you can do to add value that are pretty easy on top of this yeah so there's a lot of Sdn enabled ports and it's part of our mainline switch code you can't get switch code without open flow in it I've got a bunch of downloads of the different pieces we've got Java and rest and Python api's and then the Sdn developer's kit these are some of our partners that are creating solutions are signed up and some of the solutions they've created my boss real status questions Obama Foods is just another company that we've been working with and they've deployed optimiser corner a while ago and they've gone back and added a blue cat DNS that makes sure that you're using the right DNS I'm sure it does other things but the one feature I know it does is make sure that everyone within the company is using their DNS servers not random ones off the internet the real status is kind of a monitoring tool allows you to see the connectivity and ports and VLANs assignments I think so we've we're coming out with a new release now I think it's being posted in the next few days and it comes in two forms either an OVA or a wall package the wall package was kind of our little bit of our data center or legacy if your Linux admin you can go that route if you're not a Linux admin I'd stick with the OVA the OVA is 5-10 minutes you're up and running the OVA I think we've got it rated for 500 switches and it takes 8 or 16 8 or 16 gigs and a course I think it must be 16 gig and a cores is what we suggest for the in the OVA on the other side you can scale up higher I think the if you go hard where we are indeed tells me 4000 I feel much more comfortable with 2,000 switches but that's what we're getting if you go with the hardware one so I any questions this there's another deep dive I think this one already happened or what's happening now there might be one more session yeah both of these Scott and I are at the tech playground two shows a day for the next day and a half and then there's some some more information over here on the side if you want to see the live demo please do step by the tech playground we have some OVA s on the stick you can take home and play with especially if you have some HP switches if you don't have some HP switches it's you know you can use mini net but it's not quite the same but stop by the booth listen to us listen to another pitch for five minutes and we'll get you get you an OVA to take home any more questions comments you guys are quiet is just spitting rowdiness yeah yeah yeah it's day three in Vegas we're all yeah so did so that's where I started at the beginning of the talk Sdn covers a wide range of protocols capabilities and expectations from customers in the data center a lot of the value out of Sdn has been around either automating configuration or virtual orchestration of the virtualization layer so that's what the DCN brings to the table in the data center the it's a little bit moving very quickly we've got OpenStack with a dcn we've got our Sdn controller which is in our cloud cloud OS from HP I think I think finding the right mix of technologies is still evolving there we've got a lot of stuff going on with odl which is open daylight it's a open source controller we've been pretty active in that and driving in the capabilities we need HP is a big company we also have an NFV business unit and we have a cloud business unit and so a lot of those solutions are actually being driven more into the nfe in the cloud space so I can I can get you better answers and hook up with me afterwards any other questions so certainly the if you stop by our booth and we give you the ova it's it's the controller and visualizer pre licensed it's good on fifty switches for five months and you can go play with that certainly the controller OVA you can download a test version which i think is good for sixty days and then you can put download at least the HP apps you can download test versions of those which are good for sixty days um so you can you can dip your toes and and start finding out how it works the OVA z' is the right way to go with that it's it's literally ten 15 minutes and it's spun up yeah so it uses open flow which is a standard but i'd say it's a standard that's not it's it's the standard in the way that we all wish they weren't right it's a standard which is not necessarily vendor agnostic at the moment and that goes back to it's still a little bit young i'm HP's been doing it a long time i think we do a very good job at it but as far as interoperability it's not not quite there we work with OBS we work with our switches there's some simple stuff that should work but we haven't put the time and effort into enabling other people's just because each company's implementation is is different anyone didn't want to go deeper into a topic I'm here to have conversations so come on up if you want to go deeper in depth I want to make sure we hit the nice got everybody level set got everybody understanding it I didn't want to go too deep and lose half the audience so I think I think I was at the right level if you want more come on up and we can we can dive in no I'm supposed to show you show you this I'm sure you've been seeing it in every session there was some speaking notes with it which I read through once and they didn't really stick but I think you're supposed to go tweet get a t-shirt sign up
