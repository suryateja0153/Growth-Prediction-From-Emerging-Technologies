 well I would like to welcome you all to this managed engine webinar the 80 solutions team is very glad that you took a little bit of time out of your day to join us for what we consider to be one of the hottest topics in the industry right now which is all around security and really what we've tried to do is we've tried to build not only one but an entire suite of resources for organizations and Active Directory administrators to go to get information about how to really harden the security of your Active Directory environment not only of your domain controllers but also your Windows servers so we have a little bit of time with you this morning for some of you it's the afternoon and for some it's even the evening and we want to try to get you as much information as possible and point you to some resources just to get you a little bit of information about me since you'll be hearing me talk for the next hour just wanted to give you a heads up that is my real email address and I'd love questions actually all of us at 80 solutions team love questions because it it's a way for us to really get an idea of what you're struggling with and trying to get you solutions the best that we can so please email me whenever possible with questions about this webinar are really just general questions about Active Directory security and group policy whenever you get a chance love to hear you on that I have been in MVP a most valuable professional from Microsoft for the last 13 years I'm currently an active directory MVP but I've gone back and forth between Active Directory and Group Policy and those 13 years and really what the MVP provides for you is a direct link into Microsoft I I know the people that make the decisions on Active Directory group policy and can get questions to the people to make decisions on security so if you have any comments questions suggestions about the the current or future of Microsoft please email me those and I'd be more than happy to send those up the chain directly into Microsoft I also want to point you to some some resources and I think that these resources are extremely valuable unfortunately this auditing Windows expert page is a little bit under construction so I'm gonna point you away from that one but the other two links the resources here are extremely powerful and what it provides for you the security hardening site is by far one of the most powerful sites that you can go to with regard to what we're looking for so let me give you a little bit of background on this site and then I'm gonna catapult that into what we're talking about today last year and the May time frame I heard a a video from Microsoft where a microsoft person was talking at Tech Ed and in this video that we're talking about the next generation of Active Directory and some of the security features and I was just floored with some of the information was in this video now if you go to our website this managed engine comm website click on Active Directory and then go to this security hardening for Active Directory you will be sent to this security hardening mini site that I'm talking about and if you scroll down in here there is a link to a video and I highly encourage that you go watch this video after this webinar this video gives you information about what Microsoft is doing with regard to next-generation Active Directory security and I think you like myself will be a little bit disturbed and floored with what information you hear now how does that fit into today's webinar well after watching this video the 80 solutions team kind of grouped together and we built this website that you're looking at and we also put together a tremendous amount of blogs and videos that can help you better organize your Active Directory security so if you come down to the bottom of the site you'll see see all these different areas and they all expand you'll see here and what we've done is put together blogs and videos to help you get the job done and when I say get the job done I mean harden your Windows environment so this is really what today is about is about this site and it's about this site because we want to make sure that you have the information that you need in order to be successful with with hardening Windows now not only do we have the security hardening site we also have if I come back over here and go back to the main page if you come up here to community on our main page and then go to community active directory you have to have even more information with regard to Active Directory and this is not only a blog related to our products this is a blog related to Active Directory and how to better get solutions for your environment so we really have a lot of great information for you and and these are things that we are providing to you as a service because we feel that security is so important now how does that fit into today well a couple of things about today's webinar we only have a little bit under an hour with you so we had to pick and choose some different areas that we thought were very important to make sure that we cover all the information related to hardening Windows security is on that website including auditing information so a couple of webinars that we've had we've had some comments that we didn't cover every aspect of security hardening in the hour that we were together but that's because there's only so much information you can cover an hour so that's why I point you to those resources and please go look at those resources I've also given you my email so if you have any questions please reach out to us and we'd be happy to do that finally on this webinar as you pose questions on your right-hand toolbar or it may be somewhere else on your page you should have a a link to ask questions please utilize that whenever possible the entire ATS solutions team is kind of behind me here answering those questions for you so if you want to see the other questions that are being posed please all of you should be able to read those questions and see the answers to those questions as we go through the webinar and again at the end any questions please send them to us so let's get on with today and let's talk about some different security areas within Windows and Active Directory that we need to focus on so I'm gonna cover local users in groups because this is an area that is missed very often and it's it's an area that is very important especially with the attack vectors that are occurring in most Windows environments we also need to look at Active Directory privileged groups and understand what a privileged group is and how do we harden that excuse me third we're gonna look at user rights again another area that I find is omitted from most audit programs compliance requires that you look at user rights but many organizations many auditors don't do that we also need to look at the administrator account itself and then another area that I find is left off of most audits left off of most security hardening guides is Active Directory delegation and the reason for that is it's extremely complex to configure and even more complex to actually report so at the end of today I'm going to give you solutions on how you can do this very easily even with Microsoft built-in tools to to get information about the delegation and then finally something that I think hounds all of us which is service and service accounts are accounts that are very important to our organization but we have to harden them so how do we do that well let's talk about the first topic which is local users and groups now in your Windows machines these are your servers and your workstations you have administrators group and the administrators group can contain local users as well as domain users and domain groups as soon as a computer joins Active Directory the domain admins group is placed inside of the administrators group on whatever machine it is whether it's a server or workstation so immediately you have domain users that have administrator privileges on every server in your environment now that's important to understand because of attacks that are occurring like past the hash and past the ticket and all of these other attacks because we need to make sure that we secure we harden these administrator groups and the accounts now in order to do this we have to have the right tools now I have an environment with me here and if we go over to my environment I have a Windows 7 machine and it doesn't matter if it's Windows 7 or Server 2012 or Server 2008 it's still just a computer that's joined to the domain now if I have the right credentials which right now I am NOT logged on as a person that has the right credentials but quickly I can log off and log back on so let's say that I'm gonna log on as Derek now Derek is a domain admin and when Derek comes to a computer Derek is able to see everything on the computer so right now Derek is going to be logged on as the local administrator which gives Derek the ability to see what's going on on this machine now if I come over here to my local users and groups and I go to my groups administrators you will see that I have some accounts in here that are listed but if I do this that means I have to go to every single machine but it's not only administrators there's also backup operators I have remote desktop users that can remotely connect in so I not only have the administrators group on every machine I also have other groups which are very important in order for me to make sure that I know who has elevated privileges because really what we're talking about with local users and groups is who has elevated privileges on the machine so that we can make sure that we report on them and secure them well let's talk about this process of how to harden a machine we feel that there are five steps for every security control for you to harden your machine step one is to report reporting is not always easy because we need to have tools that are efficient as well as tools that are thorough and give us the correct information so for example if we're looking at local users and groups we can look at a tool like our free Active Directory tool we could look at PowerShell I just showed you the local accounts manager you could use that as well but we want to make sure that we get a tool that gets us information quickly and it gives us information correctly so if we go back to our free tool which you can download this from our website again everything in here is absolutely free we'll come back in here and look at service accounts in just a minute but we can come in here and point to a machine and we can say all right we want to know who has membership in the administrators group on that machine we can look at who has backup operator we can quickly look to see all these particular groups and who has membership in these groups so this is a tool that you can utilize to report on some of this information so here I've given you the free Active Directory Manager tool to report on local users and groups because again when I the local users and groups I can also manage them so I can see some different information about these users that are configured on that machine so here we have some different tools now how can we monitor some of these well the monitoring of the local users and groups can be done with a tool like 80 on it plus now how is monitoring fit into the five steps well we feel that the five steps for hardening security in Windows is reporting a step one analyzing a step two and configuration of step three configuring the correct security now again I'm going to repeat those if you want to write those down reporting analyzing and configuring once you have the security configured you only need to know if it changes how do we know if things change well that's when we need a monitoring solution so a monitoring solution could be a tool like a tea audit plus so if I come in here to ad audit plus and I go to server audit I can come down here and I can look at object management an object management can tell me when particular machines are being modified and what's being modified so I could add in here my servers and my workstations and I can actually monitor when things are changing on computers throughout my environment now could I set up alerts absolutely in alerting which I'll show you and some of the other configurations is also very powerful because monitoring requires that you manually go in and look at a report alerting is an action that's taken on in something that changes and you're being notified of that so these are the Stef's reporting analyzing configuring monitoring and alerting that we all need to follow to make sure that we get good security configurations and good security hartney so let's move on and talk about the second topic which is directly Active Directory related we have groups within Active Directory which have privileges now we're gonna have three different categories of these groups the three different categories of these groups the first one is the default groups so if I go back to my Active Directory environment I go to Active Directory users and computers and then I go to my users container you will see that I have some default groups that have privileges such as domain admins Enterprise admins schema admins DNS admins cert publishers and the like but I also have what are called built-in groups like account operators administrators backup operators which have elevated privileges so these are groups that when you install Active Directory immediately are granted privileges within Active Directory as well as on your servers in the environment so these default groups are things that every organization has now the next two groups are unique per organization the second type of privileged group is an application or service group now examples of this might be sequel admins or Exchange admins or SharePoint admins when you install an application then you might actually have one of these groups and these groups have elevated privileges a final list of groups or custom groups now if we go back to my Active Directory environment you will see that I have Finance and Finance accounts groups I have executives write execs I have engineering so some of these groups in my world actually have elevated privileges so here I have a help desk and I have help desk technicians so all of these groups are not groups that were created by an application they weren't here by default in Active Directory these are groups that you have that are customed to your organization and every Active Directory has these groups because an admin at some point went in and said we need to organize these groups well with regard to privileged groups first and foremost we need to make sure that we report on the groups now the reporting on these groups is extremely important because these groups have usually nested groups in them so if we go back to my Active Directory environment and I'm gonna pick on my group administrators here and I go to members I could take a screenshot of this to report on my group members but as we can see that would not be enough because I not only have users in this group I have groups within the group so I have nested groups now if we have a lot of time and possibly we're being paid by the hour we could go in and we can also go to domain admins and under domain admins go to members and get a screen capture of this but I think that's gonna take too much time and unfortunately Microsoft does not have a tool there's not even any tool in here to help us document recursive groups and their members so what are we gonna do at this point well let's walk over to another tool that you may or may not have which I've installed here now I'm gonna get on my powershell bandwagon here just for a minute and talk to you about PowerShell and what's important about PowerShell PowerShell is important to every Active Directory administrator because it's important to Microsoft Microsoft is putting all of their eggs in the PowerShell basket which means that you need to understand PowerShell at least to a and agree I find that one way to learn more about PowerShell especially for Active Directory administrators is to go download the Active Directory module and start to play around with it now when you download the Active Directory module and launch it you still only get the PowerShell interface but this PowerShell interface can sometimes be a little bit difficult to work around it now the number one command for PowerShell is get help and you type get help space and then type whatever you want so I'm gonna type group now PowerShell is powerful PowerShell is intelligent but it's not always the most intelligent thing for example when I type get help group it gives me the group object and how I control that but this isn't what I want I want the Active Directory group but remember we're in the Active Directory module so if I do get hel ad group I actually get a listing of commands which is this is what really the group should do that are related to Active Directory groups now if I do get help on get AV group member see that here group member you will see that I have a list of commands that I can run and one of them is recursive ok so if I do now get ad group member for administrators recursive it will get me a listing of all of the users that are in the administrators group recursively meaning not only just the users that are in the group but the users that are in the nested group now you can see that once you learn this okay it's really not that bad but getting to this point it was painful and some of you that have never used PowerShell you're thinking why would I ever do this I'm better off just to manually do it and yeah I understand it's it's it's PowerShell not the most intuitive environment and certainly not the easiest to work with so again that's why I'm giving you multiple solutions a better solution in my opinion would be a tool like a tea manager an ad manager I simply go to my Active Directory reports I see group reports I see group members I want to get detailed information I want to get the users and the groups and I want to select the administrators account and I generate and these are all the users now I don't know about you but for me this is about a hundred times easier than trying to use PowerShell but I want to give you an idea of the solutions that are out there the requirements that are needed for this you have to get groups and their members recursively in order to report correctly now that I have this list I can actually export it which again PowerShell doesn't really do this I can export this to a PDF share it with everyone that has say and who should be in administrators that's the analysis once I get the feedback I configure it and now all I have to do is monitor well how do I monitor group membership now not only group membership just groups that have privileged access well that's when you need a tool to do that I have a tool called a tea audit plus I go to my reports I have a built-in report that's called modified admin groups and here is a report on all of the groups that have elevated privileges that have changed and you'll see I know all the details around these groups and their changes but this is not really the end remember we have five steps can analyze configure monitor and alert what I want is if someone were to go into Active Directory go to the domain admins group actually let's pick on enterprise admin if someone were to go to the enterprise admin group and add in a user you'll see the user right there and I apply it I want that reported back to me I want right here you will see that Bart is added this is an alert every alert an ad on it plus also has an email option so if I go to my alerts I go to my alert profiles and I look at my modified groups somewhere it's here oh there it is modified admin group you will see that I can send an email this is the power of security hardening most administrators most organizations think that security hardening is only the first three steps well the first three steps only gets you to a point in time I want past the point in time to be known and secured that's where monitoring and alerting comes in and is extremely powerful but remember I'm gonna go up one slide privileged groups includes more than just the default groups it includes all these other groups well how do I report on those that's not a problem at all if you go back to my report here on modified admin groups first and foremost notice I can go back in time I can go back to the last six months and get a listing of all the groups you will notice it in my list I not only have domain admins and Enterprise admins I have finance managers you may not even have a finance manager group how did I get that in my report the customization of the tool is extremely important if I go to configuration group modification modified admin groups I can add in any group that I want right here this is the power of security hardening this is where you need to be now what I want you to do is I want you to think about this in your environment I want you to think about your domain admins group I'm gonna ask you some questions and I want you to think about this first of all when was the last time that domain admins and your organization changed membership was it yesterday was it last week last month in the last six months in the last year if you don't know the answer to that that's a problem you should be able to go to a report and the in the timeframe that you're looking at you should be able to do a quick search to see if domain admins change membership and it hasn't I know that in my environment right here if I do a quick search on domain admins I know the domain admins changed on December 7th that's almost two months ago you need a tool to help you with this you need a tool that's going to give you this insight if you don't have a tool then how do you know what the current state of domain admins is you're gonna manage I look at that report every time you don't have time for that that's why many organizations are asked you they have drift with their security settings if you have monitoring and reporting on top you don't okay user rights now I'm gonna ask you the same question when was the last time that you reported on user rights for your domain controllers and servers and ensured that they were secured this is important why is it important well let's go look at user rights if I go look at a listing of user rights for this domain controller you will see that I have user rights that cover everything from adding workstations to the domain logging on locally backing up files create in a token and even options like logging on as a batch or a service these are very powerful configurations so what we need to do is we need to make sure that we are reporting correctly and we're getting the information configured and then from that point monitoring and alerting to make sure that we have these things configured properly because if we don't do this we are missing some of the most important aspects of the configurations so how do we do this well there are a couple of built-in tools that are really awesome for the initial reporting we do not want to utilize group policy for this so let's go back to my environment and let me walk you through some different things if I go to group policy management here you will see that under domain controllers I have the default domain controller policy and inside of this default domain controller policy which is default configurations under security settings I have user rights assignment now these are the user rights that Microsoft assigns out-of-the-box you cannot do a report on this group policy object because here I could do settings and I could get this report right here for user rights and I could print this out but how do I know if this is actually on the machine I don't it's too complex I could have other GPOs which supersede this which is too complicated so I do not recommend that you use group policy management instead what I recommend is you use a built-in tool FCC pol EMS see it's on the slide and it's right here let's give you a second to digest that security policy is a tool that's built into every Windows machine and it gives you the ability to see the actual settings on the machine the group policy object is a file there is no guarantee that that file is applied to the machine in said we want to report on the machine and this is what we're doing here this report tells me every configuration that's configured for user rights I can even right click here and I can export this list now what you will see is that some of these configurations have groups administrate tours how do I know who's in administrators well now we go back to the original configuration we were talking about with groups and we have to get the group members recursively now do you see how it all fits together when you start looking at security hardening you have to have an entire tool belt of solutions if you don't you're going to be behind the eight-ball and you're gonna be stuck frantically trying to get the right reports so what I'm trying to guide you through is which reports help you get your answers faster because efficiency is important here it is not only for compliance compliance it's important I completely understand that when an auditor knocks on your door when an audit is going on you have to generate compliance reports but what I'm saying is beyond that we as administrators need to make sure that we get the correct information to the auditor and we get the correct information to ourselves so that we secure our environment so first and foremost we have this idea of sec Paul and SEC Paul gets us the information we need another tool that we have is our sap now the resultant set of policy tool is a little bit different than our shop so if I come in here and I run our sum on the same computer it's gonna go out and it's gonna determine the resultant set of policy now if I come under my Windows settings my security settings you will see that I have user rights okay now first I have a couple of errors for some reason let's see let's try to find a configuration that says not oh here these are perfect look at this so notice that my option for debug create symbolic link this is my arse op and it says not find over here it says administrators but wait a minute how in the world does one report say not defined and the other one give me information about groups well our shop is resultant set of policy only from GPOs in Active Directory this settings local you can see right here that icon means group policy from Active Directory this is a local setting this is a local setting this is a local setting and all of these say not defined because this can't report on it my point is you have to use the right tool if you don't use the right tool you don't get the right information in this case the right tool is not result instead of policy the right tool is set Paul do you see what I'm driving at here we as a Badman czar responsible for making sure that we get the right information out of the system using the right tool is extremely powerful for this now once we report we then analyze this by getting the groups recursively then we configure properly once we have everything configured properly we simply need to monitor and alert so now I can come down here and I can get a link of user right change so somewhere in here see if I can find it quickly there is a report for user right changes I user permissions thought it was under my reports here it's in here somewhere user right assignment changes right here okay in the last three days I don't have any what about the last six months yes I do not only do I have information about it I have details about what changed tell me this isn't powerful this is what we need this is the information that we need now this is within active directory group policy but I also come over here to my server audit I can go under my server on the reports and under policy change I would see if there's any changes to user rights so what we need to understand is that if we get the right tools in place and we use the right tools for reporting and monitoring and alerting we can get a complete view of our security in Active Directory and our Windows servers in real time I mean imagine if you have a user right change that's occurring in group policy affecting their domain controller a server how do you see that how do you even understand that that changed even if you're not looking at that from a compliance standpoint you're never looking at it how important is it how important is it for someone to be able to change the system to time on a server I think it's pretty important because I can bring down a server I can bring down the entire organization if I change it on domain controller by changing the system time so we need to think broader with this concept of security hardening now if we move on and talk about another area when you talk about the administrator account now I've just written a couple of different blogs on this concept and I'm really talking about how to secure your environment just with configurations which is the third step so let's go to step one all right step one is the administrator account itself how do we understand this administrator account well the administrator account when he need to make sure that we see if it's been renamed or not now in my environment it's been renamed and it's been renamed to I believe James Bond let's go look so I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna go to ad manager and I'm gonna go to ad reports I'm gonna go to user reports all users and right here you will see a user K called James Bond now James Bond in my environment is the built-in administrator account okay now these built-in administrator account I know that because of the sit so I could come over here and I can get a listing of the SIDS and I can actually see that James Bond right here has 500 okay so first and foremost you need a tool that can quickly show you the SID of all users could I use Active Directory users computers for this well you could come in here here's James Bond if I go to the properties of James Bond well I really don't see the object SID anywhere I'd actually have to go to the attribute editor and then the attribute editor come down here to user SID and dig that out let's see security identify their city history it's in here somewhere ain't notice then this fun right so instead of going through this process why not use a tool that's designed to do it because what we have to do is report to make sure we know who default administrator because we need to rename it and I can see you can see I've renamed it here after I have renamed it then we need to make sure that we create another account called administrator because we need to make sure that the administrator is there and why do we want to make sure that the administrator account is there well what we want to do is from this point forward we want to run reports on whether or not the account is actually being used so here you will see my administrator 500 modifications and I want to know if this account is being used at all in the last six months it hasn't been changed we also have login reports that allow you to go in and look for logon failures and we can actually look for certain names to see if there's been logon failures what is this gonna tell us well this is going to tell us if someone is trying to log on as administrator well if someone tries to log on as administrator what does that tell you about your environment well that tells you that someone is trying to hack in because we've created a honeypot for this account do you see the full circle if you only report and configure correctly but you don't monitor and alert afterwards for what you've configured how do you know if you're being attacked you don't you need to have the correct tools in place such as logon failures based on users and you need to be able to go in and look and see if someone's trying to attack you to understand this full picture so these are things that we at manage engine are trying to educate and again if you go to that website if you go to my blogs you will see that we are educating around this and how to fully secure fully harden your environments now another area that I want to talk about which is rarely if ever looked at is Active Directory delegation now this idea of Active Directory delegation has been around in Active Directory since the onset back in 2000 now Active Directory delegation as you see on the slide as we all probably know has the ability to grant privileges over certain tasks in Active Directory to only certain users to perform those tasks so common delegations are the ability to reset passwords to modify properties to unlock an account to modify group membership now the way that we grant delegations in Active Directory is that we go to a particular oh you we run the delegate control wizard and we add in who we won't want to control the tasks so we're gonna give the HD Tech's privileges to reset passwords and you can see here there's some other options now when this configuration is done it's very difficult to see what happened now if we go to HR and we go to the security tab for the properties of HR we will see that HD techs are here but we really don't know what permissions are granted because they're special so if we go to Advanced you see the drill down here we have two entries not one but two and then we have to go to edit to see the exact settings this is painful this is not a solution for reporting and if any of you are doing this I need you to stop I need you to stop because this is not an efficient way of reporting on the ACLs the access control lists of what's been delegated inactive direct this is just it's it's too cumbersome it's way too manual even though this information is important we have to report on it we we need to have something that is going to give us better insight so one I want to show you a built-in tool that every single domain controller has is called D s ackles now D s Ackles as you see here has a lot of information but basically D s ackles just says put in the path of the active directory know that you're looking for and it can get you the listing of the ACLS so if you type in D s ackles for oh you equals HR and then put in the domain information ad solutions common DC well you actually get the access control list and down here it tells you that HD Tex has the ability to reset passwords see that right there HD Tex now why is it important to report on delegation well we need to analyze who else has delegations and you will see for this H R Human Resources o you finance managers also can reset passwords that is a major issue with regard to security that means someone in finance can reset the password for someone in HR this is where we report analyzed and then we configure we have to be able to look at this level of detail going through this security option is not a solution we need a tool that can do it once we get it configured then we need to have solutions that are going to allow us to see things that are in Active Directory we need to be able to look at container permission changes we need to be able to know when someone is changing permissions within active direct we overtime right oh you permission changes right here in the last 30 days HR was changed when oh my gosh that was just a couple of minutes ago when I did it this is a real-time reporting tool could I have an alert set up for this you bet you could what if I want to look to see in the last month what changed I can do that okay last month nothing changed in the last six months I have quite a few changes and you see them all right here okay so with the right tool you can see things that normally you cannot see without the tool and the configuration step three is important but if you don't monitor and alert after that you're not seeing an ongoing security hardening baseline you just know that last month on Tuesday it was secure but you don't know today and you got a no today because the attacker is not attacking last Tuesday the attacker is attacking today now one final area that I want to cover is service accounts now service accounts are very difficult to get control of most organizations throughout the world have trouble with service accounts because we have auditors that are forcing us to consider resetting passwords for service accounts we as administrators know that if we do not have full disclosure on where service accounts are configured one change to a service account could bring down a multitude of servers and the services running on them so we need to make sure that we get control of our service accounts and where they're configured now we at manage engine wanted to create a solution to to really help administrators and organizations with this so let me walk you through a couple of things first and foremost we have to report okay now if I go to services MSC and I go to this log on as you can see that I can report on all the services and the service accounts for every server I can even from this point connect to another machine and if I have a thousand servers a thousand different screenshots or printouts I can print this out I can't imagine very many of you have ever done this it's just too time-consuming so we have built for you a tool it's part of our free Active Directory tools if you come to our website I'm gonna go back to our website and you go back to the manage engine landing page and click on Active Directory you have related free tools right here so the free tools are here and the security hardening site is here okay so we're giving you these tools for your benefit if you click on the sick the service account tool go to service accounts you click on the servers that you want to get service accounts from ok and then get service accounts you get a listing of all the service accounts for all those machines but some of these are built in default accounts that you don't care about so we've also given the ability to filter and right there the - so no longer do you have to struggle with reporting on where service accounts are configured on your windows servers for Windows services you have a free tool to do that now ok secondly now that we have reported the service accounts you're going to make sure they're configured properly and then we just monitor how do you monitor we're
