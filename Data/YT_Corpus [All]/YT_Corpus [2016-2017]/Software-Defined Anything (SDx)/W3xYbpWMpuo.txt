 okay usually I don't have these enabled okay so we got a drum kit anyplace now it's all about the next stage is all about mixing and routing where the routing part of superior drummer plugin is the more complicated one it's even more complicated than mixing actually it's ridiculous but first let's set up the plug-in to have a final final drum setup as you can see here there are many humanized options or envelopes and layer limits let's check those for a second so you have layer limits this this means that you can limit the voices of a single drum part to a maximum number so if you strike a symbol for example and you strike it again and the first hit is not yet finished it still sustains then you can adjust the layer limit if you if you hit the cymbals like eight times in a row then you don't want to to kill the sample before instantly that would sound very artificial if you choose a large voice or layer limit then you need more CPU power to run the plugin and you need more RAM but usually what I do on my i7 here is I disable the layer limits on my drum parts completely I got the power I got the power so let's do that for every drum part and you can already see that my ram my used ram here starts to increase a little bit see that noise 1929 so it just loads more samples into the ram right but my computer can do that and what i do usually on my cymbals is a lay limit of eight on toms and snare i have layer limit of five and kick I got four so let's do that so everything sounds natural eight so all the cymbals got eight snare we only need five because the snare toms and kicks they don't have that much sustain compared to cymbal cymbal rings out much longer you know so and the kick has four alright so that's the basic setup what I can do here is clear the RAM then it reloads only the samples that the plugin actually needs and this is 1.5 gigabyte of RAM that's quite a bunch right for this drum kit on my other drum kit wonder a wonder it's the same amount but the total use samples is a little bit higher it's interesting right okay so we got our drum kit and we got an old drum lair sounds let's listen to it again sounds like total crap so far but that's okay what I usually check is that cymbals are equally loud if you four if you go ahead and choose well let's say you choose a symbol from the metal foundry package and another symbol from the original superior superior drummer a package or from the metal machinery as the ax or even an easy axe library then the volumes of the cymbal may differ a little bit much it then or what what you can do in this case is you select the louder all the quieter cymbal and bring up or down the volume of this cymbal sound here a little bit to match all symbols but I feel like the volumes of the cymbal a pretty well balanced they are too loud compared to the Tom's and snare kick you know but but that's that's something you you solve in the mixer but at the starting point you have to look at your cymbals are balancing volume hyatt can be mixed differently so you don't have to check the height against that sounds that sounds really okay for me here alright so what next now to the mixer nothing's get a little bit more complicated maybe let's go here me this so it doesn't eat up CPU power if I play back my MIDI track here then we can see something's here what can we see we see that the kick drum and snare drum microphones of the superior drummer metal foundry plug-in are not used because I don't use snare and kick from the metal foundry ezx that's not coming anything out of these microphones so what we can do is we can turn them off I usually do that so that I know this track or this microphone is not used in my town like this is our final goal as you can see here every microphone that I don't use on a particular library is turned off and even I assign none to the bosses so this microphone is not even connected to any sort of drum buss within the plug-in I'm gonna do that for my case here too I'm gonna remove all the microphone bleed set all the busses to none this is a lot of clicking but it helps if you if you go ahead and recheck the plug-in if you like if you if you're mixing it mixing it a song and you're in the draw mixing and you open up the plug-in let's say I'm I'm loading up my project here and I'm getting into my superior drummer track here open up superior get into the mixer then I immediately see ok I don't have to care about those tracks here because they're disabled right so this is just something I do in terms of knowing what channels are really used within the plugin because I cannot I cannot get rid of these channels in the plug-in there's no no setting that I can like switch these unused microphones to invisible they are always visible in in the mixer that would be a really nice feature to get rid of unused microphone tracks here me to track please okay but the high hats are used the Hyatts actually are used I need my my other plug in here too to recheck what I do okay my Hyatts are used back here my rectum one is not used so I'm gonna disable that and my floor time talk my floor tom two is again not used rectum 2/3 and floatin one car coming through metal foundry so that's good I use over hats I don't use the drummer over a hat because there's no bleed for this no we don't need that this is a mono microphone and it sounds weird so I'm not gonna use that I can't show you how these sound like no the feature that you can make tracks or unused microphone channels invisible is not announced it was just an idea of myself it would be a nice feature cheers everybody it would be nice feature to have actually and what contributed to the usability of the mixer because there's so many tracks that I really don't use so it would be nice to get rid of them in this view here you could half the amount of the microphone channels actually okay so the ambient close mic I don't like that on metal mixes we can we can listen to those microphones one at a time but for the time being I'm gonna disable it the ambient far microphone I use there is bleed on it bleed on the overhead bleed on the ambient for mono I don't use mono mono channels maybe that's some kind of professional thing but I never used mono mono overhead or ambient mics on my drum sounds ever it just thought it just destroys the stereo image in my opinion I want you to have my drum kit sound very wide and open and if I use mono overhead sounds pan to the center of the sound what one of what use is that I don't get it maybe I'm too unprofessional to understand what's going on with those mono mics I don't know the chamber sound or the chamber microphone provides some decent tones in some situations but on metal drums I don't like it that much I around with it the last time I I set up my drum tone but I don't really like the outcome it does not contribute to the overall drum tone in a way that I like so I'm not gonna use the microphone channel so these were all the microphones that we use out of the metal foundry package so no kick no kick left no kick out no snare mic we use hats rectum two rectum three floatin one the overhead microphone the far ambient microphone and that was it that was it so we're only using one one two three four five six microphones out of twenty one I only use six microphones out of twenty one of the metal foundry package and now it would be great if I could get rid of the other 15 because I don't use the channels why should I why should I show them in the mixer here if I don't use them okay now we get the part of the ezx channels these are my microphones from here to here from my metal exclamation mark easy acts expansion so there is a possibility that the kick drum and snare microphones are used in this library right so let's take a look so we could we could rename we could rename those tracks that we know what we are messing with so for example I could call this M hats mr2 for metal foundry or MF don't know let's call it MF so I know if I'm messing with with microphone inputs and bosses I know where this these channels come from because we got an overhead microphone from the metal foundry package and we got an overhead and ambient microphone from the easyacc spec agend to distinguish between those two when it comes to routing you need a different name right so I'm going to call that MF overhead MF amp I know that is it's the far ambient microphone and that was it let's do the same on our easy X microphones here so which channels do I use from the easy acts I use I'm not using the hats I'm not using the Tom's because my terms are coming from the metal foundry so I can disable those rack Tom floor Tom floor from the these are all channels that I don't need all right I used the over hat the ambient and the ambient not a compression so I can get rid of this let's disable it disable to plead turn that off all right now let's rename these real quick and I know let's call that MF underscore was for metal foundry let's call this only metal so M kick left no that was right that was the right kick here M underscore kick left then we got the M underscore snare we had got no higher no rectums no floor toms here is the M overhead the M underscore ambient microphone and we don't use the compression so now we can distinguish between the overhead channel of the metal exclamation mark easy acts and the ambient mic and the overhead and ambient mic of the superior drummer metal foundry package right good the next thing we have to do is to set up what parts of the drum kit bleed through the overhead and ambient mics usually if you have an overhead microphone above your drum kit the whole kit bleeds through this microphone the whole kit is kind of recorded by this microphone in superior drummer you have the ability to choose actually which part of your drum kit is recognized by the overhead and ambient microphones that is a great feature because that is something you cannot do in real life you can't just go ahead and say something like um my snare drum sounds weird on the overhead microphones so I just turn it off that is something you cannot do in real life you always have you have your snare on your overhead microphone right it's always on there you cannot get it out or anything but I can do that in superior drummer and that's a really nice feature it enables me to get better sound a written more refined sound very easy so let's see let's review the bleed settings here on my metal foundry overhead microphones what do I wanna have on this microphone the only parts that I use from the metal foundry package are the Tom's and the cymbals so I don't have to n able bleed from the snare or the kick through my metal foundry overhead microphones this is not necessary because I'm not using the kick or the snare sound as samples melt foundry so what I can do here is I can get rid of all the bleed channels that I don't need this is this is the part where you can lower the CPU usage of the plugin if you say okay this is my overhead channel of metal foundry but I only got overhead I got only symbols and tom-toms that bleed through it what use is it to enable the kick and the snare channel makes no sense because they are muted anyway and now you have to differentiate between the extra mess the extra metal channels and the actual kick channels so let's take a look at this this is my my right my right kick drum my right X drum it's called Eckstrom one it's not really the kick right the kick right would be this one behind all this here this this is my my metal foundry kick but I don't use it in my plugin because i Eckstrom din my kick drum so what i don't use on my overhead i don't use the kick i don't use the left kick I don't use it the snare because these are coming from metal exclamation mark I don't really use the hats because the hats are extra rectums disable it you don't need it and now here is the interesting part here we got our two cymbals or two crash cymbals and the China this crash cymbal is this one this crash cymbal 5x9 is this one this is our Eckstrom 9 and the extant china 2 is this one x from 10 so these are selected to bleed through or to get recognized by the overhead you cannot disable it because sure on the overhead microphones cymbals get through the overhead microphones you cannot disable this but now I can go ahead and say okay do I want to have my hi-hat on the overhead microphone do I want to have my rack Tom's and floor toms on the overhead microphone of metal foundry and yes I want that I want to have them on there so let's let's enable this overhead track here solo it let's take a listen to what that sounds like the boss palms so the Tom's bleed through the overhead microphone okay this is only the overhead microphone there's no snare no kick because the snare cake come from another library right but what I could do here now is I can say no my overhead microphone does not pick up the Tom's and the high hats so if I play again I only got cymbals but no Tom's have no higher anymore only cymbal this is the great part this is not possible in real life right so okay so we got the bleed set up for our overhead microphone in metal foundry let's step one let's get one step further here and select the bleed for the ambient mic off of the metal foundry and again I want to have all cymbals bleed through the ambient mic and all rack Tom's and even the high hats maybe at a lower rate so let's see first I'm going to disable everything now I'm gonna select what should bleed through the ambient microphone I want to have my my rectum and my floor Tom on the ambient microfilm let's see how that sounds like okay it sounds a little bit roomy you can't actually hear how far away this ambient microphone is from the drum kit it's interesting right I want my hi-hat to bleed through the ambient microphone but Mac maybe at a lower rate right so maybe I want to have the hi-hats not that loud on the ambient microphone so I can pull this down here a little bit let's say - like - - seven point five because it's too loud and this again is something you cannot do in real life too because you cannot adjust how loud a drum part bleeds through a different microphone you can adjust the microphone placement to grab like different parts of your kit more more likely but you cannot get rid of a tone of a special drum part you cannot say that the second rectum bleeds not at the same volume through the microphone through the ambient microphone compared to the first rectum or even the floor top but I can do this in this plug in here and what I want to do next is the ambient microphone should pick up my cymbals so let's enable these cymbal to assemble five and China - and here we are okay so my overhead and ambient mics mics off metal foundry pickup my rack Tom's my cymbals and the Hyatt this is exactly what I want good let's take a look at the overhead and ambient mics from metal ezx and this looks a little bit different because the only parts that I use of the metal is the axe bumble is art the snare and the kick drums so the only part I can select to bleed through the overhead of the metal is the X overhead microphone is the kick and the snare this is what it sounds like solo okay and let's check that on the ambient microphone again because I only use the kick and snare of the easy-access passion these are the only parts I can select for bleeding through the ambient microphone let's listen to that hey mr. severoff welcome man thanks for joining again this sounds like a like a cool ambient microphone right there okay so we got everything set up we got the bleed setup we got our microphones set up we chose what microphones we actually are using we disabled the microphones that we don't use and let's let's for example check out some of the microphones that we could use but where I decided that I don't want to have the microphones on myself for example the mono closed microphone how would that sound like if I enable that so let's choose the output and enable all bleed on a microphone how does this microphone sound why should I use this mono sound on my drumkit sound I won't stay with I want the drum kit to sound wide and fat and huge and I don't see any good use of this microphone on my metal mix so I'm gonna leave it disabled right pull it down disable the bus and the chamber I said before can sound cool let's check it all that sound let's so this is more like the reverb channel maybe but since I own very good River plugins myself I want to add them later on outside of the superior drummer plug-in I can use this chamber plug-in to add this reverb tail on the snare and the kick for example if you're really in the metal or death metal they they usually use a lot of reverb on the kicks and if you want that nice snare hit tells ya the sustain of the snare this comes usually from such a chamber channel but as I said before I own the CSR reverb from Ike a multimedia and I do like those more than this reverb chamber channel and you kind of see me add in some reverb later so I'm coming to save this microphone here again okay okay now with over all the channel channels disabled that we don't like and all the channels enabled that we like and all the bleeds set up correctly let's see how the drum kit sounds like this is already not that bad if you look at the plugin I don't use any internal plugins eq's filters compressors whatsoever I don't use any of those and for that in my opinion and the sound is really darn good already right should the overheads a little bit too loud hi it's a little bit too loud and everything but the snare already has some punch to it the kick already has some punch to it and it's and it's it it's it's nice let's take a listen to this to the Tom's here they sound very natural or already if you if you're into this kind of music where you like this natural sounding open tom-toms and snares you you are already at a very good spot you didn't even need to EQ that very much maybe pull pull out the Box in s at 400 Hertz but the toms sound already pretty good and this is a great example for all those sorry that tell something like our superior drummer the plug-in it sounds so unnatural it's also digital so electronically what the you just don't know what you're doing so shut the up please thank you no honestly really honestly this is a very natural drum sound here so if you think about that I mean that's that's a great discussion but people stating that superior drummer or other all the other drum plugins like the like Steven slate and Native Instruments are selling digital this is complete nonsense why because the samples in Sapir drummer are miked real drums real miked drums with microphones and preamps and audio interfaces and and a million dollar studio it's real so it's not digital it's digital but real but not but real you know you get me can we get over this I'm so sick of this discussion under my YouTube videos really everyone there are always these trolls are using superior drummer this drum kit sounds like because it's digital c'mon guys
