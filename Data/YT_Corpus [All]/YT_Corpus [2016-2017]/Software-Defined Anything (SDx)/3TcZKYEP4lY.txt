 alright guys stay over here from one step at a time and today I'm going to be showing you how to fix your SD cards and corrupted ones ones you can't farm it I have a video on how to farm at 64 gigabyte SD cards I notice in the comments that some people are having problems with formatting them or corruption or just certain issues so I just thought I'd quickly go over a way of hopefully fixing it so I'm I suppose if they get Krakens the first thing you're going to need to do is open the command line prompt we're going to be using that for to check out this so do that and you can either click on your search bar and type in CMD and hit enter or the easiest way I find to split your window key it's just to the left of your space bar so press that and Exce and you'll get this list and then just going to command prompt admin then hit yes and then you here what we're going to do we're going to run a check on the disk so you have to have your dis plugged in so we launched insert your SD card that's cropped ashore and once you have if you're unsure what the drive letter is in it and just hit a Windows key again on your keyboard plus X I'm going to Disk Management and in here it lists all of you this USB has these hard drives and these are on my ones here so it's shown you here Dec on allocator that's my 16b with USB this is my external drive here so go on down here because this is it's a little 4 gigabyte SD card that I have plugged in at the moment and it's this we're going to be using so I can see here that it's K so this very important make sure you pick the right one don't put in anything because if you delete or repartition reformat or do anything inside here it'll remove all of your stuff so just be double sure that this is USD once you're happy that that is just minimize that and in here what we're going to do going to scan and fix at the same time so which is going to go up chk dsk sauce check disk and then you're going to go forward slash f4 fix space and then you're going to write in your drive letter so okay Cola what happens is as soon as I hit enter it's going to run a check if there's any problems or errors and hopefully it should fix them so just going to hit enter and as you can see when to scan the filesystem found no problems no further action is required so there was nothing found if there was any errors anything and this might actually help might just fix your SD card in which case you can go back out and try it if your error just press the red a exists or just type exists and hit enter and let them back yo to that if this hasn't worked then the next bit is we're going to just wipe the disk this will remove anything from viruses Trojans anything on us remove all your files all the partitions volumes everything so like I said make sure again what we want to do everyone use this pack for this so just type NDI sk p r RT and hit enter and as you can see it's changed from windows system32 and it's gone and it's going into my computer then dispersed i just expand this a little bit right and in here then what we want to do is want to list the disk so let's disk and in here as you can see again just listen this is my c if you're unsure once again just come in here it's disc 3 so i know - my SD card is industry so just minimize that again so then in here then you want to select s that that you want to work on so just post select 3 and hit enter and then it says this 3 is no the selected disk so everything we do for no one will be on this 3 so just go up here and then in here what we're going to do is we're going to do it clean so once again better to check twice and then to wipe out some hard drive or something that you need so once you're happy and you have the right disk and picked just type in clean I'll just show you on here it'll tell you it successfully done and as you can see see it's it's removed it and it's unallocated so that's wiped everything for us if there was any issues on it that should have cleans or hope the next thing you want to do is the only thing this won't do is it won't farm as if you're an SD card is over torchy 2 gigabytes I don't think they fix that in Windows 10 and maybe if someone knows I don't have a 64 gigabyte SD card lying around so and there's no way for sure for me to double-check it so maybe if you can let me know in the comments and but once you've cleaned this you can either go back out you can watch my other video on how to farm message if it's under 32 gigabytes on quickly show you here how to format it so or don't do is create a partition first so we're just going to say create partition primary and and it'll create a primary partition as you can see it's created a partition the only thing is we haven't far messages just create a partition so what we want to do is format it so if you want a formatted to fat32 X fast NTFS you can just do whatever here so and Tufano just go for mash I send in its file system equals and then pick whichever one you want so if it's X fast or so for this I'm just going to go 32 now you can put a label on this at the mall if you want so what I'm going to say is I'm just going to put a label on enable equals and so what it's going to do is it'll farm at my little SD card now to further to do this it's what I use on my camera so my labels going to be new once you're happy hit enter so there's a same complaint so this is the slow way of donor but if you've had an issue with your SD card or anything like that and this is the best way to do it because it will check all of the blocks and stuff like that and to do a proper job formatting it and there is an option to make it quick now if you have a large SD card this can take ages so I suggest going often I don't know having a few cups with coffee watching a video or something because you can take an hour at least so having said that if you want to do quick all you have to do it the back of this is at the end of label new just put a gap space and like quick and it would literally be done in less than 10 seconds so I hope that solves your problem it should fix your SD cares when you turn around to go using them again it should have wiped any issues or fixed them so if it is hit the like button subscribe if you want guys and I will see you on the next video tears bite
