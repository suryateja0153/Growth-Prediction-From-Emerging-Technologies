 hi Joel Rollins here for rave radio on day one of ISE 2016 annabelle k and i have a great job this year we're actually just touring the show looking for products that really really caught our eye and this is one and I am standing here with Martin banos of Lego master and lega masters a Dutch company correct yeah it is we're actually already 60 years old we have a long history and traditional visual communication products but ever around five years ago we we really started developing into electronics and well this is where we are right now so on the show we've just this is our premier of the new ninety eight inch our flagship East screen as we call them it's a ninety eight inch so this is this is meant for the really large meeting rooms boardrooms it's multi-touch so it's a 12-point touch system ultra HD resolution with 60 Hertz playback even so yeah this is just as good as it gets I saw it earlier running 4k material and what really impressed me was it was without a doubt the best looking 98 inch 4k touchscreen I'd ever seen and obviously I do an awful lot of touchscreen installation so this was a fascinating product to me tell me a little bit about how long you've been doing this particular screen and where you see it in the market house reaction well this is actually as I said this is our first introduction of the 98 so this is a pre-production sample we will be able to ship around June so yeah this is this is really quite new to us as well the largest screen we have prior to this one was 85 which is already significant size that turned out to be very successful because this is really also the really high-end products for instance we have under 85 with the corning gorilla glass which everybody knows from their iPhones and iPads unfortunately it wasn't possible under 98 because Corning doesn't make the gorilla glass as big as this I actually recently did an interview with the inventor of Gorilla Glass the doctor PhD who actually created Gorilla Glass they were talking about the need to have larger sizes but frankly I don't see anybody needing to bounce this downstairs well well that will be an issue and for instance this is one of the things we well as Legum Austin we really value also the relationship we have with our customers and our dealers and one of the things we're thinking about is offering this screen with a mounting surface basically because well we have to be honest it's quite heavy and typically if you don't have a really big installation you don't need for guys doing the rest of the installation so what we figure it is if we come in the dealer does the reinstall so to stand the cabling the control systems everything and then we just come in we have a spec we've developed a special lifting eight thing I don't know what the name for that should be but and we think lifting eight thing is fine okay well maybe we should patent that then or register that but anyway that that's really too also to show that we we also think about what our dealers are facing in the in the on the real world basically and well for those of you who are viewing our website today to look at what to look at it is II this is a place to stop by Martin one last question what's the stand number sorry the stand number oh that's a really good one it's I always catch them on this if Halton stands be 126 definitely stop by and take a look at this it's a very impressive product Martin thank you for being with us
