 hi folks welcome to this walkthrough of the netscaler ACI starter pocket in this demo I'll show how to access the netscaler ACI pocket online at github how to download it and how to apply your first script for those new to netscaler ACI and what a pocket might consist of this is essentially a starter script batch or a batch of starter scripts to get you going with ACI and NetScaler these scripts consists of different functions specifically load balancing SSL anything that you would think of that would just be interested to see how NetScaler works in an ACI fabric so these will get you up and running they create that everything needed to deploy an ACI service with netscaler to start things off go to github com / citrix and from there you can go to NetScaler underscore ACL and a score puck underscore kit the kit master tree is where you going to look and under each different area you're going to find a set of XML scripts and files those files contain the parameters needed to build out successful deployment for that related service now this is a complete deployment so it's not only going to create a service graph or l4d seven parameters for load balancing but it'll also create the tenant the bridge domain the private networking everything you'll need in order to get from end to end across the ACI fabric jumping over to the command line I've expanded the script to my disk and I'm going to run the basic load balancing config what the request dot P why does is it runs all the scripts in the directory and it goes through and applies them in order to build out the tenant config the networking config and then finally the load balancing config there's quite a beaut quite a few requests involved to set this up you can observe the the entire data that's being sent and received to set this up between your device and the apec controller once it's all done the script will exit switch over to your APEC user interface navigate to the tenant and once you're within the tenant notice that we now have the creation of an l 427 service graft template we've defined the function nodes and deployed the service graph to the device if you expand the deployed graph instance you'll find that VLANs have been allocated and that additional policies related to that service graph are below and then to see that under the provider EPG go up to the application profiles the application name EPG web and l4 seven service parameters on this page you'll find all the parameters that were pushed for specific load balancing and just to see how that looks on the netscaler here we do a show VLAN a show lbv server for the server name to get the full detail and you can see the creation of the different parameters here as pushed by a pic into NetScaler and that's it that's as easy it is to deploy a load balancing service with NetScaler and an ACI fabric using one of our convenient POC starter kits thanks for watching
