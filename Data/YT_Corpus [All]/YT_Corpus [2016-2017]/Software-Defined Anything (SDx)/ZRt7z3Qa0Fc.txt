 good afternoon thank you so much for being here I know we are the last session before your beer and we need to try to cover as much as we can for this 45 minutes and we have a lot of content a lot of great stuff for you guys today so thank you for taking the time my name is Marissa Schmidt product manager internets Keller team I with netscaler team for seven and a half years prior to that I was all T on product manager also a DC and engineering before that so I because this is our last session I do have a shirt to for the best question at the end of the of the presentation okay for as a giveaway for for that person that really paid attention as abhilash will go through demos so so we can get started and Abhilash this year with me today and he's going to cover a lot of the of the deep dive videos and technical details okay whoo hello we have to get out again it's not working just click on ok so as part of this there are maybe some new features that you need to go through and and it's part of that and 11 that one released since it's not officially released yet things are subject to change next one this what will go through in terms of agenda the clicker is still not working so if you can help me at the same time I go through then it's good thank you so we'll go through the the the enterprise and app delivery overview quickly and then we'll go through the Microsoft apps as well as the other demos that we need to do ok so in terms of the applications and the enterprise there are things IT admins need to look at closely and and and what they have to worry about in a regular basis especially with the massive requirements of all the things that they need to do many different components in big enterprise applications so several apps and requirements are massive than different users different use cases that they need to worry about for all the different departments that they have to support and the functionality and security requirements meanwhile they also have to worry about the integration and speed at to try and and optimize the deployment quickly and integrate this as as soon as possible then the console the single consolidated management is also an important piece that that readability you need to have and and security is obviously paramount for for this for all of these different things that we do for the that is important with that the speed to get all these things done it's like a very it's like racing with time and with that then we need to worry about the price versus the value the balancing act to make sure that we can provide the best solution for the best price with all those requirements in mind and then have the value there too to make that happen so with netscaler of course then you can have a be able to access any data any application any location device and so forth and you guys know the major five pillars of nets netscaler features from load balancing global load balancing offload security and visibility is critical for our customers and the in phenix flicks flexibility and finish flexibility is like whether you can do the MPX the BP X now the new one with the CPX the sdx and so forth right so those are all and the ability to pay as you grow especially for the appliances so with Microsoft applications what we need to worry about well you know from the keynote this morning that we have strong partnership with Microsoft and and Citrix and it really really showed I really liked that video with the microsoft CEO really showing that our partnership so we are continuing to work together as part of this as well with the the netscaler solutions so with this in mind we are going to go through in detail apolis will go through the details of all the different features as for each of these different apps Exchange SharePoint skype for business link and so forth so those are many things will go through as part of this I said our team did the deployment guide it is microsoft certified the completely validated deployment guidance that that's been put together by a team and then the ease of deployment was a part of this when we were talking to make sure that we have that the easy wizards and all those things that we could do for this right so the unique value prop you guys need to know for for the netscaler perspective is the optimization pieces you guys we get many features in the optimization that that a blush will go through front-end optimization as well as anything caching all those things that we do need to do for each of these apps security visibility and manageability all of that is part of this unique value prop because the security perspective you still need to have not only the ability to provide protection in the application layer but also in the content as well endpoint and network okay so we'll go through that in detail and the common deployment concerns that we've seen for our customers is the efficient balancing the connection time you guys know that the round-trip time for the app slow page load time was is a big one for four even our big customers in Korea was was always worried about that kind of measurement persistence and sessions excessive bandwidth usage we're just discussing this with a customer prior to this today Alton occasion points and content security okay so with that I think now we'll go through out there somewhere okay how nice killer can help we actually did some measurements there you'd have five times faster email access faster attachment downloads we have the low page load times for owa with our without netscaler and that measurements that's been done specific access policies authentication offload is there as well as restrict access to external clients so with that I think we're going to go through now in detail of all of these with demos okay right thank you thanks maressa so if you go back to slides back right I mean truly what we are trying to talk about here is not about what NetScaler does as a load balancer or you know as a gslv connecting multiple data centers rather the focus here is about those four key pillars optimization because delivering the app is no more the baseline the baseline is how fast can you deliver it how happy the end users are how slow you know how far you can reduce the network level and application level round-trip time how fast of the pages load on a SharePoint right how fast you can you know communicate across a link set up so those are the real things which people bother about while you talk about optimization and the moment you talked about Microsoft apps there's obviously a lot of security which comes into discussion so over the years what we have done is in at NetScaler is to focus at security along with optimization and when we talk about security it's not just about content secure security it's about security at a blade 3 layer for providing you different authentication solution ability to do single sign-on then providing you content security at Laverton layered 7 whether it's HTTP das protection or Application Firewall right the third important thing is in today's industry right and we saw it in the keynote we will see it in different sessions that it's all about data and it's all about analytics so you can you can get optimization you can get security but who will tell you how much it is optimized how secure your deployment is so visibility and analytics including the troubleshooting is also very very critical to the solution we want to deliver with Microsoft apps and while we do all of it manageability and ease of deployment right those are the top concerns for end-users customers that you know how can i how can I smoothly move from length 20 t into skype for business 2015 that's a typical question which we get every other day so these are the you know four key pillars we are going to talk about with respect to all these Microsoft apps so you see the list of apps here this is a lot of content what we have done is explicitly we have put more data on the slides because the slides are going to be available for you to review offline while we will talk about the highlights of the solution for every app which we want to deliver but then you can go through the slides on all these apps what we are doing you know three things we want to cover with for every app which is the value-add netscaler has for this particular app how does the simplified deployment topology look likes for the app and the third thing will be the configuration details a quick a snapshot of how netscaler our load balancing or the reset world level configuration looks like right that gives you an fair amount of idea that how the app is set up through netscaler you know what you need to worry about beyond that for a few apps we got some interesting demo videos which we will go through as well let's start with the microsoft exchange server 2013 and 2016 as I said if you see the bullet points you wouldn't see load balancing you wouldn't see G kind of gslv you didn't see all the basics of a DC which we do and we do it from several several years right and we do it perfectly fine and there are other solutions who can do that but what we are doing here is offloading entire authentication piece on netscaler making sure we can single sign-on on behalf of the end-user making sure we can do all form of authentication whether you want to factor multi-factor whether you want Kerberos basis a single sign-on or you want ntlm or you want a special directory service level single sign-on we can provide all of that including the smart card or the CAC card or the client certificate based use cases right when you talk about optimization again it's about the TCP optimization it's about the HTTP optimization front-end optimization where we can look at the content going over netscaler and then optimize those images optimize text optimize different type of content in context to how to optimize a different type like you know for an image how can you resize how can you reduce the size for text have whether a compression will work fine or you're just going to cash the text or netscaler so these different technologies make it you are really really useful and beneficial for end users to to look at our solution of what we do with exchange and we have published exchange 2013 guide exchange 2016 guide is going to come come up over the next week right the next slide is about the the deployment topologies so what we did is like I mean we can make it complex but in a very simplified way how did we deploy and tested and validated the solution in i have lab this is what you see here which is including the the exchange part of deployment and the directory service part of the deployment for all of the authentication use cases the next slide talks about the configuration on netscaler so you can see essentially you can see the all the V servers we have to configure so you know you got to create an endpoint for act of saying over RPC EWS auto-discovery for active sync so these I mean it's not very complicated but this is just a snapshot which gives you an idea of how the configuration and setup was done on netscaler for exchange environment just go back so I I just want to just want to also put point on on every slide what we have done is to include this particular you know link and it links specifically to the deployment guide for this particular application so when you get the ppt you know you will know what we have we are talking about and we know where the details by sheer point I mean we have been working with SharePoint right from 2007 I remember the sharepoint 2007 came up and there were a lot of customers asking about hey how do I code deploy netscaler with SharePoint at that point of time it was primarily a web-based delivery mechanism it was a web you know web app today a SharePoint has changed and dynamically and dramatically it's no more just web based right it includes various different type of applications different type of protocols you need to take care of so for sharepoint again we can we add value at the authentication layer security layer we have several deployments of applications firewalling with sharepoint optimization for sharepoint so if you go to our deployment guide section on citrix com unc at least like five or six different deployment and solution guides for sharepoint alone because there is so much value which we can add for the sharepoint deployments a typical sharepoint deployment looks like you know yeah so where you have the web server pool the app server pool and obviously you will have the directory service for the authentication use cases and sharepoint config is also simplified because what we did for sharepoint we could do was to build the application template so a lot of our customers have used application templates for deploying sharepoint 2010 and sharepoint 2013 we understand the application templates needs to come up to speed for the 2016 kind of configuration but if you deploy sharepoint using the application template it's a very simplified configuration single csv server and then internally you will see like 11 different CS policies pointing to the internal load balancing V servers again the link points you to the guide which provides complete details on every single bind point microsoft lync right now the link is interesting because it's unlike the you know sharepoint or exchange which has very very focused a specific use cases from lync 2010 to lync 2013 there were a lot of changes we should have brought in and so when you talk about length d and this is where it gets complex in terms of the ADC setup it this complex because because you're not just trying to do proxy layer for connection based load balancing you are trying to add value to every endpoint you want to publish for for Lync 2013 so using netscaler you can publish every service you want to for you for Lync 2013 and the next slide which talks about the skype for business 2015 right so you know we see a lot of customer use cases where people want to move from link to an attorney into skype for business 2015 now what has changed if you really talk about the internals and then mechanism of authentication optimization they all remain same there are additional set of services with which skype for business offers you right so we need it as an ADC we need to take care of that those additional services are represented in our configuration model and we can do optimization and security for all of those additional services which you will see in the next slide so yeah this this is where you know you see we have to literally create like 25 or up to 30 endpoints for various services provided by Skype for business whether it's submit' service it's it could be a third-party integration like a can of service or it could be over UDP over tcp so you need these endpoints configure our net scalars and and I'm not talking about the single netscaler I will show you the deployment topology how it looks like so when you look at the complete deployment this could be a multi multi set multi-tier deployment if you want a very very efficient environment setup for skype for business it all depends on how many services you want to offer to your end users and what complexity you want to get into but our approach covers all possible services you can deploy with you know Skype for business and and the third-party integrations so if you look at the deployment topology we kind of have in our lab essentially this is your DM Z parameter network layer where logically you are running two services one is the reverse proxy and the the other is the load balancing for your edge servers you have got the public clients the federated networks are the partner networks or the PSTN based clients all the clients can come in and the PST based clients can directly go into your internal network through the PA PSTN gateway now when the reverse proxy offers the services and the data outside to the clients it's actually talking to the internal load balancer which are doing load balancing for the front end server pool and the back end server pool and then there is a load balancing environment setup for your active directory services right so if you really look at various Bureau services or the features offered by Skype for business this the kind of deployment you are talking about if you want to have n to end coverage of all the features and functionalities you want to to your end users and we did certain you know the third-party integrations like with a Cano it was very successful and we have a few live deployments and you know maybe you know some of you already know about it that how well it works with the Skype for business and then we already have the deployment guide which is also published including the details for the third party federated services here is a quick demo on skype for business so in this demo essentially what we are trying to show here is so you got you got a virtual desktop and and that that's your that's your laptop and across the two clients we will be able two and these two clients are essentially simulated across two different networks so these are two different lands in between there is NetScaler set up entire NetScaler deployment for all the services and we will be able to do you know all of your basic chads desktop sharing audio video services across the Skype for business deployment which we have in our lab Network next so this is the there's a chat service and then the next thing will be to show the audio and obviously I mean we couldn't get the audio call you know think going to show you the audio feature but the the next thing is the desktop sharing and you know it works beautifully I mean if you set it up right it just takes time it's complex it's not easy it's not like SharePoint takes time but the when you set it up set it up right it just works beautifully right so you are now sharing the entire desktop with the user across the other network on the on the virtual desktop there was additional demo around the you know the econo capabilities and this is the next configuration as we put the snapshot over the ppt this the this is the set of v servers up you know you will see tcp SSL HTTP UDP sip all different kind of protocols we are trying to load balance and at the value of optimization and security around all these V servers and different protocols you need deal with the next is the Microsoft Dynamics CRM dynamics crm is again more of a web oriented properties and then obviously you know you could see a lot of benefits for dynamic CRM because given the use cases the TCP optimization benefits are huge fu optimization benefits are huge and it can it can be very easily integrated so you can have NetScaler not just serving or one single application you can have an its scale integrating multiple of these Microsoft apps you know the same NetScaler can do SharePoint and dynamic CRM and integrate with link on the backend right so a single netscaler can do multiple of these this is the deployment topology for dynamics crm which is again very straightforward very simple and we have kept it simple to make sure that we focus on the code next care and the application deployment and obviously there are multiple external pieces which you need to worry about based on your use case and you're you know value chain you want to build up this is the configuration snapshot for from the netscaler so v in our lab at this point have running netscaler for all these deployments so we have like created independent labs for all these applications and every time you get a ga build out the GI bill goes through testing for all of these critical applications price and that testing goes through our own network our own deployment and you see those snapshots right from those that deployment yeah so office 365 and Azure Active Directory and and some part of it you heard in the keynote that how we are trying to work with Microsoft on identity federation and integration use cases around active directory and identity so we did a lot of work for office 365 solutions while you know you can you can use NetScaler as an ad FS proxy you can use NetScaler for to contents which and load balance the load across enterprise and your cloud service the real value adds is around single sign-on the real value at is around identity federation and then working with some of our partners we could figure out some additional good good value adds right so we'll show you some of those demo this is the sam'l IDP configuration on NetScaler which is done to work with the office 365 using Azure Active Directory and we'll show you a quick demo of you know sam'l Bay's single sign-on right so this you know so essentially what happens in this demo is the first time you're trying to log in you will be you will be sent to the netscaler login page the triple ATM page which is the authentication or tenth occation login from NetScaler once you authenticate or NetScaler all your future access will be directly single sign on to the back end because now once we have your ad credentials in order of authentic authenticated user then we generate a sam'l assertion on behalf of you as a user and we act as a samurai DP and send that assertion back to office 365 every time you try to login so this is where you are logging into the netscaler or triple a and once the netscaler triple-a engine has your validated log in it will be able to do single sign-on for all your future access to office 365 involvement and we do have their but some customers who have actually kind of deployed this this part of the solution this one is even more interesting because this is a this is the solution we were working with our one of our global SI partner CSC and the requirements es he came up with was how do i how do I make sure that so they were working on a big project for a big large massive enterprise the requirement was that hey there are set of users who are the reward virtual desktop and then there are set of users who are not delivered virtual desktop right while they wanted to offer the office 365 service but not to all the users you know given their you know concerns and security reasons so they wanted us to provide a solution through netscaler by LEDs single sign-on how can we understand where the user is originating from and how can we block the access for users who are not coming from that particular IP range right so we kind of all down the solution slightly I would say this was a little innovation which we did around how do you use netscaler right I'm sure a lot of you would have used netscaler as a gateway right and when you use netscaler as a gateway there's a there is a core component in gateway which is called epa endpoint analysis so in this demo you see we have used EPA to figure out where the user is originating from and based on that we are taking their along with single sign-on we are able to take the decision whether to let the user go on to office 365 or block the access right so essentially these are two different networks again one network which is on the client the other network which is on the virtual desktop and the user from virtual desktop is allowed to go to office 365 while the user from declined the same user cannot access office identified using our EPA delivered solution so this is the policy configuration on netscaler to figure out which subnet the user is coming from but the the innovative you know thought process here is that hey we have tried to reuse our gateway value add pieces like endpoint analysis why we are not doing any gateway here along with our authentication module to to provide this use case so you need to pay little attention that the moment the user tries to log in even before we try to login we go and validate you know the policy which was set up on netscaler using EPA and this is where the user gets blocked right so this is a typical eps creed ii which you will see if your access is denied and it will tell you the reason by the excess is denied and so we figured out that using this kind of an environment we can use different kind of a PHX it's not just about checking which IP range you are coming from it could be like what kind of OS patch you are running what kind of firewall you are running what kind of antivirus you are running so we can use different part of the logic on EPA to make sure when you allow when we allow access to you know different set of resources we can control and ensure that the user has right set of softwares form words and the priority is to go to the external site so you know as I said this is the solution we covert with CSC and who have deployed this solution already in the enterprise users cool so you know some of these applications we know exactly what kind of reverse proxy value we add right how about direct access a lot of customers we talk to you know direct access is something like in many reasons it's like it's like by default adopted right and the moment you drop direct access while we might be you know typically we can add all the reverse proxy value but I wanted to give the use case of why it is important to use an ADC like netscaler for your detect access deployment because you don't want to have you don't want to run a single direct access server because that's a that's a kind of line of failure for you the moment you put to direct access servers or more than two to create the n plus 1 cluster you understand that you are running into this problem which is called managed out problem the manager out problem is there because when the client connects to direct access you know it's a transparent connection you go through one of the one of the direct access server you reach the back end but when the back end generates response and sends it back it can go through any of the direct access server and the moment the response lands on a different access server the outbound traffic can't be managed this is a problem which is there all over internet you can search about it and you know so again for us there is no magic you can't solve it with single netscaler it's going to be a two-tier load balancing deployment for direct access for a complete production grades setup and scenario so the manager out problem is is something you should look at how we are solving and on the next slide but before that you know the other value-add we are doing is like before even before you authenticate to direct access we can do lot of pre authentication on netscaler for the client site traffic so we had a customer was talking about his use case that hey you know I don't want to put direct access you know directly visible to end clients I want to use net skill in front of direct access because of all the security concerns and he wanted us to prove that we can do pre authentication and we worked out a solution where netscaler can do pre authentication before your certificates are passed on to the actual direct access server right so lot of value in this deployment topology as you see there are two tiers the front interior is essentially load balancing the direct access servers and plus one cluster and the backend tier is essentially talking load balancing and talking to the backend app servers web servers so there is a synchronization in between the front and tier and the back end here we generate a special session token when we send the traffic from the client side to the server side and the and the sauna side next killer knows which which of the you know direct access server the response needs to go through for to make sure for making sure that you know it goes to the right direct access server which has the client token so that you don't run into the manager out problem and this is a proven solution already we have done be retesting POC but it is coming as GA and in 11 dot 1 which is the end of q2 this is you know again it's it's not top of the priority but just wanted to make sure that you know that we have a complete solution for Microsoft TMG replacement as you see TMG was a ticket to turn was the last major version of TMG and after that TMZ was taken out of business and since then we have done several deployments several replacements this is just the list of stuff what we can do 40 mg and the successfully replace any TMG deployment out there these are typical TMG based deployment topology how it looks like for TMZ services so we have a you know we have a back-end infrastructure where you got the netscaler on one end and the TMG on the other end and we try and test all the services delivered through both the tears to make sure that both this all the services can be equally delivered NetScaler does a lot for the Microsoft sequel server as well right I mean when we talk about sequel server again it is it is not about clear for load balancing we have a feature called data stream and tomorrow there is a session on oracle and and the data stream our technology if you are interested you can join and there to learn more about what we do about sequel server what we do for data stream how do we treat sequel differently than TCP and as compared to http right but we look at sequel at layer 7 whether you are talking about my sequel ms equal are all oracle queries right so a lot of value add for sequel server deployments as well there is this deployment guide sections on NetScaler homepage and you know if you go to the section you will see lots and and there is a specific section for microsoft only right and given you'll see a lot of deployment guides like for example here are some of the netscaler data sheets for Microsoft apps you have the deployment guides for as you're you know you have these deployment guide along with working with zen abs index top you have all these deployment and solution guides for exchange and sharepoint I was talking about because these are the apps we have been working with for several years so we have built a lot of value then we have got the link deployment guides for 2013 and 2016 is also out now we have the office communications server deployment guides TMG replacement related deployment guides and how do you build a solution if your if you want to replace the TMG in your network then we got other microsoft deployment guides which is dear Dynamics CRM sequel server NetScaler as it a DFS proxy skype for business 2015 so you can see I mean you know it's as Maurice a touched upon in the beginning it is it isn't it is not about just one of activity for us when it comes to Microsoft apps it's a very very focused group which works on all the microsoft apt related requirement we figure out what do we need to build new to optimize secure and ensure the application delivery for all the microsoft critical apps right so this is what we want to kind of summarize with the end value that you know it's again about four critical things when we talk about Microsoft for netscaler optimization not just about I can do caching I can do compression when we talk about optimization we go all the way further look at the TCP look at the UDP look at front and optimization look at how we can optimize the sip workflows how we can optimize the ssl connection establishment security as I talked about it's all the way from layer 42 layer 7 various kind of dust protection application level queuing and then obviously the web application firewall for visibility and troubleshooting some of you must have heard about or played around with our inside center solution if you pick up inside centre you can see and get a lot of visibility and analytics data around all the app deployments and it is visibility and troubleshooting and analytics is also part of the netscaler mass solution which we are building right now which is supposed to come out end of the end of q2 so that's where the whole point is right i mean it's it's it's much beyond when we talk about microsoft app we are looking at all these unique value proposition we add to microsoft application and not just about you know plain vanilla load balancing or a DC right but that back to Marissa okay so we finished off last few slides one is a community we go through this now for a lot of our sessions so everybody is aware that we now have a growing netscaler community where you can provide your input not just is not driven anymore from from our from the Citrix perspective is the end user that actually provides this content and the details of that is here we have the spiceworks IT central sea ugc github or all the things that we are working on in terms of community so lots of growing community please be a part of it you can find these details on how to get some of these for github and then the next one then unhand then how do you get involved so join and and be a part of this community you can share the knowledge with each other things you do like I have a customer case study tomorrow a session with a session 22 245 245 at eleven-fifteen and it was a customer that's going to go through their use case and it's all pick out sharing the knowledge right so that's what we're doing here and there will be a specific networking special interest group just in this sea ugc okay next and developer resources is all available as well as for all the other ones that we go through we want to make sure that you know that we have all these out not only the guys but also the sdk and so forth next and then then the sessions for the surveys please give us your feedback on this session if this is what you wanted content-wise let us know the sessions for tomorrow the go to sin 245 11am there's also other ones with the Gateway sessions in the afternoon for details of that and many more netscaler sessions tomorrow as well as well as thursday maybe I don't know yeah all the way up to tell ya up to it up to thursday with that we have a few minutes to open it up for Q&A and then whoever gives us a really good question can get this shirt yeah I understand that this is primarily around NetScaler delivering Microsoft apps but can you present other web applications that are like internally built oh yeah absolutely so if you look at the application templates the first time we've published templates for all the regular apps we did publish a template for general purpose web app so all the value adds we talked about for Microsoft applications you can actually absolutely do the same value ads for you know your general general purpose web application but it's really important to understand what kind of application and what kind of use cases you are talking about because I was mentioning that optimization for different applications behave you know you got to really understand which protocols you're talking about whether it is important to do caching or not I mean by default caching wouldn't work for everything like for exchange you might not get a lot of help with caching but you know 40 specifically you might get help for cash but yeah this is primarily for like our internal apps that we may want to provide available externally for certain users but we want to incorporate two-factor authentication yes so that they can access that application externally so it's really not for performance per se but rather trying to get that to factor into the application using them they are so all of the features we have talked about there are these features are not kind of in the system tied to Microsoft apps these features are generally available for any use case in every use case you might have so you know absolutely you can use two-factor or multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities with all the different apps you have internally and then one last question on the input analysis can you determine like if if a pc is domain join or if it's not then you know you know absolutely because well because doing joint pc beans we should have all ten takeda the user / curb right so it's easy to identify whether the pc's dimin join or not and you can define our if your policy you might not have the expression available but if thats use cases is interesting to you drop us a note and we'll figure it out yeah but it's possible kind of following on from that gentleman's question our particular environment is is heavy and PeopleSoft do you have anything in the roadmap for for the kind of analysis that you've done in the Microsoft Application realm toward PeopleSoft yes so PeopleSoft is another application which is there as part of our lab setup I mean you know these sessions are little focus on one vendor specific applications like I talked about yesterday at 2pm around we have a session for oracle apps and all the all the application work we have done for oracle i'll give you my card if you can reach out offline i'll send you the details we have done for with PeopleSoft and you know how to be add value appreciated and we have the Oracles his Oracle session tomorrow is that 3 2 2 2 20 to 30 and is a session 314 ok any other yes can you PA do any limited analysis without an agent installers everything happens is everything dependent on that agent software paint on there so that you're talking about the EPA use case hmm there is no agent here oh there isn't it is no okay because the the screen that you pulled up said install this software now okay this is the this is just based on triple ATM and along with triple-a tea and we are able to use EPA scans so there's no end agent on the on the client okay great thank you all right from my side regarding cloud apps nowadays a lot of applications have been publishing the clouds or corporate apps publishing the cloud how doesn't it scalar provide their compatibility to secure the clouds in the application in the cloud beat as you or betws right right right so so we'd little bit talked about the office 65 use case or if you look at the typical cloud apps use case I mean the way we look at how we can add value is not not essentially through the typical reverse proxy scenario but it's more so even if your enterprise users are going to the cloud app you don't want to lose the authentication and tracking right so you want to authenticate the implies or the partners internally you using your ad the typical authentication setup then you want and device which can do act as an proxy for users when they go out and because you want to keep it seamless you don't want the users to log in here log in there so authentication single sign-on and then all kind of protection which can we can provide recommend you to look at the ad FS proxy guide which we did and again not saying that you know every use cases ad FS but those are the typical use cases of how you integrate in between the enterprise deployed and partially cloud deployed application for the enterprise users so I just want to follow up on his question so we're potentially looking at lots of different cloud providers so are you saying we could use netscaler for when people you know connect in and go back out we're using netscaler as the central pane of glass to connect all these different cloud providers so the use case there i was talking about was that cape all the enterprise users come into enterprise right and you authenticate once and then your typical idea is that hey once you authenticate to me you can use all of the enterprise resources and also the cloud-based resources right that's where we act as an ad FS proxy for microsoft use case and and other use cases as well but if you want to talk about the gendrich clouds like awas or or let's say you have a hosted application enable abuse or a zero or softlayer right so you know there could be different use cases I mean a simple example I can give is netscaler as an ADC is available in all these cloud layers like all the infrastructure layers you can have you can use netscaler as a reverse proxy you can use netscaler as a verra plication firewall you can use netscaler for authentication and offload so it depends on what kind of use case you know you're talking about or you want to explore all the possibilities are there one interesting trend we see in enterprise is that you you don't want I mean in most cases what we see is that yes things are moving to cloud apps are shifting from the data center to the cloud but end of it what you want is that consolidated path of exes right you don't want I mean nobody wants really you know users to ax access the business and productivity app just from wherever they are and whichever path they have got right so you want the users to come into the enterprise authenticate make sure you are able to track them and then go and access those apps if you do that you have the value adds of tracking the users you can provide you an analytic services for the users we can tell you who was the user when he logged in which all which are all the apps we did a single sign-on for the user what how much time he spent on that cloud app right all those different use cases netscaler can help with today okay we went at a time so maybe we can take a last one yeah it's okay so the question I had was that the gentleman over there was asking more on different cloud mythology's but my question is so using you p based on the epa on a triple-a design say i'm using and it does a scan on my cat card or piff card one of them what I'm curious is as I do that with an integration of the same ol authentication or assertions I'm going to say AWS today however I still have that session and I drop off with it does it still keep my session if I try to connect to an application in Marcus off for sure so it keeps a does yes so so again that is based on your requirement you can define the log of profile you can say that a once a session is over for a bit a nap you wait for two minutes and then you log the user out right or you can say that you know you don't bother about when the user is going to come back again just keep the sam'l assertion token available and ready whenever the user logs back in you take him and connect to the next sat so it totally depend on how you want to set up the infrastructure but we can do both okay thank you so much all right thank you very much for yours much border
