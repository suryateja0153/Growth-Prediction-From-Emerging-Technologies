 chief Cooks champion is no I hello I'm my name is Bob Holly and I am speaking on behalf of chip Cox and he could not be here due to transportation issues and I'm waiting for my presentation to come up perfect ok um empath is a regional group that is focused on connecting higher education institutions and universities in Latin South Latin and Central America it has really three different major projects one is the am path international exchange point in Miami which is also a distributed exchange point with locations in South America the am light environment which on which the empath network runs that gives 140 gigabits of connectivity to South America and Central America and then Atlantic wave sdx which is a newest item that we are working on focused on a software-defined exchange that allows for the various national entities to connect with the within the software-defined exchanged and the individual participants to create virtual exchanges on top of the existing exchange so I've covered many of these things the regional exchange point is based in the notify in Miami and it is obviously the main point of interconnection in Miami for much of South and Central America to the US and the u.s. research and education networks so am light is as you have a better picture so am light is a growth of connectivity out of Miami that is primarily oceanic connectivity that was 40 gigs and is in the process of going to 140 gigs and has the definite capacity and plan to be over 680 gigs in the next couple of years supporting substantial traffic both to the Internet to various peers as well as research and education interconnectivity in South and Latin America under the hood am light is focused on a software-defined open flow based network that allows for direct interconnection across a virtual infrastructure so therefore other national research and education networks can connect both to each other as well as to the US as well as using Atlantic wave going all the way over to the all over to Europe when you look at the environment obviously it's got a set of switches which interconnect the various environments and then the control plane infrastructure that supports the software-defined Network this is probably a much better picture of it showing you the linkages from Miami all the way out to Amsterdam throughout the United States and then quite a bit of linkages in South America the the network supports both academic connectivity as well as connectivity that is focused on traditional Internet connectivity and it's segmented in the environment to make sure that they are able to both have no contention between each other and traffic the environment it is not a multilateral peering environment each participant must make an arrangement with the other in order to transit traffic or peer traffic ampath itself the exchange in Miami has over five hundred and fifty different settlement free peering agreements as well as connectivity amongst the Canadian South American and and all the Americas for academic connectivity ampath is focused on devices that are primarily in Miami but also extend all the way to Amsterdam and through the Florida IX in that area we certainly support all different link speeds having customers connecting at hundred gig as well as of course IP v4 and v6 in addition the environment provides an opportunity for Internet transit with a number of tier 1 providers utilisation has certainly grown and the various links and I showed earlier that we're moving to 140 gigs on the environment we currently are utilizing about 35 and the entire environment currently sees about 60 if you don't include the long-haul transit so what's next many of you may be here talking about their you're moved to software-defined exchanges which allow all participants as well as participants behind those participants to have direct interconnection across a virtual fabric the underlying infrastructure that exists supporting the am light environment as well as combining that with an path creates this larger inter-domain environment that many can use to connect both to each other without direct coordination through a map or am light using various Sdn componentry this in the use of time I won't go over this slide in much detail this shows generally the ability for autonomous system a to be virtually connected to autonomous system d even though the underlying environment is not a direct connection and then when you look at what we've designed but not deployed yet we have the environment so southern lights and paths and socks can all communicate with each other across this sulfur to find exchange making a entire virtual fabric when you look at sdx applications you can certainly set rule sets in the control plane that will do many things in much more detail than it has ever been available on the traditional exchanges allowing you to do traffic engineering and application management throughout there you can create policies based on basic packet data and you can also unify that information with other data that is from other internal and external reporting systems and tools as an example if traffic was destined to port 80 then you can forward from asn a to b however if it's some other destination are as indicated you can jump it the other way which allows you to create the software-defined exchange with much more capability than traditional exchanges so right now where the statuses the environment is being specified we're expecting to have it available as a prototype during the internet to technology exchange in the US and September and we're hoping to have a demo at that point generally in summary am light and am path serve as a platform that allow extensive peering and interconnectivity amongst higher education universities and colleges not just in South and Latin America but also going throughout the world across the software exchange exchange that we're deploying when we when we deliver this it's going to create a couple of challenges because it will potentially use substantial more capacity than ones done before and traffic flows may not be known before the exchange actually exists so traditional traffic flows between asna and asn be that we generally see that are relatively predictable across an environment that allows software-defined exchange there can be substantial shifts of traffic without expectation any questions asiya stealing alguien tiene alguna pregunta laguna pregunta y tal vez é o una pregunta y te voy a hacer en español en mi pais in Ecuador a luna red academica y que hemos tratado connect Starla a al punto intercambio de tráfico sin embargo la la red academica todabia no estas preparado para para st connect our second in túcume de tráfico tienen su infrastructure abbr para la parte de investigación y esa parte y no se de CMS Claire la con el internet traditional n2n2 presentazione y como como se mezcla estos mundos de de la red académica y el internet a regular que tenemos todo um my Spanish is okay not not certainly excellent thank you for the question I think that you indicated that your national network and your education network have inter connection but there the level of preparation for this environment is something new is beyond where you currently stand is that correct yeah the problem is it Academy is different from Internet yes and a sedia is the educational network nekoda and they have a network for research write up is now connected to the internet okay this environment we've transit we translate across the exchange point both academics exclusive across either vlans or software-defined networking or and we can also at the same time transit internet and this layout that is proposed here will allow us to allow both to use the same officer and potentially pier with each other but the academic institutions will have the ability to not have traffic contention or traffic concern between the net the traditional Internet connectivity and academic connectivity so make sure I this environment can certainly support interconnection of the two while providing an environment that supports both of their individual needs a alguna otra pregunta I arriba y alguna pregunta si por hora y puedes pregunta alo Fabian see ernesto perez l cydia poruka y nosotros estamos trabajando para la Reed académica nuestra tenella separada de la rey de lo que vamos otro murcia en todo caso no I the net watch or connected at a like one level but they are separated at it cross the either at a VLAN level or on in stn well currently our ISPs doing the job but we are working to improve the network and to use our own network inside ecuador for the academic network and for the commercial traffic as we call it we will use a different with different channels so this is not how to say a big concern at the moment you know okay anyway we are also always willing to to to be part of not Ecuador yes I don't know I'm sorry that I don't know that abilities of amp app to connect to the nap Ecuador but I do know that there's substantial connectivity available to Miami yes indeed ok gracias alguna otra pregunta muchas gracias thank you
