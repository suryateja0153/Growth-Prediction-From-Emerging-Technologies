 Kevin you have been here in the region and visitied multiple companies. Can you please tell me about Hexagon SmartBuild? Sure we've been going around in Stavanger in quite a lot of meetings with a lot of prospective clients and really three things that I think they found most useful. The first one is the connectivity of the system Hexagon Smart Build is focused on supporting the end construction user and by being linked through to the shedule the cost of materials we can actually improve the way in which is work and also get a much better feedback from sight through to managing a plant.So connectivity is very important it's simple I mean 15 minutes of use and training a one quick video and be able to use it so it's really built for the construction user when he feeds back use a mobile phone to get the information back you know when yet get when you on the side and you get an accurate representation of the progress of the project so the feedback from the trade back to the office back to the owner means to say that you'll get better progress measurement very simple to use very simple to get the information and then finally the clarity of information when you're the owner or the executive of the general construction company or the foreman or the actual and construction worker you'll be able to get much more clarity to the tasks that you've got to do if there's a change in the schedule what it means on cost and schedule and linking with Leica and all the total stations means so you get a real feedback from sight in the three things: Clarity, Connectivity and Simplicity of use of the system is really resonated well here in Norway.  Excellent thanks for shaing Kevin.
