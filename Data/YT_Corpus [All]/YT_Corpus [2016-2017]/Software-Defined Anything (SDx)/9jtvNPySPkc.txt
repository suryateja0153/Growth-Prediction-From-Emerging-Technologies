 I'm here to give a strategic update of Xilinx we've been going through a corporate transformation for about four years and we just this year hit a major milestone in transforming the portfolio which supports the transformation of the company let me just start with a quick overview of Xilinx for those of you who follow us you know we've done about 2.4 billion dollars in the last fiscal year we've had a history of innovation with over 60 industry first about 10 of those being in the last four years that really enable us to pursue this corporate transformation we now also achieved market share that is beyond fifty five percent now I'd like to go into a little bit more about this corporate transformation we've talked about transforming ourselves from a programmable logic company to what we call an all programmable company that includes all programmable technologies hardware programmable software programmable and i/o programmable those technologies are mixed into a portfolio of all programmable devices those include FPGAs all programmable system on chips and 3d ICS we now also support the programming of these devices with all programming models so that's traditional hardware centric programming models which is RTL based as well as what we call software-defined programming models which are based on C C++ and overall higher levels of abstractions and languages all of these together enable us to pursue all programmable electronic systems and networks which is really the top-level mega trend in our industry so what we've done is we've set an aggressive course for the next five years if you look at this chart it's really like a timeline prior to 2011 we were a programmable logic company focused on FPGAs and traditional ways of programming those FPGAs we then in 2011 introduced our 28 nanometer portfolio this included technologies that were beyond Hardware programmable to software programmable especially embodied in our Zink SOC s we also expanded our design environments to higher levels of abstraction using C and C++ now in 2015 we've introduced a number of new elements to our portfolio multiple what we call SDX software-defined development environments to go after the broader set of users systems and software engineers we've introduced MPs OCS which are multi processing system on ships with seven software programmable cores this allows a much higher level of intelligence and integration so we've now expanded ourselves from just all programmable to also all programmable and software-defined and that allows us to pursue not only the 50 maybe 70,000 hardware engineers but go well beyond that potentially to 5x that 250,000 or more systems and software engineers and also align ourselves to the highest growth industry megatrends what we're doing is removing many of the barriers to much broader adoption of our technologies and deployment into these new generations of smarter and connected systems so first we're changing the programming model we're now moving to software-defined programming models complementing still the RTL based programming models of the past we've also moved to higher levels of intelligence and integration in the silicon products that we offer and those two things together are enabling us to participate in many of the highest growth industry mega trends those include video and turning that video into some kind of intelligent vision or machines that see interpret and then act on what they see a major application of vision based systems is a TAS and also the road to autonomous vehicles when you think about the future of those vehicles they'll also be connected and they're also part of what we call the industrial internet of things that also includes smart factories smart energy smart cities and a host of other connected machines and systems that ultimately change not only core systems and technologies but also entire societies in the way we operate much of this will also be enabled by the next generation of wireless technology we all know that 4G changed the way that we experience our smartphones and 5g will do that as well but there's many other new elements that are really targeted to enabling the next generation of these connected machines and connected societies these infrastructures will also change in terms of how we communicate we're going to have more software-defined networks and virtualization of many of these Network functions that are encapsulated in this terms of Sdn and NFV and of course a key element of NFV is to leverage the cloud but of course many other elements of everything we do everyday will also be done in the cloud and that leads us to the final element or the megatrend of next generation cloud computing so if we go up to even a higher level what we're solving is something we call a programmable dichotomy there are things pulling us towards software but also an equal number of things pulling us towards hardware but yet all with the need to retain the flexibility through program ability so there's a number of things flexibility intelligence scalability centralized control ease of development and ease of upgrade that pull you towards software but there's also a number of things Big Data video multi-level security the need for instant response with low latency low power and also any to any connectivity that really pull you towards the need to optimize in hardware so Xilinx is addressing this programmable dichotomy by combining elements of software-defined programming models with hardware optimization using our new STX software development environments with the core of that being based on high-level synthesis leveraging high-level languages and also Hardware optimization based on FPGAs and all programmable SOC s and MPs OCS this is enabling all programmable systems and all programmable networks so we're doing this through a new era of offerings it's really our new portfolio and I could not have talked about this in 2014 but as of 2015 we've now introduced three new Software Defined development environments that we call SDX we also have introduced this new generation of SOC s we call em PS OCS multi processing system on chips with a new generation of intelligence and integration and finally we're building on another generation of ultra scale ASIC class FPGAs and 3d ICS so when you look at what we're doing is we're really creating software-defined leadership to complement what we've done traditionally with RTL based design here's a map that shows the different alternatives our customers have on the vertical axis is ease of development on the horizontal axis is performance per watt and any-to-any connectivity if you look at the cpus and gpus and NP use and other alternatives like the software programmable SOC s they've traditionally been much better than we have been at ease of development but they've lacked the kind of performance and power and connectivity that we've offered what we're doing now is moving up to try to match the ease of development of these other alternatives while retaining all of the advantages of the performance power and what we call any to any connectivity critical for the next generation of connected devices and machines so with this leadership we're able to define our company in a much broader when we say all programmable we're talking about all programmable technologies all programmable devices all programming models it allows us to provide a combination of software intelligence with Hardware optimization and any to any connectivity that's any media over any network using any standard talking to any machine talking to any other machine and we have a much broader portfolio of FPGAs s o C's M PS o CS 3d ICS ASIC class Hardware tools and now also these software-defined development environments when you look at the alternatives I showed you in the previous graph you can see that they lack many of the things that we provide they do not provide the any-to-any connectivity they cannot provide customized Hardware optimization they don't allow our customers to truly differentiate and they're not all programmable so these all programmable solutions enable us to participate now in these high-growth mega trends and I'll now touch a bit on the requirements of those mega trends if you talk to a CTO for example in our customer base they will talk about this list of requirements they want their next-generation technologies to be connected because they're connected they need to be secure often they need to be safe as we talked about they typically need to be software-defined many of the functions need to be virtualized whether it's in a cloud or it's an embedded system a lot of intelligence comes through analytics often these are machines that see or have to deal with video and they have to be enabled with scaleable multi processing technology that also supports high degrees of acceleration and Hardware optimization so all of these megatrends require these next-generation requirements with the new portfolio that I described earlier we now can support each of these next-generation requirements let me contrast the old Xilinx with the new Xilinx programmable logic versus all programmable so programmable logic had enabled our customers to do connectivity typically focused at the chip level and maybe to the backplane but not necessarily a broader view of the new connected world of machines talking to other machines they also supported acceleration functions that may be needed some special performance or lower power when you look at all programmable technologies in this list of next generation requirements you can see it's much much broader all of these elements now are supported with Xilinx is all programmable portfolio whereas in the past as you see only a small subset were supported with the traditional programmable logic portfolio so this has allowed us to really complete our corporate transformation we can now say we've moved from the left side of this chart to the right side from programmable logic to all programmable from supporting glue and bridging applications and acceleration to now enabling smarter and connected systems from design environments that were focused on time to implementation to design environments with higher levels of abstractions that enable the fastest time for differentiated systems and networks removed from supporting only FPGA engineers to systems and software engineers and from a focus on IC features to really system value so as I said earlier we've set an aggressive course for the next five years in 2011 we moved from programmable logic to all programmable and now I can say in 2015 we've moved to software-defined and all programmable align to the industry's highest growth mega trends and as part of that we're expanding our user base approximately 5x in the next five years thank you you
