 so let's get started this is the epic GUI here and right here under l4 and seven services under the packages tab this is where we import Citrix device package and let us go back to the tenants yeah so to make the netscaler context-aware under l4 and seven services under the l for l 7 devices tab there is a parameter called context-aware which should be set to multiple when this is set the epic configures netscaler in a context-aware mode so admin partition is used to make the setup context of it so let me demonstrate how to create a partition using the cisco epic so let me go to the CLI here so i'm creating a tenant called tenant one and using a simple load balancing configuration here in the xml the create el defile your context-aware should be set to multi context this conflict when this is done this particular parameter is set to multiple or multi context and that scalar is configured in partition aware mode so let's see if the tenant is created yeah there is a tenant one created here and under the ten into one so under the tenant one let's go to the year four and seven devices so we should be seeing the context aware to be set to multiple and let's check if the graph is deployed yeah okay so we can see that a graph instance is deployed let's go to the netscaler and see how all this maps so this is my next scalar user interface so we use a combination of tenant named context name and be divided e to create a partition so we had created a power tenant named tenant one so as you can see there is a partition created for it so tenant one using VR fvr f1 and the V divided ebaying 4855 so let us switch to this partition and see if all our configuration has been deployed so show IP show VLAN yeah so if you go to the deployed devices here you should be able to see which vrf is being used so for 35 and to sorry five yes so that is here as well so let's see for load balancing server has been deployed as well so crap and yeah as you can see this was the configuration that we pushed and this has arrived thank you
