 okay so the the ccd sensor is made of silicon it works based on the photoelectric effect and it's comprised of an array of pixels on the other hand the CMOS sensor is made of silicon it is based on the photoelectric effect and it comprises an array of pixels e so maybe we need to dig just a little deeper because on the surface exactly the same thing let's start out with how the thing works the first part is the photoelectric effect this is a effect that was actually explained by Albert Einstein before he just figured out the theory of relativity in fact that's what he got his Nobel Prize for not not relativity and what happens in a flaw took effect is a photon of light hits a piece of metal and knocks off an electron this is normally done in a vacuum so you can collect the electrons and they explain how how all this works in a quantum mechanical sense in a silicon sensor it's a little bit different the it also exhibits this photoelectric effect where a photon comes in hits an atom of silicon and knocks off an electron but because photons can actually penetrate into the silicon the electrons are actually released inside the crystal they're not released out on the surface like they're with a metal both CCD and CMOS sensors use ultra pure silicon as a detector now silicon is a very interesting substance because it's what's called a semiconductor and you can play with its electrical properties very simply by adding little bits of contaminants in there basically a different atom so in this case this is a germanium crystal with an atom of arsenic stuck in there every so often and our sticks are very similar material to germinate Romanian but has a different number of electrons and so what this does is it has an extra left over electron and it actually can roam around in the crystal the same way electrons will roam around inside of a metal so it makes the material suddenly changing from a very good insulator into a pretty good conductor same thing with a p-type material in this example here we have silicon atoms and we stuck at the atom of aluminum in here and the aluminum hat doesn't have an extra electron it has a missing electron and that missing electron what we call a whole can actually wander around the crystal too and this lets current flow inside the the semiconductor so we've changed it from being like an insulator into being more like a metal now the the fun part comes when you bought up a n-type and a p-type material together so this is the simplest type of semiconductor device we've butted up together a p-type and n-type region and in fact it's usually made in a single crystal we just stick the extra atoms in and what happens is they cancel out the electrons and holes in this middle region called the depletion region they all cancel and no current can flow so no current can flow through this device but if you add more electrons over on one's on one side and more electrons over here and more holes over here by attaching a battery you could actually make the current flow because it shrinks the depletion region and current starts to flow if you turn that battery around current doesn't flow this is what's called a diode so it's a simple a switching device now if you make more complex structures for example PNP or NPN this is what's called a transistor which is an electric switch more commonly though these days we actually use what's called a field effect transistor I should also mention that we can take the silicon dioxide wafer dope it with these NM p-type contaminants and then add aluminum or copper tracks and we make a whole circuit on a single piece of silicon so this is how all modern electronics are built and most of our on set to be designed in a package where the light can't get into it because if flight gets into the package it will actually start turning all the switches on and it actually interferes with the operation of your electric circuit an optical sensor on the other hand deliberately instead of having a metal or plastic cap on it you actually have a piece of glass and that allows the light in hitting the silicon and generating what a photo electrons inside the silicon so both the CMOS and CCD sensors take advantage of this characteristic silicon so the the fundamental performance of these of the detectors the performance of silicon and that if you make your sensor as good as can possibly be it will be limited by the silicon so it really comes down to how close you can get your design to be the optimum performance of the silicon detector so what is the difference well let's talk about the CCD this is a charge-coupled device that's where the CCD comes from and basically the pixels are defined by oxide insulator and wire electrodes so there's a layer of silicon dioxide here which is an insulator and then there's electrodes on top and they have some are positives some are negative and the light goes through these electrodes into the silicon and generates photoelectrons photon hits the silicon knocks off an electron and it's free to roam around but because there's a positive charge up here the electrons are attracted to it so they head up towards the positive electrode what they can't get through the silicon dioxide so they all sit here and they collect as you expose your camera to the stars so during the exposure they all collect together in these little wells which are what the pixels are and then at the end of the exposure they're they're clocked out one packet at a time and the way this works is those electrodes are chained voltage and so it's no longer positive now it's negative and the electrons all chase away across a chip and you just keep selecting the electrodes and the pixels cycle across a chip to the to the bottom where they run horizontally out the side and they all come out in a single readout register in one corner of the chip so the the big advantage of this is that one single amplifier that's doing everything is doing the exact same thing every time so it's extremely consistent you get the exact same characteristic for the read over every pixel in the array because it's the same transistor reading out every pixel in a right it does have the disadvantage of being slower because all the charge has to be clocked out to the bottom corner of the array so some cc's are actually designed with multiple readouts and they may be in all four corners in some cases and they all clock out in four different directions that's just to speed it up now once you get the charge at the output node of the the of the CCD array its readout and presented as a voltage and that's read by some electronics they use an analog to digital converter to turn that into a number your ad use you used to seeing on your computer there's actually some more fancy electronics in between there they have a thing called a correlated double sampler which basically every time you dump a pixel and you have to throw up charge out so as a reset circuit I throws it out and then you measure the leftovers because the reset isn't perfect and then you dump new charge and read it again and you subtract the two and that gives you just time when she dumped in because there's some noise associate with resetting it you can't perfectly reset it every time the laws laws of physics are actually on the way on this one but we can scoot around the laws of physics by being clever but our circuit design so the circuitry for the CCD is kind of complicated both because of all those fancy retail electronics and also because the clocks all these electrodes going across a chip I'll require really weird voltages the most complex CCD chip I've ever seen the ki 10 1010 100 rather from Kodak now on semiconductor has 11 vertical clocks which are all three state voltages and then about half a dozen horizontal clocks so that's what 17 different pins on the chip you have to cycle the different voltages so there's a lot of electrons to drive this chip so that's a disadvantage of the CCD the advantage is the extreme consistency of the CCD now ccds are not perfect devices they have various problems and one of them is you have all these electrodes that are going across the top of the chip and they block light now people have made technology to make the electrodes more transparent but the fact is they still absorb or reflect some of the light that comes in so a lot of manufacturers have now come up with these micro lenses and what they do is they take the light coming into the sensor and they direct it into the photodiode the actual sensor area so that all the surface of the chip is now sense of delight or as much as possible and that is what we call fill factor how much of the front of the chip is actually sensitive to light and so these micro lenses help the fill factor they improve it again transparent electrodes there are various different kinds of ccd sensors there are full-frame sensors where all the charges actually clocked up from pixel to pixel on this way out of the sensor you actually need a mechanical shutter to cover it during that readout otherwise the image will blur as you're reading it out there are also what are called interline and frame transfer CDs interline see CDs for example have a row of uncensored of pixels between all the sensitive pixels and then at the end of the exposure all the pixels jump half a pixel over and they're covered up by this by this barrier made of aluminum that's on top of them and now they can be clocked at without any light contaminated contaminating them the disadvantage is now half the chip is taken up with these readout columns which means that there's less room for electrons and there's less fill factor which again is what the micro lens is helpless so there's the reasons for using interline sensors as they live the shutter and they're faster so there are compromises in the designs of the sensors now the ultimate insensitivity comes from a back-illuminated CCD most sensors have the light coming in from the front they go through all the electrodes and gates and things into the silicon at the back where they're detected now if you can flip this over and have the light come in from the back you avoid all that and so the light just falls directly on the silicon and it is it detected all of this detective there's a hundred percent fill factor the disadvantage of this is in order for this to work the chip has two very very thin like maybe ten microns thick so what they do is they build it this way first and then they flip it over and they polish off the back of the chip and since 10 microns is very very thin if you go a little too far you have no chip left and if you don't go far enough it doesn't work so these are very difficult to make and as a result of that their production yields are lower so the costs are much much higher so that's a disadvantage of these sensors but with back-illuminated thin sensors you can achieve up to ninety eight percent flow of photon sensitivity so you get 100 photons in and you get ninety eight foot electrons out that is almost perfect for all intents and purposes so that's why people are willing sometimes to spend the big bucks to buy a back-illuminated sensor because their performance is incredible and some of these sensors have been designed to achieve readout noise every time you read that the pixel is a bit of noise in there they vanilla achieve read noise on the level one or two electrons which is incredible so the thing that you might have a thousand electrons in this thing and only one or two of them are actually noise or even 60,000 electrons the thing is so to get that low noise you have to read it up very slowly so a sense of capable of this kind of performance is actually pretty slow to read out so usually they're not really large arrays but these sensors are for all intents and purposes almost perfect detectors really super high performance another disadvantage a typical back-illuminated sensor uses they have to be cooled a lot more to have a low dark current so the cameras tend to be also very expensive not just the sensors okay let's now go over to the CMOS side and look at how they work so CMOS is what all our modern electronics are based on back in the day there were various competing technologies and moss TTL all these different versions of logic gates and everybody settled on CMOS and that's what all the modern wafer fabs make now CMOS stands for a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor why complementary well here is a standard CMOS logic gate it's called an inverter it takes a one end turns into a zero or azure comes in turns it into a one they have a p-channel MOSFET so basically there is a channel made of p-type material an insulator and then I electrode gate and it only conducts electricity either when there's a voltage on the gate basically so when you apply voltage on the gate current flows top to bottom but there's no actual conduction through the gate it's actually insulated so it takes very very little energy in to control a fairly large amount of current going through and then at the bottom they have an end type and the idea behind using and p-type and n-type is they work on opposite voltages so you when you turn one on the other one turns off and we turn the other one on the first one turns off so when they're just sitting there sitting at one or zero there's absolutely no current consumed so it's very very low power it only consumes power when it's switching from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 so this is a much lower power architecture than what we had in the past which is why it's so popular and by making these transistors smaller and smaller they can go faster and faster which is one of the reasons why we keep shrinking them that and being able to cram more of them on a chip so the advantage of this is higher speed and lower power it's not necessarily optimum for detecting light though the old ccd sensors usually use n moss which is just this type of transistor and i believe the sony sensors use peat moss which are these types of transistors and that's all is in there the CMOS sensors are actually built using obsolete wafer fabs and so you you know when on semiconductor bought Kodak's wafer fabs they kept them because that's what you need to build ccd sensors they can't use the modern factories or used to make memory chips and micro processors they're not compatible what's the technology so that's how one of the weird thing is what seamless it's actually obsolete RCC CD is I should obsolete technologies in many ways so CMOS sensors have a lot of advantages over CCD because they're built on the technology that is used to build computers so they can contain all the components of a computer in there also CMOS is also use for all the analog electronics these days much of the analog technology is also based on CMOS so they can include analog circuits in there as well so now we have a circuit that not only has the optical sensor it also can have the converter and all the associated circuitry inside the the chip another thing is that there's actually a readable amplifier on every single pixel so as at least one transistor maybe a couple right alongside every pixel in the array so this means that we can read up the array very quickly in fact we can decide we only want to read out these pixels here and not read up those pixels there so it's really really fast if we're doing a sub-frame so this has a lot of advantages because now we can actually just shuffle out electrons off after they've been amplified and we don't to worry about being so quiet see CMOS sensor CCD sensors require very very low noise electronics because you have to be very carefully don't introduce noise as you reading them out CMOS it already has an amplifier right at every pixel so it's actually much easier to handle the the electrons when they come out and in fact there's usually an ATD converter built right into the chip so you put in three volts or five volts into the sensor and outcome digital numbers directly from the sensor so this makes it very very cheap to build a camera which is why you will find them in your your cell phone that's why we have CMOS detectors in our cell phone because the very chip that does all the tech detecting is the whole camera so they're faster to read out they're cheaper cheaper to make because it made with CMOS as this technology and all the interfaces are digital you just wire it right up to your computer and you're done now does that make it better and not so fast but the difference is that because you have at least one transistor every pixel they take up some room so right off the bat you're losing sensitivity because your fill factor is worse it may only be a quarter of the pixel it actually contains sensitive area so right off the bat you're throwing away 75% of the light this reduces quantum efficiency and it also reduces how much electrons you can start each pixel now big pixels that are completely used for detecting light can store a lot of electrons and the limitation here is really how much electrons you can store in a certain volume the silicon it isn't really any different from a CMOS sensor to a ccd sensor the difference is the architecture how much room is allocated for the pixel and it is always lower in a CMOS sensor so they don't have as much dynamic range you can't detect a faint faint object and a really really bright object at the same time in the same array because you will saturate at the bright the bright pixels another problem they have with these sensors is fixed pattern noise because every single amplifier that's an every single pixel has its own characteristics they're all a little different so you take a picture from a CMOS camera and look at it and there is a fixed pattern of random noise but it's the same on every single picture you take and it could affect the gain of each pixel not just the offset and then the and such so it actually ends up being a lot more rough a signal up but a little more crude signal it but than it is on a CCD and you can do things like calibrating like dark frames and flat fields and things but it still is harder to make a CMOS sensor as low noise as a CCD sensor so there's also extra circuitry in there there's amplifiers ATD converters and things and these do make electrical noise and this can degrade the performance of the sensor one thing you often notice on ccds is the readout amplifier in the corner makes a little bit of light because every silicon junction is actually a diode which generates light like an LED does light emitting diode all transistors do this and the more you have the more of this light is emitted so some care has to be made to make sure that that light doesn't contaminate your image even as you're reading it one other disadvantage is that the most advanced CMOS sensors well let's face it they are making these for the cell phone market Sony manufactures a million sensors a month if you can imagine how many astronomical sensors they manufacture a month in fact they don't manufacture any astronomical sensors they do manufacture sensors for industrial and security applications and the astronomers borrow those for their cameras on semiconductor / formerly Kodak actually makes scientific grade sensors intended for astronomy and other low-light applications but the companies are making these CMOS sensors are more targeted on high-volume applications so they tend to optimize them your cell phone is really really tiny pixels which makes for a great tiny tiny camera but those tiny pixels mean that they can't store as much light so they can't have as much dynamic range and the optics for them are also similarly complex because they're so tiny pixels so this means CCD is it better right well as of today that is correct the best ccd sensors today are better than the best CMOS sensors today and moreover they are capable on all fronts they have lower noise they have lower dark current they have higher well depths higher quantum efficiency but they cost a lot more the CMOS where its advantages is in costs for performance it's a lot more bang for the buck for a CMOS sensor which is great as long as it's good enough for your application if it's not good enough then you're going to have to use a ccd sensor on the other hand the CMOS sensors have been improving by leaps and bounds in recent years so in the early days of digital SLRs they were all CCD except the crappy ones now the many of the best DSLRs actually do have CMOS sensors in them so the performance gap is closed a lot it's a lot less expensive to make a really really big array you know 30 right megapixels in CMOS and it is to do it in ccd so if you want to be able actually afford the camera there's something to be said for CMOS even if the performance isn't quite on a par now the evolution of CMOS here is a good example this is the sony exmor technology and i'm going to go a bit over the evolution of this technology over time let's start with the basics they start out by trying to reduce the noise so the original design had their read on amplifier Crowley double sampler it goes off to an ad D converter in the corner so that 82 converters converts every pixel it's not a bad structure in here this is Carly double sampler is an analog device that as I said subtracts the light from the light and calculates just the difference it was way of reducing noise what they've done since then is they've actually added one ATD converter per column and then had a analog and a digital correlated double sampler to give it better is reduction yes you can do Carly a double sampling in digital domain in fact the original sd-6 camera did it that way did the conversion of the right signal conversion of the dark signal and subtract the two most of the modern cameras do this in the analog domain before they convert the signal but here they're actually doing both one after another which does have certain advantages once it comes out of the readout column then all the other circuitry is all digital and digital circuitry is really easy to handle noise with so it makes it a lower noise and faster device so that was a basic first generation of Exmoor technology now what do they do to improve it well they started out with aluminum conductors and a certain size of like a tiny micron design rule and ended up being a pretty tall chip this is one pixel and the photo detectors are way down here at the bottom and the lights got to go all the way down there this would be the micro lens here so when they went to the copper conductors they are able to make the conductors a lot thinner and and these are conductors as well so they were able to make everything Center and reduce the distance from the micro lens to the detector part this makes a camera more sensitive then they would to 65 nanometer copper and made the thing even smaller so simply by going to a finer line geometry on their on their process and using copper instead of aluminium they were able to improve their cano efficiency and improve the angle which light can come into the sensor one of the problems of Michael lens is if the light comes in at an angle it actually won't hit the pixel and by making this a shorter distance are able to accept a wider range of angles which means that if you were very fast lens you won't cut off the light that's coming from the edge of the lens okay then they actually took a lesson from the CCD sensors and they did the back illuminated thin so here's the previous generation and then they go to back illuminated where they flip the chip over light Michael lenses are on this side go directly into the pixels and all the electronics on the bottom oh I should mention that also because y'all trying to underneath the pixel that means that there's none of its in the way the light and none of it is affecting your volume of the pixel for storing electrons improves a dynamic range and then they have a version of it for near-infrared which is where the where the silicon's bit deeper and the reason for that is that infrared paint rates further into the silicon before it gets absorbed so they need a thicker chip in order to absorb that so you can either have a little better visible light performance or a better infrared performance depending on which version of the chip you want to get so going comparison here so here is a front illuminated sensor metal wiring inside here the color filters the lens and the sensor is down here whereas here it's going directly into the pixel and the light receiving surface is close to the front of the chip instead of being way down inside the chip so obviously this is a pretty expensive technology and they put a lot of money into getting us all to work and they've used this to go after the cell phone market which means itsy bitsy tdb little chips that have like one or two micron pixels not very well suited to astronomy where you might have a two thousand millimeter focal length you want to have like a nine micron pixel or at least a 6 micron pixel to use on a c8 a bigger telescope might require even bigger pixels so these the current generation of chips aren't suitable for use in astronomy even though they have the performance that's much closer to CCD also i'm pointing out here that we'll see current technology in ccd in CMOS the old the old ones would have the pixels here and the circuitry here now they have the pixels here and all the circuitry underneath it so it's actually a smaller chip which means that they can make more of them on a wafer which means they're cheaper so again CMOS is showing its cost advantages okay now for the bad news sony has decided to go all in on CMOS which means they are closing down there CCD wafer fabs in a few months so everybody who loves those beautiful icx you know 690 fours they're not going to be making them anymore fortunately sony did something that's very unusual for sony because they tend to do dumb things like oh let's cancel a sensor and come what the replacement two years later they didn't do that this time what they're doing right now is they're running their factories they have to wait for fads that make CCD they're running them 24-7 all out making as many chips as they can and they are storing the wafers fully tested wafers in vaults and then they're getting all the manufacturers you use the chips to put in orders for the next ten years in some cases five years depends on the chip and they will promise that they'll have those chips free and even nicer they won't actually force you to buy them evenly put the order and for them so if you decide you don't want these chips anymore they're not going to force them on you so Sony's CCD sensors are not dead they're just dying they'll be around for another ten years but obviously what Sony is thinking here is that between now and five to ten years from now they're obviously going to develop new CMOS sensors that are going to replace these CCD sensors and they believe they'll have the same or better performance so sometimes the next five to ten years the question will be which is better CMOS 3ccd and you're going to say well they're pretty much the same and at that point given that CCD is built on an obsolete technology requires a lot more electrons to run it as a lot more expensive it's pretty clear that world is going to switch to CMOS there are some challenges though even so most of these sensors are made with color matrix sees the bear matrix because that's what you need for cell phones and you know taking quick shots your friends and family they are going to be manufacturing some sensors in Monaco they already are fortunately as I mentioned before the pixel size of their way too small because they're designed for cell phone cameras and currently they have what are called BGA packages these are this is the chip that's the top flip it over ball grid array the ray of balls on the bottom of the chip that's great for compact electrical connections not so great for cooling how do you cool that chip down answer is it's pretty hard so they're going to have to make a version of this with a pad on the bottom that you can actually attach a cold finger to to chill the chip down so they're making it harder to make a cryogenic camera like we use for our C cds where we chill it down to minus 20 or 30 degrees for a low dark current they're making that difficult so hopefully they'll make new sensors that don't have this design that will actually be able to properly chill on the other hand there is some good news on the CCD front because you know Kodak invented basically much of the CCD technology to eventually put them at a business and didn't manage to make the transition from film technology to CCD technology even though they had CCD technology companies have a lot of inertia when they're that big so they went under basically they shut down they sold off all their patents but before they did that they spun out there ccd manufacturing line into a company called true sense and true sense has since been bought by on semiconductor one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world they are actually were spun out of Motorola when Motorola decide to go after the cell phones themselves so they're actually a very respected very huge company and they have bought a lot of imaging companies that make different kinds of sensors so they have a huge portfolio a whole bunch of engineers from different companies originally who have different ideas about how to do image sensors they put them all together into one division and said talk to each other to figure out all the best stuff of all your technologies and come up with new sensors so they are working on themselves on some new imaging technologies but they are still committed to CCD they have kept the wafer fabs in rochester open that are used to make the ccd sensor and they are in fact bringing out new models of ccd sensors there will be announced that I believe it is next month of a new sensor which you will find very interesting it will find its way into our cameras soon so it there are is not just Sony going after the cellphone market there are other companies that are going after different markets industrial medical science markets so one way or the other we r eventually going to have ccd sensors and CMOS sensors eventually all CMOS sensors that are intended for applications like ours it's just a matter of time so the good news is that in the long run we will have good quality cameras that are less expensive the downside of it all is it might be a long time before we see replacement for a 16-8 03 that's in CMOS because that's a very high performance chip at a very large chip I'm gonna take them a long time to decide they want to go after that because it's a small volume market so we'll see that people are all the companies saying very promising sounding things we'll just have to see what they actually do there are other companies other than sony and kodak / on semiconductor etv is well known for making back-illuminated sensors and a certain company that's now located in canada will be releasing a camera with some of these products in some sometime next year they also make scientific grade CMOS platforms so there is actually astronomy cameras we made today on the seamless platform by etv so in some ways we're already there so where are we headed in the future well it's pretty clear that for the time being see City and CMOS sensors are going to continue to co-exist and the sea City dish will be shrinking over time to the only the most high performance sensors as the CMOS gobbles it up from underneath and eventually CMOS will completely take over and supplant be CCD sensors CMOS of course as I said well need to improve and it will supplant CCD entirely I expect but it will take years it may be 10 years before this happens and so eventually we should be seeing large format large pixel CMOS sensor with this performance comparable to what we have now on the CCD front as I said this will make it easier to build a high-performance camera and therefore less expensive now cooled cameras are always going to be bit expensive because of all the mechanical gyrations have to go through to chill out a chip and not have it frost over so the cameras are still going to be more expensive than a DSLR but they're going to be a lot they could be a lot less expensive than they are now a.k.a f-16 803 sensor is almost four thousand dollars today for the sensor they need to build a camera so we can see a big improvement in that that's an example of a picture taken with a 16-8 03 the actual frame is much larger than us but wouldn't project very well if I shrunk it I was asked to give a quick update on sbig now sbig started back in the late 80s Early 90s as a company in California in Santa Barbara area so it's called Santa Barbara instrument group and it formed it was formed by for amateurs who created the st for auto guider for a project an astronomy project town and then it was a pretty successful product so they went on to make more cameras and it grew into the sbig we know of today about four years ago the senior partner allen holmes was thinking about retirement and went to shop it around and the company was in fact bought by a company called a plugin which was a start-up trying to make biomedical products they wanted to use SVG cameras in their products they managed to not succeed in launching a biomedical product and basically failed as a company and Alton's took sbig down with them fortunately through a series of masa nations somehow we managed to pick them up so sbig is no longer Santa Barbara instance group sbig is a registered trademark of diffraction limited and we acquired all their assets their intellectual property their brands their designs their inventory and all their office furniture even their staplers we got everything we did not get their employees however they did some of them did stay on board for a while and I'll explain that in a moment this is our office in Ottawa diffraction of it incorporated 1993 our first product was actually called quick fringe which is for interferogram analysis for optical testing our second product was Maxum DL we decided to start out doing software products because it's a less expensive way to start a business so basically started my in my spare room with me and a friend sitting at computers typing away and eventually evolved into a real company but that was a very expensive way to start i'm actually a hardware engineer by training but we decided to start on a software today we have a 10,000 square foot facility near marival Road in Ottawa we have office of engineering space manufacturing space warehouse space and we are currently at 13 staff and growing I expect to hire another three to four people or the next six to eight months so our original products included a maxim dl max point the bull would cloud sensors max tome and we had various other OEM products that made for other companies that you'll never hear about because they sell them under their own brands not all of all the things we make or astronomy related but much of them are so about a year ago October first of last year we acquired the assets of sbig and we transitioned the operations to Ottawa over a six-month period during that time we were able to keep some of the staff of the remaining staff on board by having Mike Barbour incorporate a little company in California called Santa Barbara scientific and then he hired them all and then we paid him to pay them so that way we avoided having to operate in California which would been stupid expensive for us anyway that allowed us to continue building the cameras during the transition and transition all the technology up to Ottawa and then about May time frame we loaded up a 53-foot long truck and load all the stuff into it and brought it up here allen holmes actually started a new company called Cloudland instruments they are making earth observation cameras for satellites he hired Linda and Craig the two engineers Mike Barbour started other little company called Santa Barbara scientific the one that was actually kept things running while we were transferring he's kept that company and he's now selling a new version of the seating monitor that is based on an sbig camera and he plans to make some other new products so we've had a couple of spin-off companies results from all this bill Lynch is actually started a little company called s big service and repair and he is repairing cameras down in actually he lives in allen Holmes's office and he rents a little space by the space from them and he repairs cameras for us which is great because he knows how to repair all the old cameras like the SD sevens and the STL's and things that we don't make any more and we also don't know how to fix but he does so we were able to retain that because we want to keep bill employed we send all the repairs to him it was a few rare exceptions of some things that come to Ottawa so we're now fully up and running it took a year it was a year from hell as expected any sort of corporate acquisition always is but we managed to get everything sorted out a few of our products are still made singapore by a contract manufacturer we expect to be moving that back to Ottawa over the next year most of the products are built in Ottawa all the big cameras are made inaudible all the AO AO X's and 8 and all those things are all made in Ottawa it's just see the small high-volume cameras are made in Singapore we ship everything from Ottawa we have an interesting service set up for shipping to the states where you put them all on a truck some dog dunes Bergen then they go into fedex from there so we can actually ship cheaply that a big disadvantage of being Canada we've found a way around that and a car as i mentioned bill Lynch is a repairing cameras down in California literally across the parking lot from where sbig used to be located not everything is working smoothly in Ottawa where we're now focusing to engineering new products of course it's a time to you know refresh the product line add new sensors and so we're busily working on that right now we have an engineering staff that's quite capable of design nature's Chris he's working on a new camera on the cattle too early for a new announcements because I don't like to announce things before we're quite ready but one thing i will announce is that we are building an off-axis guider to go with the big sdx cameras currently that's the only camera on the line that still has a built-in guider instead of being in part of the filter wheel and we're now building a filter will guider for the sgx camera we finished the design for that a few weeks ago we're waiting for the prototype parts to come in and so we should have an announcement for that product very shortly but you're hearing it here first as I mentioned we're designing new sensors into our line so we're including new sensors from let you speak Kodak as well as sensors from other companies and that is plural more than one sensor manufacturer will be used for future cameras I just going to very quickly go over our current product since we're running at a time or are we how much time do we actually have left ok so I'll go over this briefly we have the flagship cameras which is the STX with the sdx 1603 we actually have an STX 9000 and we try very hard not to sell them because those sensors a very bad residual bulk image we've actually sold two of them when people said yes yes I know I really want it we really try to talk them out of it we also the STX eleven thousand and two in 66 6303 those are big cameras they all look like this we have the large adaptive optics unit this is a wonderful machine that was designed by Alan home so fellow was a genius I got to say allen holmes an amazing fellow the this thing is beautiful it's thin the Micheli electromagnetic actuators or just really clever marvelous product really happy we have that we also the smaller versions of course the AO 8 which are driven by motors this is a much more elegant product and I actually am thinking once things so then we'll make a smaller version of this for the small cameras then we have the filter wheels these are the self gutted wheels for the SD XL cameras and then the big filter wheel is for the SD X camera which we're going to be adding on a add on auto guider on to the middle series of cameras is called Sgt this is the evolution of the old sort of round / tombstone shaped SG cameras like the st seven currently we have three models the 8300 which is the most popular the 3200 this is probably this sensor doesn't get a lot of a lot of attention these days but it actually is the most sensitive front illuminated sensor I've ever encountered they're actually really good chips and the sdt 1603 the AO 8 adaptive optics unit and again we have smaller self-guided filter rules for this line and the nice thing what the big salt wheels is they have this mechanical detent system so the filter always ends in exactly the same spot every time so if you take flat fields and it's a dust back on your filter it always ends up on the same pixel every time our low end products start with the STF cameras with the 8300 and the new 8050 in the 40 70 they were just launched these when we took over I actually unlaunchable unch them they work much better now we are about to launch the 40 to 60 2 3 and 3 200 in st f around the time we took over sbig we discovered that the boards that were used to make the st 402 series cameras we couldn't build them anymore there was an obsolete chip in there you could not buy for love or money just not available so we had to stop making those cameras for a while and we now have the new boards ready they've been in beta testing people seem to be happy with them so we're going to roll that into production over the next months so we'll have the four to six two and three and three two hundred in the small package again we also have low cost five and eight position filter wheels and there is a quarter see built-in filter for the 402 the 402 is a very popular product for universities because it can have the the photometric filters built into the camera is relatively inexpensive great for for student products and projects and things and then we have our small SGI camera most commonly used as an auto guider but they are very versatile there's a little spectrograph you can get for them there is the off-axis guider for the small cameras and this actually is a full crew do sir people don't know this but all of our guider units have focal reducers built into them to give the camera more area on the sky so that we can find guide stores more easily and then there's the the SGI guider kit which turns your SGI into a little mini guide scope which is a quite capable of guiding telescopes up to about 2000 millimeter focal length no problem so that's a less a very very popular option and we have the specialty products like the all-sky cameras they're actually very popular the camera adapters I was amazed how many camera adapters people want people love the camera adapters I did not realize that before the standalone guider the SG 4s early descendant of the st for and then the remote guide heads for the big cameras and the sgt cameras on the software front yes we still offer CCDC city ops we don't have CC soft anymore software bisque has discontinued it the deal that s big had with them didn't transfer over as part of the financial arrangements and frankly they were a competitor so we're not distributing the CC soft software anymore but we are going to replace it with a special bundled version of maximum dl I would have wanted to have it done already but we've been so busy over the last year we just haven't quite got it ready yet we're also in the conceptual phase of designing a new driver architecture sbig is currently on the second generation of camera drivers and we actually want to take it to a new generation start with a clean slate and and make a camera driver architecture that can evolve in the future much more easily and it will have both a directory API n native as com support as you know we're big proponents of as calm so any questions first of all done I want to thank you for this very informative conference but my questions are going to go like customer service I currently own as st seven st eight st 10 which of all our x any cameras and a 08 and and SGS spectrometer so I'm keeping my fingers crossed because I don't want two cameras you know to get into trouble too because the customer service about these parts are like a wild goose chase right as far as I'm concerned DST 10 xme is one of the better cameras that Santa Barbara built so I'm just wondering why are there aren't any parts you know if it goes I can't do anything about it yeah if I had if I had been running sbig back when the decision was made to transition to Sgt I would have stockpiled parts because they were still available or just starting to become unavailable at the time and that's one of the reasons why the line was discontinued it was a case of either redesigned the circuit boards or go to the new platform they were already working on I think they made a big mistake in not stockpiling more parts I can't solve that problem because all these parts you can't order however since we've taken over we have ordered partly the most common part to fail in stl camera for example is a little switching power supplies in there we have got a bucket of those now we're able to track down and supply those maybe bought those we're doing the same for st 7-series cameras to some degree but it's much harder bill Lynch has a what he calls a graveyard of broken sg-7 series cameras and he will harvest parts from them if he needs to to get a camera back up and running so as long as certain components that we really can't replace don't fail probably can serve as a camera but it is getting harder well I actually talked to him about six weeks ago I just wanted like a 1800 lines grading he says I can finally eat there's none so we have to go to a wild goose chase on the internet to find replacements for those or buy something we haven't got yet right have the 2500 micron gratings but the twelve hundred and eighteen hundred dollar just simply on the radio from Santa Barbara yes for most of the products we have the original parts bill of material for them and if you call us up we can actually tell you what the manufacturer of those units was and what their part numbers were and so you could go to the manufacturer and try to acquire them yourselves if they still make them okay if they don't still make them then yeah I'm sorry but no dice okay since I understand CMOS pixels can be read independently can we imagine a camera with only one digital one chip but you could use any star in the field of you to guide you know the world that style would be sacrificed but you will need a new one chip you would have the choice over the old field maybe the limitation is that while in theory the CMOS cameras can do this and practice they have a certain design architecture they for how they design the chip and most of them are designed either for rolling shutter or you know that sort of thing they're the built-in logic and the camera doesn't do those sorts of things some do but as far as i know most of those aren't the ones that do the super high performance so it really is really going to wait and see what kind of you know capabilities these chips will have when they finally reach the market it may not be suitable for what we're doing also remember that whenever you run electronics inside of a sensor they tend to emit light in the process and it can contaminate your image so there are downsides to doing that sort of thing it also makes heat which can also affect the regulation of the temperature
