 welcome to inside the studio with Gregg worth and in this episode I'm going to demonstrate how to lay a quick drum sample using Massey DRT and also picking a drum sample engines as Steven slate drums otherwise known as SSD 4 so what I've done here is I've just I've just selected a small area for a demonstration sake and this is the kick drum and what you do is you go up to the audio suite and you find the Massey DRT and this is a plugin so basically once you have the selection that you want to create a MIDI trigger of you just hit analyze and as you can see it analyzes the track here so basically once this is analyzed you can deselect this and then you can go in and select individual areas and this you can see there's a lot of false triggers here so what I recommend doing is going back here and you can dial back the sensitivity to get rid of all those false triggers and once once you've gotten a certain spot like that you can go in one by one and highlight this and as you can see here it's only triggering the kick hits and what I like to do is go a couple at a time like this just to make sure that it's not missing anything and let me see if there is one missing and I'll show you how to add one ok so see this did a pretty good job here alright so I adjusted that pretty good but just say for an example that little soft hit there was missing and what you do is you just hover your mouse over here and it's got this plus sign and you can if you make a closer selection like that you can see the region really close and just find that starting point to add a trigger there and the same with false triggers you can go and subtract them so basically once you've done that and you have everything complete you can basically drag them any information and what I do is I I put it in shuffle mode and then you can just drag it over here into an instrument track let me get this out of the way here and then here's your MIDI information so if I did the whole track obviously this would be all field that I just picked a selection so this is where you can check to see if the trigger is accurate and as far as I'm concerned it's been fairly accurate depending on the leakage in the track you have to go and tweak it but this is one of the most accurate ones that I've ever used I'll go as far as to say that personally for me it's the most accurate one but what I like about it is actually let me pull this back I missed one thing if you select this what I mentioned was that you can adjust the sensitivity here but another thing that's really cool is you can adjust the dynamics so if you raise this slider you can see these yellow lines get leveled out a little more so that represents velocity so depending on how dynamic you want this to track you can adjust it there and then this slider over here adjusts the overall volume so if you want to crank it up you can do so there so okay so basically let me let me play this now so I just you know I use Steven slate drums and I found a cool kick here it's actually into the classic the I guess it's a chili pepper kick recorded at NRG and so let's just hear it so it's kind of cool I mean what would I look for is samples is just to enhance something that's missing from the original recording and sometimes you want to lay a sample that add a little bit of low-end or sometimes you need it to add that super top-end beater sound so you know it just depends on what you're looking for and that this is a good collection because they have a lot of variety of sounds here and basically so now once this is here and what you should listen for is to make sure that the velocity is correct and if you made a mistake in DRT you don't necessarily have to go back you can just view the velocity here and tweak it to taste so I always recommend making sure that you're happy with how the MIDI is triggering before you print it to audio so now say that you know we're committed here with this so what you do using Pro Tools 11 here if you're using Pro Tools 12 you can do track freeze but just pick a unique bus and I would recommend zeroing out the fader here and then you can bounce that bus kick sample import after bounce and since I selected this track here that audio track will show up right beneath it and then this window pops up new track yes and I want it to go to where it's selected you could also select session start but since I only did this section here I want it to go to this election so it lines it up and see as you can see here the volume is a little low so I could either go back to my velocity here and select all these and raise them up or I could have gone back to DRT and raise the overall volume here but for this example it's perfectly fine so let's listen to this and just to show here it's still lined up and so this is where you can actually not only audibly check phase but visually so you can see that the waveform are slightly different but they're in phase so that's what you want there so I'll just go ahead and play the drum track as it was without the sample and then I'll play it with and just show you what it sounds like adding it in there so it adds a little top in and a little low-end girth and the important thing here is for me at least is to sound natural you know I really don't like to lay samples unless I feel like it's going to add to the track and as I said in a previous video it's all about adding things incrementally little by little this gives you a better better overall sound or it adds to it without having to drastically EQ a track so that's pretty much it you know it's the same for the snare and if you want to go ahead and do toms as well but what I'll do is I'll just play this section with the whole tracks just so you can hear it in the in the mix so there you have it really happy with that that took about you know 5-10 minutes to lay a sample so I just wanted to share that with you because I was super excited to find out about nasi DRT because I was having a real hard time with some other stuff that I was using and this just does what it says it's supposed to do and you know it's it's just under 100 bucks it's super cheap and they have a free demo so I recommend you checking that out and I'm sure most of you know about Steven slate drums it's some of the best drum samples out there so you know feel free to check that out as well they always give good deals and you can demo everything for 14 days or whatever it is so thanks for watching and please subscribe to the YouTube channel and the newsletter on my website and I'll check you out next time you
