 right so I i work for Souza I'm actually the AMIA technical strategist for the pre sales team at Souza em and I work very closely with the marketing organization so they asked me to come along and speak today around the topic of why cios should be interested in OpenStack and at least understand what it offers to them differently to other technology stacks and solutions they may be thinking of because we're finding it it is a very important conversation with those kind of people within organizations that we work with and importantly Souza has solutions to try and help with some of the challenges that come out the conversation so I think Jonathan was very good in explaining to you but there's quite a lot of change going on in the MIT space both personally as individuals using technology constantly now we we tend to all use smartphones often interact with our smartphones and actually is the size of what we traditionally have done has grown immensely in the last few years so in the last few minutes over 200 million emails have been sent it's quite an astounding number now that's traditional stuff we've been running email servers and collecting email for many years now as organizations but the actual volume of it is new it's growing exponentially every year and it's increasing very rapidly Google searches the same newer technology is coming on board all the time for organizations to deal with quite amazed at over 6 million YouTube views take place per minute that's pretty pretty exceptional numbers and obviously tweets are now part of that data set that organizations are interested in all those pieces of information have got to be managed somewhere and organized at the same time there's also risk involved here so there's over a thousand botnet infection is in only one minute and that that these are records and numbers from 2015 so there with all that you've also got the wider kind of year-on-year growth that's taking place and these numbers I find quite exceptional so now we've got over four billion email users nearly as many social networking users so that's become a norm that most of us interact with from day to day and of course the network devices is just exploding that fact about the amount of cars that are now effectively computers on wheels which are interacting with public networks all the time is part of that change and that constant drive now as leaders of IT organizations what does that mean to you well first of all businesses have culture and culture is created by people and people are getting much more accustomed to rapid change within technology they're adopting changes in technology that make sense to them very rapidly as they're being delivered so there's more and more pressure on IT organizations to transform faster now that sounds quite an easy thing to say but to actually do come some challenge obviously that challenge might be around the ability is an organization to be competitive and I talked to that in a little bit of detail later but at the same time I'm sure all of you have been faced with either smaller budgets or the same budget from year-on-year now that is a challenge because you are actually being asked to do more in the first case of faster response and at the same time you're being asked to transform the way you're doing things the real reason why that matters to leaders of IT operations is this paradigm where and technology creates inflection points within markets okay so everybody so often a technology comes along that is so revolutionary that you get in a situation where the opportunity that Jonathan spoke to earlier the opportunity to change the way you do things and become a leader in that market becomes available and really good examples of organizations that have grabbed that opportunity recently I've been Netflix and Apple who have transformed the way markets have been delivered transformed how things have been done internally to be able to change the whole outlook of particular market other organizations are highlighted here sorry if you worked for any of these and you suffered in that process but organizations have missed that inflection point Kodak rental stores for video now I'm sure in Europe not many of us have walked or rented a video in a physical form very often most for stream art video content nowadays so there's been a massive technological change in how businesses and create wealth and profit using these technologies well on all that doom and gloom luckily OpenStack is one of the solutions that could solve a lot of those challenges and complexity that might come down through change so it's um offers organizations a lot of capability around being agile the concept of software-defined it allows you to manage at scale changes within your infrastructure rapidly okay now being OpenStack it's a private cloud solution so it not only offers that speed of change to you as an organization but it keeps it in source to your organization as well so if you have any fears around security you don't want to outsource important services to your operation and then the private cloud really suits that kind of model you get out control and you get that security and importantly more and more organizations are looking to deliver self-service capability for those services that are required and certainly OpenStack is a great tool for deliberate now one of the questions around OpenStack is its maturity it's been around six years in real terms six years is a long time and a short time in the IT industry luckily over those six years a lot of people have been involved in the community doing some great work and now certainly everyone except the OpenStack is very mature in its capabilities and it's a platform that organizations can start to rely on as part of their business infrastructure to deliver the services they need to cope with the inflection point of rapid change within those service delivery so effectively it's layered as a slide put up by Jonathan told to talk to this concept but at the end of the day what this is doing is moving the API layer for instrumenting the capabilities of the hardware and the logic that you need to achieve within your services at a higher level at that OpenStack level but it also builds on the traditional technologies that you've been using for a long time okay so operating systems physical infrastructure and then hauling a public combines and again talking to Jonathan seen collaborate to be able to deliver the kind of capability that you as a business would need for instance Seth isn't a core OpenStack capability but works very well within an OpenStack implementation so as a separate an open source project it offers capabilities to organizations that need that now allowing a concept of software-defined datacenter so today OpenStack is a very powerful tool for delivering what businesses you need now these these statistics come from 2015 obviously Jonathan's been talking about a very rapid rate of adoption and change so more and more organizations are running these services in productions so this idea is maybe our date a little bit but importantly in stress fact that the key services within OpenStack are generally being used by most organization to a utilizing OpenStack so it's relied upon more than half of them are using them in support very Deb in production very definitely it also gives you a platform for future proofing so the other projects that are around OpenStack the things that were told to earlier by Mark pointing out that not there were as many projects with an OpenStack and not all of them are as mature as of it and they're really future proofing capability so they're bringing online answers to technical problems the organizations are facing now ready for future business use ok so what pursues to do in this space well you you may not be aware but souza are a lead OpenStack distributor we have a distribution for OpenStack and what we do within that distribution is souza is we apply a lot of our understanding of how OpenStack works and should be built and managed into our software layers so again this software-defined capability and what we did it what we're intending to do and what we're able to do is effectively do the same thing that car manufacturers do so theme that's been brought up a few times computers on wheels but really if you think about what a car manufacturer does he gets loads of little parts and puts them together he puts them together in a way that you can trust when you're traveling at 70 or even quicker on a motorway that is a prebuilt solution and ready to go so you can get the value of an investment in a vehicle at the point that you purchase it well that's the model of scissors OpenStack it's very rapid to deploy very easy to consume and get the value of building clouds and delivering them to your users in that elastic manner very effectively and rapidly of course everything we do is underpinned by Souza linux enterprise server and the qualities and strengths that we bring to market as Ali play with our Linux distribution as well really we've concentrated on a few key areas so I think he's been pointed out there is feelings that certain areas of OpenStack have been a challenge and as an organization we faced down those challenges so first of all we've made it very easy to manage and initially deploy an OpenStack infrastructure in an environment again taking that knowledge that we've got about building OpenStack and putting it in a software layer we've also worked very hard with the community around that stability access stability and reliability are the things Sousa does that is part of their DNA and we've been leading in the area of high availability particularly around the OpenStack services and the virtual machine so we've done a lot of work in those areas and made ourselves also able to support the why issues case of hypervisors so where we've worked with established relationships with organizations a lot of the Masters to help them use a different hypervisors within their OpenStack infrastructure so for quite well now you've had the ability to use VMware and kvm within your infrastructure but Souza also fully supports then as a more traditional open source hypervisor layer that still lots of organizations in Europe are using and integrate that into your open stacking infrastructure we also support integration with hyper-v and we also support z/vm now so if organizations are other large and using the capabilities of the IBM mainframes for their reblock reliability scalability etc then you can now instrument those and compute hypervisors within your OpenStack environment with susie linux and of course we built on their heritage in the support organization that suz's built over time to be a global player in this market ok one of the validations that the marketing guys like us to talk to about our ability of installer management is the fact that in previous OpenStack comment conferences around the globe Intel's run some rulest at competitions and these have been in some ways like a hearty competition where they've asked vendors to come along and stand up OpenStack infrastructure for particular use cases with particular quality gates and Souza has been the standout winner every time this has been run at opens that conferences and that really says something to me as a technologist it says my engineers understand OpenStack so well that they've been able to build software allows rapid deployment and then of course stability and usage above that that requirement it was spoken to earlier by Jonathan but the fact is that that if an organization is going to adopt cloud then there's much more than technology updates that need to take place and as leaders of IT operations you need to be aware that there will need to be a just from adjustment and change in the whole way that organization thinks about how it deploys infrastructure for them truly to utilize the capability I've seen the presentation a few time that Jonathan gives with the example of the 42 days being the initial attempt to reduce the lead time for delivering services in organizations and that's pretty impressive it just shows that if you're able to automate the practices of validation etc and software-defined that as well as automate your infrastructural delivery then as an organisation you'll be able to embrace the change much more effectively and to do that there'll be many many individuals involved there will be lots of stakeholders who need to come on we talk about it a lot in the OpenStack world the journey to it's really utilizing Software Defined 8 centers and those stakeholders will have to be convinced of the value of what they're trying to achieve so there's some work to do around there you've also got to analyze your processes which can be a poet or a painful process in itself and really ask hard questions of what the value of those particular steps might be and whether or not you can change the way they've done maybe not eradicate those steps but change the way they're actually achieved to try and utilize the technology and importantly what the things mean so we talked about cell service and what it means to an organization here but actually what does cloud me to an organization what do you as a business need to achieve with this technology as being your lead goal and then everything else should align to that requirement as you move forward of course the way you choose to deliver architecture will have an impact on that usage as well so that's just a warning as an IT organization that if you are genuinely looking to transform how you deliver services how to internal and external customers to your organization's you've really got to think about the wider implications of what that means so what's happening next so of course more and more technology options are becoming available we talked about the bread of Technology exploding within organizations and within just for general IT use and of course we've got to be able to work with those tools if we are going to define everything liar software those individual elements need to be usable well of course the a PI API will get more capable of delivering against that of course emerging capabilities and requirements are coming all the time and the community has proven itself to be very able to rapidly respond to those requirements as the market changes as businesses change underneath but all of its built on very very solid foundation now through the compute network storage platforms that hold up the whole infrastructure of OpenStack and essentially the foundation is dedicated to making sure that this technology stack moves forward with organizations requirements and gives you the food future proofing you require for investments that you made today so thank you very much for your time series it's very happy to be here so thank you to everyone that's organized this day and come and find us and talk to us if you want to understand better how souza work in the OpenStack market and I think I'm five minutes or four minutes early so if anyone wanted shout out a question you're more than happy to welcome to do so any questions from the floor resounding silence I expected so thank you very much everyone and enjoy your day
