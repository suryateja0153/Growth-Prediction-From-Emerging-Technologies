 hey this is mike abbas thanks for joining me today we want to have a look deeper look in the process industry actually what is going on these days in this industry knowing this the oil price and all challenges we have in the perhaps how how intergraph can help there so what kind of solution can actually happen now in these difficult times challenging times in the process industry so i have to davis me to guests adrian park from norway he just flew in right that's correct on Michael introduce yourself ok so I'm vice president for information management at Intergraph so I'm responsible for all our information management solutions from a sort of overall product owner perspective cool yeah thanks for joining then after on why he flew in from Huntsville Alabama from our headquarter that's right Michael I'm responsible for all the design and visualization tools product management at Intergraph cool cool so thanks for joining tom so the first question I have to aid in its actually what you see owner-operators get impacted by this change in the industry and what kind of solutions perhaps we can offer here what kind of we have okay there's a number of trends are going on right now in the industry one of them is their owners are operating plants for longer than very perhaps originally anticipated in many cases beyond the design life of the plans now that causes you know a question to be asked well can we operate these facilities and a safe and efficient manner and the only way to really answer that question is to have a good engineering design basis but these plants they've often been constructed 20-30 years ago so how do you do that well we've had technologies on the market now for a while but have allowed people to capture structure and validate information all informations are kind of what 20 or 30 years ago that's right but whilst it had these solutions the the hurdle to actually implement the Ark of the necessary software and infrastructure at people virtue administer v systems have been very high so one of the things we are launching at the moment is something only smart access smart access is really a packaging of solutions and services so that we you have third parties who can actually take documentation for monona can be hard copy documents can be 2d CAD files Excel files databases and stretch of us make it available on the clouds there's a cloud-based offering core owners and it's going to reduce the hurdle considerably so owners who in the past haven't really been able to take advantage of our solutions will be able to do so so that's one trend how do we keep existing facilities up to date and be able to use these in a safe and efficient manner so there's some o technology you have to delete read and scan all these doctors yep that's why that's where the solution partners come in so we have a number of solution partners around the world who actually do this work on behalf of the owner so the owner doesn't have to do it themselves because the owners are totally consumed with doing the day job right so we need somebody to help us on this and another trend in the industry is do more with less it's almost being the mantra of the process industry today everyone is saying this so the question is now how can we help people do that and one thing is to present our information to the users in the context of where they're working because most owner-operator personnel they don't work in engineering systems they work in maintenance systems and reliability systems control of work systems inspection systems so what we've now developed is and forgive daddy keyword we've got these OData API s which actually make information available very easily so what it really means is that the third party system can actually access our information and pull it up and provide relevant information to be users inverse systems so people don't have to log into our system to get hold of the engineering information and documentation that's a good question i mean we have this new product like smart i said and put all this together what about the training needs or the user interface well that's something we're working on as well so you might remember last year we introduced smart enterprise portal which is a great way of providing really easy access to be able to see information so we have that and people can use that in fact we're extending that capability so that now we can access in all our information management solutions both custom SPF and SPO solution so you are helping our customer base on operator space basically the solutions that are basically no training required that's exactly that yeah and we're trying to reduce the threshold for using some of your expert users so we've now got this what we're calling the SD a client coming later this year and that's an html5-based clients it's a website again a1 on tablets it'll earn on desktops it'll run on mobile phones and you'll be able to create an update data in a web typing vilest of high very performant and really simple to use so let me plug in also Tom so he's not listening so thanks for the old upright happy day so what do you see in the in the EPC what happening in this industry now you know what's happening is that it's nothing really earth shatteringly new I mean there's still the pressures from productivity so you want to be able to do you know more design in fewer hours you want to be able to reuse what you've done before but what's different is rather than looking at the design on a piece of paper what they want to do is you want to take the dad and all the relationships that you establish with these modern tools and take advantage of that and reuse it again in the future ok so that's a second big thing so don't invent the vehicle again and again just reuse as much as you can I think another trend and this is just a trend that's continuing is the projects are getting bigger and more complex and to spread the risk they're bringing in more contractors to spread that risk and so you really need to be able to collaborate much better than ever before so this stuff that adrian is talking about being on the web it's really absolutely critical to us here that information so check size you see I mean and how many pcs and the proto I was just talking to technique just a few minutes ago and they've got 15 engineering contractors on a single and on big projects and you're spreading it out and spreading the risk across a collaboration is key and yeah what they need to be able to do is share data but keep the intellectual property across that secure and it's pretty interesting that they're using our technology to do that we're you can argue later yeah we're a market leader there and then I think the the other trend is you want to be able to rather than just providing documents for construction and operations maintenance you want to take advantage of use that data so you can take advantage of the relationships or building work packages and that kind of thing so take the design information bringing it forward other examples of production improvements in your towards you mentioned we use yeah you know I there's I'm going to talk about two two categories of that we have stuff that's available today to do that and I've kind of took a few notes first of all we have for electrical design we've had a lot of resistance of clients wanting to use our smartplant electrical because they typically use spreadsheets and and CAD drawings well now you can take advantage of using those CAD drawings bring them forward into the data centric world and add the data and keep it forward so that's the first thing number two for this productivity we have a new version of Smart Plan instrumentation that gives you the engineering data editor and our query builder which is a modern user experience for really manipulating and very quickly making changes to lots of data and then third on smart 3d immediately today with the these two versions of Smart Play illogical and smartplant instrumentation we have the ability to do cable integration and we've done workshops with clients where they're actually routing cables during the feed project and bring it forward through detail design so they have accurate lengths and eggs accurate costs and then that just rolls over in a construction so that you can do the spooling and make sure all that stuff's there so that's available today and then the second category is what's coming out real recently we have smart 3d 2016 that's going to be available later this summer this trend about data reuse we really take it to the next level where you can much more easily and more cost effectively use data time I'm most impressed it was really good yeah you guys there so so from the EPC side sounds like offering more productivity improving productivity of the existing for us people have customers have improve collaboration on operator yeah I see do more than this less you know that's like that's a big thing and collaboration of course is very important for operators so right now we're working with one of our major so when we talk about collaboration and a lot of companies are involved in all these days in projects what are you about cloud computing I mean very much time this is very very central in many of our customers thoughts it's a lot of advantages really it avoids over handovers between different phases of the project I mean people have worked out the cost of handing over data during a project and two operations is between one and two percent of total installed cost and the final hand over to operations could take up to a year such a vast amount of cost which is eliminated totally if everybody's working in the cloud but and it also takes care of everybody working on different standards what doesn't really mean working in the cloud welcome today it doesn't really it doesn't really make any difference reviews like us to user is just really working through web front-end and for actually working on set and for the use it makes no difference where response is the same if not better and cloud often than with locally installed systems what I mean ons and it's not limited just to you know tabular data we actually are running our 3d applications in the cloud very successfully with very large projects with very large at epc's like Saipan all right okay and of course it's very scalable so basically what you're doing you're doing more with less again because basically you can start off with a handful of users and very few resources but then you can scale of attack because you need too many hundreds of users and scale down again and you're just paying for the resources that you're using whereas with a non prem solution on-premise solution you have to dimension it for the maximum number of users that you need so do you see the whole trend in our process industry obviously doing more with less but also the whole web boiled a cloud ward it's going definitely that way varnie down you know some customers are the front end of that some customers are further behind but you know that is the direction things are going around you now that's right so Tom so we mentioned you just releasing use new software smart woody what other cool stuff you're working on it to have the industry for the kind of well I talked a little bit about the data reuse we actually have a new capability that uses this collaboration thing to do we actually do for owners can do project as built with legacy systems or with smart 3d and then you know as we talked about collaboration and speeding the cost of communication our visual our visualization software is really investing very heavily there so things look better they perform faster they work on the cloud and we can do that in a in a web browser so you don't need to have this big client installed save a footprint so there's nothing installed locally everything is really rented back on the server that's right yeah and it's not only can you do this collaboration during the design cycle but you can hand this over and visualize things during operations especially so you can highlight objects which are involved in a change involved in an isolation of equipment you can actually highlight the objects and that is really very powerful and then the other trend that we're seeing is that augmented and virtual reality so we're actually partnering with Microsoft and the daiquiri helmet to actually provide 3d visualization and augmented and virtual reality so not improve the 3d experience in terms of visualization to set for the hell to reuse it somewhere it's a fine take it out into the field so the plant floor worker actually has access to the data on a on basically an hour at his helmet with a visor in front and you can superimpose information to be able to this is how you isolate this piece of equipment or this is the value of the information from the dcs historian what I can actually superimposed on information as the guy is actually looking at the equipment very powerful concept okay I mean what is augmented reality but not everybody knows so how you describe it the best way basically what you do is you're looking at a physical plant itself and then your superimposing information on top of it so you don't need to go back to the trailer hitting d or that's my DNA she's presented you so you say okay what is the name of this tag I'm looking at and you say this pump is called this and by the way do you want to see the maintenance instruction yes when we can actually be presented to you on the screen in front of you so for people later it's not the screen but it's actually on within the helmet or whatever augmented reality devices are wearing in the in the fields pretty cool I have not tried it yet okay so it looks like I need to try pretty soon yeah liddie present you know so so as all those avoid I mentioned but my last question now so that process industry is changing to the web / to the cloud world what about the mobile world definitely I mean our mobile solutions have been very well received we're actually working on new generation of mobile solutions now but our platform independent so to work on either android iOS or Windows they can work online and offline and I think that is definitely going to help again it helps people get information context of doing their work out in the field and for design it's really about reviewing the design not necessarily doing the design on those mobile tools and so it's about collaboration and review and that's the mobile solutions that will be providing for design so like I have a mobile app and then I can ask questions about the specific installation or exactly it goes back into the field i'll go back to the whole office that's right i collaborate so it's not we're going to be creating massive amounts of data but it's enough to help the design in enhancing collaboration and do markups perhaps actually in the field capture information from flange inspection checklist for example or take a photograph or video right now interesting i think i thinks thanks Tom sinks Adrian for today's discussion today so i think we interact offering a lot of solutions for this challenging time for the process industry tom was mentioning productivity improvements with the new tools coming out and talking about smart smart asset so do more with less and then obviously the easier delivery on the cloud and then use mobile apps mobile apps for the mobile workers thank you micah pass
