 hi Emma you can ask you if it's quick question without a curses excellent so when I approach cost control engineers and larger enterprises one of the first questions I get is why do we need a system on top we are already using ERP system and we all are very confident using Excel and in the face explain yeah yeah of course yes well typically said excel in and your position is honestly the most popular so-called project control tools that people is using what actually echo 62 necrosis it goes in the middle I mean one of the reason is because it basically have it helps in bridging the gap that hand and the weaknesses that motor systems have and then at the same time it brings the value from both of the Soviet system and way I can give you a quick explanation if you look at if you look at the desktop tool like Excel years and most of the people loves external courses because you know powerful Excel is now very powerful in providing tools for analysis is very flexible and very easy easy to use and easy to learn on the other side and the price system are very strong right I mean especially very really are very strong in being the security they put the data in a very secure environment and if it's basically a standard for for for for the company all right so that everyone is using this single process and so on and so forth that's very good on the other side when it comes to to to excel at a stock to since it's very prone to make to make a make mistake and it's enough you are looking at the specific formulas in Excel and then maybe your wife or your colleague is just ringing you and you lose the control what you're doing so and then it is not a standard it means that assuming you are a beautiful range you're undressing approach and there is a colleague of Hewitt racing a different project and I am your director you both guys will give you will give me different different numbers with different a metal in different reports which is something else to make my life more difficult life on the other side enterprise system this are really very very strong and very even very rigid as soon as a specific word process has been implemented right so what actually occurs is does it brings the both of you the best of both okay removing all the concerns and then you you then get a very very strong enterprise productivity system which which take all the security that you have on your team because even if it works on the cloud it has two level security before you can access the system so it's getting very strong it's it's callable as well on the other side or the other time is is providing you with all the flexibility you need for me eventually solving very last meal a question that your client is is asking you to do to deliver or to support executing or in controlling approach ok so it's taking as we say take the backs of both the system with something which with that you meet in the middle it actually increased value productivity and answer away and answer your capability to deliver a standardized methodology right with all the flexibility you need and as easy as to use as an excel by the way as I can give you probabilities on this ok thanks a lot for explaining everything you're welcome
