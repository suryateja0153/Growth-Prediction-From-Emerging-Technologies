 welcome and to begin with I would just very quickly introduce myself my name is Kate oh oh and there is no car I think enemies and I've been working with a lot of different stuff but mostly secret sensitive related stuff in the last 20 years I don't know ll it's actually remove the twitter link on the presentation program maybe because he doesn't like this then we'll eat i don't know brother sorry so some of the agenda here and this is this is really i've been dropping a lot because this is something that is kind of hard to do in a short time so you might find that I mean rushing a little bit I hope it's not too bad you can always come and discuss some of the things with me later if you want and we can go through some of the demos and more visas and also some of the slides will be very with maybe too much text you're not my teaching is not believe it wheat everything but maybe later when this week hold or whatever you get the size for me or whatever then you can maybe say some time to study the slides have been developed through some training as well so some of it is a little more detail than it should be stay so what I'm going to discuss today which is important I think is this what is what is actually happening from a network perspective when you put the net scale more than one with more than one interface on the network and I are not sort of i'm talking about every types of disability I'm sorry about the estate's index and also GPS because they all got some negative connotations and they all acts the same way they have a little different options across because so then I twig secure construction business the security could be a socket itself so i am not going to dip that just passed our roof tops for that then I'll quickly go from there what is described is names of it and if you guys already know by heart and you this is really Tribble then we might just keep it basic setup of the netscaler i will show you quickly how is a i was actually behave when you lose your nose in this case it's one word and the full caller ID versus free activists from the execs on it then i will show how this can be done through segment network with the in a way so that the device is behaving so you don't know be getting used to the hit with the little cars to customers then I'll just cross growling a little bit and also case Robin this is a rowdy feature with you can you can get if you have the right last thing on the list game then I'll talk about something or make this forwarding and little legs and feeling very short and then summation traffic artifice and cost of cases so now we know why we are really busy we don't have the time let's start so how many here have implemented on this scale and one okay what I vote is really nice because it's easy to set up you don't have all the problems that I'm discussing today both in any way and then from a from a security perspective if the company policy is like this all tragedy that's are traversing security zones must pass through the firewall which is not uncommon then this is the right places but if of course if you do stuff like no dancing so you can because I could have a lot of ties of our own features and what it is feasible but if the company wants to use the mascara for something really I mean for instance for load balancing of advocacy truculent exchange service then you get out of the problem but see maybe some problem I see there's a problem that your aversion to firewall from the inside network load balancing conserves that I actually called balancing things that are also on the internet only recently so you actually usually icon the network that I want more than you actually do if you so the traditional way of doing to our most with was maybe 10 years ago or something like that the true value our services your service and services put on a special MC I may make more than one dt and then you would you would change their chief of gatorades would be in the netscaler and then you would let the traffic flow this way this is you have the same problem that you're supposed to fireboard you have to change them so today most people will actually want to do it like you have 11 networking space on the GFC and wonderful way to face on the internal network maybe more than that but for simplicity I just joking okay okay so no new IPS for the service they did them actually they're not aware that there will bounce they did you get some connection from Venezuela it's so costly a free knows we're talking here and also you can you can do services on internal never in place so that internal clans will not respond wall and you can do service from the outside on the DMC for another one and in that way you can actually can actually spare the traversal of the is everybody with me for this month yes this look throughout the description anymore sorry this is not subscription so the net scale is not booting terrific yeah it is actually handle help but yeah maybe you can save your question a little bit so the securities person I wanted to just very quickly shower is that when you do more than one a moat it's very very important this is the whole point of the decision it's very important you really think about security because you aren't actually bypassing in some way the firewall you just have a device that fruits potentially and I'll julieta came into those and do traffic and of course it's a proxy so he needs to do that if it's a formal it needs to traverse and go inside the customer use tools to check security there's a lot of different things you can do if you produce heels under the Descolada lot of blocks and description white papers out there explaining and showing how you can actually have your miss Kayla that's very oh you can also do something that's Denmark right now every customer is scanning for ssl Venus's you the same experience yeah yeah so so that's great of course but there are other problems with that but right now this is really what everybody all right test is the citrix cloud like you can upload as a fourth bundle to it all needs to have a problem with the mystical attitude but the test will actually give you a nice report also giving some advice on the optimization of your security on the material also with silence must be okay and of course the dollar is important always remembers to talk to the lettering security guys and explain how this works and agree with and this is this is the way that we agree with each other that is work and maybe also tested and tested on boys and always remember them by fine yes okay quickly does everybody here how many are really know what is snip and tip and disabilities okay that's not a tratar de so i'll just quickly good so the next Calliope is a unique i peed on every in a scale it's useful mentioned the soft and I p is for outgoing traffic and you would always do a snip for every submit that the netscaler has to be put on okay by default how many people here know what outdoor casters okay great so body falls and I'll do their thing and in a second apartment that shows this a default when you put multiple in IP Persephone this collective will broadcast everything on every space so so we could imagine what problems could get out of that right the map app is a legacy way that that's not used anymore so you think if is virtual activist is a service we can use the IP this is income psychic income request and is specifically patients then quick security advice when you do when you do those arguments something's by default enable some is not but all the ideas can be used for management strategy the less Kayla and this is also securities you need to it went out so only enabled management really want to mention okay there are some moves that's I don't think we have time to go again for that but out of the box for the standard the netscaler will use its own something I pee when it does proxy and this is a good thing because it can then optimize the use share the use of resources across different clients which means you do things like most pressing here the multiplexing is really great because you say resources so every culture every person from the outside this aren't going to have so many connections to the services that you would if you didn't have an educated person in shadow new source IP is something you would use if it's very urgent for a security same conference that you have the client IP be cognizant also features the problem with that is that when it's at an ID that is coming to the resource on the internal network then the recent needs to know how about it back and this can even problem so normally you would actually have the the netscaler city for Gator to see vendors in this case as people gateway so that's but this is really to pasta salad yeah this I'm sex is may be important to add slip a steady put practically ultimately edits so if you look at the rapture collecting it wraps for every single interface I you tell you that all communications who has received something will go to last me and this is for the problem exit devices what wisdom hey step can be used for management as well it's always one to the other if your accent SE set up you can always go to the exit interface so that sorry to the eggs in this killer threw a sniff and that way you will not need to remember what is the exit at the moment you're always going I think you said it uses yeah it's a good point yeah good one so this is a I'm not go through all the detection very shortly we are moving on this later today we could move and all the other lives let's just build a lot of all systems moving on the other ways this movement so this is where we are talking about mega reverses we talk about IP addresses okay so very quickly this is how goes the are broadcast our requests you get a send out requests and you get a response ok this is the pace and when you go to another network you are actually in a calculated in the IP traffic of course but but the destination MAC addresses this is just based so okay so Adam de mesera i want to show you where I didn't condition of the news netscaler firmware and give you Katie them and I gave us then I my sense of our sensor or not I had a couple of Windows whistle when she cheats on each comment given a static IP that's because of it and using that show you how many heat the game was that was like this so we have as I said total windows machines and you have a nice color into our mouths with a nice finality of the ginseng soup and something IV for that subnet and a southern a key for the teachers teach you free right yeah so let's move on today so I have a request application that i put on both machines and just quickly wanna show you oh I think so I need to be sure that is the right so you see we have a in spaces here let's have it so I do i request for the IP address on the same softness and I gave it a megabus from the front desk already starts to 5e this is one of the interfaces get the thing down there but it's a bit because that's the thing of it but what happens when I change to the other suckers but to the other sleep with this device with the broadcast now I still get a response played with the same negative that's not working too long with us right ok so that's problem we need to be with so what can be done is anybody you have a suggestion for that I won't have another go meet you why not yeah that could be a way so but the other is what we did because number once this then yeah so yeah message but yeah but in this particular case I will show you how to use to be a captain inches so as we just saw the national you are prepared response based on our first step exist so we need to isolate the networks and this is what our tune so I'm going to the netscaler administration web interface i'm going to add another VLAN but I'm this is a version of the time so I don't want to take it i just ate it and I call it of course something that's easy to recognize i bind you to interface to add a bandage of the snip that is for that particular the secure zone okay and then I should okay and then i'll show you how the windows machines will actually relax so they still do what is put to one do something of course but now let's see what happens when you to broadcast all you get nothing and this 0 is just this particular application showing that you don't get so now we have something that working all that we would expect also for my computer right any questions mother okay so now we need find stuff so that we are getting the proper response yes so this is great but then then we now did some good stuff which segment the network's fine that's great but then what about routing Oh what's this if you deploy this will get here in this given in just very default settings to to this then it will actually be around you know how many movement and then this is not very good if you don't worry user power which I'm not made love a lot of people like that so maybe in my opinion this is not be a tea cozy you can use pulse pace Robby mention later and you can approach to steady bronze and fill our rights around you can have more than one mentioned in connection is something more trains how to base body is feeling like this and let me in the clip you could also do it in the movie of course I saw the show with the minute then you had something called matrix all right and anybody ask councilman in what position 11 a chain of us additionally also yeah the metrics for she is the netscaler would receive the text will send the fire of the same as a face than participation yes so they will actually it's the simple solution for swim over to me and yeah it's not really but if there's to a but then your name in my face for you need it for the recording oh so yeah so make baseball and we'll take the check your series / outing actually so so this means that the peg is that come from a specific Magnus will also get the traffic reserves that okay it can be used to make sure everything is floating and I have heard a lot of stuff like this is really bad and stuff like that until I was actually in a dialogue with some people who was just using the FI this is a competitor to sleep in tonight's game and they have something similar on near five and they would like this is such a nice and great feature okay I didn't hear that often on the best ever yeah because we want to make sure that we handle all the traffic so it's nice sometimes to get some other angles but of course if you use this you can get a lot of trouble I have talked to two michael t he left his fight but he will hit I land on doing a little a little session on the next event on the negative 33 about about hi Bobby and they this will implementations where this can be a real real problem we can get more if you want to join decision so this is the place where you put this layer Freeman that I talked about perhaps and I will show you what is happening when you put a windows machine on you have you saw the windows machines under under that is some different softness i will now actually disabled disabled the firewall yeah I saved you from the final and then I will and then i will put the netscaler certificate way and show that they are community I think I'll see that there is pizza time strong like fish so I disabled stuff in the far wall of course so after the same in this as you see it will stop the presses plus it's not rocket science and now i'm going to change the default gateway to the michigan on both of those late it didn't work and i was like oh my team is not working anybody suggest not one of the heads you see that the tower wins out to the ones to scan and what happens to those seen me yes the 50 exactly so it really helps when you when you want you to say that's not a generic but in this one particular baby it helps launch the things so now you see the traffic film from the mescaline and now I'll Joe in the end stay while sure we were on the nests killer dead people is my question sorry what's the Hebrews language that I'm really strange things i actually had claimed them putting a language Baggins because I wanted to be nice but that's that's not I had I didn't get this abscess so so but you get the point so now i'm going to disable the layer 3 4 1 in here and as you can see after that after that it will stop serving those those machines that's right okay this right so right now i can see that i need to speed up because i really want to share with you some thoughts that we had about custom cases and this means that i'll it's certainly something like that i'm not sure you are proved to you can ask me later 170 okay so i'm going to have was planning on showing you the s and Kronus travel because now we disable the routing for all the IP addresses and fiscal zone but they're still wowing so addresses so what I'm was planning on showing here was if your machine on James III is painting the snip interface audience it was still route it was still browse through the bathroom because it's full address and this is for people behavior okay so this means that i can ping in both directions which would not normally work because i don't have wonderful gave advice so how i mean and i disable that yeah so so this is important and it's not a problem anything but it's a problem when you get through more rich programs on the other layers so I was showing its planning on showing it that HTTP sighs was that as was on duty free and trying to show the netscaler interface bicycle maintenance base 82 and showing that this would not work this doesn't work because this far wall then that I have this setup so wat it could be a lot of other friends in tow most serious farmers could rock this trap right so it sees you got a night detective true and you get you get the IP packet back to the nest also will come from this is not good so next time you can affect the firewall will say I know what's up to you but I never saw the return so yeah the let's hang we'll skip that you take care about Sam industry line does anybody know you know what a team is millions ok I can quickly mention it it is real and it's a real and specifically maze when you create an excellent it's used for arm is is used for the maintenance and you can change it most people will change it in the command line find it so specific interface and this is something that's quite important because again the mystical mentionable will when when you segment the meal a little divine plan for the other person and this is deep Purdue for began one you cannot change that in the GUI you want you need it when i reboot okay yeah so it's a traffic when you have two nights in a setup you would want it to send some information through the passive past and that will produce all frou frou frou since villain that I mentioned before from this Calliope is karate this includes synchronization and if you do a command also if you do something to it will reverse a command command if you seem lost so this will be propagated to the secondary so that they are always sing on also some session information depending on the time so you'll go dancing we'll go to the unethical of the first fits all you want as many of the user sessions to be as close to the original base ok yeah ACA Happy's is slightly different this is this is the mechanism for for checking if it's not something wrong but that will provoke the netscaler to fail altogether this is also very important setup right because if you have an interface that I face involve fellow disconnected we change another be line and out when the data it can be checked on one side dependent on it's a slightly advanced it up but you can't check everything yeah most beauteous yes so this demon was I plan here which I'm not at the time for me is to show how you can create a specific VLAN and this is very important about don't find any stick addressed food then you won't be able to choose for a city that's right ok that's very important but if you don't find out that was you can you can use it and I asked situation this is great but what is happening and essentially slaves who shrugged hey there is no traffic but I mean you need need to go severe police's sort of communicate the different devices and i did a why why shark face on this specific interface that are bound this miscommunicated to and it turned out it is like basically IP let us traversing this although you already have that you could have it on another day so it's not very nice what could be really great was that if we could find specific IP softness to that's some customers doesn't like that they want they have maybe a specific there in customs that they have specific VLAN for that kind of traffic and they wanted to have the same software as that Travis but that is how it works and when you can do it yeah I happy traffic it's a month with us when I talk about it sable brain series you'll know what a feces in days is not a bad thing is it is about me you can ask me after the poisonous yes I'm so bad to say but on an escalade means that you can I mean it's very important to consider what how many of my living spaces to air once 22 so be able to detect that will fail before I do this K or to put but don't do a fellow without recently because involves hear that noise so why do so a fellow in to preserve is a way of sort of showing this is this is a group of interfaces if all of those found eat yeah custom cases better be quickly the first one is it's about it's about a very secure installation in Denmark where they wanted two different components are of the simple bar to be also in different subjects and they have the same problem that the netscaler was robbing stuff back because they were doing a load balancing of the FC sorry of the said no prob this was accessed by the FC and he's in crunch Robbie was happening and the fire was parking the solution here was to rename they had a enterprise licenses so this is safety enable users may policy-based want to force the traffic to go properly through the through the Gateway full-time and then things were start toward so this is it you don't have Enterprise feature then the only way you can actually make this work is making so much but this is the global saying it's not really nice next could also use traffic calming yes which is Japanese well then you and it could but you would have to use the gateway drug to mean zero because it lives there but you couldn't subtract me put the other yeah it does being an attractive mature also yeah yeah under same deal for what is great about it I know that I will admit rate this back policy based routing in the report yeah because it's easy to break stuff I think that your official stuff we got from jesus said that if you want to vs. Michael you can also move my solution we cannot use practical management a lasagna I can't think on it so I have done it at a customer where we was always a real stuff to make zero and then kind to some tears not nervous torrance yeah but the problem that profiles just that gives fellow straight to the right you only have one round table so if you forgot when routing you will have traffic going in a way that you wouldn't expect so so yeah yes but it's a good way I understand the common in a case like this right yeah then the other one I want you to not five minutes late and so yeah so this was a customer who's used to have a competitive muscular five but def is a fact and they were used to a complete separation at least I told not only five that well because including something they said that they they are completely isolated so you have the management network is you just read from the from the days and they like this and they also because of that they they had a sleep on the amendments traffic that was 48 ounce and they didn't want to wait 48 hours things work so they need to make sure that they could actually pull the block under this on the desk Ellis management it was officially honor Benjamin spaces without any thing disturbs and they could still manage that so thank you yeah that was something that then I was some reseller permit so yeah so yeah you did some work on it and I think I just I just very quickly go to the to the solution so the solution is was the final sign was this stuff very nice try but I syllabus and so the ordinary cognex were was when this Calliope is here and they have a recipe with a fraction on the 16 gig sir I think a rotten and then they have boosted was it was I events that's notion space and of course for that we're done he said that was this lady talked of us so they wanted to make sure is the color block here nothing was so awesome a frog was a solution of taking the traffic flow probably that was also the month they had which is understandable comes and then happy was disabled on those those particular management interfaces that preparedness piety and then a sink was created on a specific checking man in his face that was mint salute so fantastic and with no access and this was also the where society in action and this particular setup was made and the customer did a test when he shut down the poems with super hand and it says showed that everything the command propagation is work you know a CAC Co certain note hello was try it the only drawback was that they needed to use the special on course for many races when the in that time by the wait is this leis we met earlier gates then insert a solid running it I we have a little talk about if they wondered change management as also you mentioned twisted because that was a way of moving this so the production anyway but they didn't want that they thought it was a solution might think that could be maybe you've waited because of course there is the long for prices to the signal yes that is the goodest below it's under so I was a thing it is time for you really as have you looked in a potato yes I look interest and I find it really really great I think this is what we've been waiting for and I'm very close to one hundred percent sure that this has also been made to do things in an inch much waiting likely factor to it so but I don't think very much folks as you are I think a lot of consultants are waiting for it to maybe see it in nation and mature a little bit but it seems really promise was one of the issues I have with the net skaters that even if you do real and taking them whatever as long as you're at one routing table it's a space to that long penis so then does make this working but we need suddenly with two writers my crack to means or admin positions but just prep convenes its limit and you told the services put Edmund participez very trusting and invitations if you cannot afford on this gate and say edmonton positions would be a really great ugly for another position just one point where we were using because they get really in trouble authenticate users with three sadly I don't have that means customers running his gifts there's also the issue with the Kuwaiti government to comment lands is this one big one from one investor a CSM login with admin user you don't have any rights to a blue buttons files to configure many tools to configure ssl certificate because you don't focus yet but I'm guessing if you're running sdx you wouldn't need separate I mean the case for separate frontage wouldn't be that big maybe because of you could get value customer running box 30 or 40 years s so yeah you want different desert with that and this is why he asked me that possible to stds the beach right that's what so I've seen a table from operation shown that it actually work so it's very Church engineer enrichment so I think we should follow the box and and discussion around this because I'm unversity but from teachers trying to do they need this to me also use them yet because they had one GF five so it's a wedding and slice really yeah slice really i mean nicely in other words you play the netscaler naww yes first on and we play mean it's killin AWS not very much very much but i find it interesting that you can get 1i bird that is somehow interest in this features yeah it's extremely strange to operate a scale but fellows get to be very very wrong ok 8pm tonight this is recession of that yeah ok any other questions ok thank you very much
