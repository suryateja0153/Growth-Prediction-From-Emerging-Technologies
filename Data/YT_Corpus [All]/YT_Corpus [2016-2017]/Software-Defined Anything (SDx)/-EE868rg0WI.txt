 welcome to the cap discussions roundtable I'm Tom Nana maker with our guests Mike from power options but before we get started a quick disclaimer the capital discussions is not a broker-dealer or an investment advisor this presentation is for educational purposes only you don't know your situation and have no way of knowing the level of risk is appropriate for you sorry about that big thunder outside we're not making any specific trade recommendations the risk of loss of trading options can be substantial so please be aware of all the risks prior to placing any trades epithet achill computer simulated trades are believed to be accurately represented however actual proper loss may vary due to market factors such as liquidity slippage and commissions so that out of the way and the Thunder has stopped I will transfer the presenter over to you Mike and this is your first time in the round table so welcome and maybe give folks a little quick intro and what who you are and what you do okay hold on one second here we'll make sure to share your screen it can go a control D like desktop on your Windows computer that's okay ah did that that didn't work did it I see sorry folks if you're in the webex the event center you go to a quick start there should be a button to share your screen or you can go on to the webex menu structures to the share alright there it goes yeah I don't know why control LT wasn't working there so I apologize to that sorry seeing my screen now just has power options basic walk through the power options tools jun 8 2016 i do it's great looks good ok great well first thing we want to do folks thank you for letting me speak here today with capital discussions Tom thank you for reaching out to us and thank you all for joining the presentation power options is essentially a patented suite of search and analysis tools designed for self-directed options investors earnings renner created the power options tools back in 1997 he essentially retired from hewlett-packard and him and his friend who was a programmer who retired as well created a set of tools so Ernie could simply have a place where he could enter in his own trades search for his own trades that he wanted rather than spending time going to library looking through newspapers and finding stocks that he liked and realizing they weren't optional and couldn't do the positions he wanted well he put it up on the net for some of his friends at HP to continue to use and over time other investors found it and Ernie decided that he would make it more of a lucrative business now of course when he originally started he put in the strategies that he was using covered calls long calls and some naked foot positions we've expanded the tools over the last 19 years there's a patented search tool the search tool algorithms that we use there's actually patented and that's now available for over 23 of the most commonly used options strategies but as Tom and I were discussing early right now we don't have a search analysis screen for broken wing butterflies as of yet we might have some tools available working with capital discussions group and others coming up for that kind of access as well now it's Tom mentioned my name is Mike chupke I'm the director of education here at power options I've worked with Ernie and the power options staff since about 2001-2002 so for about 14 15 years now I have Co authored two books on investing I've presented in various places across the country Atlanta of course Chicago several times Texas and different trading groups as well in South Carolina and North Carolina as well now as I mentioned of course the reason these tools were created because as options investors we know that we need multiple services we need a service that can identify the combinations of strikes and expiration dates that match our trading plan and can make or break a trade but just important is the option configuration is going to be the underlying security we know we're not going to waste time trying to open a bullish position on a bearish stock unless we have some type of alternative management setup many of the services offer a stock screener but then a separate options matrix where you can just plug in the stock and view the spreads we of course offer those two as well but it's much easier to be able to screen for just the positions you want to match all of your criteria at once as opposed to going different places of course proper management is also the key to success earlier I think one of the attendings thing was Gregory again and mentioned about how he's working with the broken wing butterflies and I believe he's comfortable with managing in one direction and not the other and so you need tools to be able to manage the various positions as well so why power options exist and what our tools are designed to do in addition to the education that we offer we like to have these tools available because it gives the investor the ability to select the options any given strategy to match your goals and tolerance the true screening for the price return probability volatility greeks and liquidity and in any strategy you can also search specifically for stock fundamentals and stock technicals that you would use to identify the security for that particular strategy of course once you identify the positions you will then be able to further research and analyze those positions the stock or the option before entering the trade and then of course we offer a powerful set of portfolio tools to help you pay per trade track and manage the positions okay so that's essentially what power options is apologize there i'm going to navigate over here to the main screen of power options and what we're looking at here is your basic trial account one thing i wanted to ask you real quick come do you see the others like the blue I'm sorry box at the top of my screen as well it says I'm sharing the monitor is that just for me I just want to verify that that's just for you okay yeah all right fantastic well so the basic power option screen our tools are designed by strategy so we see we have some of the basics here set up for covered call and just in each tool each strategy i should say you'll have a variety of tools we have selected a pics of the day for covered calls naked puts and upcoming credit spreads we show the top three based on historical searches that we've done the option chain we'll talk about a little bit of course every service has an options chain but our is a little bit more customizable than most the search tool we're going to spend time on that today and of course you can always search by symbol in every strategy as well i'm going to quickly go to the other strategies tab here just to show all of the available strategies so i have selected about seven or eight the common strategy straddle strangles bull put credit but over here on the left you see all of the available strategies the different vertical spreads of course calendar calls calendar puts covered combinations iron butterfly's iron condors long calls long puts and so forth we had a gentleman who came in earlier who would mentioned that he had found power options through the radio active trading concepts the married put techniques developed by kurt frankenberg who actually partnered with right now for limited risk positions and applying the different income methods as well now i'm going to go into bull puts the reason why i'm going to do that tom is i saw that when you did the survey many investors say that they were beginning or a little bit more experienced of course many are doing the the pattern trades of your donations a pattern trades but there's broken when butterflies but rather than start we're just covered called naked puts wanted to show some of the tools for evaluating credit spreads simply or maybe even iron condors so on power options if i'm interested in opening a particular bowl put credit spread or i want to identify bull put credit spread to match my criteria we'll start off in this search tool when you click on the search tool in any strategy you're going to see a list of potential trades and these trades match either your last save search or most likely the default criteria that we have available and for every strategy we offer default criteria that you can use as a stepping stone to create your own personal search for this particular one we're looking at the weekly bull put screen and you see a brief description here the selections to find bull puts and weekly options and we've actually tested different criteria to find which one worked best which set of criteria would work best consistently over the course of the last six or seven years as well now when you scroll down below the list of trades in a given strategy on power options you'll be able to see the actual criteria that were used and you can make any adjustments to those criteria as well so we start off with our four basic tabs here are options criteria the stock technicals stock fundamentals and the list as well and let me see here just going to make sure if I can change there we go okay and I'm sorry folks okay i just wanted to do that there all right so sorry for the options in any strategy you can select the timeframe whether we want to look for a standard expiration or whether we want to look for weekly options for example or any given time frame you had mentioned with the broken wing butterflies of course that you might look for up to 60 to 70 to 90 days out in time I could easily set a time frame for look for all exploration cycles between 65 and 90 days out in time as well so that's something that's always available there for us to use in every strategy you'll be able to screen by implied volatility whether you want to screen by the cell option to buy option implied volatility ratio there's also the availability to screen by the percent implied volatility range in most strategies and that shows you where is the options implied volatility now compared to where it has been over the life of the option so if I'm looking to sell premium in a given strategy I might look for a higher percent implied volatility range on the options i'm selling and try to look for a lower implied volatility range on the options that i'm buying a basic risk return of course we can set the maximum risk for the spread itself monetarily or percentage wise and of course the net credit and the percentage return range is in or out of the money in each strategy and then of course the other option criteria including things such as the theoretical probability above the short option in this case of a bull put credit spread the Delta of the short option or the long option adulteration between and if you wanted to limit positions that you're buying or selling by bid-ask spread you want to look for a smaller bit I spread or percentage but as spread that's available in all strategies as well of course we can also adjust the volume and the liquidity for the positions now in any the different strategies these will change for example we talked briefly about the Mary puts well I wouldn't see a net credit filter or a percent return in a merry put or a long call or a long put because essentially the upside profit is unlimited but we could define it by the percent or monetary maximum risk we wanted to see across the universe of options or other factors as well depending on the strategy if I'm doing the calendar spreads I could set requirements for the time frame for my short and my long leg as well as setting a minimum price for the premium own receive on the short and a maximum price I want to pay for the long so the idea here is to cut down the entire universe of options based on what you're looking to accomplish in your particular strategy as well in every strategy the technicals that we can use things such as beta the percent of 52 week range volume and percentage stock volume broker recommendation we get into a little bit more detail with things such as the Bollinger Band ranges and the Bollinger Band ratios those of you who use Bollinger Bands we could screen specifically for stocks that are up near the upper range of their Bollinger Band or if you even broken through the upper band or the lower band as well those of you who might be trading the iron condors or neutral strategies you could use a bandwidth range that's the envelope size of the Bollinger Bands of themselves so if I restricted this to be between let's say 40 and 60 I'm looking for stocks that have been condensed on the Bollinger Bands and have been trading in a tighter range now that might be counterintuitive at some points there's a lot of times we see stocks contract and the Bollinger Bands close in we're expecting a breakout one direction or the other but again a lot of times an extended condensed bollinger band width will allow us to look for positions that of course are creating within a strict range which would be good for neutral strategies simple moving average fields we can screen for stocks that are trading above a 20 or 50 or 100 or of course if the 50s above the 100 or below and we can also screen for the number of days the stock has crossed a 20-day 50-day 100-day moving average and of course those of you who are using MACD we see here that one of the defaults that we found with the historical testing is looking for weekly bull puts where the MACD line has been above the signal line for at least three days or more now for the basic fundamentals that you'd have in every strategy for those of us doing spreads and things of that nature we may not necessarily want to limit the stock price but for my bull put spread they probably don't want to look for bullets on stocks in or maybe under 30 or under twenty dollars per share maybe even under fifty dollars per share so i might specifically look for stocks that are trading greater than one hundred and then the standard other fundamentals the earnings per share growth p/e ratio PEG ratio as well if you wanted to screen specifically for stocks that pay a dividend for those you doing covered calls married puts or other long strategies market cap net tangible assets as well and priced a book then of course one of the other important features for screening in any of the strategies is to screen specifically for earning States between now and expiration or not between now and expiration or ex-dividend dates depending on your strategy the last set of filters that you'll see any strategy is of course the field and the list field you can choose to screen specifically against given sectors or industries or exclude them and at the same time you can choose to include any stock list that you want as well we start off with a default here for things such as a ETFs da 30 IBD various is a standard & poor's list that you can screen against as well as value line list which you can always create your own personal list so if you just wanted to scream again the 20 or 30 or 40 stocks you found may be from another service I have a lot of customers who use vector vest and they get the stock list from vector vest and they'll put it into the create their own personal list from what they found and use that as their base criteria when screening now once you set your criteria of course you see the list of results up at the top of the page and you have various just basic view right now so for both puts we've got our company name the stock symbol the last price of the stock the option that we could sell here we see the June 98 and a half nine days to expiration on wy n n for a dollar 11 and we could buy the June 97 and a half so we have a dollar strike at eighty-nine cents so our total net credit would be 22 cents with a percent return of 28.2 percent and of course we're showing the probability as well on any of the search tools in any of the strategies or the search by simple tool or the option chain you're going to be able to customize the date of you based on what you want to see so I can simply click Choose columns and this gives me a list all of the criteria that I can use to search for stock fundamentals technicals and the options criteria we can select to view on the results page so if I wanted to add in the other stock criteria I wanted to add in things such as the option Delta or the short option and long option volume individually percent to break-even ranges range out of the money we just select what we want and then we can make that change to the window and then our new columns will be added to help us with our research and analysis now we do have a list here of about seventy-two possible results 67 results after that recent update just went through Lee refresh the page here a lot of times when I'm running a search in any strategy I want to narrow down the universe of options to maybe only those 10 or 15 positions that best suit my needs Ernie design these tools of course there's as we mentioned about 30 to 40 different option criteria we can use in any strategy and about 20 to 30 different stock criteria that we can use for every given strategy as well and we don't want to use every particular criteria that's listed if I put something to each one of these boxes I'd likely have no results but it's designed that if I have investors that are looking specifically for both foot credit spreads based on technical data and I have customers that are looking for both put credit spread specifically based on a course they took where they're only looking for positions that have a delta of let's say point three or less on the short option and a minimum return of at least fifteen percent this tool allows you that wide flexibility where I could go to the floor at CBOE grab fifty options investors put them in front of 50 screens and tell them create for me your best iron Condor search and I get 50 different searches that match each individual investor and that's what these tools are designed to do now although it may look a little bit overwhelming at first with all the criteria for a particular strategy the key really is to put in just those criteria that you use as a starting point so when I start off in any strategy once I scroll down below the listed trades I can go ahead and hit clear filters that will empty everything out and we're just going to create a basic search for options that might be about 10 to 15 days out so again I could just go to June tenth standard expiration which is ten days away but I'm going to select all months and we're going to put in a range of let's say at least one day to 15 so we'll see anything that expires coming up on friday as well as anything expires on jun 10th that matches my criteria we're going to look for a minimum credit on this bowl put of at least 35 cents we want that return to be a good leverage return so we're going to look for at least a nine percent yield on the position the out-of-the-money range well I can use out of the money if I specifically wanted to look for the short put to be least two or three percent out of the money but we can also use the probability I'm going to put two percent out of the money but going down into our price strike price field I'm also going to look for a probability of at least eighty percent or higher that the stock would remain above the shortcut and I'm not going to want to mess around just for specific reasons I'm not going to want to look at spreads that are one dollar I'm going to look for at least spreads that are greater than or equal to two dollars and of course I'll want some basic liquidity so let's look for at least five contracts traded today and at least an open interest of 10 contracts as well now we're looking at a bull put spread this is just very simple the four or five criteria we look for on a particular spread but let's go into the underline and without getting too complicated I'm going to look for stocks that have an average stock point at least 750,000 shares per day this particular field is measured in thousands and any time you can hover over the basic listings there on the filters to get a definition and some insight of what criteria you might want to use again we're just going to use that simple filter for looking for stocks trading above the SMA 20 I'm going to keep the default rule there of looking for stocks where the MACD has been above the signal line for the past three days or more now for fundamentals just going to put in a basic view again we're looking for stocks greater than fifty dollars per share and since this is a bullish strategy I'm going to look for stocks that have shown good management of the last year and have grown in earnings at least five percent and put on a relative p/e ratio of let's say zero to 50 s that's not too wide apart in addition to that I'm going to avoid stocks that have an earnings between now and expiration and as before if I just want to look at standard securities I'm going to go ahead and select to exclude indexes and ETS for the time being or I could choose to screen specifically against indexes and ETFs now just with that six or seven criteria entered let's go ahead and submit the search and we see here now that would just that basic criteria of looking for a good net credit relative percent return a good probability and then putting in some basic bullish criteria we've narrowed down the entire universe of options and every 15 to 20 minutes we're building close to about 900,000 two million bullets or bear call credit spreads we've narrowed it down to four positions that match my specific criteria now I'm not saying that these are recommended trades we just wanted to show you how quick it is an easy it is to set the criteria you want and the tool is designed to be a time saver so rather than look across dozens of spreads that may or may not match my criteria I know exactly now why these four came up in my results and now we can quickly compare the different positions so once i get the strategies listed that match my criteria will use the more information button we could look at the stock chart i always want to look at the recent news and headlines to see if there's anything that might cause me hesitation to enter the position we can do further research on the stock or the option i'm just going to click on the short put research very quickly one of the features that we have here on our research tools for the option we show all pending data but down below you also have the history of this option since it was released on the market so you can compare graphically option price versus implied volatility black-scholes ratios option volume bid-ask delta as well so you can see the graphical changes of the option based on the stock change or implied volatility as well so you can always see the historical prices of the option as well as the historical implied volatility and that's how of course we have that filter available where we can look for the percent implied volatility range of course other things we may want to look at it's just your basic profit and loss chart so you can evaluate the position see if the graph matches your specific risk reward tolerance and you can also run what if scenarios here for changes in the price what would happen in this bull put spread if Google fell to seven hundred and thirty dollars in the next three to four days let's say what my position look like or if the volatility changed as well current volatility for these options is around point one six seven so for my volatility change 2.2 and the stock dropped to 730 well now we can see the new profit and loss chart the curve line at the halfway point and of course we end up seeing that we might have a loss in this position based on the increase in volatility and the fall in the price on what we'd expect to change for our short option and the long put option as well now the profit-loss chart does link us to the custom spread tool where you can build spreads on the fly so if I change this here to maybe sell two contracts of course of the 725 put and by one of the 717 for the june seventeenth expiration we can go into the view options field nine days away there and let's say that now i went ahead and add a further in the money or out of the money put here to create a different position so we're about seven and a half strikes apart so let me just go ahead and go for a cheap put here at the 700 well we can sort of build different combinations on the fly if we wanted extra protection I don't think this is a kind of position money of us would look for it doesn't give us the advantage we're looking for we probably adjust that a little bit different but you can add customization to the potential position you found on the fly if you wanted to add a little bit more protection or maybe increase a little bit of premium by creating a ratio spread or doing other legs of a spread to create a combined position as well now one of the last features here we've talked about how we can quickly identify positions that match our criteria one of the advantages of for self-directed investors of using the power options tools over just a stock-picking or a covered call picking service or things that nature is we know specifically why these results came up we have control as an individual investor over the criteria we used what we're comfortable with and what matches our trading plan going forward as well now after I've run my analysis didn't see anything that would cause me hesitation to enter this given position the last thing that will do is go ahead and add it to the poor folio the portfolio features on power options allow us to track and manage our positions just going to put this in for a quick example if I open this bull put credit spread on google it so we did five contracts and put a commission fee of let's say 595 for both legs all right let's just go ahead and submit that now once you create a portfolio you'll be able to track let me go to the standard view there folks you'll be able to track your various positions and we link them together by strategy so rather than having them as separate legs thrown into a different portfolio we see where they one covered call open we now have to both put credit spreads one on Texas Instruments one on Google one calendar spread and of course one iron Condor in the forelegs the iron Condor there we see that we can you have a summer here the subtotal of the iron Condor or the Iron Butterfly for the four different legs now this is just the standard view which shows you the gain and loss of each individual leg for the particular strategy other views in the portfolio which are very helpful to position analysis of course when i click on position analysis and adds the six extra criteria over here on the side and so now i can see the position as a whole so for the google position that was just opened we received a credit of 413 and due to bid/ask slippage if we liquidated right now and be of a loss of 124 dollars to close the leg but the position we open on texas instruments that expires in two days we receive the net credit of 5 24 10 contracts and we could liquidate the position right now for only a cost of 480 and so we could make 92% on that bowl put credit spread and that might be a good time right now to potentially close the position I'm sorry I just had a chat come through I didn't see there might have been more questions I'm sorry there oh sorry okay to question I'm sorry folks I didn't see them but I was going to show one other thing real quick but from andrez says that please explain how the historical volatility is calculated the screener itself the historical volatility for the stock is based on the 50-day volatility we do show the values when you're in the stock research tool to 20-day 50-day hundred and 250 historical volatility but in the screen itself it's based on the 50-day volatility for the underlying stocks annecy said are there any risk management type of features for the strategies the premium seller I'm constantly having to make adjustments when the underlying moves against my positions that's perfect lead-in to what I wanted to show next here very quickly though before I do that not sorry wrong button there we before we do that get into the field there there we go the other views that we offer here on the portfolio as you're tracking multi-leg positions which may be important is the greeks view so when i click on the greeks view i see the combined based on the number of contracts in each position the summary of Delta Gamma theta Vega of course and the implied volatility ranges so if you're a delta-neutral trader or gamma neutral trader for example in the portfolio view you'll be able to see your combined portfolio average weighted Delta and gamma of course and theta and you could make adjustments based on that as well and as I'm tracking the positions in the portfolio we also have the important dates field as important dates will show you the earnings coming up for any position dividend date and last dividend date and there's some other basic information as well but going back to the question that came in about management anytime I enter in a position to the portfolio whether it's a simple covered call whether it's a married put even whether it's a condor or a bull put credit spread we're going to set alerts in the portfolio and for any given strategy you'll be able to set alerts on the underlying security and the stock moves below a certain price or decreases by a certain percentage or increases and you'll be able to set alerts for each individual leg as well so for my short call here for the covered call position if the option changed by a certain value or increased in my favor if I'm within one to two days to expiration of course I could set alerts based on that if the total position whether it's a credit spread a condor has decreased by a certain percentage or increased by a certain percentage we can set that and as we mentioned in our search we had looked for bull puts where the stock was you know above the 20-day moving average or I might have used a bullinger Baron screen so I can set alerts to be notified if the stock changes direction and drops below the 20 or the 50-day based on the original criteria I used or if I'm within three days to earnings or three days to ex-dividend and might want to manage the position now i can save those alerts of course and as we saw in the footlocker position will be notified when an alert is triggered subscribers to the power options services will also be able to have those alerts email to them when they're triggered for one of the most powerful features of the portfolio tool whether I'm tracking just covered calls or elaborate spreads for example as I'm tracking those positions I can go into the position Actions menu where we quickly do any of the adjustments at a dividend roll the leg closed the leg and so forth but we can go to a position analysis page and we're looking at the position up sorry folks when we're looking at the position analysis page we get a breakdown of our current position profit and loss chart we expected some criteria based on a remaining Delta on the option the time value left or days to expiration as we scroll down below we see the basics of what was our original position value what is my current liquidation for this footlocker position one down 2.4% after 20 days on the covered call and if I held it for the remaining nine days until the loss of one point eight percent if the stock stayed at the same price but as you scroll down below the position we're at a loss right now two point four and might expect the loss of minus 1.8 but as we scroll down below in all strategies you'll see potential rollout opportunities and adjustments where we're doing the math for you so we're shown that we could currently buy back our June 57 a half call and foot locker for 25 cents and we could go to the July 52 and a half call it fifteenth of July for a premium of 360 but that still puts me to negative assigned so if want to try to trade change this moving trade into a winner I might look further out to August but the July 55 call here offers a smaller premium but with a potential of a point five percent game so if I feel the stock is going to stay around this price I'd still have a good downside protection of seven percent and instead of taking a loss of 2.4% liquidating our one-point-eight percent I might have a small gain in 37 days by rolling down to the July 55 it's great to see things numerically but what's better is to see it graphically so as I'm evaluating my roll out opportunities in any position go to simulate trade we see sort of a side-by-side comparison of where we are right now my current position on the left and red and my new position on the right in blue where we see that rolling down now would lower our cost basis down to 56 60 and 50 for 80 total after the premium received so if the stock does stay above 55 now we could of course increase the return there and change a losing position into a winning one over the next thirty seven days is this potentially the best adjustment no but it does show case that the rollout opportunities are help you more quickly analyze potential adjustments on the position we're doing all the heavy lifting for you and if I decided I wanted to make this adjustment simply click Submit change to portfolio down at the bottom and now we still the footlocker position but the original price at sixty sixty has been lowered to 56 76 after rolling the call and we see the new combined July 55 call that we just sold for a dollar eighty five so that's taken into account we can always view the full run there if i go to analysis we can see the full position on foot locker that we've traded over time with various puts now that's just a walkthrough of what i do on a daily basis when i'm opening new positions adjusting criteria using the default searches as a stepping stone to make the adjustments i want to see and then researching and analyzing the positions using the quick tools there on the side run what if scenarios with the profit and loss chart and then put them in the portfolio now question came in earlier about position protection in many of the individual strategies you'll have various things that you can use to help protect the position hedge a position or increase potential returns as well sorry let me go back there real quick here just in the home menu so one of the main features one of the tools that we offer here is called the stock repair tool so if you have a covered call right now or maybe you have a stock and i'll use foot locker again as an example and i'll go to the stock repair tool so if my cost per share was actually let's say 59fifty and i had a hundred shares or maybe i lowered it because of a call that i sold what this tool does is build repairs now footlocker's currently at 5546 i got a cost basis of 59fifty what this tool did is try to build ratio repairs for the position the stock repair where i could potentially lower my break even from 59fifty down to 57 15 by doing a ratio call selling 257 a half's and buying two 55s won't go through the repair details right now but we can see here as we go to the profit and loss it would take that losing position i have right now to a potential winner if I expect the stock to recover over time didn't address the downside though if I'm concerned about another fall so in positions the protected positions such as married puts and collars by clicking the insurance tool we can put in let's say our stocks them again of txn will you change the texas instruments let's say i bought the stock around 60 150 and we can go ahead and hit calculate here it shows me I have an unrealized gain of about point eight percent and it shows me available puts I could buy with the new potential Lockton profit- lock in profits shows you the risk but there's a position here where I could guarantee a profit of one percent and still apply other adjustments to the position so the insurance who will allow you to evaluate put options you could purchase on your stock your underlying security even if you do already have a covered call in place to show you what your new risk would be in here we have a negative max risks with the bulletproof position then of course we can customize adding other positions to it if we want to simulate may be selling 63 call for example or doing a ratio spread against this position we can evaluate that as well on the fly to see what our new risk reward profile would be for this particular position with the risk limited now no return not as high as I'd like there but the custom spread tool the profit and loss chart related to do that on the fly as well now another tool to other tools real quick i'm going to review here that our independence to the strategies of themselves powerful tool that we have for those of you might be speculating with long calls or long puts and part of your portfolio is the long option finder and what this tool simply allows us to do is let's say we were looking earlier at alphabet or google so if i type in goog l which is currently trading i believe around seven forty and if i put an expected price for the stock of 795 and i'm going to invest about maybe three thousand dollars into expensive options on google and i expect this new target to hit by the end of june for example in bullish over the next 20 days or so was put that into the long option finder and that brief instant what this long option finder did is grabbed every available call for this particular stock and it calculated every possible strike to see what the potential return would be based on what the current price of the options is right now okay so we see here that the july 780 call july one I'm sorry 780 called priced at 120 with my investment of 3,000 i could buy 24 contracts and if the stock did hit my expected price on my expected target date this option would see a reticle be worth 1502 which makes sense it's right at about intrinsic value so we'd have about 11,000 1000% returned from a dollar 22 1502 now that's expecting a large move I understand that but that's what this tool allows you to do the long option Finder allows you to do is plug in your values for your expectation the stock and quickly see which options would use your the best theoretical earn on the position and of course one of the for those of you changing trading spreads we do offer the spread chain tool and this tool is a simple tool to use by stock symbol so if I was interested in trading both spreads on Amazon I can look straight at credit spreads where it show me the bear calls and the bull put combinations or I could go to the put credit and call debit parity i'm going to type in amazon and we're going to put in some basic criteria that we want to spread with of what say at least 10 spread with of 10 minimum credit of at least 85 cents per cent out of the money good 4.5 minimum return let's again increase that 29 and a probability of greater than seventy five percent ok now this showed me the default positions the bull puts and the bowl called debits for the June expiration let's go to june seventeenth instead to look for the weeklies so if i was interested in opening spreads and amazon but i knew i was going to look at a ten point spread with i had a minimum net credit requirement minimum return and probability the midpoint spread chain tool shows me just those quick combinations for amazon where i can evaluate the probability versus the return for each position now why did i choose to look at this called debit put debit parity let's say we just went with the highest probability and we chose the spread here of using the 690 250 in the 70 25 selling a 70 25 foot in buying the 692 while the credit spread the put spread would give us a 96 sense net credit which is a ten point six percent yield but the debit on the bull call would be 90 3 which means we could get an extra cent or an extra percent return now that might not be worth it but some of these other combinations here let's look at the 697 seven oh seven and a half a fifteen point five percent return for the bull put credit spread or the same probability where i could get a 16 point three percent return at midpoint potentially for the bull called debit spread so in this case my sentiment is the same i'm still bullish on the position but the midpoint spread chain allows me to view the parity view between call credit and put debit or put credit and call debit to see which one best matches my probability my individual requirements for a stock and can I get a better return with the debit potentially than the credit even though I trade both put credit spread zubair call credit spread I might consider going with the parity trade if it is offering a reasonably higher return on the position one other quick thing here I want to show you this tool for those of you may be doing condors or butterflies let me just change my criteria again for this particular spread chain tool here minimum return we've got to have at least a nine percent again I'll go probability of 75 but if i use the spread chain tool for the credit spreads where I have my bear calls on the left and my bull puts on the right this now allows me to quickly create and compare a potential iron Condor based on what probability I'd want at midpoint prices so if I wanted to be at least eighty two percent probability why would have put that into the field here for the probability range but here I see I could combine the bear call 757 60 with the bull put 697 707 and we get a return of ninety six cents plus a dollar 13 so we get about a little bit over a two dollar credit on a 10 point spread so this combination of iron Condor looking to other money bear calls and puts would probably match my criteria for return about twenty percent or so based on a premium and the ten point spreads will have to cover one side or the other as well so in each individual strategy there are individual tools that you can use the insurance tool we saw there the spread chain tool for both puts and bear calls and the long haul of course the long option finder just plug in your stock there and go from there and you can see which calls are which puts would give you the best potential return based on your criteria now before I navigate back over to the slides to briefly show you some other information about power options I guess I'll open it up if anyone has any questions in fact let me just go ahead and do that real quick here well I'm on this page there we go so what we wanted to show today's is how do we feel power options is used to be a one-stop shop for options investing you can set up the search in any strategy find only the trades that match your trading plan and specific criteria for stock and options in less than a few moments in a few clicks you can narrow down the entire universe of options to only those positions that match your personal risk war tolerance you quickly have links available to further research and analyze the stock or the option run what if scenarios look at recent headlines and then the portfolio tool to help you for ease of tracking your positions tracking alerts and evaluation of adjustments as well now the standard cost of power options we do offer an end of day service which is only forty dollars per month the delayed service gives you access to all the tools available and that's sixty dollars per month it's about a 15-minute delay and we do offer real time so every time you refresh a page whether it's your portfolio where you run a search you're getting the numbers and the calculations at that very instant and that's one hundred and twenty dollars per month for the real time service right now but consideration is that how much would you pay for individually a stock selection service an options analysis service market news or portfolio tools I know of three or four portfolios sorry services out there that offer portfolio tracking tools that are forty five to eighty five dollars per month with power options you get all of those services combined in one for really just under sixty dollars per month depending on your activity and of course time as we had talked we did set up a specific link for anyone who is interested out of the capital discussion group if you have not tested out our tools yet or use power options you can use this link power up calm / capital and that will take you to the main page and you can just put in your name and email address and that will start you with a 14-day free trial no other information is needed you will have full use of the tools for the delayed service and of course we're going to work out specials available for future subscribers of the capital discussion group as well discounted for group subscriptions and so forth as well going forward and as Tom as I talked of course a little bit earlier we were going to talk about working with one of the members of capital discussion who is a subscriber to power options and using the broken wing butterflies and continue to talk with Tom as well to see if maybe there's a one-off tool that we can use to help build those positions for you perhaps or identify them similar to how we use the search tool for other strategies as well Oh fantastic I did have a couple of questions do your tools work with indexes like the money where members Jade's dated Russell or sdx absolutely so let me go back here to the screen I'll just go here right now earlier we are in the search for bull puts or if we went back to that I saw the spreadsheet open maybe I do it doesn't look like i do but let me just go into the search real quick and one of the things I'll show you two things here for the bolt put credit spread search there it is we were shown earlier that we specifically remove the indexes in ETS from this filter but I can change that completely and show just indexes and eat up sorry something when I want indexes and ETFs as well so let's see with that basic criteria we created on the fly all right nothing is there and it's probably due to the probability so let me narrow that down to 70 greater than or equal to do that's fine this should work a little bit better the openness now there's one more thing I have to change sorry any time you're looking for the indexes or ETS you want to clear out some of the basics especially the stock volume filters as well there we go okay so that basic criteria Tom I was looking for a position bull puts one in 15 days out minimum 35 credit spread with greater than 2 probability of greater than 70 we have 16 results here for the I BB biotech ETF spreads on SPX yeah so it's looking at all the indexes as well are you ti WM one thing I've done before too is a this is on my webinar account of course I've ones that sorry lists I've created to remove from specific list and I also have one just called my index list and I'm going to go ahead and do something very quick here just shows SPX let's clear out the filters one more time put in that date range let's keep a very simple search that credit of 50 Cent's return of at least five spread with again i'm going to set their tom greater than equal to probably five here and the probability of what goes 70 and i selected the list to screen against of just my index list which is just the main for indexes we should see are you tsp ex and the X is in there as well now there's too many results here there's 140 so I can narrow that down further by doing other criteria one thing on power options Tom of course thank you for bringing up is it if I'm in that spread chain tool we looked at earlier when I'm putting in a symbol for an index on power options you can see our notation is dollar sign SPX dollar sign n DX and so forth so I'd have to if I was doing a search by symbol I just wanted to look at the chain or the quotes I have to put in the dollar sign SPX we could go directly to the chain for example and of course one thing I want to mention with the chain just as we saw before this is just your basic small chain for calls and puts with some of the basic criteria but as we saw in the search we can customize the call chain the put chain on power options of the call and put chain anyway you want to through that choose columns filter so you can add any criteria for the Greeks return probability ranges implied volatility implied volatility ranges so anytime you look at a chain it's customized the data that you would like to use for your analysis hey speaking of SPX I know they recently started adding the ones expiring options are those in your database as well you see them right here it threw me off when they first came out I remembered when they were coming out but the notification that they released them came actually about three hours after they did it and I went to the chain and I thought wow what is this June ninth and June tense and and where is this other ones you see it here the June nuts expiring tomorrow they are in the database and then of course we have the June tenth two days away for Friday's expiration as well and sorry you saw the selection there in the drop down so the 15th and the 17 all the Wednesday ones are in there for SPX and we believe other indexes are going to be released theirs as well ok more questions for me is there I know we love us use either option view or option that explore and they have nice manual back testing tools is there any way to do that with power options can you see go back in time and look for spreads or you know different crates very high to sea level again absolutely let me do one thing real quick here I'm sorry let me get out of this and see a couple other questions from Jerry coming in as well so this search oh that's the weak people put that's not the one we were playing around with okay I got out of it already one do one quick thing go back to our bowl put search we just created Tom and I'm going to go ahead and save this search now and we're just going to call it the index search for capital discussions and it's not a recommendation or suggestions just on the fly so let me go ahead and save that I didn't have to say that but I'm going to save this particular search in any strategy we can click on back test the back testing tools will give you three uses the smart history Excel which will allow us to run back tests in any strategy based on our criteria we could use the search by symbol history to look up index spreads one index at a time going back in the past and if you're on the subscribe to the historical tools you'll also have access to the full chain the full historical chain we record our own data goes back to April of 2006 so over 10 years of back testing data now now in this particular account is just a trial account that we use for our webinars but all of you on the free trial will still have access to the historical tools but using two months of historical data so I'm going to go to bull put Tom and let's go back to the end of April will go to april eight and we're going to do that pull up the screen we just created index search for capital discussions so now we run the historical search and it's actually looking for positions that we've matched that criteria as if we'd run the search on april eight we see the top 15 results therefore Nasdaq different SPX different are you T's as well now and the historical tools you find your results there's two things that you can do to analyze the position i can analyze this position individually so i decided to go the ndx one which has the highest net credit there or the highest return i should say of twenty one point seven percent and if I open this on april eighth through the april twenty second expiration and click on analyze position and this is going to give me a break down and a performance of the position the maximum return was realized on this position is expired worthless and we can see the minimum return was the day three days after we open at nine percent and then we can see the history of course of the percentage return on my position versus performs of QQ at SPX but down below we can see the stock last price based on the bid and ask to what our return was historically since we opened the position now that's useful to see the individual position but if we go back to the back-testing how we use this tool is i create a set of criteria that i'm interested in for calendar spreads for condors or as we're looking here bull puts for indexes i went back and i said ok so going back in time i ran the search here's my top 15 results how are these performed over expiration so we could calculate group results does take some time to compile of course for the historical tools but as we see here now we can see the total view screen still my screen came up here but is still not loading at one second so what this does of course this is just going to look at every position the top 15 positions that were on that field and it's going to show us the total cumulative return at expiration so what was my when loss ratio on all of the spreads from when we open the position on april eighth to the expiration date of the individual options and then we can also recalculate it to see a specific expiration date so if i wanted to know what these spreads were worth their value was five days in or six days in to the trade we could see that as well all right there it goes so we see here that what we expect sometimes with credit spreads and we all knows now let's be honest we wouldn't have opened all these positions we probably would have opened only one for each individual r-ut SPX or mdx but this allows us to compare which were the winners and losers and we see over that course the SPX and the ndx spreads would have been successful to one hundred percent of what we expected but just as any spread trader knows the wind losses get counted out the r UT spreads all had a hundred percent loss on the position so even though we were right eighty percent of the time we still would have come out of the month with a loss that tells me one of two things either I have to increase my range out of the money to narrow down the number of positions that I saw back on that original search or maybe I remove the Russell if it hasn't been a good performing over the last three months but what I'll do with this tool tom is I'll go ahead as we just mentioned i'll create a criteria set for a strategy that i want to test and then I'll go back in time and start running it month by month by month to see how it would have performed and as I if it's not successful I'll make changes to that criteria based on the market conditions or what I think is working and not working between the strategies until I develop a screening criteria that seems to have worked best over most market conditions and of course the question that you might want to ask is well did your sample searches and default search we sell earlier are those tested and yes a lot of them are we see this weekly bull puts that we had for bull puts and same with bear calls Ernie actually ran historical testing to find the best trade-off for time versus net credit again we're not making specific recommendations or suggestions but we found that this specific criteria that we use for bull puts perform the best for weekly options the most common question I get from a new customer to power options who is interested in credit spreads or trading weekly options they go here and they see the week we both put search and say well why are you looking 8 to 17 days out in time because historically we found that is more successful than trying to force it to every three days or four days out in time because the smaller premium is received in those shorter time frames so the losses get compounded more dramatically uh very good I didn't expect that that's a nice surprise I did have another quick question and obviously have a real time data do you have to pay exchanged fees with matters at all included if you are a professional yes ok so the exchange is ask us to if you subscribe to the real-time data the exchanges have you fill out the professional versus non professional if they judge you a professional based on that 10 questionnaires that they send out or if you have a of course a an account number license number of then y se then there would be extra fees on top of that for a professional user I think it is about 120 to 140 extra it's not paid to us it's paid to the exchanges the the 120 dollars per month stays the same for a subscriber to power options but you'd have to pay those extra fees to the exchanges if you were a real time user and a professional user right and another question now you have that tool to look for optimum calls if you have a tool say if you have a market opinion the SPX is going to go to this range over this if this date or date range what searching across multiple strategies would be the best strategy or strategies to use we've been developing something similar to that we do have a tool right now that allows you to view positions it's called the search summary tools so if I just said SPX here and I go to search summary the search summary tool allows me to see combinations for covered calls calendar spreads I can see if I just select bearish for example and submit that and I can select the expiration date as well so this is showing me combinations of what is possible but as you mentioned it's not doing that next step which is in development is if i put in SPX and i put in my expectation the price on a target date where it would show what calls what calendar spreads what iron condors we'll both put credit spreads would yield the best theoretical return as well oh yeah that purple fees tho those monthly yeah those are monthly fee so in addition if you were a real time subscriber and professional to power options the 120 dollar per month for the real time service to power options an additional maybe 110 120 dollars front the exchanges as a professional trader would be monthly as well interior hit another question earlier did you see that how many time decay lines are available yes and right now let's go to just a profit loss right here right now it just shows the one now that's a bad example the covered call and let me go to the so I let's go to something more fun let's go to that bull put credit we entered a little bit better view so Jerry right now it's just the one as you originally open a profit and loss chart or you create a custom spread what it's showing you first the curve redline the one curve redline we're showing is at the halfway point but we can run those what if scenarios at any time again let's say this drop-down is 735 three days from now two or three days from now leaves of volatility alone but then the curve will be redrawn based on that new date we selected and I'll show you the gain and loss and laugh but right now we are just showing the one curved line on the risk-reward graph the expiration date and then the halfway point initially and then it will change based on whatever date you want to run for your expectations to run your what-if scenarios Jerry as well and can you overlay one trade to another no I don't have an over a feature available I usually have two or three tabs open when I'm comparing the two positions and I'll sort of minimize them down and show them next to each other as well but I don't have an overlay feature on this profit and loss ready for running multiple strategies on a similar stock or two separate stocks for example let's say I have two more questions before we wrap it up and hit some technical analysis filters you have plans to add more and other some common ones people use like RSI that may be missing Oh RSI is there okay that's there let's see so let's go into the technicals real quick yeah I'm sorry we have the RSI number of days too short interest average broker recommendation we added some of the other things the stock trend number of days up and down number of days the 20 days been over the 50-day the MACD as well Williams percent are was asked about within the past couple weeks and a couple of others if you do have requests or ideas of what you'd like to see added to the technicals or fundamentals will look to see if we can add those in that's how these Bollinger Bands got added in and how the MACD got at it and earning was shown the bollinger bands and shown ways to trade them so that's why he added them and some of the default searches for long calls and other strategies are set up to look for Bollinger Band ranges and bollinger bands around earnings I was the one that kind of pushed for the MACD because I use that with some of my analysis on the married puts and even the bull puts or bear call spreads as well as the Bollinger Bands in some cases also but at any time we get a recommendation or a suggestion from a power options member then we look to see how quickly we can add that in and what changes we might need to make for the technicals or fundamentals as well and then I know we talked about it a little bit before we started so people may not have heard it but I know you do have some plans for adding and the broken like butterfly type of screens right and do you have like a week maybe nessam get in time when you might have it ready I don't know we would have to talk with the programmers it's on the list as I mentioned we were looking at doing the search fields for butterflies and so forth but working more in depth with your group as I mentioned it might be possible to build one off-screen or specifically for the capital discussions group that would match more of what you're looking for on the set as well Jerry another Jerry I believe asked a question was this modeled after the option that explore meeeee I can say no Ernie created this tool back in 1997 I don't think he'd ever seen option etics before even looked at option that exam I know the option view was doing education back at that time but I don't even think they had a suite of tools and one thing we mentioned at the beginning of the presentation one of the original founders of optionsxpress actually used the original form of power options for several months before optionsxpress was released so sometimes I get a customer who says hey this looks a lot like the output on optionsxpress and I know the reason why well maybe option etics copy do you guys heard of a great they were they were around about the same time and I've talked to it was a sorry I forget his name is George fontinalis is that correct here's how I operate Tom Jensen yeah I've talked to George once or twice my email on different ideas and just different concepts of trading I think we are of course both together many of you might recall several years back there was a they were doing the options expo for optionsxpress is hosting the options expo and of course you know we had booths two away from option view and option Maddox was down on the other side we all three of us of course did little of the workshops seminars that were there as well oh I'm sorry to hear that I dad I did not know I did not know he passed away three years ago thats that's sad to hear i'm sorry i did not realize that i was very sad to hear thank you jerry for letting me know that but yeah we had it we had a good time there and it was always you know we are in competition with each other of course but we're always in comfortable competition I would never talk bad about anyone who's trying to you know enhance education of options trading across the board because I know what I know and then Tom you know what you know in our education and what we like to do to present to other investors may appeal to some it may not appeal to others everyone has their own risk tolerance and their own strategies they're looking to do so I'm always learning every day as well as I'm teaching and I'm sure Tom you are too so absolutely and you know I always look at tools to see if there's anything that I can use to improve my trading and I don't necessarily have to use the whole suite but if there's one or two things in there that can help me then I'm more inclined to just go ahead and invest in it absolutely I agree I think for the question so Mike really appreciate you taking the time today to show us what you've got in that special link for the capital sessions members I'm sure look at some people that check it out and really look forward to trying out the tool myself and seeing what I can use to improve my trading all right that sounds great Tom thank you so much for allowing us to spend time with you today with the capital discussion group after I leave the webinar of course what I'll do is email you this link here so you have that if anyone asks for it again just to power up calm / capital pretty simple and when you just go to the main page you'll just see a field there where you can put in your name and email address and click start my trial and the 14-day trial won't start until you actually walk onto the account for the first time we'll send you a password and if something comes up and it takes you five or six days to get to it your trial doesn't start until you first log in and it's important to note as you mentioned that everyone who is on the trial will have full use of the tools and the other idea is that everyone who is a trial number of subscriber can schedule a coaching session anytime with either Ernie or myself and the coaching session is just essentially a 35 to 45 minute phone conversation will walk you through the tools on the site answer any questions you have show you how you might set up the search based on what kind of criteria you're looking for in your strategies and other discussions as well as far as how to use the tools to implement what you're looking for also well thanks again and I will put that link next to the recording also sends you a copy of it too if you want to use it for any purpose ok thanks again every fantastic yeah thanks everyone for sticking with us to the end really appreciate it and I'll get this recording in our library as soon as I can so thanks again and thanks Mike and let's wrap it up and I'll see you next time alright Tom sounds great we'll talk soon take everyone all right you bet
