 man's paralyzed limb reanimated with the help of a brain ship a team from Ohio has made a medical breakthrough successfully developing technology that allows brain signals to bypass a spinal injury and transmit straight to the muscles when Ian Burkhart broke his neck four years ago it damaged his spinal cord and left him paralyzed from the chest down he retained some movement in his shoulders and biceps for lost sensation in his hands and legs to help him doctors inserted a chip the size of an eraser head into his motor cortex the area of the brain that controls hand movements the chip records brain signals for specific hand movements and sends these to a computer via a port on the back of burkhardt's head once the signals are decoded they're transmitted to an arm sleeve studied with electrodes the electrodes stimulate the muscles and allow them to move the system called neural life has allowed Burkhart to make six different hand and wrist motions it marks the first time a paralyzed man has been able to regain movement using recorded brain signals
