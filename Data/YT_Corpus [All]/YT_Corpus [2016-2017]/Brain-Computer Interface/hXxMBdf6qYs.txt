 by the way yeah fractal fox works on a ete g classification which is that thing way they measure their like the electricity in now how what is the proper definition of it by the way they do something something without with the electricity that is going on in your brain and yeah he is into neurofeedback research and as a software for non-invasive computer vision based wildlife identification which is a very cool thing I believe yeah this was your biography in a couple of sentence made very very badly anyway yeah so oh hello ah perfect ok yeah so please give him a big round of applause for it yeah thank you thank you for joining this session yeah I I put some crappy description of what I'm actually doing so the wildlife thing is actually a separate project so what I'm basically doing a EG ECI research and yeah and so this is what I actually want to talk about because recently I felt like I was waking up in the future I mean because we have all this new technology right now happening like rejuvenating cells what is it open open a I like driving cars self-driving cars everything just like it's it's tangible almost and so now we have brain computer interfaces and also made affordable and to the point where you can say it becomes reliable actually and yeah so but of course always with new technology there might be some people want to misuse it and so like there's a great responsibility coming and so I know this place here I find probably the most progressive people around technology and that's why I want to hear share this update actually update on the BCI progress that we did already last you with meet our mind and bizarre heal and yeah alright so let's get started so yeah this is basically where we want to head ok so but yeah I know a lot of people probably knows something about our know maybe a lot about pc i but i have to be fair and just give a little introduction first so for the people don't know and yeah the number talk of course about the challenges or things that actually are going to be relevant and yeah it also give you a view over the consumer devices that are currently available and all the open source approaches right now and okay so yeah here we go bear with me this is just the basic right now I try to keep it short so what is eg basically it's electroencephalography you have this you have this beautiful plot here this is actually what we can measure on the surface of the head and that's what times bag are and the 20s found out you can do it also with humans so you put this electrodes and somebody's closing the eyes and then he opens it and you have a totally different pattern of brain waves and so yes a non non invasive brain imaging method and it's probably uh yeah one of the best known so to say and okay and so yeah this like maybe a typical mount so you have like Electro's and you place them in a certain certain areas that correlate of course to brain activity and different areas of the brain and then you get this signal and so basically it's you can interpret it as how how many times the second does a wave go up and down and then you can do an analysis on this you have the frequency analysis for instance at something that's being done quite often actually and so not what else can he do you can do the unmixed the signal and then you for instance have you can determine the arousal state like so how awake are you are you almost falling asleep or did you just have like a bunch of coffee and yeah like this kind of scale you can we can see here this is the typical scale of course there's also different activity and yeah so basically we can do so much more actually with this combination also with machine learning of course and so but let's just have a slight a definition here and just do so you can see like the basic difference or how we can operate actually a brain-computer interface so like this is you haha so this was the end of it okay okay hello okay all right perfect so yeah okay so like three basic well yeah way to differentiate we have active active brain computer interface where you for instance I think about your left or right hand and of course need some training and then yes you can directly control the device without that's one approach then you have reactive where show circle stimulus that means so you should show something like maybe something visual or something auditory and you have a certain reaction and then also hear pastor ones those are the ones that you probably won't notice much there's kind of tweaking your user experience and so you probably won't even notice them and yes it is like a very basic very basic yeah circuitry of brain computer interfaces where you have the user and then you have the electrodes we do amplification I mean this is a very simple simplified approach right now then the filter ad converter and then we send it to a software we do some pre-processing because of course we also have a lot of noise in the data then we really looked for the data that we can use feature extraction and then we have some machine learning algorithm that can run a command based on the interpretation and okay so yeah so as I said so it really depends on where I put the electrodes and there's so many possibilities actually here and this is only a crude map of course so but yeah for instance spending computers something very nice I think so you just see maybe a screen with all the with the alphabet and so the letter you're thinking of maybe the line is then highlighted and so we can measure actually this is then the latter you thinking of is actually the target stimulus here in this p300 scheme and then this is like a different reaction we can really measure this to anything else like anything that's not the letter you right now thinking of and of course yes so maybe it's already also the videos where people are can actually control by thought exoskeletons and prosthetics and yeah so and next something that's also now very popular for ya out for the commercial consumer products is the new your feedback and so what what is basically is you can learn you can really train your brain wave activity and and so the way it works is you we constantly measure actually you're the brain wave data then we do the processing and we have an interpretation is this going near to the state of well-being you want to beat maybe then we give in this moment we give a reward so in this the reward is a sound and then you say like oh okay that was the sound this is great and your brain tries to reproduce the sound so in the same time you're changing your brainwave activity and yeah okay here brought some samples examples this more maybe for clinical and medical use of course but yeah so that's the heck II thing of course you don't have to be sick to use neurofeedback you can still optimize your brainwave activity and yeah so and the north of our artists is the nice thing it's easier than ever to make an interactive installation where you can have an audio visual feedback maybe you can design it it's just the nuances of your arousal state and also baby in combination with somebody you're doing it together with so it's a whole new it's a new experience is something new that you can really feel so I tried up so we did I did a similar set of authorizer at a sort of festival and it was quite interesting with two people and you can really say it's something special and yeah worse sorry really worth trying on so and then euro gaming so this is basically the gamification of neurofeedback so also there was the second conference and Nuri gaming already in San Francisco this year ok and then there's this new approach are not so new approach but now new approach in consumer the consumer landscape is to combine EG or to use tDCS transcranial direct current stimulation or transcranial alternating current stimulation which is basically zapping your brain the problem is there's not much there's no long-term study so far I mean people say it's nice it's like wow I feel like I drank a bunch of coffees and I'm so active ok but I don't know can you can you do without it something that less it's not so sure so they are some scientists also who say yeah you can try it out but you should be careful definitely what you're doing you should be knowing what you're doing ok so maybe just give a quick overview the methods this is not all of them this is just the ones i found interesting here's the PT on earth was that was the one where you respond to a to a certain stimulus the target stimulus and the spare computer for instance and there's no learning involve Freddie then we at the steady-state visually visually evoked potentials this is where you can for instance have a blinking light and a certain frequency and you will have you can actually read this in the hospital Sonya your visual cortex you would have a certain response to this and so this is also maybe an exam sample of a reactive vci then we have slowed critical potentials SMR motor imagery this is again the active one and yeah this is them yeah also quite good one so okay but yeah let's just have a quick look at the consumer devices right now and first okay we should clarify what are we looking for what what would be the criteria to say this is a good device or this is bad device so I just thought of a few points of course depending on what you want to do they might be different so but of course the first thing is cost I mean so maybe don't want to waste $50,000 and then say oh wow okay I can control make a robot go in a circle and the other one and wow nice $50,000 so okay maybe a little less and but what's really important is this passivity and the reliability so you don't want to buy some stuff in and there see oh it's all it's just a it's noise in the data so like I mean you should ask you service really brain wave coming out of this thing so I'm not going to point the finger at any commercial product right now because i only have 10 but so like it's really it is really something you want to look at it's really essential thing you want to have clear data a clean data and okay so the next thing is the the hardware and software degrees of freedom so to say this is an more of course interesting for hackers I guess if you have the chance to change some parts of change electrodes and of course what's also essential then to have the raw data access and and then ergonomics I mean you don't want to waste 10 minutes trying to set up your EG pci device not maybe even 30 seconds that really sucks because like every time you want to try at night at some point during the day and and then you fiddle around the whole time and then it's like it's a turn-off you don't you don't want to deal with this the whole time well of course you are depending on what you want to do so and then one important thing is the product safety and securities or safety I would say of course you don't get electrical you don't get a shark from the system there's not as dead circuit or something and security I will come to this later this also one point and okay so just yeah I know this is this is just a few devices i picked this no so to say yeah just like the yeah right now popular ones but they are also other ones of course if you do some research the newest guy mind wife is kind of I think popular does a good job and has good connection I mean it's easy to mount and and there at least I have a hardware DIY guide it's nicer than the motive i was working with two years but I was kind of the apoc and I was kind of annoyed to put this to other people's head actually because yeah if those people have a lot of hair are you really sitting there sometimes 10 20 minutes and the the guys asking like what's happening I don't know nothing's nothing's medium yeah I'm up waiting for something yeah the electrodes yeah it's not really working and yeah it's also again as I said a turn-off but I'm really um yeah I'm curious about the inside I think it's a actually just launched than the in tracks muse also looks like legit headset melon i put here I couldn't so they couldn't give me the the data security but it's also very affordable alright so okay so what is the progress so if you look at the devices they all have dry electrons that means not like USB you have to put gel to have a good conduct connectivity it's different now so like dry electrodes whether the problem is you have to make sure you re you get a higher higher impedance and then it's a very sensitive to noise you can really get nice very easily so you have to think about the design of your secretary and of course yeah the agron rhythms get better and it's something that improves of course but if the signal is bad in the beginning sometimes there's not much you can do and yep then you don't have a working bc i actually oh ok there was one too fast the okay so then let's move on to the open source DIY and so yeah so of course the time a little bit too short to to go in detail about the hardware setup but we're gladly going to help you guys if you come by we can talk talk on the details of the hardware implementation really but yeah and also I now just picked like a few devices again that a project that either have enjoyed like a tutorial how to do a device for yourself or that already offer maybe like a kid or something that you can restart during you doing vci ok so here just list then the open EG project i think is has been this quite popular this has been online for a long time on the sauce watch page and they're doing a really good job they also have a lot of tutorials there and so and then they say it's like something between two hundred dollars to have to put the device by itself but then you ought to have a company that basically assembler this all in the box and then also yeah probably also heard about the open be cio.com project this is where you can relieve 3d print also the EEG or pci device and and you have a different approach also more electrodes but also like one with four and then the open pci dark the one that comes from from meet our mind and was a hero and with over 30 years of research and this is what one gear can be steak and a lot of electrodes and we it can be used either with arduino uno or you can use basically you can exchange also the microcontroller here yeah so but yeah what what is the core difference what is why would you either pick the one or the other so again it really depends on what you're planning to do is it something you want to do at home some simple setup or you want to make research low-budget research so to say you want to have holistic recording with a lot of electrodes so you have to think about that but so like maybe one core difference is also the ad converter that was a hero pic for the brain to you know so you can use it actually better with dry electrodes so yes it's more it's actually easier to start with it do to set up and yeah okay I'm just maybe than a few words to the electrodes because this is the thing that you cannot I mean you didn't have with the consumer devices but like with them with the heck of devices you can read to say okay I want this or that the very something that is also in the scientific realm you if you have the like a standard is the electrodes which are like a cup and they basically the materia something silver God or tin then you have big difference is a passive and active electrode so passive means I just make I've electrode and then goes maybe over wire and then you have the amplification but on the way it's a problem that you maybe get some signal noise also because of electromagnetic fields for instance the active electrode on the opposite is you amplify the signal right after the electrode and what makes a better contact than a better signal okay and then also something very new you have bendable electrodes I saw publication and I think is also coming up so something the very air economic and yeah of course and also you can you can hack electrodes you can just take some silver coins and solder them to screw and then connect it works perfect yeah okay and then software so I only also picked a few of course there's much more but like open Vegas one of those thats quiet has been there for a long time also and you have a visual editor and you have all the machine learning at all the filters there also and like a lot of tools and yeah brain-based also unfortunate only for windows but then nuram was also new software it's not open source but it's free to use so yeah but i would suggest for the beginning or if maybe some other two boxes for for matlab if you do it like the research field what open pipe is always a good thing to go I think the beginning and so one one important thing I want to talk about is re privacy issues maybe this feels like it's an early stage but if you think about it if if brain-computer interfaces become more popular like you know you used to be like Fitbit maybe or something like that and now it's you quantify the the body now you quantified in mind and become popular then you should ask yourself what happens with my data with my brain wave data because there's actually some things that you can do with it and yeah so let's just take a look at this titles here um so the headlines and brainwave privacy standard is needed to prevent buying on EG day desk scan data research as one so okay muffins proposed brainwave private standard EEG data can predict illness and app makers are storing it in the cloud I think wow that's I don't want that that's really something I want to prevent so I think it's it's a critical time that we should actually get in get conversation and just discuss this really because yeah I don't know where this this could be heading I mean I'm not overly paranoid but you can imagine there's a lot of things you can really use here misuse and yeah so basically something about health conditions cognitive performance and then of course there was also publication talking about achieving with the consumer device they found out the pin code once the first locations where know are people you actually know so all this data can be actually compromised and yeah so you have different stages of attack and of course what we can do is with the open source community we can cause a look if there's something maybe around the device so maybe we can check out we can do a we encrypt the brain wave later before we send it but okay no it's going to be hard anyways but we should discuss about at any and yeah so um so again I would say private standard is really something essential something we that should be discussed and and then yes so then this is something that where I really want to also that's why I'm here also to discuss with you guys if there's some approach that we can make a safer brainwave experience in the in the future and yeah so just come by by the new rope you're hiking space and yeah we can discuss you can try out the device we have a lot of devices there from all sorts of all the consumer the open source device we listed with are actually there and yeah try out on test and then if you want if you want to hack something glad to help you and answer all your questions and yeah again as I said so maybe you also have a good input for so we can kind of go on with the privacy of brain wave data and then also for the for the brain to a new project there's going to be a Kickstarter we want to make it more affordable yeah also if you want to participate yeah just come by again yeah but that's basically it thank you for listening oh yeah questions yeah there is a really a question from the internet so please go thank you a first question do you know of any plans to regulate the whole technology devices that sends waves and have the capability to you know temper with your brain shouldn't maybe be easily to to be allowed yeah I'm not sure it means the problem is sometimes you I mean the consumer market then so like okay I will repeat the question um so it's there any way to to yo shut up what there any approach so I would say the problem is always the disclaimer like mouse like very small print of things and then you're not sure on the if your consumer of a yeah if you find consumer product so from that point it's quite hard I think to to regulate at this point but the I don't know if there would be like a standard like like a read data standard and a safety standards and maybe this could be done but of course there's so many steps where you can attack this actually so yes it's quite a complicated topic okay there is a question on the microphone editor oh yeah okay you had this slide at the beginning where you outline the basic though the data when it first which analog taken from the brain then change to dialogue data add digital sorry and there was a filtering process before that my question is is there a direct at advantage of filtering the data before changing it to digital data and what sort of cruel doing is done there is it just a band pass was there something else it actually so I mean this was quite simplified graphic because you have also different kind of amplifiers before or instrumental but yeah so this is it make sense before you send it further but yeah maybe if you have the time maybe you can come around and we can show you like some detailed schematics actually and try to explain why why is this make sense at this point but yeah also I mean if you if you don't want to come by it's all online I can show yeah sorry to my left hello no no there is a question in there hello about the EPOC headset there was a small bullet point mentioning that it has rotate hack could you please elaborate yeah i mean i'm not sure if this i mean yeah i mean if you if you look in the search engine you you can I mean it's quite easy to find it's also in github there's some Forks off it and yeah it's actually quite easy to use um but yeah it's possible hello you were talking about also the dangerous and a misuse that can will be done with it the dangerous enemies use that can be done with it with the system there will be misused you know that it will come yeah I mean it's part of it so how as a scientist to you yeah work with that you know you yeah only one hand you clearly know that it's good and all the good things that come out of it or the other hand it's a very very powerful technique technique I think people should be able to decide by themselves if they want to share their brain wave data or not and every action i do before this i want to make sure one hundred percent that cannot be compromised I think that would be like maybe some opt-in if you can say okay I'm fine I put my raw data online in the cloud they can use it for analysis for like cloud analysis yes definitely it's a powerful tool but yeah I think it should be opted in there should be no compromising before that step do you also believe that it will sometimes you know in our society we we have the brain in the heart you know we take separate it I don't know why but this happens do you think it will lead to us getting brain and a heart closer together again I mean once you know sometimes you don't know what you're feeling you know you can't describe it do you think that that whole technique can help well I mean so basically I mean how I think about neurofeedback for instance is it's like meditation with guidance so like all the like the research also going on with meditation you know kind of bring into the car what does it read do what how to change your brainwave chemicals really and in a profound way and I mean with us with us I mean what's following this is that you become more aware of course your surroundings so maybe anyway this this brings this brings close together heart and the mind so to say yeah yeah that's all there is a question to the microphone at my right I think bc is quite interesting but since it and it's an interface I'm interested in whether there are any methods of inducing brainwave since of just measuring them imagine a world in which you think of something and you get a I'm wikipedia article directly in your brain requires interesting yeah so like this is the I mean they're different approaches right now non-invasively but in a way it is invasive you have the tDCS but I mean so the problem is you don't have like long-term research on this you can you can be your own guinea a pic of course you can divide by the devices and just check it out what it does but so like this is you know like forcing brainwave activity the other thing I mean I try to explain the newer feedback is really it takes some time but there's like depending on what protocol using you can regulate also you can change brainwave activity and the great thing about it it stays the way it so it's not like so like you're really building new bridges in your brain I mean the same with tDCS but it's not forced and the problem with tDCS also it's like very unspecific right now at least it's like you're firing in every direction and changing something forcefully yeah thank you there is time for one last question from the signal angel thank you my question from the internet goes along the lines of the last question could you elaborate a little bit on the brainwave training part what's the status what are the benefits yeah so I mean it's used right now for instance to like a DG like attention deficit disorder it's an alternative to to write to learn Italian you know that cycle basically it's an impediment that they're giving two children and so it's very harmful II for the body but instead you can do neurofeedback training actually and so I mean of course you have to do some practice and maybe you have to do also some follow-up practice but in the long run it helps you with a situation in a very good way also and you don't have to take chemicals I'm super sorry for you guys but we're running out of time and I've got a t-shirt so yeah thanks a lot the yeah also you can just come by you
