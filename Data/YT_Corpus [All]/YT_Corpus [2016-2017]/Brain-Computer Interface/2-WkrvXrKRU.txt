 If you can imagine not being able to talk, she can't communicate like you or I. You can imagine not having a voice. I have been working for years to get a system that works for Mia. "But when she grabbed :prose, "I want Play-Doh." "Play-Doh" "I want Play-Doh." "Play-Doh!" "I want Play-Doh." "I want Play-Doh. I like your sentence." The reason why we're doing what we're doing, is because we want to democratize voice for millions of people. What we do with the EEG is, we take the data that comes from your brain waves, to have :prose speak a phrase out loud. Liz is now able to think, and :prose speaks on her behalf. "Alright keep smiling, let's get a good smile!" "So smile for "Yes" and "Push Away for "No."" "Yes" "Liz you just did it!" "Communication is everything for her." "I want it to impact the rest of their lives." Using brain and facial inputs, I mean, this is...this is history. And you're watching it. The world we're going to create is that every single person, regardless of your ability, is going to be able to communicate. "I love you" It's just going to happen.
