 hey youtube Alan pan here in this video I'm going to make a cerebro helmet that's going to let me remote control other people like I said in my last video we need something that can be remotely controlled that can apply a voltage across a load in either direction and that can do so while limiting the current between 1.5 and 5 milliamps through a human head first things that come to mind obviously Arduino and radio modules something like like a ZigBee if you're older like me or what one of those NRF modules or the esp8266 those are the hot new things I'm just going to use a remote-control toy car got this one from Toys R Us about $13 wasn't the cheapest one but I like the way the controller looked I like how I'm goofy it is turning a remote-control car into a remote-control person and depending on where you are and where you source your parts an RC car might actually just be cheaper now at first glance it seems like a remote-control car is already perfect you just cut the wires lean to the motors you stick electrodes on them and put them behind your ears and you're good to go right well there's a couple of problems the first one is that the remote-control car doesn't have any kind of current limiting so you don't really know how much current you're going to be putting through your own head and something like electrodes attached to skin across a skull has a varying load the resistance is going to change from person to person and even within the same person over time your skin tends to get more conductive as you pass current through it so we need a way to keep that steady we want to make sure that we can keep a constant current regardless of the load and regardless of the environmental changes second of all this particular RC car got six six volts for double-a batteries so that's the most amount of voltage that can come out of the wires into the motors for most people that's actually not enough voltage to even generate at least 1.5 mil amps skin resistance and an electrode resistance is pretty high so it's sort of like it's probably not going to be enough power and if it does provide enough power it's probably going to be too much power and we won't be able to control it so RC card on its own is not going to be quite good enough for our needs so let's take a look at this circuit this is the cerebro circuit there are three distinct sections here the current limiter the H bridge and the RC car receiver board the power supply here is to four triple-a battery packs so each supply six volts four twelve twelve volts up here so here's the board from the RC car it's just a black box all we care about is that it needs six volts and that it has two outputs which are labeled a and B these are the wires that originally powered the steering motor they connect to here a and B for clarity up here we have the current source or current limiter that's connected to 12 volts these are PNP transistors and there's a nice feedback loop here when enough current flows through this resistor such that the voltage drop here becomes 0.65 volts this transistor begins to turn on which raises the voltage of this node here which will start to turn this transistor off so the voltage drop across this resistor will never exceed about 0.65 volts with a hut with a 220 ohm resistor that means that about a flow of 3 milliamp is all that's ever going to come down this way won't ever be more than three milliamps this circuit here is an H bridge and allows us to switch the polarity of this 3 milliamps of current that's coming down here so I use two logic level and channel MOSFETs and two logic level p-channel MOSFETs MOSFETs are sort of overkill since we're controlling milliwatts of power but I wanted this little voltage drop as possible the MOSFETs are controlled by these two NPN transistors here which are connected to the a and B outputs of the RC card guts and B are normally low so these transistors are off and these two end channel MOSFETs are on but these Pichu MOSFETs are off so no current is flowing through our load here when left is pushed on the remote a goes high and B remains low so when a goes higher this transistor turns on and brings the voltage of this node here down to ground so when that happens here on this left side this N channel MOSFET turn off and this key channel MOSFET will turn on so if we've got this on and this on and this often this off we've got a path to ground for the current to flow of this way through the load there we go if right is toggled on the remote control the opposite happens a goes low and B goes high when B goes high this transistor turns on the node here drops down to ground this end channel MOSFET turns off this P channel MOSFET turns on on the a-site here this N channel MOSFET is on and this p channel MOSFET is off so we've got these two MOSFETs on and the load then the current then flows through the load this way so if you try this on your own check the neutral voltage of a and B some cars may keep a and B high rather than low when the steering motor isn't being used also make sure that everything here shares the same ground everything here should be connected to the same electrical ground otherwise the circuit will misbehave or won't work at all here are the guts of our RC car I just want to point out this is like a weird drifter type car so the transmission is all in these two wheels that can turn to steer and provide power these wheels are actually just like plastic doohickeys I just kind of there for decoration so this is a really neat gearbox and I'm definitely going to hold onto this for like a weird future robotics platform another thing I want to point out is how nice this circuit board is a lot of times with these cheap RC cars you have no labels you just have wires soldered directly to the board and those will snap in no time if you don't get hot glue on them but this guys actually got jst connectors that are labeled we can see forward backwards here this is for left-right this is for the battery and so that means we can just pull these out and we've got a like a platform here ready to go a robotics platform just stick an Arduino on top or whatever and we've also got our nice remote control module here and we can just plug in our own power supply and we can put in our own outputs for steering to hopefully steer some people around alright I'm all wired up got my H bridge here got current source here the outputs of our remote-control car right over here I've got the controller in my own hands I've got two electrodes I'm on mastoid processes everything goes well I'll pass no more than three milliamps through my head and stimulate my vestibular system so I'm going to turn the car on and turn the controller on and toggling the joystick left or right should make me feel like I need to lean left or right okay uh galvanic vestibular stimulation three two one oh let's try to the right oh wow sings a little bit I think we're pretty good right that's that's what no more than three mill hams right huh okay 2.2 okay perfect that's perfect um zapped in my brain with electricity okay let's slaughter this up here it is the helmet is a children's t-ball helmet I cut the sides out here and spray paint the whole thing silver check out the description below to see the instructables that I follow to make this helmet the electronics box in the back is just screwed in with these two screws down here it's not it's not even screwed up up here you can see the electronics are exposed this is this is just a sloppy job I was trying to get this helmet done pretty quick another thing that's that's kind of sloppy is if you look at the back here there's two switches for the two separate power pack so that's also kind of like non-ideal not elegant these cables are just a regular solid core wire with silver bead slipped over them I'm actually really pleased with this effect they ended alligator clips to clip onto the electrodes the chinstrap here is a dog collar that I got from the dollar store and cut in the two pieces and screwed the ends into these screw holes here these are actually really convenient I think they're there so that you can add like a face plate or something now over here this is the headband that I use to keep the electrodes in place behind the ears this is like one of those headphone headbands that normally has speakers in here so you can wear these when you go to sleep pretty sure any regular headband would do just fine though these electrodes have copper sheets in them and they're held in place by these up plastic rectangles I just cut off of some packaging the sponges are regular cellulose sponges cut to about one by two inches and soaked in 100 millimole per liter saline solution or about point six grams of salt in one cup of water if you want to see the mind control cerebral helmet in action make sure to click on the suggested link up here I think is where it is thanks for watching
