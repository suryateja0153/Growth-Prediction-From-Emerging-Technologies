 the human brain can do things that most of us think are impossible but when you really get a human being you know aiming at something with enough energy and passion even things that we think part of science fiction actually tend to happen the brain machine interface is is a paradigm that establishes a direct link real-time link between living brain tissue and artificial devices like robotic arms robotic legs and most of the time in humans that is done on a non-invasive technologies the EEG that you record from the scalp and you know that embedded in these brainstorms these electrical brainstorms you have motor commands so you use mathematical computational algorithms to extract this motor information translate it into digital signals so that that brain can directly control the movements on the robotic arm or robotic leg well when Brazil was awarded the World Cup very soon after that the Brazilian government decided they wanted something special for the opening ceremony and at that time I proposed that we did a scientific demonstration to show case to the whole world what science in particular neuroscience could do for Humanity and we got people from 25 countries to collaborate over 18 months to get a group of patients including Giuliano to train with a new piece of technology that brain control exoskeleton and at that point we work together to get Giuliano to to basically deliver the opening kickoff that symbolic kick was the opening kick of a new phase of this field there may produce a lot of technologies that will help millions of patients around the world you
