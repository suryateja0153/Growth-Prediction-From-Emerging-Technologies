 In this work, we present and evaluate #Scanners, a professionally produced, interactive film experience which adapts to the viewers physiology. Scanners was presented at FACT, a major arts venue in the UK, where viewers experienced the film inside a specially converted vintage caravan. The experience will be available to try during the CHI interactivity session, and our talk will explore the 2D design space around involuntary and conscious control and the diverse ways in which viewers experienced the film.
