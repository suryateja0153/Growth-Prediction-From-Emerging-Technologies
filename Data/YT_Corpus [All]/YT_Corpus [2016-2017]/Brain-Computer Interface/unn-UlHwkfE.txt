 thank you so I'm a neuroscientist and the neural engineer at UCSF my laboratory does both basic investigations into the way that we move it the way that we learn to move we also study some clinically relevant applications and that's what I'm going to tell you about today just briefly before I get started I'll say that the work that I'm gonna tell you about is the work of many many people who are currently in my lab and the previously been in my lab and of course we couldn't do the work without support mostly from federal funding sources so what I want to tell you about today is what we refer to as brain machine interfaces and when I say that what I mean is devices that allow us to communicate directly with the brain and there are other things that you could do when you're communicating with the brain for example you could read information out of the brain like for example you could read out movements that I want to make or speech that I intend to make or even memories and those could be used to help patients who for whom these functions are impaired you might also want to write information into the brain for example if you have a blind subject you could restore vision or hearing or something like that and then further along I mean these are things that we're working on now and they're a little bit further along you could imagine if you can read up and you can write in and there were parts that were broken you could sort of jump over them you could read out the things that use those parts and write into the to the things that those parts protect to and so this is the sort of thing that people are thinking about quite a bit these days and I'm going to tell you about one particular aspect of that which is brain machine interfaces for the restoration of motor function and there are a number of patient populations for whom this would be helpful for example upper limb amputees spinal cord injury and other forms of paralysis such as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease MS or other populations so there's a fairly large population of people for whom the ability to move has been lost and if there was some way to regain that ability it would be fantastic and even if it meant for example giving a brain implant so what look like well what does it thank you what is it that you can get out of having a device like this well you have to interact with something in the external world right that's the point is that you want your brain now to control something not through the normal means through your spinal cord you muscles your limbs your hands instead to interact directly with some external device and for example there are really beautiful new bionic limbs that have been developed mostly through the support of DARPA the Defense Advanced Research Projects administration for example this one was developed at Johns Hopkins and a similar one at Dean Kamen's group deca research and this is a real photo of this this limb that can do pretty amazing things that looked pretty dexterous you could also interface with wheelchairs and computer interfaces for example here's a picture of Stephen Hawking who speaks through a synthetic voice by communicating the computer imagine if that could just be read directly out of his brain and he could speak or he could move as he wants now these are external devices you can also imagine reanimating your own body say for example through exoskeletal devices little robot that sort of clamp to the out of your body outside your body and let you move or even through what we call functional electrical stimulation and that's where you directly stimulate either the spinal cord for the muscles to allow your own body to move and these are also things that are currently under investigation so if there were a way to get information out of the brain in a really precise and accurate way these are the sorts of things that you could get but that seems like those would be really good things so how is it that you communicate with the brain how do you get information out and mostly most of the devices that are out there these days work by communicating with the part of the brain that's called the primary motor cortex so this is a side view of a a human brain and the humans are looking this way like I am right now so this is the front of the brain this is the back of the brain visual cortex temporal lobes frontal lobes parietal cortex in this bit here the strip is the motor strip so it's the thing that sends neural incentive injections down the spinal cord and drives activation of the neurons that eventually drive the muscles so this is the thing that if you stimulate you get possible okay and because this is sort of the last stop for outgoing motor activity in the brain it seems like kind of natural place to record activity to figure out what it is that person plots to do if you can decode what's going on here during natural movement for example then you can imagine using that decode to control a robotic limb to mimic what would have been the natural movement that's yeah so how do you read our information well you have to get something in there to read information our neurons communicate with each other the chemical synapses but those chemical synapses are activated by an electrical activity so neurons basically are electrical beasts they said what we call action potentials which are waves of electrical activity down their axons and that causes information to transmit to the next neuron down and you can read out that electrical activity by putting electrodes which is just basically little wires inside the brain and then loopy nose up to an amplifier and you can get to the app and this little device here is 100 electrodes and this is the device that's currently approved for use in humans for these sorts of applications not I should say for clinical use these are all preclinical trials and so they're not that you can go to your doctor now and ask for this but there are ongoing clinical trials the small numbers of patience and these are so here's an example of a human with one of these implanted these are also the devices that we use in my laboratory as I'll show you in a bit so how did it work what did what happen is when you you have one of these so I'm gonna show you now is this is the raw electrical trace it's been it's been filtered a little bit but this is a filtered electrical trace that you would get if you put one of these in a monkey brain and actually we just back up this is a human brain this is a monkey brain but the structure is very similar so this is what you get if you stick one of these are the monkey brain and these are the trigger every time this thing goes hi we're going to trigger we're going to plot what we see you there so that buzzing sound those are action potentials those are the spikes of a neuron so we're listening to a single bit out of the brain talking to its downstream neighbors which is super cool and this is it's really cool when your physiologist you see the listeners it's just and that's the way the neurons communicate and you could imagine that if we could read this out we could decode the information from those neurons and use that to control something now the science of how that works and the algorithms and the information content networks all deeply interesting and on time to tell you about it today you guys want to know about I can tell you more later but this is the kind of thing that you can get out of that so this is from Leigh Hochberg John Donoghue and colleagues at Brown University in Mass General in Boston and this is sort of pretty much sitting there so here's a woman that has a brain stem stroke so she can't lucify tetraplegic and she has one of these devices implanted on her head and she's using that the readout of that to control this robotic limb and here she's going to take a drink from this thing which is something that she hasn't been able to do to give herself a drink in a long time and you can imagine for someone like this to be able to give herself would be highly satisfying and indeed look at that smile highly satisfied so this is truly remarkable right here's a woman can't move on her own she's moving a robotic limb to give herself a drink fantastic but it's it's not quite natural behavior right this was very slow took a long time I was able to tell you a lot well that video was playing thank you might have noticed some jumps in the video that's because I actually cut out some stuff so it actually takes even longer than that so this is remarkable and wonderful but it's not really at the level of natural movement it's not what you and I would do if we were to walk over there and pour ourselves a cup of water and drink from it so what's one what's missing what do we need to get to that level where you can go out and beat Luke Skywalker or or whatever and you know what we're out of this limb that really is natural so you might think well the problem is you know this hundred electro thing that looks pretty crude we've got millions of electrodes in her brain that's the problem we're not recording from enough electrodes and that's true the neural interfaces that we have today are really impoverished compared to what we want to do and in fact in my lab we're working on some pretty kooky ideas for how to improve those devices together I can tell you about later if you're interested but you know what neurons are still enough to get a pretty high fidelity readout so maybe that's the problem is probably more maybe the algorithms the people who developed are good enough yet but people have done a lot of work and they're pretty sophisticated so I think it's true that with better neural interfaces and better algorithms we probably can do better but I don't think that we're going to get to natural levels of control with just more engineering but something that's missing and what is it that's missing so I'm going to show you a video hopefully good so here's guy and he's trying to sit down and she's trying to get off this wheelchair and sit on the ground and if you're looking at him something's not right right and I think it all green so what do you think is wrong with him anybody want to guess what come on guess wheelchair so he's got more work I long term problems in that cerebral palsy good guests it is personal brother okay so most of you say things that look like motor disorders right clearly this guy is having trouble moving right guess what his motor systems fine there's nothing wrong with his motor system but this guy's problem is is his his sensory system he can't feel his body that's problem motor please fun but can't feel his body well it's a great documentary and it's about touching about something difference about a guy who overcame this problem and you can find it on YouTube so I recommend it but in any case so what the point of this video is that this guy can't feel his own body and that movement is perception the perception is movement if you can't feel your own body you're an awful hard time moving now what he's actually lacking is two things there's something called somatic sensation that's the general term and that includes tactile things like the ability to touch and feel what things are texture and and the warmth of touching your or your partner or something like that and then there's what we call proprioception which is the ability to know where your body is in space for example I can do this and the reason I can do that is because I know where my body parts are because I can feel them and that's a term that we mean proprioception so some medicine tation your spoken in a tactile and and proprioceptive feedback from the periphery so just to give you an idea that was a guy that problem was mostly due to lack of proprioception and here's an example of what happens if you don't have tactile feedback so this is a video hopefully we'll play sorry a woman who is going to she's been asked to simply like the match and this is a house from rolling Johansen this is a really beautiful video or maybe now this one doesn't like the point here is that she's asked to simply try to strike a match just pick up with one hand about two and striking that's a very easy thing to do and she did it seven seconds normally and then what Robin Johansen did is he put some lidocaine in her fingertips that's the stuff you get the dentist to make sure she can't through your teeth right so she can't feel her fingertips and it turns out that if you do that it's very very difficult to manipulate any small thing and with the video shows it takes for a long time to pick up the match and if you want to show you that later okay so the point of this is that somatosensory feedback is absolutely critical for an effective movement and therefore we think that a naturalistic performance with a brain machine interface will require somatosensory you know look if you better control as I told you and the other thing it will do is if you're putting on some device it may feel foreign to make you unfamiliar but if you can feel it the thinking is it will feel like it's part of you you look better ownership of that thing and then you'll want to use it alright so how can we get artificial feedback into the brain well it turns out you know this idea is kind of out there already if you have using the electrical micro stimulation to stimulate neurons to create sensations that's out there many of you probably know someone who has a device tens hundreds of thousands of people who have these devices I should know the number a cochlear implant so when a cochlear implant does this is for deaf individualism what you do is you put this little microphone down here basically the core of it is it reads into an electro which wraps around the cochlea which is the organ of the peripheral receptor organ percept and it stimulates the cochlea is stimulating the neurons in the cochlea which causes you to perceive sound how does this work why does it work it works because the cochlea here's a blow-up of it it has a very special organization some of you may know this which is that as the sound comes in which is just waves of the air right there are fluid by the time it gets inside the inner ear the frequency of oscillations in here is sort of broken down by the structure of the cochlea so that cells for example here will respond to high tones accelerators sorry to low tones to hundreds of hundreds and as we have further along the cochlea the attired he had lower lower tones at the beginning of time and at the end it's low so the cochlea has what we call a topographic organization which is that neurons in the cochlea respond in a way that breaks out by frequency there's a map of frequency of tones on the cochlear surface again a topographic organization and the reason why tomography is important is because it allows you to do what we call biomimetic stimulation which is to say that allows you to mimic natural sensory cutters if you can take a sound music or voice and break it up into sort of the intensity at different frequency bands which is like what your equalizer goes in on your computer then you can play back different amounts of frequency depending on those okay so this allows you to decompose the sound into frequency so topographic organization is critical to give you biomimetic stimulation will that work for so many centuries do that well sort of so if you look at the somatosensory cortex which to be right next to motor cortex this is the part of the brain that if you particularly your body or move your limb these cells won't respond there's this gross topographic organization which we call the homunculus so for example parts of the body use a lot of your face and your hands have a large number of cells a large number of areas involved there's this organization so that suggested there's a tough ography which means that you can create natural patterns of activation to can create preserves does it work yeah kind of does so here's an experiment from cinemates - lab in Chicago where they put some of these same things that I showed you before into the brain of a monkey in somatosensory cortex and they touch different parts of the monkey Tim and seeing when they're touching gear for example these neurons light up these are the ones would be over here in smell sensory cortex and when they touch here these neurons light up over here so there's a map on the rain it corresponds to the to the hand so that's great that means it's stimulating now use electrical stimulation here you'll feel touch here here you'll feel touch here and so on and it turns out this works and you can you can get monkeys to feel different fingertips and different intensities and you can have them compare those to natural sensation and it really works you can start getting this sense of tactile feedback that feels quite realistic so this is very exciting right so this means that maybe it's not that hard to do the test that we're trying to do but there's a problem for proprioception for knowing where your body is remember that was the problem with the guy in the wheelchair that there isn't a good typography so nearby neurons have very different behaviors and because of that because there's no topography we can't create these biomimetic patterns and so that that raises a real challenge how do you give feedback how do you tell somebody where their body is that they need in order to get precise control if you don't have that talk and it turns out this is true most of the brain now there are many areas visual auditory somatosensory then have these nice topographic maps but when you get away for what we call early sensory areas to sort of the higher-order parts of the brain there are many many parts where there just isn't good time how do you interact with these so our approaches instead of focusing on creating natural patterns of activity yes let's use the way that brain naturally learners let's focus on learning now it turns out the circuits for sensation and movement highly adaptive and this is something we've been studying for a long time in my lab and in particular the brain is very good at combining the information from multiple modalities so vision and audition is of speaking you can look at my lips you can hear me and effortlessly your brain is combining that information what the brain is really good at is picking our patterns finding things that move together in the world and using that information and we know that we've studied that lab we've modeled it in my lab and we're gonna try to harness them clean up the obvious Wow here's the trick this is work was done by Maria doubt a lot of graduate student in my lab and Joe Girardi who's now gonna take the experiment that I'm talking about now and we would really forward to to real brain machine innovates so the idea is what if we write something into the brain that's entirely novel entirely non bio matter but it changes moment by moment with vision and we know the brain is good at picking out these sorts of correlations could it use it to learn to interpret this novel signal so here's the experiment we have a monkey's do kind of a weird test they were asked to zero out this flow so they're sitting here at the starting point and these dots are moving in this direction so now they no need to move in that direction and they get close but not quite to the dots are slow and if this sort of weird docked feedback scheme and I can explain why we did that later but thinking good at this this is pretty easy and we have them do this for a while and what the dots are telling them at every moment the difference between where they are now and where they need to be so it's sort of like telling them the error of where they are now where they need how are they moving the big dog so they're just moving their limb they're just sitting at a table and moving and that little big dot is following the fingertip around thank you alright so they're just sitting there doing this with their hands and then what we're going to do is they get good at this and then what we're going to do is we're going to stay like your somatosensory cortex and we're to do it with a pattern Omega T about the details of it but it's a complex pattern that involves and Electro's B P P P buzzing along stimulating local neurons nearby and it's something that they've never experienced before it should feel very strange but moment by moment it correlates with what they see so here's a typical thing during training the monkeys are doing these same kinds of movements I showed you before so they're supposed to be reaching over here and the dots are telling them what to do but that is this weird pattern means stimulate each is agreeing markers is a single stimulus that drives a bunch of neurons nearby one electrode and they're eight of these electrodes and they're coated by direction because it really matter what is that the feeling some crazy pattern and they're doing this over and over and over again now this thing it first just goes weird and actually impairs the performance so they do better when this isn't there then when and there's just vision and when they're both but very quickly after about a day they learn to ignore this and they do a vision and then of the wait could have stayed they could have ignored this forever but I've already told you that the brain loves patterns it loves to put things together and so it can't help but learn what this means because if kuvira's moment by moment with this until after a few weeks after several weeks the monkeys can now make reaching movements without any vision at all they're sitting in a dark room but they know what to do because they can feel where that target is by the stimulation pattern that we're putting into their su medicine and now that they're combining these two signals in a very natural way in this kind of optimal and adaptive way that we know people do with normal sensory cues okay so what do you make models so we call this a learning based approach somatosensory feedback for sensory feedback generally the idea is that you learn through these structures of correlations of senses in the world again what we're very good at is picking out patterns picking out correlations can't help them do that and this is the brain that the signals generated a very natural way it works together with vision to reduce errors which is what normal our normal ability to combine cues does and just to mention that these experiments were motivated by computational models which is very important component of what we do in my lab and trying to think about how to harness the brains of power this is a new benchmark for writing tasks for elevate development information into the brain multiple electrodes two-dimensional signal distance direction and real-time feedback so it's a pretty exciting result that we're very pleased about and the other thing about it is that it's kind of the first it's one of the first attempts to try to think about how do you work with brain areas how do you communicate with brain areas that don't have a simple natural easy to understand topography like the cochlea or like the tactile parts a somatosensory cortex and we think that learning how to do that is something that will generalize quite well to a lot of problems going forward and thinking about interfacing communicating
