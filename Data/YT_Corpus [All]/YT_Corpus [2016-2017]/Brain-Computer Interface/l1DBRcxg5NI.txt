 hi my name is khan deep singh and my topic was brain computer interfaces or bc is the bio ethical question that i chose to examine what should be c is the a strongly recommended form of treatment for people who suffer from neuromuscular diseases this is a significant issue because almost 6 million people suffer through some form of neuromuscular diseases and bc is profit provide a clear and positive solution for this problem however VCS also have some interesting ethical issues that are associated with them and thus they provide a great ethical debate some important vocabulary to note is BCI's and BM is a BCI is the same thing as a VMI however VMI is just named differently a brain machine interface they both use a hardware and software component to enable communication between the brain and I computer invasive and external are the two main types of BC is invasive is an implant they require surgery and external is a cap like device that is put on the user's head a neuromuscular disease it is it is a disorder that affects the nerves that control your volunteering muscles and complete locked-in syndrome is a neuromuscular disease in which the patient is under complete paralysis however I will refer to see complete locked-in syndrome as CL is now that we have examined some of the vocabulary for BCS let us look at some of the ethical harms privacy is one of them many people see privacy as a key right that is upheld by the Constitution however according to the journal of neurological physical therapy bc eyes do not have put this right this is because a third party must be required in order to ensure that the BCI is working properly as a result this party can see this third party can see levels of stress hormonal levels and mental health owner ability of the specific person who's wearing the BCI another ethical issue is the psychological harms in 2014 glennon rights and frontier that the failure of using a BCI is deeply harmful to the user's mental health this is deeply troubling because according to the neurology journal the success rate of bc is with CL is patience is really low now that we have seen some of the ethical harms let's look at some of the benefits one of these benefits is prosthetic control ECI has enable the user to gain control over a robotic arm a set of studies from the university of pittsburgh user monkey to controller pci which enabled that monkey to control a robotic arm with a great deal of success this has an enormous levels of application for those who wish to regain their motor skills but are going through paralysis another clear benefit is communication bc i can also enable communication for people who are going through paralysis and they can do this without the need for going through a real rehabilitation process this allows patients to answer yes and no questions just by imagining a cursor moving to the corresponding side of yes and note overall a BCI is very positive and it has some clear positive benefits that can be applicable in the near future however as of today we should not strongly recommend the use of bc is for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases and this is because of two main reasons the first reason is because they are extremely harmful on an ethical basis the privacy and the psychological harms completely outweigh the potential for having a communication as well as prosthetic limbs however this does not completely outweigh the possibility of those happening and for those reasons a BCI is a completely possible and possibly one of the most important ways of solving the problem of neuromuscular diseases the next ten seconds will be used to show the works reference slide
