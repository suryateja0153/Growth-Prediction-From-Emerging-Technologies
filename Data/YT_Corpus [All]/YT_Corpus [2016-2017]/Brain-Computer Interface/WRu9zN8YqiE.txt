 well imagine being able to spell words and move things with just your brain it sounds impossible but thanks to developing technology it might not be so far away tv6 and Nick Brennan has a story precisely it looks like a strange hat but it's actually a communication device for your brain it's called a brain-computer interface or BCI and it interprets your brain signals as a computer would interpret a keyboards actions meaning you don't have to move a muscle to communicate and this produces signals that you can detect with an electrode cap outside the head or different kinds of sensors and therefore people can communicate without moving for example you could move a cursor to the left or to the right just by thinking about that the technology has been in development for decades and it's still not perfect but bc eyes have been recently known to help stroke in coma patients establish a basic form of contact where they were previously thought unresponsive it has a variety of uses not limited to spelling out words with the mind people have used it to operate a robotic arm they've used it to operate a prosthetic limb they've used to brain computer interface to operate electrical stimulation to move muscles that are paralyzed g-tech or gügor technologies which develops BCI technology handle a demonstration of said tech today at NMU use University Center the university psychology department is helping to develop a new form of bc i related technology that utilizes touch with patients that cannot see a possible alternative is to use the tactile sense to be able to control a brain-computer interface so here we have a neck device that deliver tactile summation around the neck to find out more about BCI technology visit our website upper michigan source com dick Brennan TV 6 News Marquette
