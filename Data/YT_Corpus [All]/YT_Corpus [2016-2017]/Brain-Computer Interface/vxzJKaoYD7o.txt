 paralyzed patients can have big difficulties communicating brain computer interfaces can be their only means of communication they allow control without movement but typically require 10 seconds per character and our arrow prom researchers at the Dondre Center for cognition post a scientific breakthrough based on so-called broadband visual flicker allowing for much faster and more accurate control here we straight our patient wearing an EEG headset can type a letter by focusing attention on a character in a matrix when there is an occasional mistake it is easily corrected by selecting backspace the technique is so robust that it can deal with movement and electrical interference it can work without connection between stimulus presentation and signal detection and it requires no or minimal calibration the typed output can for instance be inserted in an email I'll be fat into a speech synthesizer may our project take off the generality of the technique opens the door to a broad range of devices and applications the route to market is supported by the STW takeoff program for information on using this technology please contact us
