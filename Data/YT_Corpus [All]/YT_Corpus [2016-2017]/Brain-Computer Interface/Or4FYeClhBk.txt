 hello and welcome to the third and final day of ICC 2016 we've had the morning keynotes just now and here joining me is Harry L gotten from interaction and her company is famous for the muse ahead had wearable device for measuring brain waves and she's going to talk more about that at the moment first of all aerial welcome could he tell us about brain computer interfaces and which ones you think are most suitable for for consumer electronic devices sure so in this morning's presentation I walked you through a variety of different kinds of brain computer interfaces you can do b/ci in an MRI machine that's obviously a large investment there you're looking at hemodynamic response and being able to trigger an outcome based on change in blood flow to a particular region most famous example is that of Technology an example called brain pong in 2004 we're two people in an MRI could literally play pong with their brains there's a smaller version of it called functional near-infrared sketch spectroscopy f nears that does very local brain flower varied flow Barre local hemodynamic response and there you're looking at something that works for very slow bc i interactions because the time course of the blood oxygen response is about five seconds you can also do stimulation technology so transcranial direct current stimulation is something that we're beginning to see actually even from a consumer perspective and then transcranial magnetic stimulation is firmly a clinical application but we are seeing actually quite good results in the depressions for yours for example probably the most robust and ready for the market is using EEG non-invasive sensors that track your brain wave activity to do brain computer interface okay brilliant thanks could you tell us what the difference is between active and passive brain computer interface so there's two different things that we can refer to as active and passive one is the sensors so an active EG sensor versus a passive EG sensor is one that's able to have sort of electrical amplification on the signal so that you get better brain state in my talk today the difference between active and passive that I was referring to as the kind of brain computer interface that you're doing so an active one is one which you are controlling the system you are actively trying to control an output and we're at the stage where these kinds of controls are still quite basic there is a new concept that came up in 2010 by Thurston's andrew at all around the passive BCI a BCI that just tracks you as you go and then makes its own decisions so that it can start to change an environment around you for examples the example that I gave was the responsive room that we built and they are the elements of the room respond to your brain state so as you read the lights get brighter as you relax the music dims as you fall asleep the blinds closed so the brain computer interface is the the the way in which the some intelligent system can understand your mood and adapt the world around you to to fit your needs without you having to manually do this yourself yep so that's actually where we're hopefully going with a sphere of brain computer interface so control is is one way of interacting the technology but it's it's really quite basic it's really quite binary what we're seeing is technologies that understand us and respond to us and adapt and build relationship to us you know your phone for example as you tilt your hand the screen turns off so that you don't accidentally dial it with your cheek you know these are these are small gestures that we make that allow technology to understand us which allows a change in technology which allows us to then exhibit another behavior and interact with it more effectively I understand so the BCI devices are just another way of getting this of getting data that could be used in to make our lives richer now it's time for a commercial break Aereo could you please tell us about the muse what is it share well this is news the brain sensing headband it is a clinical grade eg in this beautiful slim little form factor it's four channels two sensors frontal two sensors temporal tracks brain activity in real time and then sends that to your smartphone or your tablet and then from there a wide variety of different kinds of interactions are available right now this is one a lot of prizes and we're here at CES well in Las Vegas we just had the consumer electronics show some people walking around the show floor might have been tempted to look at wearable devices and say they're gimmicky or they're somehow they're super Fleur so there are just a something you might get for Christmas and use for a week but you gave some examples of how the muezzin and other devices can actually have serious that ways of improving our lives that go beyond gimmicky and you use meditation as an example could you say a few words about that sure so Medicaid meditation is one of the applications that we've built with muse and it's actually the main commercial use case right now and meditation has been demonstrated in over a thousand published studies to be able to improve your attention decrease your stress manage your pain potentially even stave off cancer and on and on and on so with muse what we do is we make the process of meditation easy so meditation is all of these benefits but most people never access them because meditation seems strange it's hard to do and you don't know what's going on in your mind so Muse makes that process simple by giving you real-time feedback on your meditation you can actually hear what your brain sounds like so when you're thinking distracted ruminating you hear it is windy and as it guides you to state of clear focused attention it quiets those winds so it really takes the guesswork out of meditation and makes the process actionable and tangible you get real time feedback throughout and then at the end you're actually able to see your brain data see what your brain was doing at every moment in that experience and where do I see that see what my brain is doing on your smartphone or tablet it's just a very simple interaction between you and your device okay that sounds excellent what is the magic in muse why is it so special compared with what are the technical innovations that make it unique there are a lot of technical innovations in muse so one is the proprietary sensors these are around conductive ink sensors I'm connected rubber there's the form factor getting something into this slim easy-to-use form factor that fits on every single head with great signal quality with dry sense or literally clinical great signal quality compared to a gel electrode system in a dry system that you can buy to best buy for 299 and then really important is our algorithms so we've been able to create algorithms that very sensitively and finally know when you're in focused attention versus mind wandering and then we're able to look at large-scale population data to constantly improve those algorithms and experiences and then whenever you make a piece of technology in order for that technology to really work to really have consumer update you have to have it paired with the human it has to naturally fit into your human life so we've created a device that both you know what fits very comfortably on the head feels very natural to wear as well as a user interface and experience that gives value to your life so it's not just a bunch of technology sitting there it's a thing that you do every day that literally makes your life better and that you feel and you understand and you continue to engage in brilliant so let me conclude by thanking you again Ariel for a great keynote today and for taking the time to answer my questions my pleasure anytime thanks for watching you
