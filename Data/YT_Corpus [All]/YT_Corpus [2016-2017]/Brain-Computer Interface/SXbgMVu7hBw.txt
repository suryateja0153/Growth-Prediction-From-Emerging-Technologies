 Kercher's can use new technologies to tap into these signals to control machines the understanding of how the brain controls movement led to the development of devices and algorithms that can be implemented on a computer that you know recognize these patterns in the activity imagine moving their hand and we use the computer to extract the patterns that correspond to imagine a movement of the hand compared to for example not imagining and just resting from there the computer can distinguish the two types of brain activity imagining movement and not imagining movement then use that information to enable hand control by mental activity given the right kinds of information and the right kinds of devices that are useful for the animal or for the human the brain can start to adapt with practice the brain can learn to do something that's never done before like control a prosthetic it's not familiar with but the key is to understand how these neural networks communicate between the brain and the body if you're able to understand the brain better Danny also able to build better brain computer interfaces because then they can use those signals that are responsible for different kinds of movements as rao continues to collaborate with engineers neuroscientist and neurosurgeons to develop more b/ci devices he is working toward a future where the brain and technology come together seamlessly
