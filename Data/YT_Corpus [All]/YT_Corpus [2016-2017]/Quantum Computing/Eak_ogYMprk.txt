 I wasn't asked you to explain quantum computing but when do you expect Canada's eyes'll mission to begin again and are we not doing anything in the interim while we prepare okay very simply normal computers work by don't interrupt me when you walk out of here you will know more now some of you will know far less about quantum computing but most of you normal computers work either there's power going through a wire or not it's one or a zero they're binary systems what quantum states allow for is much more complex information to be encoded into a single bit regular computer bit is either a 1 or 0 on or off a quantum state could be much more complex than that because as we know things can be both particle and wave at the same times and the uncertainty around quantum states allows us to encode more information into a much smaller computer so that's what's exciting about quantum computing and that's so don't get me going on this or we'll be here all day trust me uh
