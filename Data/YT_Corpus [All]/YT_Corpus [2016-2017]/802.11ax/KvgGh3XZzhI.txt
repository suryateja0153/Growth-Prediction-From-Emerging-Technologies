 hello and welcome to tech deals really quick review AC 450 megabit per second Wi-Fi wireless adapter this is a $20 adapter that will let you add modern fast AC Wi-Fi to a laptop or desktop of your choice why should you care about this why does this matter well first of all not all computers come with Wi-Fi now most laptops do in most laptops in the past many years do many desktops don't come with Wi-Fi or they come with an old slow Wi-Fi in addition AC is relatively new what does AC mean ac it actually says AC up here you probably can't see it is just a new standard of Wi-Fi that was released in the very recent past and if you have a machine that's more than about a year old or so you probably don't have AC in it you have n AC is three times faster than the old end version of Wi-Fi is much faster transfer rates but it's not just transfer rate AC has another benefit it works at two different frequencies n Wi-Fi and all the wi-fi's that came before it work at 2.4 gigahertz frequency spectrum that radio frequency spectrum is clogged and congested everything from cordless phones to personal radios and all kinds of things in between are clogging up that spectrum AC Wi-Fi will work at 2.4 gigahertz but it also will work at 5 gigahertz which is far less congested now the reason it works at both is because 5 gigahertz doesn't work everywhere because the signal is more easily blocked by walls ceilings concrete etc so routers wireless access points are adjustable they can be set to either 2 point 4 or 5 or both note you must have an AC wireless access point your router or your cable modem or whatever you use to get access to the Internet has to be AC capable for this to do any good compared to the old end standard so if your internet modem or router at home is 5 years old well that definitely doesn't Acey however if it is old your internet service provider will probably give you a free upgrade if you simply ask now if it's only a year old they might not do it but since new customers usually get one for free definitely ask for an upgrade if yours is an older unit what comes in the box it's amazingly small in the box is this that's it it is a very small nano adapter the gold part fits into the USB port only the black part very I mean if you can barely see it is the part that actually sticks out of your computer if you have a laptop stick this in the side or the back or wherever your USB port is you'll probably forget it's even there if you have a desktop front USB port back USB port maybe your monitor has USB ports try it in several locations you may find that one location or another gives you better performance results depending on the configuration of your house your desk where your computer is etc once you plug this in if you're using a modern operating systems such as witness 8 or Windows 10 it should auto detect and download and install the drivers for you if it doesn't or you're using something older there should be a inside the box there's a driver CD in here which contains drivers for various operating systems as well as 1-800 toll-free technical support if you need any help during the installation there is a quick installation guide which have actually a lot on it this is all written in one language this is in English so there's a step-by-step guide of how to set everything up if you need help this does support both PCs and Macs and I would imagine Linux as well although I can't claim to have tested it because I don't use Linux but there you go I mean it's it's a Wi-Fi adapter what more do you want if you have an older machine that is on in and you want to improve your Wi-Fi performance and you have a wireless access point to connect to that is AC Wi-Fi you may very well see three times the performance with this $20 gives you state-of-the-art Wi-Fi adapter a link to this will be in the video description below just below this video go to Amazon and if if this is helpful to you go by it it's a wonderful little device like this video if you like it don't if you don't remember to subscribe to my channel the big red button down there if you are already subscribed and it's not red anymore thank you comments questions thoughts feedback suggestions those go below the video where's this helpful to you was this not helpful to you do you want more little mini reviews like this or less you've got to tell me because they can't read your mind as much as I would like to if you are interested in a performance test and a side-by-side test between this and an adapter let me know in the comments below if there is demand for it I would be happy to do a side-by-side comparison and do a performance test but I only want to do that if you guys actually care and want to see it so like the video if you want to see it make a comment below if you do and I will otherwise I won't thank you very much for watching and I will see you in the next video
