 this one I was surprised did some research and trying to find out what type of clients are available we can't go away to a solution we only have wave to aps obviously we need wave to client because they're you know if you you could use wave one clients with ways to a piece but you wouldn't get nearly the you know the benefits if you were to do that so on the right hand side you see a bunch of ways to cry so this is just a subset they're actually way more I just pick you know some of them that I thought it would be interesting but there really are a lot more way to 'pliance available or soon to be available and as we eat by you from the new tablets and new laptops over the next two years while next year two years we're going to be you know we're going to buy wave to clients at least here in the US and a lot of other regions as well so we will have a lot of wave to clients available or actually in our pockets or we're carrying them in our backpacks in a very near future which is really good because as we talk about multimedia Miami will see how important wave true clients are all right bitrate
