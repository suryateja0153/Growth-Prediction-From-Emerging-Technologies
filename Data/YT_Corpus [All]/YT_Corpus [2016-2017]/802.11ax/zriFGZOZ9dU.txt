 hi everyone I'm Sean O'Kane with chip estimate TV where we bring you the latest trends and information and software IP and semiconductor design in the EDA industry where with keysight at design con 2016 here in santa clara and they're the leading electronic measurement company specific to wireless modular and software solutions and key site has a HP and Agilent legacy deliver solutions in wireless communications aerospace along with defense and the semi conductor markets now with me today is Todd Cutler the general manager of keysight electronic and engineering software for ETA thank you so much for taking a little bit of time with us great to be here thanks her environment so key site has announced that they're going to have an increased focus on industries and applications in 2016 and what is that exactly me yeah that's a good question Sean so four years from starting with HP days we've really made the best technology of individual products right great measurement products great design products what our customers are asking is for those to move a level up instead of just buying the products the bag of bits they really like us to offer more complete solutions to specific problems that they have so what we've done is really shifted the organization of the company around specific industry segments right so we can identify really closely with those customers to come up with the solutions that they're looking for right right so for this year at design con what is the foot so what's the focus area along a theme of solutions right one of the new things people are struggling with is the USB type-c connector right just one of the things we're showing here is how do you make those measurements how do you do the design of those types of systems the second thing is a lot of work and signal integrity and power integrity factor just in a meeting where we're looking at 56 gigabit neo type type transmissions some people looking even twice that right the really tough problems are dealing with the third area is you know the existing standards keep moving ddr4 standards removing PCI Express two engines are moving you have the latest solutions that are keeping up with the technology there and last but certainly not least is Pam for against we keep trying to go to higher and higher bit rates in one of the best ways to go to multi-level signaling we have some unique solutions here today we think that will really help customers solve those problems well you talked about you know some you know what you've unveiled here today simulation tests and compliance solutions and that helps engineers with the particular design challenges that they have and that's that's very important so but one of the trends that we're seeing is in in high speed additional design is it increased a more accurate simulation especially for the integrity and power can you explain a little bit what key site is and how you're helping your customers sure addresses sure that's a really good question so we've been helping customers with high speed design for quite some time right in the simulation and modeling these high-speed interfaces what we notice really quite a few years ago as these bit rates go up not only they going up but the boards are getting more and more complex right right and so we can anticipate it that's going to happen although it's coming even faster than you might and then we have people with 18 inch boards they have 32 layers with thousands of components right 10,000 components on that one board and having analyzed these really large high speed designs so we sponsored durand sponsored some rd work starting almost three years ago it really do some breakthrough technology to be able to handle these very large boards with high accuracy very high speed and we're very happy today in fact we're announcing introducing a new product as I pro the ipro that are able to address those specific problems so we think we're really people this high level of accuracy that they need in order to meet the very rigorous standards that they're coming to so very excited got a lot of interest in it here on the floor and looking to to help customers solve those problems well another great year for key sided design con here in Santa Clara so thank you very much for taking a little bit of time with us for Todd Cutler my name is Sean o king will see you next time on chip estimate TV thanks Sean thank you thanks
