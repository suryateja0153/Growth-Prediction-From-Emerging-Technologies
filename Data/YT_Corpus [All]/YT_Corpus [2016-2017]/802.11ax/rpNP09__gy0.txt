 so today's well basically day one of the kitchen remodel can't really see the kitchen I'll show it to you a little later on what looks like today we are going to do is drop this ceiling we have a really ugly um well fluorescent light set up in our kitchen it's got a drop ceiling it's about six inches lower than the rest of the ceiling in the house so I need to drop it so i can see whether or not i can raise it ironically enough there's just no way i can check so i figure i'll just drop the whole ceiling and since I have to run wires anyway then make it easier overall so tape everything up I'll basically have to prevent some dust and we'll start demoing so here's hoping alright so I took down that drywall a bear hell if that in place because the light today I'll look at using those until I'd drop that looks like the only you sure I'm gonna have is this duck which i think i can rewrite well i know i'm going to have to be re-routed higher so i think that should be ok there but other than that i think i should be able to drop all that framing it'll be good and yeah not much electric running through it so it's not too bad good stuff
