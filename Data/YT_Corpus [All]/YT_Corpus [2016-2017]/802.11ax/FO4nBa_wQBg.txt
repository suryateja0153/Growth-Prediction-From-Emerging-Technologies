 Wi-Fi technology a viable potential solution to the global wireless spectrum shortage the contents of my presentation introduction key terms like pie components how I fireworks presentation by dr. Hall's Wi-Fi versus wife on advantages and disadvantages the progress and global interest Internet in developing countries the possible areas of usage challenges of life I ethical evaluation and conclusion whether you're connecting to wireless internet at a coffee shop or competing for bandwidth and online gaming you've undoubtedly faced sluggish speeds due to multiple devices connected to the same network since the digital age the Internet has become an essential need but due to heavy traffic airwaves continue to be congested fortunately for us German physicists professor Harold hog developed a solution turned data through elimination sending data to an LED light bulb equivalently as an infrared remote control yet more powerful his invention titled delighted can generate data rates quicker than 10 megabits per second surpassing your average broadband connection unit does it taste the future where they are from smartphones tablets and laptops are transmitted by a Wi-Fi connection with firm security establishment no x equals no data Wi-Fi is the transmission of data through an LED light pole a speedy a cheap wireless communication system it is the ultimate version of Wi-Fi at the heart of this technology is a new generation of high brightness light-emitting diodes this is Harold house very simply if the LED is on we transmit for one it's off you transmitted 0 they can be switched on it off very quickly which gives nice opportunities for transmitted data at the high-rent institute of tech moving scientists have achieved their rates at high speeds of over 500 megabytes per second using an average white head pretty bold in Las Vegas this technology will showcase at the 2012 consumer electronics expo using a pair of casio smartphones to exchange data using light emitted from both scream a distance of ten meters in october 2011 the Wi-Fi consortium was created for undisclosed technology companies to promote high-speed optical wireless systems while eliminating the usage of the radio wireless spectrum as they exploit a different section of the electromagnetic spectrum the consortium believes like I can achieve when in 10 megabits per second allowing HD filter download under 30 interestingly this technology began during the 1990s in countries such as Germany Korea and Japan where it was discovered LEDs can be modified to transmit information since LEDs have been retrofitted to transmit data VLC has become faster safer and cheaper than Wi-Fi soon like fidelity will eradicate costly mobile radio mouse which costs is range from 200 thousand dollars at $250,000 oz invention illustrates how these signals are returned with information embedded within the illumination the light bulb sending data of body changes with light intensity at ultra high rates from 100 million cycles per second here are some key terms to know Wi-Fi is a bi-directional high speed and fully networked wireless communication technology similar to Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is a substitute of optical wireless communications and can be a complement to radio frequency communication for replacement in context of data broadcasting an LED is a light emitting diode and is a semiconductor device that emits visible light when an electric current passes through it the benefits of LEDs compared with incandescent and fluorescent lights include a low power requirement in which most types can be operated with a battery high efficiency where most of the power supply to an LED or ired is converted into radiation in the desired form with minimal heat production and a long life when properly installed an LED or ired can function for decades light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum which ranges from radio waves to gamma rays electromagnetic radiation waves as their name suggests are fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields which can transport energy from one location to another visible light is not inherently different from the other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum with the exception that the human eye can detect visible waves optical wireless system refers to the combined use of two technologies conventional radio frequency wireless and optical fiber for telecommunication long ranged links are provided by optical fiber also known as fiber optic cables and links from the long-range endpoints to end-users are accomplished by RF wireless the electromagnetic spectrum is comprised of seven different forms of energy the radio waves microwaves infrared waves visible light ultraviolet rays x-rays gamma rays gbps means gigabits per second Wi-Fi is a networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed internet and network connections a common misconception is that the term Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity however this is not the case Wi-Fi is simply a trademark phrase that means oee 802 point 11 X a data stream is an uninterruptible Ong sequence of data such as an audio and video data files VLC or visible light communication is elimination and communication a data communications medium which uses visible light between 400 and 800 terahertz VLC is a subset of optical wireless communications technologies the technology uses fluorescent lamps such as ordinary lamps not special communication devices that transmit signals at ten kilobits or LEDs for up to five hundred megabits low rate data transmissions at one and two kilometers were demonstrated Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances using short wavelengths ultra high frequency radio waves in the industrial scientific medical radio band from 2.4 to 2.45 gigahertz from fixed and mobile devices and building personal area networks irda the main reason for using RDA have been wireless data transfer over the last one meter reading point-and-shoot principles dustin has been implemented in portable devices such as mobile telephones laptops cameras printers medical devices and the main characteristics of this kind of bias optical communication is physically secure data transfer line of sight and very low bit error rate that makes it very efficient finally network topology is the arrangement of the various elements links nodes of a computer network essentially it is the topological structure of a network and many to be depicted physically or logically physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network including the device location and cable installation while logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network regardless of its physical design the life I product consists of four primary sub assemblies the RF power amplifier circuit printed circuit board the bulb and enclosure the RF power amplifier circuit has a radio frequency signal generated by the solid state PA and is guided into an electric feel about the bulb the PCB or printed circuit board controls the electrical inputs and outputs of the land and houses the microcontroller use to manage different land functions the bulb is the high concentration of energy in the electric field vaporizes the contents of the bulb to a plasma state at the bulb Center this control plasma generates an intense source of light and finally the enclosure is where all of these sub assemblies are contained in an aluminum enclosure so how does life I work well there from the internet and the local network is used to modulate the intensity of the LED light source in a way undetectable to the human eye the photo detector picks up the signal which is converted back into a data stream and sent to the client the client can communicate through its own LED output or over the existing network it sends a single data stream of bits at the rate of ten thousand to two thousand bits per second now replace the IR LED with a light box containing a large LED array this system is capable of sending thousands of such streams at a very fast rate in this block diagram the two key processes are modulation and demodulation these processes help convert light source to data this is an example of how life I works with an office setting you can see that LED lights are powering different computing devices for example the computer cell phone laptop printer Wallace thermostat and the clock haber to the visible light spectrum go to more controls you all know the remote controls have an infrared LED basically switch on the LED and widgets off you switch it off and it creates a simple low speed data stream in ten thousand bits per second twenty thousand bits per second not usable for youtube video what we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can further or replace the remote control a light bulb we transmit with our technology not only a single day the stream we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel at even higher speeds and the technology we have developed it's called sim OFDM and spatial modulation these are the only technical terms I'm not going into details but this is how we enables that light source to transmit the data you will say okay it is nice it's a slight created in 10 minutes but not only that what we've done is we have also developed a demonstrator and I'm showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator and what we have here is a no ordinary desk lamp we fitted in an LED light bulb worth three US dollar put it in our signal processing technology and then what we have tears a little hole and the light goes red home there's a receiver the receiver will convert these little subtle changes in the amplitude that we create their into an electrical signal and the signal is then converted back to a high speed data stream in the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smartphones and not only integrate a photo detector here but maybe use the camera inside so what happens when I switch on that light as you would expect is a light a desk lamp you could put your book Denis thinkin could read it's illuminating at this pace but at the same time you see this video coming up here and there's a video high-definition video that is transmitted to let light beam your critical you say hahaha this is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here but let me once again sit on believe it is the slide that transmits this I definition video this bit stream and if you look at the light it is illuminating as you would expect you don't notice with the human eye you don't notice the subtle of changes in the amplitude that we impress on to this lightbulb it's serving the purpose of illumination but at the same time we are able to transmit to stage the next few slides show the differences between a lifeline and Wi-Fi in this slide you will see that life I beats all other existing technologies life I achieved at least 10 gigabits per second base fee on this second table you will notice another main advantage of using life on in addition to a very high data speed and other metric shown on this table Wi-Fi is cheaper on this third table you will see the direct comparison between Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi the greater difference between the two life I is green technology here are 10 advantages of life on higher speeds compared to life by proper security it has a 10,000 full bandwidth very high peak data rates simple usage and applications useful and electromagnetic sensitive areas readily available internet via led the avoidance of radio frequency spectrum crunch enhanced energy efficiency by combining data communication and elimination complete elimination of health concerns and net neutrality it can be achieved these are the five disadvantages of Wi-Fi technology compatibility in direct line of sight the presence of light level efficiency with regular bulbs interference and the high installation cost of the VLC system as you can see life I has become a worldwide interest for instance Mexico developed a VLC system attaining speeds of 10 gigabits per second China made a breakthrough in life I tech with speeds of 50 gigabits per second likewise in Beijing the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology VLC system attain similar speeds in Korea applicants have utilized life I to replace wires and medical treatment they implemented blue red and green LEDs to apply parallel transmissions through different channels this allowed physicians to conduct eg tests brainwave study and ECG tests electric activity of the heart as well Disney has committed resources and expenses toward the approach of VLC in Shanghai professor China used basic items to successfully create her own life I'm after her success she was funded by food on university and the Shanghai government spending an estimate of five hundred thousand dollars on research and construction hence the drawbacks this includes our project being not available for portability as well as for proper accuracy in the transmission of frequencies still it is impressive feat to learn that many scientists such as yourself are in the progress to facilitate life I granted and light file will benefit all it is still a working progress but presents opportunities for global connectivity here is a special advantage as life I as a medium for net neutrality now global mobile data traffic grew sixty-nine percent in 2014 and continues to grow yearly mobile video traffic exceeded fifty percent of total mobile data traffic for the first time in twenty twelve about half a billion mobile devices and connections were added in 2014 and then Saviour over one hundred and eighty nine million laptops on the mobile network each generating 3.2 times more traffic in the average smartphone in the mobile network there 2019 the amount of mobile devices will exceed the Earth's population and about 75% of global mobile data will be videos you so how can life i salt net neutrality well for those of you who don't know net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equal not discriminating or charging differentially by User Content site platform application type of attached equipment and modes of communication unfortunately internet service providers tredici and companies separately even conjuring 2 types of broadband speed lanes the fast lane and the slowly in order to access the fast lane eyes peas compel companies for example YouTube to pay premium costs granting high speed streaming of HD video and content towards users but if YouTube did not pay on time eyes piece like streaming and downloads and still further notice the second lane namely the slow lane is essentially for everyone unable to afford the fast lane so if you decide to launch a YouTube competitor but are unable to afford the premium costs already you're at a disadvantage consumers and companies alike are against the ISPs to tear usage and the facade of the fast lane it is unfair for the rich to obtain fast internet while the form-change slowing even companies refused to pay high costs for high-speed the area because they believe it ought to be standard for all with life eyes very high peak data rates and speed providing internet access to many is not an issue it provides enhanced energy efficiency by combining data communication and illumination and provides complete elimination of health concerns remember it's light energy and not radio frequency hence net neutrality will not be an issue but net neutrality has become a fairy tale thanks to the US Federal Communication Commission the FCC introduced a legislative proposal that grants ISPs official action to try companies for faster lanes President Obama affirmed that fast lanes ought to be bad he addressed the FCC to ban paid prioritization and classify ISPs as public utilities but the internet affects everyone for Internet in developing countries net neutrality means everything to take Evelyn a 40 year old woman reciting the Philippines who like us access to social media on a daily basis she plans offense with family and friends reads the news or enables the Waze app when driving around Metro Manila but unlike us in the West who can pay for unlimited data or access Wi-Fi hotspots Evelyn's greatest challenge is ciphering which apt to open and just for how long the Internet has become a human necessity but despite America's issue between the fast lane and the slow lane developing countries continue to run on weak and insufficient internet Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has addressed the issue via internet org a partnership between companies such as Facebook and Samsung in which they are working together to make the Internet and the different parts of it more efficient for everyone to have access to it for a really affordable price or free is the real goal for basic internet services while Asia beats the global average on broadband speeds there is still a huge difference between the accepted and the neglected Singapore is advanced on an average speed of 100 18.8 megabits per second but the Philippines remains at a staggering 3.6 megabits per second even worse Singapore's broadband speeds have doubled in the past year while the speed in the Philippines only inched up a meter six percent as of may 2015 the Philippines has the second slowest average download speed among 22 Asian countries ranking 176 out of 200 two countries worldwide the Philippines also has some of the most expensive internet connection in the world spending 18 dot 19 cents per megabits compared to an average of five dollars and 21 cents per megabit worldwide it's a similar story in Asia cellular speeds china seller speeds zooms at an average of twenty seven point six while Vietnam struggles with data rates of 1.9 megabits essentially the blank white screen there are eight possible areas for Wi-Fi usage for example when traveling by air radio frequency is compromised the airplanes instruments with life I ensures a safe flight with access to your mobile devices for power plants they require a fast interconnected data systems to monitor demands grid integrity and nuclear plants core temperature the savings from proper monitoring at a single power plant get up to hundreds of thousands of dollars I thought it could offer safe abundant connectivity for all areas of these sensitive locations not only with this save money related to currently implementing solutions but the drama power minus own reserves could be lessened if they haven't yet converted to LED lighting for undersea research pilots can operate underwater ROV s with a power supply encased within hail unfortunately ROV struggle with insufficient tether length or become stuck in gaps if the wires were cut and the place for life such as a submerged high-powered land it would be convenient for undersea explorations the headlamps may be used as communications processing data autonomously and referring findings periodically back to the surface and for underground communications southern stations and tunnels are common dead zones for most emergency comms but with an LED light augmented with Wi-Fi you're on lung in the medical field Wi-Fi hospitals interfere with monitoring equipment Wi-Fi is the antithesis and the replacement of Wi-Fi with Wi-Fi at institutions any companies will offer clear bandwidth and quicker data streams at traffic signals we can use Wi-Fi to communicate with LED lights exponentially reducing car accidents but despite the possibilities Wi-Fi faces several challenges light cannot pass through objects Wi-Fi requires a line-of-sight interference from external light sources such as sunlight normal bulbs opaque materials will cause interruption in the path of communication the high installation cost of the VLC systems and how the receiving device will travel it back to the transmitter but every challenge requires an ethical evaluation as I mentioned before Wi-Fi technology will provide a greener clean and bright application of i.t potential great use in different areas enhanced energy efficiency by combining data communication and determination and enabling the Internet of Things will resolve net neutrality so far they're more than 14 billion LED light bulbs worldwide and compared to the radio wave spectrum visible light is 10,000 times available wouldn't it be nice to use that one as I've mentioned about congested radio waves net neutrality or insufficient Internet in developing countries I believe life I will facilitate these tasks tackling efficiency safety capacity and availability my perspective of this topic is ethical most specifically ineffective ultram Peterson Air believe that all beings are equal and with today's resources we ought to utilize and employ ourselves and eating the under privileged as well the manual can agree on the augmentation of life I because implemented the imagination of possibilities for course usage are simply amazing I believe and so will come that the greater good is done for the majority of the world you in conclusion Wi-Fi is upcoming and growing technology with an auspicious future as visible light surrounds us this propitious resource can facilitate task in his fields unattainable with Wi-Fi and other technologies the possibilities are incalculable once patented every bulb will be utilized as a Wi-Fi hotspot and proceed toward a cleaner greener safer and brighter future you
