 we'll begin hi all I am pretty from University of Texas at Austin I'm going to present my paper on investigating the 1180 standard four millimeter wave automotive radar the co-authors of the paper are Nuria princess from University de Vigo Spain and Robert Heath from University of Texas at Austin first of all let's get into an application of automotive radar such as automatic cruise control in this application there is a host vehicle and there is a target vehicle the host vehicle is trying to keep a constant time gap from the target vehicle so what it does is it estimates the range and velocity of the target vehicle using signals such as conventional radar wave form linear chirp signals however they are not standardized these systems are generally available in luxury cars and cost around eleven hundred or five fifteen hundred dollars so automotive radars are expensive and they are propriety that is not standardized then let's go to the vehicular communication systems which are based on standards like DSRC which operates at 5.9 gigahertz with seventy-five megahertz of pan they can also be applied for applications like forward collision warning and cooperative automatic cruise control however the standard has low data rate because of the low bandwidth we can use millimeter wave communication for high data rate however it's yet not adopted so communication alone is not enough for traveler safety application that's why we propose to use joint millimeter wave vehicular communication and radar this will allow to increase penetration rate for vehicular communication which has yet not widespread efficient spectrum usage because we are using the same spectrum for both radar and communication low-cost due to single waveform and hardware increased performance enabled by sharing of information from radar to communication and communication to radar the joy system can now be built on the existing millimeter-wave standard such as 80 2.11 ad and it will have high data rate because of high bandwidth now there have been some work on integrated communication radars such that the core domain like DSS's in this you have secure and high resolution ranging but you have imperfect auto correlations then there are some approaches in frequency domain where you use OFDM signals they have better correlation than the core domain however they're complex and they suffer from high peak to average ratio and they have complex signal processing so then there is another approach that is time domain duplex which is easy to implement but inefficient use of time because when you are sending radar you are doing nothing for communication then there is another approach which is standardized approach where we use standards like 802.11 P and in this approach the authors have shown that they can do automotive radar application however it suffers from poor accuracy and resolution which is required in automatic cruise control applications thus it motivates us to have a standard based radar solution for which is based on the communication now the contribution of our paper is that we are leveraging the 80 2.11 ad millimeter wave wireless LAN standard for joint communication and radar which has never been done before it motivates a common standard at the millimeter wave fan as I suggested earlier that radar doesn't have any standard for automotive radar operation like communication and since currently the luxury cars only have automotive radars which is quite costly and the blue line chips are cheaper having a joint solar system based on the 1180 chip may lower the cost in this paper we have exploited the preamble and pilots of 11 ad and we have also leveraged the existing WLAN receiver algorithms to achieve a good radar performance so to understand more about the paper first we will go through some introduction of single carrier frame of 11 ad in 11 ad there is a preamble and header the some data blocks and optionals of feed we have leveraged this preamble which has a very good goal a structure which can be exploited for radar operation what do I mean by that is it has a very good ambiguity function which is a function of delay and Doppler shift it shows how the received signal performs when it is being distorted by delay and Doppler shift after much filtering so we see that at zero Doppler shift there is no side looks that means it has it will have no ambiguity and this is an ideal autocorrelation function for radars hence this can be used these Koller sequences that we find in the channel estimation sequence and the goal is to we find in the short training field can be used for radar purpose let us go to the system model of our paper here we assume that there are two cars this car as I said like host and this is the target car it's sending a signal okay which will be based on 11 ad then it reflects back the radar echo from car b reflects bar to car a and then that received signal is given by Y of K then you have beamforming receive beam forming and transmitted beam forming which is being done here and we assume that these antennas are close to each other so that they see the point target which is representing this car B as a single location and they are pointing to the car in front without blockage that means we assume that it is more line-of-sight type transmission we assume the channel is assumed to be constant in a core and processing interval and we assume that this car is within the B width of the car a based on these assumptions we can simplify this as a complex constant factor which is based on the radar cross-section of car B and the path loss distance factor it has a delay because of the round-trip time because a Doppler shift because car B is moving related to car a some phase noise and noise additive white Gaussian noise now this beauty of this paper is we have used already existing the Blue Line receiver algorithms to estimate the radar parameters that means this time delay which communication tries to find through frame synchronization or time synchronization techniques and the stopler shift which tries to find using frequency offset estimation technique can be used to find the range and the velocity of the car ahead how let us go further into the detail so first we have to detect the vehicle this vehicle detection can be done using typical WLAN frame detection or synchronization techniques what we do is we have a correlation with or between the received signals which are separated from nd distance this is like a training sequences and the length of the training sequences and T since our goal is sequence is 128 lengths we choose ante as 128 then we see that the Platteview of the our joint is actually above some threshold ideally it should be 1 however because of noise and system impairments it is not exactly 1 so we choose a threshold to get robustness but it is less than 1 we have choosiness 0.05 for demonstration purpose and we have choosen that it is above that threshold for 256 samples for accuracy then this is a okay lets us talk about the results so we see that above my -2 DB we can achieve high probability of accuracy then we go for range estimation there are different ways of range estimation that we have come up the time synchronization can be done as a course or as fine that is if we use a preamble star detection as the range estimation technique then we can have a coarse range estimation that is what is this curve and we have done it in two way one is a constant threshold as I talked about and when is an adaptive threshold based on the statistics of the received signal however when we use fine synchronization techniques like which is based on STF correlation with Golay sequences that is we are correlating the received signal with the coalesce sequence or when we take symbol boundary detection which is also based between the like the STF and see if there is in between a boundary - GA 1:28 then we use a phase inversion technique to get the symbol boundary detection we get this green curve and because of the method - we get this red curve we see that we can achieve NMAC of 2.8 one micro which is the desired range accuracy that is it comes out as point one meter accuracy using the WLAN estimation techniques for only a single frame then let's go to velocity estimation then we can do velocity estimation using the existing Doppler frequency shift estimation techniques this can be applied on two things first the start training field of the SC 5 strain and second on the pilots we see that when we use it on the short training field we get an accuracy which is not that good however when we applied into the pilots we achieved the desired accuracy much faster than the one with a short training field however using both the methods we achieve the point one meter per second accuracy which correspond to normalized mean square error of two point seven eight micro at high SNR so yes we can achieve the desired accuracy of 0.1 meter per second using eleven ad however not a close RR we achieve it at high SNR using a single frame so we conclude that we can achieve the desired range accuracy of 0.1 meter with a high probability of detection using a single frame of 11 ad indeed we can achieve accuracy more than the existing automotive radar because of the high bandwidth available in 11 ad the velocity estimation technique achieves accuracy of 0.1 meter per second at high SNR low SNR some more techniques can be devised to achieve it which we do in the future work and then we extend the framework for a more complex channel we incorporate v2v channel models at the millimeter wave bond for the future work so for example we in this paper we have worked on this particular model when you in the car is totally in this beam however if this blue car comes within this beam then how would you detect the red card this can be a future problem where you can have complex channel thank you okay I'm done okay yeah
