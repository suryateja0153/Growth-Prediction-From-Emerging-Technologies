 here's a question what's the difference between B G and n routers the biggest differences are speed and range B G and n refer to wireless standards with B being the oldest and n being the newest B routers are the slowest and they have the least range and they aren't made anymore so don't worry too much about seeing one in a store for most consumers the choice will be between Wireless G and M G routers send data faster and reach farther than B routers as long as your internet service and all your device is supported a G router could get you speeds up to 54 megabits per second jumping up to an end router will usually cost more but it will get you more speed and range plus it'll get you a higher frequency G routers are stuck on 2.4 gigahertz which means they're using the same frequency as many home appliances and routers can use the 5 gigahertz band so things like your microwave are less likely to interrupt the signal and routers are some of the fastest you'll encounter at an electronics store they offer speeds up to 300 megabits per second again as long as your internet and devices support it if you want more router tips or to see past week's questions visit the a snoozy topics page at news EECOM slash topics slash ask - newsy if you have a question to ask newsy leave a comment on social media tweet at us with the hashtag ask newsy or just send us an email for newsy i'm lia Becerra
