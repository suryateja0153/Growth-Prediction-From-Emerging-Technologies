 good morning everybody thank you for taking the time to be with us today I will be sharing with you things about connectivity what's happening in connectivity what's the next generation of comic really looking like by way of introduction I manage the connectivity business at Qualcomm we are one of the six businesses in the semiconductor division of Qualcomm and in connectivity we have obviously Wi-Fi bluetooth FM GPS dsl and small cells basically right so we do all the products that would be in the phones for Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS we do all the products that are in the access point drivers that you find in retail shops in your workplaces enterprises in some of the devices that you would be getting from your service corners like Comcast if you are from outside this country but it's all calm or the places small cells as well I think what comes of franchise on the cellular side give you know arrival to none basically and we take some of those assets and build small cells as well and so it's a fantastic platform also coming out of this business unit I don't know what Kim's you guys like to operate on but i'm free with whatever works for you in terms of Q&A where we want to ask questions please go ahead so what defines the next generation of collector is the big question in my opinion it is effectively the experience and what does that mean connectivity everywhere seamless ubiquitous connectivity needs to be self continuing I don't need to worry about as a consumer what am I connected to my connect it would be really am I connected over Wi-Fi am I connected or some other technology now none of that from a consumer point of view so the connectivity needs to be contextually aware connectivity needs to make its own decision based on the application that is traversing the medium or the waters netbook whether it's a video application it's not sufficient or ble to support then you move to Wi-Fi and if it is Wi-Fi cannot support the traditional Wi-Fi you move to 11 86 degrees and that doesn't work because the range is not there you've moved to back to Wi-Fi so and so forth right connectivity needs to be contextual yoga not just being a point technology and networking wireless technology and ultimately deliver a user experience that makes sense right a user experience that makes sense to an average consumer you know let's use my mom as the average consumer she doesn't need to worry about SSID is passphrases she doesn't need to worry about or I don't need to get a confuse her when I go to her place and say mom what's your you know security warrior basically I want to use your access point need to take all of that out of her hand the complexity of the network right and make it a seamless experience where she would get the video like she would want to be delivering experiencing the video she would get the music like she would want to experience the music she would get the moist calls like someone should get the data like she want to and let connectivity deliver that seamless contextually aware unified experiencing in a couple of wards of fully immersive consumer experience right that is what the connectivity used to do on a going-forward basis how do we get there you know right is the next big question there's a lot of things in college it is a background right you have a personal network where you have variable devices you have some medical devices you know you have music players that all cannot use the wireless personal area network then you have a wife and approach which is the local acts of networks where you are kind of using that technology and that implementation or kind of your campus to the entire fall and then you have the wider network where you hold from within your home within the mall with in your enterprise outside and you remain connected right that's a wireless plan and so that's largely a cellular network so you have these three networks if I have two bucket eyes even in a higher level of abstraction there are three pockets of networks but they all have to work together the world is changed there's a lot of IOT devices coming in our homes there's a lot of IOT device is going to be around us there's going to be a lot of scaling needed to be done there's a lot of battery life experience need to be managed you've got to kind of manage them in a way that makes sense for that end application you don't need a know very low power band implementation going into a dishwasher or a washer dryer because it's war connected with the power but you may need you know a coin cell battery implementation with wireless connectivity msn that it's going to sit on your windowpane because of the security that you want around that room or that place for that area of the home and you would want that security sensor to move from one place to another place you know and be alive all the time when you absolutely need it and not have to worry about the battery that we want that security sensor to work on that battery coin cells battery coins about it for months if not years right and so all that is going to require a certain level of implementation on connectivity varied implementation spectrum is what I've tried to share with you that I see going for but one thing I just noticed with this slide of a lot of the previous talk was on aggregation or cooperation between the LAN LAN level like I'm on fire LA and all that is there anything similar to take it down to the pan level and does that make any sense it means it seems like handing it off to that could make a lot of sense yeah we're like little skill so today we can roam between ble and Wi-Fi Bluetooth and Wi-Fi we can have it at a central point and make really clients talk to a Wi-Fi network and why sell water right so those technologies are there in our portfolio and implementations in fact this year we owe may not be getting ahead of my presentation but this year we will be seeing product that address that experience coming out towards the end of the year from not sore bottom we are ready it's just our customers that they have to go to the design cycle implementation plan cycle and test like that so I wouldn't be surprised by Christmas you will have to lose parts of it I would you know you asked a good question we'll cover some of those some of the answers it's a certain amount of technical support based on the next now I'm even thinking you go further than that which is too based on what you said you can go from you can hand off between pan and land and if be the next to land and when can hand off there's a to b to c but i'm thinking directly pan to win it can't happen right if if you want to skip the land basically and you can bring in the grand inside over here generally what happens is you know the coverage is not that great but if you can supplement the land with a small cell implementation and effectively is exactly what you are saying so there's ways you can do that in operators on trying all those implementations today ok any other questions we believe Wi-Fi is evolving and warming very fast not in terms of just the adoption and what's happening in the world of Wi-Fi right every device that i can think of you will have some or other fungal wife but it's going to be more wife and then you can imagine and you see you know pictorially when you get to know some of the slide but what is Wi-Fi doing right today we are shipping wave to let me see the industry is adopting wave to spec of a toward 11ac the biggest feature in this pack the biggest two features in these this pack of Bay the wave to us back our multi user manual technologies will talk a little bit about it and what are the big benefits of multi-agent manual and 160 miles channelization right kind of you know looking at it as 160 mega channelization probably it is doubling of the channels it's kind of widening your lanes on the freeway to be twice the size so you can go a lot faster right or you can pack a lot more in the wider Lane than just you know having one wake of pour demain basically so there's a lot happening in wave 211 AC or come absolutely you know let the industry in this implementation and delivery it's an industry standard implementation but quantum was first to come in the marketplace and drive this across the entire ecosystem then you come closer that's 1180 no Qualcomm you know through its velocity acquisition you know broaden the unlicensed play into 60 th spectrum 11 8802 1180 you are now looking at multi gigabit per second wireless performance replacing the wired iOS I mean a lot of the times where you have these big files in your phones and you want to upload you use your cellular network or you use your Wi-Fi it takes forever and so what happens more often than not then you pick up a USB cable and try to connect to your phone and connect to the no pc a lot of the times you have a set an apple pc in a samsung phone they don't talk about there's not a single USB cable that works extremely well right because the connector are different it's a challenge we won't take this out of the consumer experience this wiring experience we want to play stacked with wireless connectivity that is better than what you would get with USB cables right multi lipid per second wireless connectivity to 1180 seamless IO implementation in input-output implementation at gigabit rates and something that we think will deliver a lot more than just what why replacement experience that is coming to plug and you will see in a couple of slides and what we have done in that technology in dimension and then I talked about ble we talk about bleh lot more for power reasons and short-range reasons that makes a lot of sense and then there's a new technology that's brewing called 11 h which is a little bit longer range its lesser power it's less a bit rate difference frequency spectrum so you can see you have 2.4 gigahertz 60d goods you have 2.45 giggle juice you know sub gigahertz implementation all these frequency radio technologies are going to be there in products one or other products in one or other radio form or if not all right you will have to deal with this complexity to deliver the final experience that the consumer is going to come to expect right and I just want to kind of give you a complete view of what these technologies can do from the key consumer oriented dimensions what is the capacity of the link through the water technology and the discussion what is the coverage how much range you get what does it do to battery lock right if you look at ble you know you can get days and months with ble right it's very very close vicinity basically short range it's you know one to two hundred fifty one megabit to 250 kilo bits kind of a bit data rate 1180 you are looking at multi gigabit per second right about four or five gigabits per second it's largely in grow in room the battery life experience you can expect from a cell phone is like pull the experience very similar to 11ac but it is lesser in terms of capacity but gives you the range of the entire homes of the entire enterprise right and then 11 eh gives you the range of you know coverage for the campus right that otherwise you know AC already could not get you and the battery life experiences months if not years right so but the data rate is a lot lower so here you have all these frequency spectrums all these technologies having the need to kind of deliver having the need to work together to deliver the ultimate uber consumer experience and so implementations are going to be key going forward point solutions will kind of not deliver that experience you need to have a solution that delivers all these radio technologies working in harmony making decisions on their own being contextually aware of what the application need is what the network of air you know capacity range battery life experience needs are right all these things have to be you know understood by the solution and you know having one point solution who's not going to be the answer it so effectively deter the experience question is it the thought then that LTE narrowband would handle the macro area coverage and then 11 aah would be the campus-wide yeah no power okay and then when they work together they should work together tamerica take the same picture and kind of put in the context of a home or a campus or enterprise you can see I in the room you would have ple you will be streaming of using 1186 agree guards or 4k video we're talking to your speakers you will be streaming music in your speakers it could be in your study room and you could be using Wi-Fi or your computers you could be in your you know bedroom and you could be watching or Wi-Fi things on your tablet and you could be having appliances you know talking over Wi-Fi to your network and having the ability like things like garage door openers things like washer dryer and then you could be sitting in your backyard or you could have a geofence right for your pets all those things could use longer a technologies like 11 age right so what is multi is your mobile I think I talked about it earlier in a slide deck company to buy more is a way of introducing the optimality on the bandwidth consumption that's there in the network infrastructure today the network infrastructure is time division multiplexed by the clients and as a result what happens is the full capacity of the access point if every time slice is not utilized multi-user mode changes the game this technology maximizes the usage of the or the capacity of the access point every time slice and so as a result in that particular time size that the access point it's got four stream implementation you got three other clients that are one by one instead of using for sims in time one time to time three or time for right in time one itself all for clients or three clients could be serviced by that access point improves the capacity on the access point makes the access point more available as a result you can prove the capacity of the link by thirty percent with multi-user mimo technology that's there in today's product what it also inherited does is because it gets going fast gets done faster goes to sleep sooner than the traditional 11ac very one implementation and as a result what you get is a better battery life experience you're better life is preserved dramatically right so there's range benefits capacity benefits and a battery life experience benefits here with multi remind you know and you know it's meaningless to talk about the chips and technologies unless you know they are supported by your customers right 2015 is when we launch multi-level this is a sample of products at our shipping and product shipping with multi jemima Wi-Fi in pebble multi-user mode is going to be the defacto technology that's going to be in products going forward because of the inherent benefits of multi my way you have brand name companies from handset to home networking products to you know enterprise products to you know service Reuters all launching multis are my parts netgear using qualcomm chipset 7800 are 7800 is a rather than netgear launched at CES uses qua comes way to 11ac technology and it was designated as a best CS innovation a product basically at CES 2016 right so you know a lot of goodness in the products lot of goodness in the wide adoption of the product and how broad the ecosystem has been for multi survival very quickly versus the prior watches of technologies well I'll try to show you you know how multisim have all looks right this is not something that Qualcomm did but you know single research group tested single-user MIMO which is the first generation of Cologne AC with multi survival which is the way to 11 AC in download it you know a video file in a 3,000 square foot home in a bay bay location right in San Jose area using the one by one Simmons accuser Klein and one by one multiplied and you can see the difference in the video performance right how fast how the streaming experience changes as a result of having all those are mine ok nothing happening here I mean cut people blocked out because time dog fouling ok so what is the 11 ad on its fishing gears another form of Wi-Fi as part of you know the Wi-Fi franchise basically 60 gig ours is a new spectrum 1180 is the 60 gigahertz technology it does you know it lends itself to being you know very easy to implement from a user experience part of a technology that ultimately replaces wired connectivity for fine transfers and gets you similar if not more capacity as a wired connection right up to four and a half cube is per second you know also is by nature of the physics and how the technology is in that frequency spectrum it gives you the ability to kind of design small antenna elements and so for the thumbnail size you could pack in 32 antenna right and helps you direct the being a lot more than you would with the traditional 11ac ecology right so in a phone you could have 30 to bed 30 32 element implementation antenna element antenna element implementation a small factor for factor basically gives you high density connections with very little interference because of the narrower beams it's got a high capacity and as a result again the same philosophy as I've discovered it in other technologies it uses the radio very quickly for the same capacity file and gets done a lot sooner than other technologies and as a result you have a significantly improved battery life experience five times lesser power is consumed for big 1180 1180 versus 11ac and you know I go back to all the other two slides that I share with you has the ability to roam between various frequency spectrum for example if I am sitting in this room and I have the experience of kind of using 11 AED but I walk away from this room I may lose the connection or 1180 but with Qualcomm's implementation of fast session transfer I would be transferred into 11 and see if it gives me a broader range coverage so as a consumer you know I have a seamless experience as I move from one radio frequency to another radio frequency I don't lose the connection that same technology to deal with the short range of 62 minutes good things for the process yeah the same thing it's a fast session transfer works on 60 gig and we can roam between 60 gig and Wi-Fi at the short range too if for some reason being network is congested or they're not able to get the same through poor capacity that you want right and again like with everything else at Qualcomm we just don't announce products unless our customers are committed to the program and here at CES we announced multiple customers with our 11 ad in their products right again this is an ecosystem play we just didn't stop it kind of building a smartphone we kind of brought a robbery so that every smartphone would talk to around and we also brought in a PC of OEM that would have pcs that would have 60 gigs so dissemble a fuel ADV a smartphone and Chinese smartphone maker as implemented 60 gig in their products they also have a talking are designed that ultimately kind of takes makes the television 60 gig cable television and so as a result between the phone and the television you could have seamless coming communication obviously tp-link supports AC as well as 1118 there are ours acer supports 11 ad as well as they see in their some of their pcs a su salts announced with Qualcomm there are a couple of other Japanese router makers that have already announced there are a few other us OEMs that are working on 11 ad in the robbers and we should expect them sometime in the next couple of quarters also you know intel is also shipping 11 ad in their product right Wi-Fi alliance is not going to be ready to do in an operative test for a few months from now right and so as all come as being a technology leader and the one that's going to be caring for the experience that we deliver to our consumers we draw the partnership with intel to be interoperable with intel and for community solutions right what that means is you bring a dell pc that today adopts intel 60 gig with a Qualcomm phone 60 gig form you should be able to seamlessly transfer files between the two products welcome absolutely as based on our portfolio connect to your theory is the connectivity who's also supporting 1180 entails but more point solution-based never got on connectivity yeah did you say you'll do this with others as well yeah more than happy to support in our every psybeam is another tips of the large that would be in are all private to their more on the base station sign yeah ok we're not done with Wi-Fi Yeah right you look at our homes today this is just the snapshot of the living room right my friend your television to your wife and your speakers your Wi-Fi in your hand you have probably some other things that are hanging off the wall that have Wi-Fi your access point laptops tablets for this is just in the family room right and you just kind of see what's happening in the kitchen area you've knocked today in your kitchens I think very quickly in your kitchens when you upgrade your plants you see you know you're cooking ranges with Wi-Fi you'll see your microwave with Wi-Fi your you know water faucets with Wi-Fi you may have a television screen in your kitchen basically you may have some other devices I have seen you know toasters with Wi-Fi I've seen you know almonds with Wi-Fi and the purpose of that other one is not only just to alarm you then your food is ready just in case you're not in the kitchen but is also to coach you how to you know go through a recipe instead of having to worry about hey what should I be doing next right in front of you the other one's going to tell you thankfully because the other ones connected to the clouds gonna tell you hey no time to turn the PISA I on the other side cuz it's not done well stuff like that right so those are the aspects that you can expect right and think about the productivity think about things that you can do as a result right and so this is what you see happening in the kitchen I mean this I mean I can kind of this is the family room you this is the kitchen rogue you I can see the backyard changing with all kinds of connectivity right I think I can go on and on but why does the water faucet need Wi-Fi ah the quantity of water right you need to be notified right as soon as there is change in the quality of water we don't care no sometimes in this country and believe me i think you know these are just samples and people are kind of working on all kinds of application lightbulbs into I fine right just imagine you're not being at home and you having a pet right and you coming home a little later then you would not really want to basically and there's nobody to turn the light on if there's Wi-Fi and your light bombs right security of the whole right lot of goodness a lot of goodness the point here also is not just you your neighbors too right you can look at the building it's loaded with all kinds of connectivity and it's not just your building it's your neighboring building too all right and it's congested right and another good application is to Super Bowl week all right you can imagine what happens at levis you know it's one of the most modern stadiums football settings with all kinds of Wi-Fi connectivity here people are uploading not downloading right uploading the pictures and videos and clippings right going to Facebook and putting stuff on and all the service from google and youtube and all kind of stuff it is very congested in one there's not enough capacity in today's Wi-Fi to service these environments like the one that I've painted over here right in an effective manner without compromising significantly on consumer experience and that's the reason why Wi-Fi is going to be involved to a new standard chord a tool or 11 8 X okay this is going to be a newer modulation technique let's go improve the capacity by twenty five percent there's going to be a new modulation technique that's going to create a better utilization of the channel that every access point has to work with with a client and all of these things are going to and carrier has Wi-Fi a high-efficiency one and that's 11 years okay the next big thing I think coming back to the pocket I haven't talked enough about Wi-Fi coming back to the platform right there's a lot of things happening in the platform level right your access device your CPU gateway there's technologies that spectrums that's why collectively wireless connectivity there's going to be convergence of wine and wireless connectivity you can't you know wireless 11ac via vu Wi-Fi you got 60 gig PLC power line communication ethernet got broadband access coming to your home the smart gateway is going to be a homologation or a hub for all these technologies coming together so that any and every client you bring into your home network will work in your network right this is the hub this is the clearing house clearing platform for all technologies to be connected to to have your own plant connected to the internet right another way of looking at it I think from a Qualcomm point of view you know we we do well if not very well in cellular product lines we do extremely well in Wi-Fi in terms of the homes we do very well in bringing small cells to the marketplace we also have recently acquired DSL technology through the iconos communications acquisition and we're bringing gigabit or copper fujita fast technologies and we are working to build our firework platforms and working with partners who are supplying fiber based on solution to the marketplace so if you look at our take that picture of the home or the multi-dwelling apartment complex and I kind of paint it a little differently and this is what you would see when all kinds of technologies right from networking point of view all kinds of devices one that would be on your pets collar to your auto mobile by having some other phone connectivity right and the only two go together they all have certain quality of service requirements they have some expectation that a consumer would have on these devices right that you have to deliver it but same time you have to work in a way that you don't create the consumer burden or two or dealing with the complexities of the network that they are going to be working on or using or utilizing for the benefit for calm launched the uber platform software platform called Wi-Fi song song is self-organizing networks what this does is delivers the seamless user experience contextually aware immersive experience that I talked about on the first slide without having the consumer to deal with the complexities of the network would that be the new term for mesh yeah mesh is a component of Wi-Fi saw the good question mation is a component of why fights off right it's a bigger umbrella listening people get confused I mean I mean I don't know about you guys but I when I talked to my mom you know about two years back she asked what he working on I said atc and she said you were I thought he would in high tech when did you switch to that conditioning hi and I think I know kind of making the point here Wi-Fi Shawne is the answer to that she does not need to worry about it my tp2 connected to the access point what you know device in the home am I connected to is my television getting the best of the service that it should be getting because i'm watching netflix and my temperature all of that decision making is taken out of our fall out of ram and there is that intelligence in the hub in the router that Wi-Fi Shawne along with the repeater networks is making on behalf of horror basically right that is Wi-Fi song so if I cannot you know if I have to help my mom Anderson what does Wi-Fi Sean do itself configures it self manages right it self-defense and if something breaks its self heels that is what my son it takes a complexity of managing the network out of my mouth at all right my mom being the average consumer you okay you had a question sorry well I was just going to make a off-topic comments saying your air conditioning comment is nowhere near one of the guys from imagination he was getting an award from the Queen of England and she asked him what he did and he said I p ah he did not understand what he just said that's a good that's a good one ok so like with everything else at qualcomm when we bring a new technology we have customers supporting the acceptance of the technology and embracing the technology Wi-Fi song was announced by our customers at CES right and one of them demonstrated in a big way wife I saw that was dealing and they won the best CES innovation award for the demonstration of the Wi-Fi saw in there dealing right was fantastic in many other customers regular brand new router makers like tp-link a sous linksys they all have announced support for Wi-Fi song if not in their products now in parts that are going to be launched this year if I have to summarize right various point technologies that Qualcomm you know it has delivered multi-user MIMO 1180 gigabit quality 0 fast over copper you know powerline unplug lte-advanced LT an unlicensed band Wi-Fi start more importantly only these point technologies which are great for the network in the experience welcomes bringing all this together that converge manner in a platform that ultimately delivers one experience through that implementation of time we are all about delivering that one experience to the average consumer and not having the consumer to be burdened with dealing with point technologies right thank you any questions when you talk about Wi-Fi in the home what do you think about thread and all join and maybe zigbee Z all those other ones where do they do they all come together so I think it's a very good question so I anticipate multiple wireless connectivity technologies to be coming in the home thread is little bit above the physical in the Macklin it's a layer that sits on top and supports multiple radio technologies underneath it zigbee is one of them I expect you know the hubs of the future the router hubs of the future support multiple technologies as being the clearing house or working with all clients that will bring in different types of so that consumer doesn't have to think about when you got and Wi-Fi song would effectively make those intelligent decisions if you have kind of an echo cobbler where would you connect to what would technology you use to connect as well how is the congestion in the network right is the congestion and network conducive to Wi-Fi or ble to be the network of choice for that particular moment in time for that particular application all those decisions will be made by Wi-Fi song could you elaborate ourselves depending dedication yeah I think yourself defending is clearly i think you know preventing things that you would not want to be having the network like access right having temper control having the ability to kind of manage what gets access one time having the ability to head off you know if you bring in a repeater for example into the network how does a repeater have a secure connection main juice right so bring the repeater close to the Reverend we cannot handshakes a factory authenticates self to be on the network answer now entire network is secure versus you know your security is usually as good as your weakest link and you have cannot set up there you don't have any biggest night I think that's the best way to go about doing it so that's the self dependent imagine so it is cus toughest that but it's dedicated devices and not having you know for a good the average consumer you cannot worry about
