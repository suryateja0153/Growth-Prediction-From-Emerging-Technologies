 and so our next speaker is Chris France from ulta devices and you're going to hear all about these wonderful solar panels these guys make they're actually making him here and are you guys a menlo park or sunnyvale the factory is very impressive I did not know that you guys were making or growing the solar panels here in California I thought they were expensive before but then when I found out that they were being made here I'm like man this is a bargain anyway would you please welcome Chris France okay yeah there we go good morning everybody thank you much for your time and attention today Patrick thanks for having us and thanks for the good introduction we get altered devices has been around since 2007 we've been we've been here a couple years so you might have her to speak before Patrick's a little taller than me so we're going to talk today about harnessing the power of the Sun to extend your UAVs performance and we think the best thing you can use for that is alter devices gallium arsenide solar so going to just start with a brief overview of how solar energy works a solar energy 101 course and then talk a little more specifically about solar for uavs and are any light technology and then we're going to close up with a couple quick case studies where we have proven that Alta solar shows gives dramatic improvements in range for a wide variety of small UAVs so solar energy 101 so a solar cell technically it's called a photovoltaic and I like that word because it tells you exactly what it does you take a photon of light and you turn it into electricity so these are semi conductor devices similar to what's on a lot of roofs around here right and the material properties are going to determine how the solar performs and in what cases it's going to determine the amount of light it absorbs the voltage produced by the cell and the energy lost if you're operating in a high temperature regime and how sensitive it can be to moisture UV radiation and other parameters and one of the the key things is only certain technologies allow you to become thin flexible and lightweight and i would think most people in the room would agree that that's pretty important for the UAVs visa and the key parameter out of that is the solar as the bandgap of the solar material and what you end up having is this trade-off certain material you can absorb a lot of light but the power you get out is at a lower voltage and then other materials you get and a high band gap material you get less of the solar light but you get more power per electron that comes out and all the fancy theory that has come in shows us that the theoretical limit is right here and gallium arsenide band gap is right around the best material you can get for optimized solar performance at the surface of the earth it also works is also near the optimum as well once you're at high altitude for you abs as well and the overview in in the solar field you've got a wide variety of materials if you've if you've got solar on your roof or you drive by a large solar farm you're kind of looking in in this regime the copper indium gallium diselenide cadmium telluride and your silicon your calculators and other things that are often used indoors tend to use low efficiency material and then gallium arsenide exists up at the record setting for single Junction and this is a the technology gives us an advantage of a high energy density from a weight standpoint and from being able to capture the most amount of energy per your area and in your so your UAV applications require a handful of constraints and flexibility is of course important because you've got most of your wing surface is not perfectly flat and that rules out a lot of Technology you also need the high efficiency due to the fact you have a very limited area to generate your power and even on top of that you need a lightweight material and when you factor all those in there's really only one solution that that is viable to really give you the best gains possible and it's gallium arsenide when also looking and we're also looking at solar it's important to understand kind of what sort of energies we have available to us the benchmark in the solar industry is a thousand watts per meter squared now that is approximately the amount of energy you're going to get high noon at a latitude approximately like where we are here in California on a good summer day in the winter time that's going to drop down in the mornings and the evenings as the the light goes through more atmosphere that also drops lower some of those conditions being you're in about six hundred to a thousand if it's sunny and clear drops down to about 300 to 600 and partially cloudy and if you're in San Francisco nine months out of the year you're probably at the 100 to 300 range and in UAVs you have a lot of so this energy is in UAVs you have a lot of different constraints that you don't have to worry about in a lot of other solar including the fact that the solar plane is always moving and as it changes orientation you're going to get a slightly different amount of power planning your mission from talking to some customers can be important if you're doing a mapping mission and you map in one direction whether north-south versus east-west could change the amount of solar you get over that day also you want as much solar directly facing the Sun as possible if you've got a certain profile where you're going to be moving certain planes can be optimized to kind of have their wing surfaces pointing towards the Sun and those are things to think about and then as you go to higher altitudes where there's less atmosphere you also get a boost in the amount of power so your high altitude UAVs tend to get a little more solar irradiation than most of the small UAS is and one thing you also have to consider when dealing with this is that shading from the plane can limit the amount of power so you've got a large tail and that tail produces a shadow over the solar it could shut down part of the solar so you want to make sure when you design these things you want to minimize those impacts and on a little Morse so in solar for uavs we want to see kind of the gallium arsenide has been this benchmark material it's been heavily adopted in the satellite industry almost pretty much all solar in space is a multi-junction gallium arsenide based solar material multi-junction that crystal gallium arsenide is heavy but it is robust to the moisture highest efficiency technology and a really great temperature coefficient and so when you find that is you get away from your laboratory conditions gallium arsenide waft and perform even better than other technologies than on their data sheets and it is ideal bandgap the biggest issue is the cost the cost of gallium arsenide wafers traditionally is very very expensive the wafer alone is to approximately 200 times more expensive than a silicon wafer per area that cost is mostly driven it is slightly more expensive inherently but it is often driven by by scale the first solar cell materials in the silicon market were scrapped wafer materials that were not good enough to be turned into micro processors but still good enough to make solar so that allowed the silicon industry to have abundant material and start down of lowering costs and the other application the limitation is its rigidity and heavy weight and there's a lot of numbers behind this this is a nrel efficiency chart this is updated one to two times a year as the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado updates and test new solar material and the record efficiencies this date across the bottom I'm sorry I got cut off and the the efficiency of the solar that they've tested these are your record for Junction sells very very expensive and complicated to make triple Junction is slightly behind and dual junction and more practically for any intent purpose is almost all the solar on this chart besides this is all single Junction and the single Junction records top out here and our technology and Alta devices is right there so we are the record holder in the single Junction efficiency we also have done some dual junction work and that record is slipped away slightly but we'll see what happens on so if you need the energy density and you need flexibility this is this is really all you're going to find there our goal is to take this technology and bring it to a broad market and to do that we know we have to increase the volume and decrease the cost we have a great plan and a great technology for this and if put lots of effort into it and the key is to design our own tools we have a design custom MOCVD reactor with a focus on solar a focus on volume and a focus on efficiency so these reactors use less of the precursor material keeping costs down and they have the highest throughput in the world we have a technique known as epitaxial liftoff that allows us to grow the solar film and then remove it from the expense of substrate that allows us to reuse the wafer and a thin film has enabled it a technology that's called vote on recycling which actually allows us to have that record efficiency over a thick film gallium arsenide film and then our process has been designed to have a flexible product size so that it can fit on a small UAS a large UAS work in the sensor market or do any place that you need solar so no matter what your size is we can probably cover it in solar relatively efficiently so I wanted to talk a little about photon recycling this is a an interesting phenomenon that we didn't even actually know about when we started and we were trying to explain why we were getting even better efficiencies than we thought and we realize it came down to the fact that if you make it thin your solar material you may have to make your solar material thin and you have to make it very high quality so that there aren't any defects to lose your you're the energy that you've collected when you do that your solar cell actually works like a really good light emitter which is an interesting fact and it traps the light into the solar material so that if it remix that light it then gets reabsorbed and that's why we call it photon recycling so the better our solar cell works as an LED the better it is as a solar cell which is an interesting was something our development team found found interesting and then once you so the next things we need to think about is as far as how what do we have to worry about when we're designing the solar into the UAV or into whatever the customers product is and for those constraints we have to look at how we can get the voltage into your battery system and so we end up doing that by connecting in series and parallel as you add the matrices in series you build up to the voltage that your system needs or your power electronics and then you stitch the matrices in parallel to collect as much current as possible there's a diodes that are required to protect against leakage and shading especially if you're you have a you that intends to run in dark conditions if the solar is not working traditionally the battery would drain into the power into the panel's when they're off and that needs to be designed in to make sure you got a robust solution and then there's a little bit of electronics required so this this space over the last year these are dc-dc converters that optimize the operating point to the solar so that you're getting the most amount of energy no matter what light condition you're in it's a vital to get the most power and in the last four years this space is really really increased with a lot of electric a lot of major companies providing these solutions so that's been the biggest improvement I think that's helped us when dealing with customers over the last five years is that the technology that supports the solar has really increased and the really nice thing that UAVs don't have to worry about the storage in some ways other products do is the fact the best way of storing the electricity for when it's shady or when you need the extra power for a climb or anything of that sort is the batteries that if you're an electrically powered UAV you already have so in general we're taking our solar finding the right the right power management chip to get the energy into your batteries and power your systems and then match your solar panel voltage to that once you have it electrically once you have a plan for how to electrically connect solar you also need to worry about how is this going to be physically integrated into your craft so you need to think about flexibility and weight and often once you get to a thin-film solar solution like our any light technology most of your weight is developed is actually in the encapsulants you in to protect the solar so not only do you need a thin solar cell you need to make sure that you're getting away from metal and glass substrates or metal or glass or very thick polymer laminates in the protection or encapsulation of the material so the encapsulation retirement drive a lot of things it's going to drive the lifetime's the thicker material you put in is going to allow less moisture to come in but at the same time may also attenuate some light and in traditionally and solar we're talking rooftop we're looking for about a 25 year lifetime so that requires a very robust encapsulation no matter what technology you're using indoor appliances two years it's a lot simpler and in the UAV sphere because this is a definitely a very cutting edge and it always evolving market we're you know this standard has not really been set you know most of the customers we talk to our kind of rating the lifetime of their craft in the number of landings rather than time and as we move forward we know this is a place where we're going to want to work with our customers to to figure out what is exactly needed if you're looking at a short lifetime you know you can get away with a very very thin and lightweight material now independent of what solar you're using you can usually do that but some materials are going to be a lot more moisture sensitive your other thin films tend to be CI GS cattle or an organic those all are moisture sensitive gallium arsenide is not so we can get away with a very very thin front sheet you can survive the elements it works well and minimize your weight and then of course the the key last thing as far as material considerations is you want to fill the solar wing with as you want to fill the wing with as much solar as possible you know also in layouts and a point I forgot to put on this slide is that you also have many options for putting the solar on the wing we have customers who have used adhesives we have customers who have laid up the solar in the manufacturing process of their wings so actually embedded in the composite carbon fiber or fiberglass so that it's a robust solution and permanent to the plane and speaking of some of those customers these are two case studies I would like to highlight to close out in that we have shown dramatic to 24 x increases in endurance on several chassis so one is the arrow environment Puma which is a pretty big mainstay in forward reconnaissance in the military these are hand launched robust simple to use in the field and provide very needed surveillance for the for the soldiers that are using them so this UAS is about 160 watts of our thin film gallium arsenide fit on the wing this plane had about a two to three-hour endurance before being connected to solar and has demonstrated repeatedly over eight-hour flight times with the solar on it so when you think of that as far as what type of mission either in a military or commercial environment that that enables by going from two hours to eight hours you've opened up a lot of doors the amount of craft that you have to fly to survey an area the range in the time that you can loiter or the range in time that you can distance you can travel is dramatically increased we've been working in the last year and and this is kind of a little outdated as far as the names we were working with a customer going as a aerial Vista they now use a plane called the Cyclops see that is a composite several meter wing plane and this is actually shown here this is a sold by Asia tech drones but they were developing this this chassis for a working on an anti-poaching challenge over in Africa the Wildlife Conservation UAV challenge and we've provided 60 watts of thin-film gallium arsenide and this craft went from a six hour endurance up to a ten hour endurance on our first integration there's a couple improvements that we think we can make to this and we think this this craft could fly under the right lighting conditions for 12 hours plus so and this example is not actually we actually the solar UAS we were hoping would be here but it's actually not with solar but there's an example of the Cyclops in the booth next to us the so come find us over in the corner it is a big red three meter UAV you're not gonna be able to miss it but it's a beautiful chassis and we're very very excited about what it can do in the future so I would just like to thank everybody for listening today and open the floor for questions for whatever time we have left
