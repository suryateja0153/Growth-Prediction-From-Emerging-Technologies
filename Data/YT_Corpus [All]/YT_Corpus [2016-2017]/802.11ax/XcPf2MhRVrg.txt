 hey everybody its lon Seidman and we've got antennas sticking up from the desk and that can mean only one thing we've got a wireless router to look at we've got the new Asus AC 88 you and this is a really nice product and don't get distracted by all these antennas that they keep marketing at us because we're at a point now where the router makers are making stuff that our hardware that connects to it doesn't support so I'm not going to spend too much time talking about wireless speed we are going to test it but the reality is that this is for the most part going to perform just as well with the same amount of range that an AC wireless router did a year ago if you've got stuff in your house that eats wireless signals and the walls or whatever you're not going to get any better range out of this than you might Adam a router you bought a year ago so I think if you have an AC router that you're happy with stick with it because the speeds on the wireless side are not going to improve by buying this but there are a number of things that might especially if you have a lot of traffic going on inside of your house and that is because this has a pretty fast processor onboard a dual-core Broadcom 1.4 gigahertz processor a cortex a9 chip 512 Meg's of ddr3 RAM so it's really becoming quite a robust little server running with a pretty quick little processor with a ton of memory that can move data back and forth out of that processor very quickly and that will allow a lot of features that were going to look at to work very efficiently it's also got some other features that are rather interesting including a USB 3.0 port here in the front it's got some network attached storage features so you can plug in a hard drive and share files and serve media as well as make it work as a print server and even connect a cellular modem to it so if your internet goes down you can seamlessly switch over to a wireless modem if you have one and we'll show you how that works in a few minutes too so there's a lot of things you can do with this the print serving that it can do unfortunately is very basic so you can't have it translates to the Google Cloud Print format or anything like that but it does do very well serving basic printer functions on your network if you have an older printer you can just plug the USB into here or the USB port on the back and be able to share your printer that way but it doesn't do more than that it's not a cloud-based kind of print sharing feature on this side you've got two buttons here you've got an LED button to turn off the blinking lights here if that's annoying you you also have a Wi-Fi kill switch that if you have somebody unauthorized in your network you can just push that button in and disable all the Wi-Fi radios to knock off somebody who is not authorized to be on your network and that's a quick way to just hit the panic button short of turning the router off if you need to get somebody off of your router really quickly what I really like about this is the fact that we've got eight gigabit ethernet ports here on the back this is more than I've seen on many routers most only have four so this is really nice to have this many ports available if you have a network attached storage device that supports link aggregation this will support it only on ports 1 & 2 unfortunately but if you've got a lot of people hitting your network attached storage you can actually serve a two gigabit link to the rest of your network of course everyone's still connecting at one but if you have a lot of demand on those files you can give it a little bit more bandwidth out the back of your Nass device by aggregating these two ports together the higher-end WD my clouds as well as the Qun apps and thus analogy's all support that feature and if that's something that you find of use this is kind of nice to have this built into your router you don't have to have an additional switch next to it the rest of these ports are just standard gigabit ports you also have a gigabit port for your wind connection there is well to plug into your cable or a telephone provider you have a power for input here your power button over there your reset switch over there and your WPS button to link up with a faster pairing if you don't want to go through the rigmarole of typing in passwords this is disabled by default which is actually nice to see because this can sometimes be a security issue and on the back here is a another USB port this is a USB 2.0 port this one will support all the same features as that other port does just a little bit slower so I'm gonna get this thing plugged in we're going to test out a couple of things on it including its speed with standard 2 by 2 wireless AC because that's the only thing that I have that I can actually test your at least that's the fastest connection my computer's support we're also gonna look at the the network attached storage function on here as well as its connectivity to cellular modems to lots of things to look at so let's boot it up so here we are on the front page of the control panel for the router if you have used an Asus router in the past this will look very very familiar to you but there are some features which we'll definitely talk about as we're going through this but I do like just the at a glance kind of approach that they have two things on here so I can click on the status icon for example I can see how much RAM is available on the router so I can see what impact perhaps some of these features and I'm implementing might have on its overall memory but again because we have 512 Meg's of RAM it actually gives you a lot more room for some of the features that they have added to this particular router which are very helpful you can also adjust very quickly your wireless settings here if you want to quickly change the password to the router you have the ability to do that very very quickly on here the one thing I love about the Asus routers is that they include an open VPN server and client and what's nice about this is that Open VPN first of all is a lot more secure than PPTP is because there is a certificate as well as a password involved and what's cool is that it's a great way to link to networks over the Internet to each other so you could have this one here and another one somewhere else and you can actually connect your two networks together so everybody on each network can get to each other's computers which is a very useful thing if you have a multi-site office or something and don't want to spend a fortune on some enterprise VPN solution this will actually work pretty well it's relatively secure and probably good for a small business if you're a larger business of course I would recommend something more robust but this is better than the basics that you might have on other routers and it works quite well it's also a great way that if you're if you're off site or maybe you have a network attached storage device somewhere you can connect that device or an individual computer to your network in the same way so you can go outside your network connect in and get access to everything like you would if you were sitting on your home office desk or something so really very very useful useful feature there a couple things that are unique to this router one is the traffic analyzer and this is a neat feature I've been playing with all day today as I've been experimenting with the router here and what's cool is that when you turn this on it will monitor your network traffic and tell you not only who is using the most bandwidth it picks the top five clients used for whatever time period you're looking but also what they're doing so this top one here is my iPhone it's not currently connected so it doesn't have a mapping to that MAC address this is the physical address of its Wi-Fi connection so if I have my iPhone connected right I would say iPhone up there and it tells me that not only is this the top bandwidth consumer right now based on the pie chart but also what I've been using with that device so if you are in a workplace environment for example and somebody is torn thing during the day or something and you want to knock them off that task you can find out exactly who is consuming the most bandwidth and what it is they're doing so you'll see here it knows that I was on YouTube and Facebook even though there are secure services it knows the URL that I'm going to to look at those services so that's how it's able to see that there's some other web traffic here that is just secured to you know various web sites that it's not familiar with so it'll just kind of lump those into the SSL option there but there's also an mp3 download which I did to grab a podcast off my iPhone earlier and I can see what my iBook my macbook was doing here as well so a really neat little feature you can then go in and dig a little further so you can pick specific clients off a list here and see when they were most active when those things were happening how much bandwidth they were consuming so really useful stuff if you're really trying to figure out if somebody on your network is doing something bad you can also aggregate all the app traffic together and see from all the clients which app is consuming the most bandwidth now this is a router marketed towards gamers which is why it's so angular a meme looking they have a feature called gain boost that will attempt to get the traffic routed to your game servers in the most efficient way possible especially if you are sharing your network with other people and there's some interesting stuffs they have on here they have first thing is this service called wtfast which is a they call it a GP in a gamer private network it's essentially a VPN of what it can let you do is basically specify a device on your network that it will route to this service which will then get you over presumably faster to one of the major gaming servers that you might be trying to connect to it's a hit or miss kind of thing I think if you are having issues that you know are nothing to do with your router or your wireless connection and have everything to do with your ISP then this might be something that could help you it is free for one device but if you want to add multiple devices you have to pay for the subscription service to add additional ones there but what's nice about this is that it works without without a client so the router here essentially acts as the client and it looks for traffic that your device generates but one thing you might want to try first is the land boost and what this is is a way of very quickly specifying which packets should get priority on your network so what'll happen is when you implement this you'll get a little game controller icon up here you click on that you go to change priority mode and what its nice is that there's a couple of ways to look at this prioritization of traffic this is also called QoS or quality of service so they have a one-click option here where you can say alright I'm playing games so any game traffic I want to go over the network faster or if you want to specify web surfing is the primary activity you can click on that you have the ability to go over here to customize and you can drag things around here to get a custom setting that will prioritize things based on how you set them and this is all preset stuff so it's knowing to look for certain destinations for the data or the certain originating device to kind of know exactly what you're trying to do it's not going to be perfect but it will allow you to do things very simply from a quality of service standpoint this is a nice improvement to see this feature getting a little bit better to understand but you can also go in and do it in the traditional way where you you know go ahead and specify the amount of bandwidth that you have and then go in and try to manually set which devices do what but it is a little bit easier sometimes to just be able to click on a one click thing to make it work but you can go even further if you want to and say alright you know the MacBook only gets this amount of bandwidth and that's it to limit perhaps somebody you know barging in on your bandwidth what's been interesting is is that I've typically been the biggest bandwidth consumer in my house but now that I have a daughter who watches a lot of her educational stuff on Netflix she is now consuming most of the bandwidth in this house so I could limit how often she barges into the things that I'm doing especially I want to do a live stream or something I can deprioritize her device or the things that she's doing and prioritize my network stream out to youtube or something like that so they've really been getting much better at simplifying how all of this stuff works another thing I want to show you is the USB application because this is where you can connect devices up to your USB ports on there so I have right now my 3G 4G modem plugged into the USB port I've specified that it's on I have a USB modem but you can also connect an Android phone via USB and have your Android phone be the the modem essentially so if you do have the tethering service enabled I believe you need to have that you can plug the Android phone into the router if your internet ever goes down and get everybody back up again through your phone you will consume your bandwidth of course but it is a way to in an emergency to get that done very quickly and what's really cool if you go over back over here to this dual wind setting here you can actually have that work as a failover so your primary network is you know your cable or internet provider that you're doing via the LAN but you could have the USB be the secondary one and that is exactly what we have right now that I have it in failover mode I don't have an internet connection into that wind port at the moment so if I go back to our network map you can see that my primary win is disconnected but my secondary the little Internet dongle I have here is taking over and it's been working great so a very nice seamless way to I have an emergency backup if you want on your network and again just all those things that we just saw here just kind of the tip of the iceberg on this device and that's one of the things that asus has done I think better than most router manufacturers that we've looked at so far is that they really have quite a feature set that makes us a very very useful router from the standpoint of having the VPN integrated having all this failover stuff integrated things you might see a more expensive more enterprise level kind of stuff are in here and I think for most home users and home office users it's good enough to get things done that you really can't get done on other brands of routers that cost the same or more all right so we saw how that back port was good for using our cellular modem as a backup and now we're going to see how the front port does with a solid-state drive attached to it so what's gonna happen now is we're going to try to use the router as a network attached storage device and I have my Mac here connected to the router via Gigabit Ethernet and we're going to compare this speed that we're about to see with what we might see from a modern network attached storage device I'm gonna start our usual disk speed test here from black magic and you can see on the right side we're writing for that solid-state disk connected to the router over Gigabit Ethernet at a speed of about 30 to 35 megabytes per second and reading at around 50 megabytes per second now this drive it plugged directly into my Mac via USB three could do 400 megabytes in both directions typical speed we see over Gigabit Ethernet to a modern ass device is about a hundred megabytes per second so this is about half of what you would expect out of a NASA vice but it is actually a functional read and write speed for basic stuff so if you're not you know transferring videos or watching a lot of movies or whatever you could probably get by with this as a file store and if you had just a you know little USB stick or something you wanted to throw in the front of this this router would actually probably work very well as a network attached storage device without having to buy a separate product to accomplish that file-sharing task if that's all you're after so I think we're going to start seeing more of these features from routers start to creep into the network attached storage territory if you if you call it that and we may actually see the reverse happened on the nasty side where these nasty devices may start acting like routers also I think we're seeing a real convergence here as processor speeds and overall innovation in this space continues to pick up so we'll have to see what happens in the next year if one of these routers could serve files as fast as a network attached storage device does but this is definitely a lot better than what I've seen in the past and I think we're only going to see it get better soon the next thing we're gonna do is see how fast the wireless speeds so are we gonna leave this Mac connected via Gigabit Ethernet we're gonna grab my Mac Book which has a 2 by 2 AC wireless card built in and we're going to transfer files wirelessly to the Mac and see how fast we can get them there over-the-air alright so we are connecting my macbook here to the router via wireless AC you'll see our transmit rate is at 867 megabits per second that lines up for the most part with 2 by 2 AC wireless which is the radio that this has built into its we are looking at a current generation MacBook that's it 2 by 2 AC wireless this can support 3 by 3 and of course that 1024 format that nobody supports just yet even my Microsoft Surface book back there a flagship Windows computer only has a 2 by 2 radio so this is about the extent of what you're going to see now what's gonna happen here is that this little MacBook is going to transmit the data wirelessly to the router the router will then take that data push it out via the gigabit internet cable back here and have it go into my MacBook here which is also on the desk and we're gonna see how fast that data makes that trip so let's go over to my test here and we'll run this real quick and see what kind of speeds we get and as you can see here we're getting speeds in the upper five hundred megabit per second territory which is actually pretty good now we're in ideal circumstances there isn't much distance between the macbook and the router but we are seeing some really good wireless speeds here under ideal circumstances and it looks like 562 megabits per second is the average that we saw over the course of that test so I think you know from the standpoint of wireless speed it is great but it's just as great as many of the routers that we've looked at over the last year or so seem very similar speeds that we saw out of those primarily because this is the maximum speed that this laptop and just about every other laptop out there can transmit at so again if you are looking for a router really focus on the features you saw here versus the need for greater wireless speed because if you already have an AC wireless router and most of your clients are AC clients you're not going to see any real improvement in wireless connectivity then you may already have if you don't have an AC router than certainly stepping up to an AC router will make a difference provided that all of your clients that are connecting to it also support wireless AC and you should definitely go in look at all the specification sheets for the devices that you have and see if they do if so then you might see a better boost in wireless performance but if not and you already have an AC router most likely you're not going to see anything really different with this one and one last thing to talk about is firmware updates they will not always tell you when there is one available for this through the control panel I just checked on this a little earlier today it said I was on the current version yet when I go to the Asus website there is a non beta current version of firmware available that is a later date than the one that is currently installed on this one so you probably want to go once a month to the Asus website and just check to make sure that there isn't a newer firmware available because there's so many open-source libraries being used on this thing to get updated all the time you definitely want to keep up with those firmware updates in the control panel doesn't always tell you that so definitely be on the look out for that if what you just saw is nothing what you need I do suggest then looking at the google onhub routers there is one from tp-link and there's also now one from asus they are very easy turnkey solutions that update themselves you don't really do much of anything with them they just kind of run in the background so if you are not a huge gamer or a huge networking person those might be easier ones to look at you can see my review of that one that I did a little while ago I'm definitely recommending that one for regular consumers but for enthusiasts this is probably the best one you can get at the moment until I see something better but right now I'm sticking with this one this is lines I've been thanks for watching this channel is brought to you by the generosity of my patreon supporter if you find the channel
