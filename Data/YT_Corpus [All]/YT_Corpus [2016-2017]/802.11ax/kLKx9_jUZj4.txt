 hi this is Tom VAR c with embedded computing design here again at tu automotive here at the red pine signals booth and I'm with Jim Furyk applications engineer how are you Jim hey I'm doing fine today how are you doing I'm doing great Jim tell me about the we've come chip in module that you're showing at the show today well let me explain what this is wave combo is essentially a device for the be 2x market using the 802 lat 11 p standard but we also support Wi-Fi Bluetooth Bluetooth ble and zigbee so what we have here give you an example this is an onboard unit of the device and we're can communicate vehicle to vehicle right here we can also go bluetooth to a lot of monitor inside or a smartphone we also can go and get information from the roadside unit which would be something like you know traffic problem ahead uses all to your route something of that nature also now there are zigni devices that are smart cone so when you go into a construction area to make sure that you're right you're going through at the speed limit not going above it we're not going to way too low so that's the difference there also too as i said we look at it we view chips we do the complete module we on all the software i triple e 1609 stack who also are you have some reference designs with an onboard unit and a roadside unit which we have in the table so essentially you know this is something out of the smart cities program where the mid-sized cities won the draw of the program and essentially what's going to happen there is there going to be putting the infrastructure in with subsidies from the government so once that's in place you're going to start seeing aftermarket devices and cars and then eventually you'll see it built into the car market so today we have evaluation boards available we have the silicon available and the modules available for the 802 11 p and d SRC applications great technology from red pine signals thank you very much Jim how can we find out more information about your company well you can go to our red white signals com you could also if you want to find out more about our IOT platform that's called Wiz be calm and you get information that way or from the show
