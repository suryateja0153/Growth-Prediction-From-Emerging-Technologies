 hello I'm Ian skills you're watching Telecom TV and we're here at smart IOT London where I'm going to be talking to William Webb William is the CEO of weightless and he also sits on several Ofcom committees so we want to talk about openness and IOT William welcome thank you in as I just said I would really like to talk us to talk about open source and open standards and I know it's a subject that's very close to your heart because we've spoken about it several times before so my observation just to kick this off is that in every other part of the telecom industry at the moment it's underpinned or most thought people are aiming to have it underpinned by open source code at the very least yeah and the definitely open standards at the at the very most absurd in IOT I don't see that happening so much of course there are people that wanting to do that but we haven't seen many Green Streets yet what's your could you observe on that please so you're absolutely right it's it's a real mess right now in the Internet of Things so we have three different areas I suppose you could focus on what one is in-home or short area to some degree that is one where there are standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but they're not standards designed for the Internet of Things they're standards that are just being repurposed repurposed for other things but that's not the area I think that's of most interest we're looking mostly at the the wider area connectivity that's more suitable for smart cities asset tracking all those kind of things and that falls into a non-licensed set of technologies and standards and a license to set the license set actually is evolving around standards because it's being developed through 3gpp the body of the develops our cellular standards and whilst they've got many variants they're gradually finding their way towards a single solution but in the unlicensed world we have four or five different contenders of which all apart from wait list the body I represent are closed in some way shape or form they're either completely proprietary or or they have bits that are open such as the terminal sign but it's that a clothes such as the base station side I think that that leads to no end of problems but the biggest problem is what I sometimes characterized as the the washing machine problem which is if you are a Chinese manufacturer you are making a washing machine you decided you wanted to connect your washing machine because and all that allowed you to well for some kind of new feature that was of interest to people who are buying it remote maintenance or whatever it might be what tip would you put into that washing machine would you put in Bluetooth Wi-Fi 2g 3G 4G 6/4 Laura weightless ingénue all of the above in the hope that one of them connects and because you can't do all the above it's too expensive and because you don't want to pick the wrong one because that saddles your washing machine with both extra cost and you get an annoyed consumer because it doesn't connect you do nothing yeah and that's the problem good at the moment people are doing nothing except in areas that are fairly closed and where it's really critical they move ahead in which case they can pick one to get a technology control that system but that's not very many areas and that's why the Internet of Things is not yet exploding in the way that so many had predicted that it would happen five or five years ago so we're still wheel spinning as it were because we're waiting for one scalable technology to come through I think so and if you if you look at say wearables that didn't have that problem so if you're going to make a wearable you had no debate over what client tivity chip you put in it was gonna be bluetooth because everyone's got a mobile phone and every mobile phones got bluetooth so now we still don't quite know what wearables are for but the clinic dignity side of it wasn't the blocking problem yeah but in the internet of things it very much is and what history tells us is that in any particular area of wireless connectivity we get one winning standard Bluetooth personal area Wi-Fi for local area cellular for wider area and so on and it's only one and it's an open standard so the Internet of Things I don't see as being any different in its dynamics from any of those areas so it seems to me that we will inevitably sooner or later end up with an open standard and probably one or most two perhaps one a licensed one for unlicensed that will emerge from this melyandd morass of different competing activities that are going on at the moment except that you know when I talk to other people they talk about the really important things in IOT being applications the point is that those applications are very diverse yes some demand very low power long life backgrounds some don't worry about that much some demand you know very long range yeah that'll soon the extent that standards that we've got at the moment the lower and this is sick folks and so on they tap different elements of those of those so you have a range of horses for various course yeah um what do you say to that I mean a lot of other people would say that we can't compress all of those standards into one big uber standard because the market wouldn't bear it so there's certainly truth in that the applications are fair it but the problem is if we end up with too many different standards it's unlikely there'll be that many networks deployed so if we decided we needed four different standards let's say four different balances of range and cost and so on then we'd need four different networks deployed across the country and that and the the amount of revenue in the business is probably not sufficient for that so I don't see how we can achieve that I think what we'll end up with is one technology and that will be well-suited to some applications less so to others and I think there's other applications we'll we'll have to learn to live with that and adjust their demand to that in the same way we only have one cellular technology we're all heading towards despite the fact that some people want to download many gigabytes and do streaming video and others only want to make emergency calls but we don't have different technologies for those because it would just be too expensive to run separate networks for them so that will be out here the ideal solution often doesn't happen and what does tend to happen is people change their applications so you might say actually my application requires lots of streaming video and then I'll come along and say well that's fine but the solution I've got doesn't really lay to do that and if you do want to do it it would cost you five hundred dollars a month and you might never say actually perhaps I don't need streaming video perhaps I can make do with storing video locally and then just sending a few frames of the video sequence that you particularly want to see when some alarm was triggered or something yes okay well that could be the case of course I don't you can always argue around the metaphor itself yeah and resist the temptation to do that but on the other hand there might be a way in which you can amalgamate all of those qualities into a single standard where you could cherry-pick different aspects of it yeah I never won one standard fits all but you can configure the remote device to perhaps better husband its power depending upon how far away it is from you know there might be ways yes melding them together I think you'll see that as a positive yeah I think that's absolutely right that chipsets are becoming ever more capable we can have a standard with multiple different variations within it and we see that with Wi-Fi for samples so you can have amber cellular - yeah exactly so you can just pick 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi or you can have combined 2.45 you can decide to aggregate multiple channels together to get very high data rates or you can just have the simple solution yes and so different chipsets can have different elements and pick and choose of that that I suspect is quite likely in the Internet of Things so CS it's a fair point we may well see a number of these technologies being squeezed into one standard which itself has a number of variants within that and as long as that doesn't have too much cost in complexity to the chipset then the manufacturer a particular device then says well my device would only turn on part b of that standard because it doesn't need the rest of it and I can just sat there quiescent on the chipset that's what pure economics would apply to them you know the minute it gets cheap enough to do that they will be able to do it yeah you mentioned Wi-Fi which is an interesting case because of course the other you know the other the other party might say we can we can use Wi-Fi and we can adapt that's very similarly with Halo for instance which is their standard for low powered weii how how likely is it do you think the Wi-Fi will sustain I mean it's one of those technologies isn't it just keeps you know morphing into yes it does and it's done a fantastic job of developing and enhancing itself over the years to the extent that actually it's probably the the one we use more than anything else now we might think that actually we use editor and then move over to Wi-Fi but actually it's the other way around most of our devices only have Wi-Fi actually if you look at them so so you're quite right so good Wi-Fi take over I think it might do in the home and the reason it might will do there is because we already have Wi-Fi in the home so it's easy to bring devices in and just connect them up to the existing Wi-Fi router at the moment the battery life is not fantastic but you can imagine that if all thing over time in gradually getting better would it extend to a wide area coverage I think that's too much of an ask for Wi-Fi so the current standards are talking about extending the range from a hundred meters to a kilometer but actually to get cost-effective coverage of a country one kilometer range is not sufficient you need to be at about four or five kilometers was the modeling that we showed for the UK for example gave you the ability to cover the whole country with a decent number of base stations and Wi-Fi can't leap too far off into any particular direction because it needs to maintain in backward compatibility with everything else is out there and so that does constrain is its direction so I don't think it will be the solution for the wider area right okay but it certainly looks like being the de facto solution for the in-home error if you think so supporters yeah the only other thing we see coming along is people like hive and so on are deploying their own hubs in eight six eight megahertz or similar to that but those aren't really standards those are just each individual application saying here's my hub and that's a bit of a pain frankly as a consumer you don't really want to end up with this massive hubs scattered around to your home all eventually probably interfering with each other when he goes to the stage that the spectrum constraints are such that they can no longer operate effectively friendly home hub yeah schemes look like becoming more and more complicated they do when I read them up yeah what about some you talked about the GSMA standards before yes I understand it yeah now if we follow through on what you are talking about necessity for the to be a very limited number of stands and everybody can support obviously in the hot seat are going to be the GSMA White's wide-area yeah how likely is it that they will be open in the way that you suggest in other words could they be easy could they be open enough to be supported in unlicensed bands as well now I know that you know the wait list yeah think the Newell thing before yeah that's exactly how they were going to do it they were going out to do it in the unlicensed spectrum first and you know the same technology was going to be suborned within the cellular environment under GSMA yeah what from your doing this in 5g how likely do you think it is that that scenario that you were talking about was gonna take place yeah so at the moment the mobile operators and that whole 3gpp community is focused on license spectrum and actually on something that is very close in its look and feel to 4G so that it can be ideally software downloaded to the operators base stations and running that and that means the route they've gone down is not particularly well suited to unlicensed which has very different regulatory environment typically lower power different bandwidths and also this whole issue of not knowing whether you're gonna get interference you need to design around that so whether at at the moment is not particularly well-suited for that and that's fine if it wasn't intended to could they add that mode on possibly but they're I think they're gonna be spending quite some time delivering on the license side of things they still haven't finished those standards they're quite complex and when they finished them they've got to test them certified and build the chipsets and so on I think by the time they've done that they'll already be some kind of de facto solution on licensed and it'll be far easier for the mobile operators just to say well we'll if we want to use a mix of the two will flip between those two so in the same way that they use Wi-Fi on license to send you in license they don't try and shoehorn send it or into Wi-Fi although this or so on we'll see where we go with that be careful William yes so I I think it's it seems unlikely in the next few years is a decade from now it's too difficult to call I think yes so so the the young licensed band low-powered net will function a little bit like Wi-Fi phones now I think so and I think it will emerge in its own right as it is already with six Foxx and others yes and we'll see exactly what technology dominates that obviously I hope it's gonna be weightless that's where I'm coming from this is a little bit about when we waste weightless in the in the firmament at the moment yeah so wait this exists as the only open standard for white area Internet of Things connectivity so companies like cig Fox and lore and so on have essentially proprietary technologies weightless has always been there as a not-for-profit open democratic organization and as such it doesn't have a particular technology that is trying to push it's not being set up to further ultra narrowband or anything else it's simply there as a vehicle for its members to drive it in whatever direction it wants to go and over time that's driven us to at the moment two different standards an altar narrowband standard we call weightless n and a bi-directional standard that we call weightless P both of which should just get into the stage now software development kits and so on being available okay so we're some way behind the proprietary systems in terms of timing but that's kind of a narrative all with standard standards take longer because you'd need to get people together reach agreements in an open democratic way move forward as an ecosystem whereas if you're doing something proprietary you're you can just focus in your own little closed environment to make it happen and push it fast so that's no surprise that we in that situation but I think the innovation proprietary systems I think are increasingly seeing operators and others saying we're nervous about a proprietary solution it's a single source supply is potentially monopolistic and it doesn't have any of the benefits for open standards of vibrant competition and the ability to draw in lots of different ideas to that yes I wonder about that I sometimes wonder that they are rather comfortable with the operators are rather comfortable with their modulation we'll see yeah they rather like a monopoly they'd like to be a monopoly themselves but I don't think they'd like the monopoly of the supply for anything that they are okay that they buy that's a fair point but uh but you know isn't redentor that weightless has missed the boat here because now you've got the GSMA gonna be coming out with them but their standards but it seemed to cover the out a bit of the range now you've got big deployments of of sig Fox in in France say and you know there's quite a bit of Laura activity as well is there gonna be much room left because you know you've even got France still you've got the big telcos in France and adopting pre standard you know network technology so I think best a plenty of room now so if we look at most of the predictions for Internet of Things people talk about 50 billion devices or thereabouts that seems to me eminently plausible that's only ten devices per person with a smartphone that's not in any way unreasonable and where are we at the moment most ten percent of that probably so there's still 90 percent of the markets play for in terms of network rollouts there are six Fox networks but they're very small-scale indeed so here in the UK are Keever have rolled out into ten cities I think but it's not anything like a sizable deployment and I don't believe is yet they have that many customers so I think it is still 80 days yes orange going with Laura in France but that's one operator in one country the fact actually that we haven't seen very large-scale take-up persuades me that in fact people are holding back waiting for something that's a bit more certain in this space so they can say that's going to be the winner we can back that and we can deploy behind that and if we look back to the early days of GSM or whatever we had whatever it was and 90 operators in 30 countries or 40 countries all deploying within the space of a year or two in big scale that's what happens when people are certain haven't seen that yet William thank you very much very interesting you're welcome you
