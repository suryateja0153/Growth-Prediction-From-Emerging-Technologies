 hi my name is Matt Maxwell and I'm a product manager for tektronix spectrum analyzers and in this quick how-to video we're going to talk about first turn on of a wireless LAN device and to do that we're going to be using and tektronix RSA 607 a this is a USB controlled analyzer that's being driven from the signal view pc software on this pc here and i have my device under test here so this assumes you have some sort of environment where you can either have a test port to connect a cable to the analyzer or you may have to use antennas maybe directional antennas on the analyzer with a on the directional antenna from the device under test to have a reasonable assurance that you're getting good signal strength from your wireless LAN device also in that kind of test setup it's important to make sure that you're in a relatively clean RF environment so you're not encountering interference from other signals over the airwaves so let's get started here we start out with the instrument in a preset condition preset button just like a regular analyzer is on the front of the display and I preset that to set the frequency so in this particular case for the signal I know that it's broadcasting at channel one of the wireless LAN frequency so 2.41 two gigahertz and I right away I'm noticing that I don't see a signal present so the reason for that is it's a bursted signal it's not happening frequently so the way that I get around that is I turn on a trigger and I need to reduce the threshold which I control when I bring up the trigger menu I turn on the trigger and then I reduce the threshold to a level where I'm actually capturing parts of the signal so go down to about minus 25 DBM so now I see updates regular updates to the spectrum display and maybe I also want to turn on a max hold trace in addition to the regular spectrum trace so the blue trace is the mat x whole tray so I'm looking at the power versus frequency of the spectrum from the transmitted signal now the way this analyzer works is that a level trigger can be used anywhere within 40 megahertz real-time bandwidth if I wanted a sweep wider to look for the signal it may be more difficult it's very helpful if you know where your signals transmitting and maybe future videos we'll talk more about using real-time displays to find the signal without a trigger in any case the next thing i want to show are some basic spectrum measurements so i use the mouse control and i right click to add a marker and I want to look roughly at the bandwidth I say roughly because I'm just positioning markers on the display and I see the difference between those markers is 15.4 megahertz if I go to something like a 3d be down point it's probably a little bit wider so it's it looks like it's the right kind of signal that I would expect to see 15 20 megahertz or so for the wireless LAN signal the spectrum analyzer has basic spectrum analyzer controls down on the lower portion of the screen I can control the frequency I can control the level with the reference level which changes some of the gain stages and the analyzer to adjust the signal on the screen as I increase that it'll it's over ranging or if I decrease that it'll miss little it's always triggering now but it'll get to a point where it's not triggering and then I also have the there it goes back to its other state I go I have the span control too so I'm looking now at a 40 megahertz span of the spectrum and then a resolution bandwidth or a measurement bandwidth filter so the reason you may want to change this is if I want to look at wider signals I see I have less resolution in the frequency domain or if I down arrow to reduce the resolution bandwidth not only do I have more resolution but I start to be able to see further down into the noise and it happens that the portion of the signal that I'm triggering on and analyzing is right at the preamble so I see the pilots of the signal only and that's one of the reasons why I see also a narrower bandwidth less than 20 megahertz for this evaluation board so these are important measurements to be able to make on a wireless land Internet of Things device for the first time the device is turned on so I want to be able to look at rough signal parameters to make sure a spectrum is present and maybe perform some basic measurements just to take it a little bit further though I have a number of other measurement capabilities available through the software so if I select different types of displays I can take a look at the same signal with the real-time display so if i turn on trace to with the peek hole trace and i can right away see a burst that's been captured with the real-time display and that gives me more insight it also helps me if I'm trying to find a signal that is frequency hopping changing channels or make sure there's a signal present which for a low duty cycle signal like this that I might have a harder time seen with the lower spectrum display there's a lot more capabilities that we could use but I think for first device turn on these two are very helpful and powerful displays to help you make sure that your device is working correctly next steps will involve emi pre compliance as well as troubleshooting if things aren't working well and then broader device characterization which is another area that's more for the development of a wireless LAN module that goes into that final device so we've looked at some of the high-level capabilities to perform basic spectrum measurements and some other capabilities that are available in the view pc software for wireless LAN device first turn on so i hope this has been helpful for you and I thank you for your time
