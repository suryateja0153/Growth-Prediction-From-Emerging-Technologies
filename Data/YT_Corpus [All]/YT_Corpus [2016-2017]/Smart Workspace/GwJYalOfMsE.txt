 welcome to our crow for retail hangout on air thank you for joining us today from all over the world with a large crowd concerts let's appreciate it my name is Sebastian Schneider I will be setting the stage for today's topic hoping to understand how the chrome platform can help streamline operational efficiencies and so very real work flow problems in the context of the retail vertical with me today I have sash lawd panigale our senior product manager who we talking us through the specifics of our own solution the key focus of today is to really understand how probe can help connect sales associates and subsequently drive customer engagement through the delivery of relevant and timely content so it's a wide retailer according to ours our research retailers phase two significant operational founders and I would categorize them as traditional important problems that essentially revolved around getting ever-changing information to highly dynamic highly distributed workers in practice that means keeping employees informed about promotional activities now you're essentially dealing with data that may be changing daily or changing hourly based on the store zip code for instance the other challenges maintaining consistency of rollout processes the tide turnover environment so this can be Dan to seasonality of the business for instance now through the lens of the IT department these are arguing very complex problems especially in the setup or multiple in storage systems don't talk to each other you to let me see our particular constraints so rather than consolidating and rethinking workflows some retailers are patching and adding for term solutions to accommodate and thus contributing to the siloed architecture environment now more than ever there's a growing lead to communicate with a distributed workforce the shopper as well as the store employee today most of them digitally savvy Millennials that basically grew up with the cloud have both grown accustomed to always focus on the main economy experience and thus expect the wealth of information at their fingertips to make an educated decision or an educated recommendation quickly now faced with the substantial digital disruption of screens and purchasing behaviour store face retailers and recognize they need to improve their in-store experience to really capitalize on using technology strategically so just from a high level perspective what's happening today is the following ninety percent of customers will need the Thor when you can find the regularly so you're dealing with a customer base that is has a very limited attention span due to time constraints and it's this highly results women in conjunction with that the other phenomenon is that was inside the store forty-two percent of customers are doing real-time research using their smartphones that's the experience that the storm moving doesn't control so by not effectively capturing the attention of the customer I not accurately delivering timely contextual information the chillers are faced with a conversion problem which directly impacts the bottom line into lead to negative attention all the while incurring the cost of the traffic now one way to solve for that is to put technology in place to continuously educate the sensitive essentially make the associate a subject matter expert by providing relevant the man based information thus digitally empowering the associate and give him a for the ability to learn on the fly data shows that training and communication matter and it actually directly impacts the ability to sell so for us there in little I as an opportunity we think that intelligence screams lightweight Alexis can help bridge the gap and really be instrumental for the technology strategy ever be gentle chrome is the platform to power all your screen and we have some great adoption with companies that start with quote unquote one defined user and quickly realize that the Chromebook is organically expanding to fulfill multiple functions right so per this illustration of a slide we firmly believe that screen should actually came into multiple use cases that the device should be repurposed in real time based on the user based on the audience so drop from staffer a logging in with their credentials to check promos just after be using the same device to assist a customer in real time to customer a picking up the device to perform a self-service product look up in the aisle from employee facing to customer facing all this is accomplished by one screen so to summarize there's a massive opportunity to deliver an experience that can achieve really three key values employee effectiveness so the device nears employee becomes the device they knew at that time enabling them to focus their attention on the customer customer experience self-service kankan seamlessly transition into Employee Assistance really providing an added value beyond what ecommerce can provide today and then lastly but just as important this idea of IT efficiency the fewer devices with a higher utilization to drastically simplify management for the device that are deployed now to help us understand how we exactly do that I'd like to now us a flawed to walk us through the technical background and give a more in-depth fraud over you so with that sash shot over to you and thank you all hi everyone thank you for joining us today and thank Sebastian for setting this up as Sebastian was saying the way retail functions today is fundamentally changing both jutsu user behavior as the vestrion was referring to people researching products before getting into the store in the store and so on and the expectation they have a few sales associates in the amount of knowledge they have from the product is over and above the degree of research they have done prior to that the second thing that is also changing is the security landscape is changing and e-tailers versus retailers and combined presence is also changing the technology landscape in retail we'll be covering some of that but broadly what we're talking about Alexis just to you know focus the discussion a little bit we absolutely need the sales associates who are on your floor to be always connected in today's world why because the customers that are walking into your store are always connected even in the research they did before as well as when they came in so having always connected sales associate gives you the benefit of them being able to be completely trained in your product portfolio being able to accomplish HR tasks easily so that most of their time is actually going into selling into customers check product details whether the product is available in that particular store in many for example home improvement stores what we find is even if people do the research before going to the store you know if there's an inventory mismatch between what they saw outside and when they get into the store there they are somewhat disappointed so making sure that your associates have the precise information to be able to direct those incoming customers is critical at the same time when some of these devices that are on your active shop floor are not being used by your associates there's no reason those screens should not be used for something like signage to either guide the customers for higher value offers things to guide them to a large stores area various or those specials that you're offering that specific day also as Sebastian was saying it doesn't mean that because you're trying to span these variety of use cases everything from store manager to sales associate the customer sign up to signage that you need to buy for devices or talk with five technology companies the exact same device because chrome OS was designed as a cloud-first shareable OS can switch between users with minimal interaction or zero interaction by utilizing policy similarly every almost every store we know of today has a back of a backroom office that either the store manager uses or the people who are enforcing you know Andy theft procedures have various amounts of computing so those involve things like managing the finances managing the local inventory doing orders for the store as well as you know managing who are the shift workers for this week shift versus the weekend shift and so on for all of those things store managers device is also something critical and once again in this area we have seen a tremendous success for Chromebooks and various retail organizations so those are sort of use cases that hopefully you can all identify with if you have worked in the retail space but let's go into a little bit of okay sure so for these use cases what are the types of form factors because form factors does matter in providing this versatility so the good news with Chromebooks is we have devices starting from $85 all the way to a thousand dollars and everything in between in terms of price points in terms of shapes sizes we have everything from a 11 inch convertible with a 360 degree hinge to a beautiful one of the thinnest laptops which is the HP Chromebook 13 as well as a dell chromebook 13 pixels chrome boxes strong bits so regardless so ein all-in-ones as well so regardless of where you are thinking of placing your device we have a device that suits your needs further these devices work great with peripherals and multiple monitors and so on depending on the use case that you're fighting for and also the diversity of the sicko system proves to you how much success our OEM partners are saying which is why they are building this variety of innovative devices that cover every part of the market need as well as every users your flexibility needs now go let's go a little bit deeper into what are the inherent properties of chrome was that we believe make it applicable to retail first and foremost security I'm sure you all have read headlines about breaches happening now you may wonder how come it's so often retail that's the attack target it's no surprise actually a recent study found that more than forty three percent of 500 data compromises that were being studied they were in retail why because the credit card data the payment data that's exchanging all of that information is monetizable by these by these attackers that makes retail and it's very very attractive target for them so where does Chrome OS come here remember when I was telling you about devices being available from $85 all the way two thousand all of those the cheapest to the most expensive from the most affordable to the most expensive come with a trusted platform module we do not believe that security is a premium feature its present in every single Chromebook chromebox chrome with you name it what now you may wonder okay fine what does that actual trusted platform module do what it does is it stores safely your encryption keys your wireless authentication keys and the reason it's important to store these keys safely is that if somebody were to be in a whuppin shop floor which makes these devices more vulnerable if somebody were to be able to steal those keys they could impersonate the device or the user to the network and cause significant damage by putting these keys not even in the actual hard drive but in a trusted platform module attacking it becomes near impossible also every single application is sandbox so even if somebody were to a compromise one application it doesn't spread to other tabs or browsers finally data is encrypted as well every single users data is encrypted by separate keys which is why your store manager who may have slightly higher level access can confidently share the device with a temporary employee that's working each of them is encrypted with a separate 256 AES key which which requires insane amount of computing resources to be able to brute force and break and finally one large one huge source of our security is being able to auto update our expose you know attacks on the internet evolve hourly and daily so if you're an OS that hasn't been updated in three or four years just by virtue of that the the security posture of your device has been significantly compromised and the fact that we are able to update billions of endpoints within days in the event of an attack or as new threats emerge gives us a huge gives chrome was a huge sense of security now I know when I say update probably many of you are running scared because the painful experience you have had with what OS updates look like but it doesn't have to be that way if you have ever tried a Chromebook the update actually downloads in the background and applies in under six seconds which is why users don't even notice and you can do this at the end of your workday and in a manner that doesn't disrupt any of the users so if security is at the top of your mind you should definitely choose an OS that still has a base attackers to be able to find its vulnerabilities we've been running the chrome vulnerability reward program for a long time we're consistently had to increase the top reward because it was not claimed so today it's at above 100 it's at hundred thousand dollars to be able to expose any vulnerability here so we talked about security and why retail which is a very attractive target for attackers is a great place where Chrome OS should be adopted now let's talk about speed as you guys know even from the beginning days of the browser the Chrome browser our primary mission was to provide a fast gateway to the browser and we've stayed through that mission with chrome OS now definitely people love being able to get their stuff done as fast as they can but why does it specifically matter to retail in retail let's say you are in the refrigerator sales section of your of your store there are multiple associates that are coming in and passing by each probably is logging into a particular application to help a particular client through a sale at the end of the day they're probably entering their timesheet now what happens typically is that if the boot up procedure takes very long or if logging in or logging out takes a very long in traditional OS people solve this problem by doing something that's convenient and essential to help their customers but extremely insecure let me give you an example so what would typically happen in a refrigerator sales section or appliance sales section of such a store because they're so ships find that logging and logging out is so cumbersome what they would do is leave the device in a local administrator mode all of the associates and the visitors and any potential attackers would have open access to the same device in administrator mode which is connected to your network if you ask any security expert this is this is this is a very painful situation to be in so we tried to solve that we tried to solve the issue of why logon should be so cumbersome so today chromebooks logins and log outs are can be achieved within six seconds your store associate could walk out you could have a policy that logs that user out immediately as soon as they go away and the new user can log in in under six seconds now think about this so you have certainly made it faster actually because in the past what would happen is even if the device was in local administrator mode each of the apps still needed logging into because you needed to give these sales associate their commission based on their individual sales so in the past they were logging it individually into seven or eight apps leaving the device in local administrator mode keeping things less secure now due to the speed security and share ability of Chrome OS they are able to do it in a fast manner still still serve their customers not leave their customer hanging while the device is rebooting or logging in but yet do that in a safe manner and I think that's where that's just one of the examples where security speed and shareability combined together to make it a great fit for retail and of course each of these associates data is encrypted by a separate key so there is no way you know across-the-board attack can happen or one malicious employ can hurt the other malicious employs data and so on and as you have seen from our success and education the interface itself a promise is very very simple that's why kids have been able to use it out of the bat and the employees that you are getting in the ones that Sebastian was talking about with her you know seasonal workers temp employees typically these are people who have been born and brought up in the cloud first world so they will find themselves right at home in the Chrome OS you i ah let's talk a little bit about the chrome management console now as we were discussing earlier the voice itself has been built from first and foremost as a cloud-first OS now the fact that it's cloud first implies that every setting on it can be managed from the cloud this is what makes it a great fit for retail as well because retail by definition is highly distributed no no globally distributed or even nationally distributed retail chain can afford sending an IT manager to every single store if something were to go wrong and the tech tech talent available in each individual store may be small and further IT spending trends are not exactly climbing up heavily into the management of devices so what chrome OS provides is your ability to manage over 220 policies every user setting every device setting kiosk in settings for putting them in signage and stores device specific settings and network specific settings we were talking to one retail chain in a germany and they were this this particular retail chain was present in every single you know major town and village in germany and and they had a single central IT staff do to save costs but yet what they were able to do is pre-configure all of the devices before sending it out to the sides and all the local retail outlets had to do power on the device and they were good to go their networks their certificates their identities were all pre-configured which apps they were allowed to use which apps they were not allowed to use were pre-configured which you are else they are allowed to visit and in which mode they were pre-configured and this was different by store manager versus seasonal worker versus shift worker so all of this can be controlled at a highly granular level in a tree based oh you structure where different sets of policies apply to different users studies have suggested that this ability to manage everything from the cloud every single aspect of the device and the user from the cloud reduces the overall maintenance costs by over sixty percent and the deployment cost sometimes by over ninety percent now why is this important because the role of IT in reach retail now should be how to strategically position on the information systems in the retailer to the world a type of world Sebastian was talking about where users are constantly researching products and prices coming in they should not be wasting time knowing when to patch a particular antivirus when to patch a particular app that's what we were doing 10 15 years ago guys and that's not should not be the primary focus we should be able to the device itself and the way it has been built the way it's managed from the clouds should be able to take care that for you and I think that has been the philosophy behind grow boys so enrollment is very very easy it can be done it doesn't have to be done at the store it can be done white glove by one of our partners that can be done at your central high tea store before it's even shipped all the policies can be pre-configured and your store associate or or your store manager only has to power on the device and here are what you're seeing on the slide is a few poor integrators that you can partner with to get you started on this journey now definitely as you're beginning this transformation or journey you still have a number of applications and infrastructure that was written the prior we work with all of these existing infrastructure providers let me quote just a few examples let's take identity as an example many of our retail partners use Active Directory they may be using octa ping identity a secure auth all of these identity providers / 12 of them are supported by chrome ones you can again reconfigure all of this using the chrome management console we already support have millions of devices using this identity infrastructure so whatever identity infrastructure you have we can integrate with it let's talk store Wi-Fi we have met retailers who within a single store sometimes have two or three Wi-Fi networks some are for their guests let's say your cafe you provide a certain Wi-Fi network for you guess that has to be kept separate from the network that you're using for payments that has to be kept separate from the network that you're using for your store associates and your store managers we are able to support all three of them and Chrome OS is intelligent enough in when it's in a certain mode to upgrade to the most secure Network so this certificate distribution is a major challenge in retail they ID managers in retail want to benefit from the additional security that comes from certificates we're distributing certificates in the highly distributed retail a map in a nation is very hard we believe we have solved that problem we can integrate with Active Directory certificate services and also with specialized providers such as cloud path and aruba networks and through a few clicks of a button we can provide you certs there are actually better the private key is backed by the trusted platform module making it one of the most secure solutions so this is hardware backed certs guys so stealing this would be excruciating ly hard and all the security doesn't come at a cost to the user experience users can still collect pretty easily and automatically because you have been able to configure all of this from the management console so I've gave you two examples with identity and certificates but we also integrate with the top major VPN providers we integrate with the major virtualization providers all of whom have launched many new features across VMware Citrix amazon workspaces and so on and finally we would work well with file systems in your organization as well so some of you may have windows file share some of you may be trying out google apps for work box Dropbox we provide a native offline singing experience with all of these those are just some of the examples of the infrastructure integrations we have made easy for you definitely if you have questions on any specific one we will answer them at the end of the hangout a few other points some of our partners wanted a easy solution to be able to use multiple monitors especially store managers or in the head office so Chromebooks do support multiple monitors in this slide you're seeing tube but we can support three or four some of our retail banking customers have used even more than four monitors and you know for example the HP Chromebook 13 is powerful enough to drive these also now there's a great selection of docking stations for example the one you are seeing on this slide right now it's a very thin very portable USB see docking station and to that one cable that's going into the Chromebook that you're seeing you can drive power the charging of the Chromebook you can drive external displays you can drive networking and these devices even if the store manager is running around the store seeing how his associates are doing or her associates are doing you have 11 and a half hours of battery life of 12 hours of battery life for some models so your entire day you never have to worry about charging even so hopefully what you're seeing is the versatility around in terms of peripherals use cases is just increasing and by the way the HP Chromebook 13 is a first in many ways it has audio by bno it has a it has a beautiful backlit keyboard amazing design and and still for affordable price now let's let's switch gears from instrum infrastructure and devices to absent content clearly many retailers have already gone the way of google apps so with Google Apps you get one full suite of solutions everything from unlimited drive storage using Gmail remember when Sebastian was talking about how critical it is for retailers with changing employee basis to keep the employees trained and feel connected to the you know head office and overall strategy Google Apps whose foundation was collaboration being able to edit docs quickly being able to send each other chat message just sit being able to send each other email at a very affordable cost all in the cloud is a great something that resonates great with retailers calendars similarly and an internal social network using Google+ Doc's drives sheets and even sites sites for a region's retail outlets or for the overall national layout so all of these apps work beautifully on a Chromebook because all of these designers use Chromebooks the people who design these products use chrome books as well so I think if you are in this world you would feel very familiar with in the Chromebooks as well however we did not stop there what you're seeing on the slide is citrix receiver and how this strategics receiver has evolved over the quarters what why did we do this because we know that even if retailers are in a journey to the cloud many of them do have Windows applications that they are virtualizing today by the way most of the large retailers that we have met recently they already have a citrix solution or they already have a VMware solution why because even with their existing oasis it was becoming just unmanageable to maintain thick applications on these traditional oasis oftentimes citrix or other virtualization solutions are that stepping stone in the journey to the cloud and we covered earlier why their journey to the cloud is almost inevitability in given how offline sales eat a website sales local store inventory and consumer research is coming together so now how is the Citrix experience whenever you say virtualization you always have to worry are my employees going to suffer from the fact you know either the performance not being up to the mark or the UX being non-intuitive so what I'm seeing you in the slide is just a few examples of how our collaboration with Citrix has worked so over the last few years every single quarter the Citrix team has launched new features on Chromebooks specifically so a few examples what you can see is we now use hardware acceleration for decoding of video and audio encode also is hardware accelerated now why am I harping on hardware acceleration what this means is that even if you have got a fordable Chromebook the chipset likely supports hardware encoding and decoding which means that the video quality will surprise you even if the device that you have bought is in the affordable range and not a thousand-dollar device similarly what you're seeing on the screen and the image every single virtualized Windows app is now appearing in its own window now why is this important because this gives a near-native feel to your employees and they don't even sees as if the OS minute has changed so seamless apps is a recent feature and you should you guys should definitely try out and then many many other features that I'm skipping over here that we have done to make your employees live sees you for example remember that six second logout and login I was talking about once your user logs and now we have worked with Citrix to make sure that you're automatically logged into citrix and even to the windows apps so in the past you are leaving the local OS in administrator mode and then each app was being logged in to what we are now providing you love once into the device switching login is less than six seconds and then automatically you're logged into every single app and so these are just some of the improvements we have done with Citrix and if you are a citrix customer you should be able to try this out immediately we also have options from VMware horizon del V workspace and amazon workspaces for example del V workspace in that single sort of blade server that you're seeing on the image you can power over 350 users so so that's a very easy way to get set up and try it out in a couple of your outlets amazon workspaces is a solution all in the cloud so if you don't want to have any on-prem setup you can try out amazon workspaces as well also i would like to do in case you miss this at google i/o we announced android apps coming to Chrome OS that that has is a huge effort that we have undertaken and we were trying to make sure that all android apps with minimal effort can run well on Chrome OS we are already in a dev and beta channels and multiple customers are trying this out already and are ecstatic about it now why is this so powerful for a retail again of course there's the element of the general productivity apps that your employees use all of those are coming to Chrome OS now that's one natural upside but think about the apps that you're writing today even just now if almost every retailer is writing some sort of an Android app today for example to power the Android tablets or phones that your store associates may be carrying around either to check inventory or to scan barcodes to update the inventory or to carry around in their arms when there's a customer asking them where a particular product is stocked in the market now in the past what you would have to do is write that android app potentially an iOS app if you have some of those and then think about how are you going to bring this to the desktop and keep all of this in sync what we're telling you now is you don't have to do that that same Android app that you've already written or already have contracted is going to work on Chrome OS so let me let me go on a limb here and get out of my presentation and just show you some of that working right so here what you're seeing is skype on my running on my Chromebook this is a regular Chromebook word running on my Chromebook so all of this available right now and you can try it out right now so I just thought instead of showing you the slide I actually show you the product itself and all of this by the way the fact these android apps are managed through the cloud through the same management console you can try it out in a store by store basis who has access to these android apps who doesn't which android apps are force installed versus you know user option to install all this is controlled through the same twice to the same management console sorry so hopefully that gives you overview of why it's a great fit to invest in this OS it can power a variety of you use cases from store manager to sales associate operations to training two HR tasks to ease up employ signups let's so now let's take a few examples of how customers retail customers are using this today Big Lots is an example and and Sebastian knows a lot about this he worked on this one himself so you know in big lots when asked customers would be interested in a big ticket item purchase oftentimes the store itself offers some sort of financing now filling out this financing in the past would be a pretty painful task taking a piece of paper writing in everyone's individual handwriting and some of our handwriting is better than others or you know one customer dictating it out for and employed to fill out very very slow and very inefficient process what Big Lots was able to do is provide a Chromebook which is available to its customers and they can just come up to the Chromebook and fill in this application this is what made it a very very smooth process and they can also use this Chromebook for other purposes Woolworths is another example it's a very large retailer in Australia and they had many many dated systems and now they have 10,000 plus staff utilizing Chrome OS and Chromebooks today they are they're also a Google Apps customers so the combination of collaboration that we and and Chromebooks that we were talking about earlier this is a perfect example of it and again there's a variety of use cases they're doing here everything from back office to the head office operations down to the store operations as well and one final recent example I'll talk to you about this child Schwab in its retail branches as a banking customer they were able to they have rolled out 1,700 Chromebooks and able to manage these devices centrally and also their incoming customers are able to get for potential clients they are able to get up-to-date information and fill in information or data as well and you can imagine if a bank trust search for its retail operations you as a retail customer definitely can trust its security as well there are many many other retail customers but why don't I pause here and go over to some questions um so one of the questions that were submitted is how easy is it to switch a device from an employee workstation over to kiosk mode you know for example when our sales team is not let's say filling any HR tasks and and instead interacting with a customer exceptionally easy actually you guys and and we can actually show you guys a demo so you can as an administrator pre-configure first of all which associates can login if you want to control that and further configure which kiosk apps are available so let's say there's a you know this is a device in the appliance section you can make that plants apps available as a kiosk app and all the user will have to do is hit sign out and even that can be sort of automated with her with a policy for after a certain period of time in signing out and then I'm the login screen itself there will be an app that the user can just click and you're straight into the kiosk app so it's exceptionally easy in fact being able to use the same device across kiosks public sessions signed-in users all controlled by the cloud is one of the major value propositions here another question is that we received as some of our sales associates already have some tablets how can Chromebooks fit in that environment great question in fact that that's where the Android apps coming to Chromebooks fits in very nicely part of the reason people are giving their sales associates Android tablets or phones is they realize that sometimes associates need to work or with their customers two different sections the good news is let's say you were helping somebody build a kitchen you can be on your laptop on the same app or are on your all-in-one desktop on the same app at the same android app configuring the kitchen and then seamlessly take your Android phone or tablet walk over to the aisle where that material is actually stopped so that your customer can buy them so hopefully that gives you a visual image of how big you know operations can shift between a desktop or a laptop and a tablet or a phone and the great thing here is now with Android apps coming to Chrome OS you don't have to rewrite that at that exact same app will work across the board so hopefully that give you guys a overview of how Chromebooks can fit in your organization folks and we would love to discuss further with you please reach out to your Google rep or your partner rep and thank you very much for joining us today
