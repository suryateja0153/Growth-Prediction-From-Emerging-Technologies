 hey guys welcome to Mobile World Congress here in Barcelona 2016 and plywood verge and we're here with the first big new phone announcement this is the brand new LG g5 it's a 5.3 inch handset the company follows up from the LG g4 from last year as you can see it's a more complex and wallet device but it still has the same resolution 2560 by 1440 quad HD the first thing I noticed with this device is that it video reminds me of Google's Nexus 60 it has the fingerprint sensor but all over here in the back which is also that was up as a power button also you might notice this is where LG starts to come into its own it has a dual camera system so it has a 16 megapixel camera and an 8 megapixel camera the second 8 megapixel camera actually gives you wide of your period of view goes out to 135 degrees g5 will be available in the silver option there also be a code a pink and a dark color which LG calls Titan but Philips really different about the LG g5 is something that LG calls a set of friends for accessories for the new phone there's a tiny little button right here on the side which when you press it it pops open and you should pull out the battery of the phone with it it's a twenty eight hundred million power battery and you can add more accessories so one of them is this extra camera grip which you took the battery into and then you plug back into the phone LG says that the g5 brings up really quickly so we can actually test that right now but what you have with this compartment is you get an extended battery but you do get a dedicated shutter button a dedicated video button and LED indicator light and a job dial for zoom and the phone is just put it up so there's a few seconds that it took with the external battery as well you get up to four thousand milliamp hours LG says that gets you 50% more usage or six or eight hours extra Camrys which is you know it's nice also noticeable down here the bottom use DC this uses a USBC connector another attachment that LG has for the g5 is the Bang & Olufsen high five DAC and M so this is a 32 bit DAC it has its own headphone jack which might turn out a bit confusing because of the headphone jack up here and this is why I put the top of the phone one of the bottom is for 32 bit high five DAC and amber the whole idea with this is that the g5 once you have this plugged in turns into a high five portable media player but these are just the two attachable accessories the two attachable so-called friends is the LG 360 cam which does pretty much what the name suggests it's a 360 camera and there's also new USBC head mounted display it weighs 100 grams it's a little bit more attractive than the usual VR set and also there is a rolling robot it's kind of like this view elbow it's a big bowl that you control with your phone it has a laser pointer it has a camera integrated into it has speakers and a microphone and LG presents it as a home monitoring device / pet care access reason another big new feature is he always on display so the display never goes off it's an IPS display not OLED and consumes not point eight percent of battery power or rout the one thing that LG isn't giving us is any pricing for any of these accessories the big innovation for og is all of these accessories the friends that it's adding on this is what's going to set g5 apart but speaking for myself personally I love the design I love the feel of this phone and I feel with the new and improved cameras the new improved processes as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 inside four gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage micro is the expandability just as a phone this might be one of the more interesting most exciting ones coming out in a long while the LG g5 and all of its friends are going to be coming out in early April we're told around the world but anyhow this is all from the LG g5 and MWC for now but stay tuned to the verge tune into our YouTube channel as well we'll have a whole bunch more from here at MWC that's it
