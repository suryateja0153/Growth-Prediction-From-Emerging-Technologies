 most of you are probably familiar with RGB LED strips you've probably seen them behind desks in tables in a lot of tech videos on YouTube you can see one left behind my desk right now and if you ever shopped for one on Amazon you know there are a ton of options and despite having very different prices they're mostly the same exact thing so I went ahead in bought three units of the same 22 dollar one I'll link it below and I think I found the best option out there if you like cool tech posters check out m/s tech shop comm the current designs are work harder inspired by Casey Neistat tech made out of Tech and a pair of headphones with a sound wave use the link down below to go buy one or don't it's your money the best way to showcase these LEDs is to actually unbox them and show the installation process so let's do that alright so here's their live unboxing and application of the LED strip to the new desk that's going where my best currently is and I'm going to explain this in a bit but it doesn't have that good adhesive so we came up with the solution using staples and prying them out that I'll show you closer right now so we use the staple gun and would staple it in and took a screwdriver and pried it out just a little bit the LEDs will fit through there and I'll hammer back in to hold it tight and that way I don't even need to take the adhesive off of the LED strip because that adhesive really isn't any good if you pay more for an LED strip you can get better adhesive on it or press one depending like 20 bucks for the entire system you're not going to get that good pieces so in box you get your remote which is used to set the colors and whatnot and you also get the receiver which goes with that remote and that also converts the power you get your power cable that goes into this table and then you get the LEDs fish themselves say open up this is what it looks like it's gonna come way longer than you actually need it so I'm going to put it through what I want and then I'm just going to cut it they actually come with these little mounting points you can see right there that's um they're made to be cut at those mounting points let's see if we can get it to focus it even has a little scissor logo they're made to be cut so don't feel like you have to use all of it because if you use too much and it's looping everywhere you can get very annoying to deal with so you find the end tuck it in drop it and you're ready to go so I'm just going to unravel it fully so don't the wheel so as you can see it's really long you do not need that much like unless you're LED stripping like an entire wall so almost um there we go so it's out of the wheel the ends are actually the same they both terminate actually now one is a male one's a female and the power cable into it is female so you need to use the male end on the side that's going to connect to power that was right and all LED strips work RGB LED strips work in a similar manner with these four pins so you take that out that's funny the pins actually came out so now I could use either side if I wanted to okay so start we need to figure out a solution for that yeah why don't we cut one end and that we're not going to use already and then as we turn all the way through yeah all right live live improvisation improv stop p.m. we're not going to use just cut it on where it's set to cut so now we can feed that through and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go all the way down and then loop back and go under as well just to give it kind of twice the strength so it just feeds right through and at the end I'm gonna hammer all these staples in to get in the little tighter fit you want to figure out where we want to put the receiver first um we'll probably go right around over there at around over there okay does that have screw up like yeah you can also screw it in till probably screw it into the desk you do need some patience since it is a rubbery material takes a while to feed through but alright so it is now feeding through fed through and Givens one complication of where to plug it in and our solution was we're going to put the little adapter thing right there and it's stapled and not going anywhere and the receiver part just hangs up here and it goes over so the front of the desk see on the other side I can just reach down and reach this receiver with the remote that goes up and plugs in you can see all this slack cable we had even though we did two runs so what we do with this is we find a cup location you can see it right there and you cut and you just have extra cable which I guess theoretically you could reuse eventually if you just get the four wires but almost like you go trash this is cool so we found out that we know through these remotes because we have to when we actually have a third unit over there but um so this works over there you can see that it changes color over there and then if I move it over here you can see it also works on this one so only one remote control all the lights as long as you have a path to the receiver and the last thing here to do is to take all the staples so I you see the staple right here it's others a little slack hammer it in a little bit and it's secure I'm going to do that for all them and then we're good working looks beautiful as two runs to be a little more powerful than be happier with them installed and everything they look fantastic and I really mean that you can see that they're actually significantly brighter than the IKEA diode or LEDs I have behind my monitor which is fairly impressive considering the IKEA LEDs or twice as expensive they also make for an interesting background when filming b-roll they just add a little bit of spice to what would normally be a pretty vanilla looking shot so they're cheap they look really good and they're easy to install but the single most underrated feature of these LEDs is the synchronization so one remote can control multiple LED strips and I keep my remote on my desk velcro so my guess is they all use the same exact frequency or however means I communicate with the receiver to communicate with receiver so no matter what receiver you're pointing it at a communicate and can control the LEDs of any LED strip as long as you're pointing it at the receiver so if I want to control my LEDs my receiver is down there I'll just point at it and control it change it to red green blue out of them leave it at blue I wanted to control byron's LEDs just point it over there convenience the blue red green phone to control the LEDs of the b-roll table again just point it over there blue red green red whatever so you can control any LED strip with one remote and that's something that's not advertised but it's incredibly useful and it's really awesome that you get that synchronized functionality for such an inexpensive product so that's it for this video I really wasn't even planning on making this video but the quality of these cheap LED systems blew me away for $65 I have a fully synchronized LED lit office that I can change the color with just one remote and that's really impressive especially for that price thank
