 oh wow this doesn't even look like my house we're in Dallas Texas on our way to ginetto Hortons house where they're living dining and work areas bumming her out this couch Apple I'd like 10 years ago well it has seen its years I typically just throw stuff there oh that looks like it's a bit I really need a space where I can come home to decompress and just not even think about the whole day you're gonna give her an inviting space that melts your stress away
