 hey what's up everybody its towels with gadget hacks and this is just a quick little how-to on compass calibration now I've heard a lot of folks complaining about the compass feature being out of whack on some newer Android devices what'll happen is you'll open Maps and try to get Direction somewhere then it'll pop up with a little message saying you need to calibrate your compass but this little demo gif it shows you there isn't really helpful if you actually do what it's telling you to do here your compass will still be out of whack and that message would just pop up again next time so basically it's useless because that's really not the gesture you should be doing instead whenever you're having issues with your compass just open the Google Maps app and you don't have to press any buttons or anything all you really got to do is just wave your phone around in a figure-eight pattern like this and it'll collect all the data it needs to calibrate I'd say do it three or four times or however long you feel like doing it so pretend your phones are glowstick and you're at a rave basically we have that figure-eight pattern should get you all fixed up and your compass should work just fine from now on but for more tips and tricks like this make sure to head over to gadget hacks com and as always we'd appreciate it if you would like and comment on this video and subscribe to our channel so we'll see you again next time folks but until then happy gadget a key
