 hey what's up guys you're watching theater tech and I wanted to talk about a new product that Google announced just the other day at the keynote at Google i/o 2016 and that is a competitor in the smart home assistant devices category called Google home now some of you may be familiar if you saw my other review of Amazon echo it's basically like a Siri in the form of physical speaker that talks to you you can ask a questions control smart home devices that sort of thing and Google is now creating a very similar device that does pretty much the same thing except with a few extra cool features that really only Google can do and it's gonna be called Google home it's like a little speaker looking thing kind of weird I'll talk about that a little bit but first let's talk about what it does as you probably guessed this is gonna be controlled completely by voice they say there are no buttons on the face of it to control it at all maybe one button on the bottom to connect a Wi-Fi or something like that it's gonna be able to do basic stuff like play music manage tasks to-do lists that sort of thing control smartphone devices mostly everything that Amazon echo does as well as for how it looks I'm not really sure how to describe it it's kind of weird-looking obviously I'll show a picture of it here it's kind of like a weird egg-shaped thing I don't know if I like it to be honest I'm really a fan of the Amazon echo design that Amazon show is just a cylinder very sleek very modern minimalistic and Google I guess took a different approach made it kind of rounded corners I don't know if I like that I think it looks kind of weird I'll still probably get it because it's not like I don't like the look of it it's just an odd choice I think it's just kind of weird looking they say can play music so I'm assuming it's a full-range speaker in there and it also has customizable bases for different colors and different textures and that sort of thing still I don't think it's gonna look any better because it's a weird shape but maybe if you like that design you know at least get different colors and customizations for it as for the tech inside the Google home it is a Wi-Fi speaker so it doesn't connect through Bluetooth or anything like that although that is possible it's mainly used to connect to Wi-Fi very similar to how I am on echo does and it streams directly from the clouds so you basically control it with your voice or a phone or whatever and then it downloads that audio stream right from the cloud so it's gonna be high-quality through Wi-Fi it's not like you're just playing through a Bluetooth connection from your phone however if you do want to you can stream to it directly through your phone through google cast and on top of just music it will also let you control other Google cast devices like Google chromecast you'll be able to say play some show and then it will tell the chromecast they'll connect to that also on the Wi-Fi and have it start playing through the chromecast on your TV or whatever so that's really neat I'm really excited about that feature it basically is kind of like a hub to control all your other cast devices so if you want to play through your Google chromecast Audio on your speakers you can do that not just through the Google home speaker little thing itself you can have it on dedicated speakers you can play it on the TV really anything and because you can use it to control other devices you can actually use it for multi room playback so if you want to play music on a certain cast device in your bedroom you can say play music in the bedroom or play music in this room and another room or everywhere all at the same time you can control that all through the one device now in addition to just entertainment you're also going to be able to use it for managing tasks and more productive things like you would expect this would of course include the basics such as timers to-do lists alarms but it also can control other smart devices that it's compatible with such as your thermostats smart light so I'm assuming Philips hue including nest devices which is owned by Google so the nest thermostat or the nest camera all that is gonna be part of the ecosystem and you can control that all through your voice through the Google home it's gonna be like a hub as I mentioned before so it's not just entertainment productivity you can give it commands and then it also ties together all your devices they also said it would be able to order dinner I'm assuming through different apps such as OpenTable perhaps then you can book reservations or have flour sent your house was the example they used so I'm assuming any app or service that lets you motely do orders and order food or order anything really if it's able to connect to Google home and Google supports that service you can control it through Google home as well and if you want you can actually choose to have it get a little bit more personal information perhaps by scanning through your emails so like inbox it'll be able to tell if you have a package coming and if you say when's my package coming it'll know which one you're talking about and you can also get traffic routes and updates every day it'll know your traffic routes just more up-to-date information like that that is very relevant to you and very personal and of course you'll be able to ask it questions and using Google's vast amount of information they've collected from search over the years they'll be able to answer pretty difficult questions relatively for a computer I mentioned in my Amazon echo review say for example you say when was the 44th president born that would be Barack Obama it wouldn't know because it can't make the connections between the 44th president and the birthday it can't get those two pieces of information simultaneously it can answer who's the 44th president and when does Barack Obama born but it can to do both if you ask Google that it can do that it goes and first looks up all right who's the 44th president first of all ok then when was he born and it'll get that information and it will be able to connect those and get context and answer that more smartly so I'm really excited about the information that you can ask Google home and actually get some useful info that you wouldn't be able to from any other devices really another example they used for showing off how smart this AI is for the Google assistant that's what they called it is using follow-up questions so say I said who's the 44th president they'll say Obama and then I can follow that up with another question without even saying Obama I can say well when was he born and then it'll tell me and I didn't have to say when was Barack Obama born again it knows who I was talking about because I just asked him about it and that's a really simple example probably easy even for a computer but there are other situations where context might be pretty difficult for a computer and that is where the computer power of the AI from Google is deaf only gonna come in handy so overall I'm pretty excited about what this is gonna turn out to be it's not out yet it's coming out I believe in the fall they said no price as far as I'm aware although if I had to guess I'd say it's between 100 and 200 hopefully on the lower side when Amazon echo came out it was $100 for prime users and I thought that was a great price now it's closer to 200 I'm not really sure if that's worth it and so hopefully with Google being a better product maybe in the 150 range would be pretty reasonable but that's all speculation so don't quote me on any of those prices I have no idea I think either way I'm gonna try it out if it's not too expensive I think that smart home devices are really useful to me I use them to control Philips hue and set alarms and that sort of thing really helpful always looking for the bigger and better one coming out and I think Google would be the one to make the best one so we'll have to see what they do so you guys can let me know what you think especially with that design what do you guys think about that design because honestly it's kind of weird looking to me I'm not sure I like it I don't dislike it enough to not get it but I think they could have made better choices so we can talk about that down there in the comments section and if you guys want to continue watching I've got some other videos on the right-hand side you can just click those or look in the description for the same link like if you're on a phone and if you guys want to subscribe I usually make videos two or three times a week so it should be worth it I will look forward to hearing from you guys either here in the comments section or on Twitter so thanks for watching I will see you next time have a good one
