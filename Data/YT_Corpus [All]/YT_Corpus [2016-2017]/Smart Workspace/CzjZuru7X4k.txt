 thank you John Thank You Debra it's obvious it's always a privilege to hear from great customers and partners so it's an exciting time ahead for Australian business you just heard how the DTO is in power it has a mission to empower its Australian businesses and how the government's trillion government is helping enable that equally one of the world's largest professional services organizations is onboard and we're really excited about the journey we're going to go ahead together so my name is shirt fennec I head up our solutions engineering team for apps in Asia pack and I'm also excited to have Kaz sattell who's part of our developer advocate team for cloud platform and he'll come up on stage in just a short while so for the next 30 minutes we'd like to talk to you a little bit more about smart technologies so we're gonna shoot a little bit about what machine learning is and how we use it within Google but we're also importantly we want to talk about how you can use these smart technologies within your own enterprise to really drive insight into your unstructured data your structured data to gain more learning but also how machine learning and intelligence and smart technologies are also creating a productivity suite that is much more sophisticated in terms of how how to make your team's work better we're also going to make this come alive with some a couple of demos you just saw them bring something up on stage here so stay tuned for that so data is everywhere data is exploding you feel it in your personal life with all of the photos and files that you have also in your workplace all of the emails all of the content you have for meetings this was this massive information was has been a challenge or you could see an opportunity for Google for maybe the past decade our internal systems and bringing all of this information together you know to process and to store and to do analytics on it we started using traditional and analytical capabilities sequel was no longer keeping up for what we needed to do to index the internet so it was really about not just processing information but really getting understanding from it so we needed to look at different ways how do we understand all these videos these images this audio so that's when we started to bring forward machine learning data together with machine learning is really what delivers insight a machine learning is a way machine learning is a way to gain insights by using predictions and the better you understand the various predictions you have on your data the better you can deliver and make better business decisions or change the the application experience the fit for the consumer or for the end user so there's any bike show of hands does anybody know what this game is on the screen okay right quite impressive so this is the game of Go it's a bit like chess it's a strategy game chess I'm the expert in chess I actually get a little bit nervous when I play Connect for with my five-year-old he's often quite further ahead than me but jazz is a game of strategy that has a number of finite moves it's a so I feel like a tree above system there's something like 15,000 opening moves and then it goes about 7 layers deep after that the game of Gore is very different there's more openings or there's more moves within the game of goal than there is atoms in the universe so it's not something you can just apply computing power to to try and overcome and to try and win so go is the hardest game we know and it was expected that it would take more than 15 years or more for any computer system or knowledge system to - when so that the team at Google called alphago they built a customized system and they trained on the data and he played itself over and over again and about four months ago there was a very exciting announcement where we played the grandmaster and actually won four games five but the point being here is that this is not just about machine learning and an artificial intelligence system just for a game of strategy there's a lot more applications that we're really excited about for so we're starting to really see now a lot of applications that are using machine learning as the underpinnings for how it can really impart a great user experience you can see up here there's photos translate and also in box so Google photos show fans who uses Google photos yeah lots a lot more of a stain so Google photos it it's used it's powered by machine learning if you look at your own photographs maybe take hundreds or thousands of those photographs know what Google photos can do is it can scan these photos for and identify things like faces objects situations so now we know you can do a search for say something like a Border Collie you know a type a dog and what we can do now is we can detect that as a breed whether it's a puppy whether it's ten years old but it's got long hair whether it's just being shaved so this is this is quite incredible also the power of this is that what we can do now is once it's learned how to understand to look for a particular breed it can go over the data again and then find other breeds so it's learning and learning and becoming more powerful I'm sure there's many of you here that use Gmail and also probably mbox so the feature called Smart reply is something again it's powered by machine learning it's looking over your email as you reply and it's very thoughtfully and consciously proposing three suggested answers it may be yeah I think that's perfect that looks great I like it and you can use that what we're now actually seeing is is that 10% of Gmail is Gmail to Gmail so just with one click of a button you know you can have a response to that so we're getting excited about the type of applications that no polling the user experience using these smart technologies and look this is this is how we're thinking thoughtfully and considerately about using intelligence across the rest of Google and it's any large-scale system that using this type of machine intelligence to look at how it can improve the end-user experience by taking onboard those helping improve those decision-making stages within within the application itself it's not just about things like photos Gmail and translate there was also very recent announcement that we made of how we were using machine machine and smart technologies within our data centers so we've now taken as an introduce that where we're starting to look at how we can optimize our computer resources and also things like our infrastructure our cooling systems and what we've seen is that we have had a 15% percentage improvement and our PUA which is our power utilization efficiency is basically how better we're getting at managing the amount of energy for our servers versus support mechanisms that come from things like cooling so this is very exciting we're applying this type of smart technology to lots of different use cases but what does it mean for the enterprise you guys so you might think about it in this way structured data on one side unstructured data on the other side so structured data is the world that you're very familiar with it's things like your purchase orders and your ERP system it's like your customer records in your CRM system it's your relational database your emails this is a world you're very familiar with and for decades we've been applying typical storage and analysis and looking back at the past what's happened unstructured data is a little bit different it's your images your videos it's your clickstream data this is a world that Google's grown up with a lot and has a lot of experience with an inner cloud platform this is where we've had trained model and have delivered and externalized these four year ability to use for things like speech and for vision to look at all of your images it's a world that we've got a lot of data on it so that's where we can train our models and then expose them to you to use but on a structured side as well indeed our machine learning we believe will be very powerful but I think what's really exciting is where we can bring these both of these worlds together so both your structured data and your unstructured data and we think there can be a lot of insights that we can apply to these data sets to make better decisions and actually one of the demos we're going to show in just a short while is going to show exactly what that might look like but it's not just about data it's not just about underlying data sets it's also about your applications so how can a smart technology also be applied to what you users today your teams today could be using right now or in the future so what we see here is how machine learning can be started to be applied to areas to help make your applications your team's more predictive more automatic and more natural so let's take each one what could this look like for you so I'm sure many of you are living in a world of spreadsheets I was just talking to a customer just a little bit earlier on in the company in the retail space they say you know you know all we do spend loads and loads of times and spreadsheets I'm sure everybody's got a different view of what all of that data might look like what's on the x-axis what's on the y-axis what do I do you know what's my view of all of this what data do I look at I'm sure the finance team ops team have got a different view as well well what we have now is is we have a feature which is just one click and sheets which you can use called Explorer and what that does is underlying your data in the cloud that basically suggests the right format and the right set of data and then proposes these beautiful charts so everybody becomes a smart analyst within your organization more automatic this is where you're running to a customer meeting you're like ok where were the meeting notes I had with faired or the last time I met with them what was the present I was about to use with him where's the location what's the calendar details the address I'm going to would it not be so much better if somebody was being a proactive assistant and helping surface all of that up at once well that's we were very excited to announce something called Google springboard just a couple of months ago and it does exactly that for you it's your little proactive assistant everybody's got a PA now it surfaces up all your content across the Google Apps platform presents it to you the time you need it when you need it and we're very excited about that more natural so what's the best way to communicate probably speech right I'm a pretty fast taper but you know when you're on your mobile phone it's very hard going through even you know a keyboard they're much easier just to use your voice so we've got a lot of experience in natural language processing and speech recognition so again your data is in the cloud we can use this empower this to make smarter technologies for you to use so just as the in this is just an example of Google Docs where you just press one button and it starts typing everything out we know translate we can do this in over 80 languages so we're bringing smarter technologies cloud services and intelligence to the platform and we're really excited what I could do for you for your teams and also for businesses okay enough for me on this let's see it in action I'd love to be able to bring our pair cars please and we've got two demos that are going to showcase some of the things I just talked about what you guys Thank You Stuart hi everyone I'm Col Sato I'm a developer advocate for Google cloud platform so he uh tried to show two interesting demonstrations here these are based on the product called cloud machine learning api's starting from Russ December we have started externalizing the power of the machine intelligence we have been developing at Google to external customers and developers and the first product is the cloud machine learning a psg-1 product what we have here is crud vision API which is which provides the image recognition uploaded the photos and pictures to the cloud you can then apply the API to get universes result the second product is called crud natural language API that can analyze the natural language text like a Spanish Japanese English and analyzing the meanings of the languages in Centauri in a few seconds the third product is called crud speech API that provides you the high quality voice recognition technologies via API so let's take a look at the interesting demonstration here the first demonstration is called crowd vision Explorer where we have imported over 80,000 images into Google cloud and apply the analysis space by using the cloud vision API so in this soccer galaxy we have many cluster of images and each dot inner in the the cluster represents a thumbnail of images so if you take a closer look at the annual fee of any of the cluster then you'll be seeing lots of the thumbnails of images is showing popping up just like this this must be a plane of the day picture of the airplane and now please imagine that you're working at an apparel company in a fashion industry and you are asked to collecting a thousand rupee the images of Clovis and we're from the social medias and you are asked to put the tags or categories on those collected images what would you do do you want to hire tens of people to sorting out all the Clovis and whales by manually instead you can start using a cloud vision API to take advantage of the machine intelligence by developed by Google so that but by sending this particular image to the API you'll be receiving Gigi already at your level such as clothing and jacket in the river and formal wear actually this is enough for me where but sorry yeah sometimes they make makes a mistake but but anyway yeah you don't have to hire tens of people instead you can just call and send an image to the crowd that's all also if you send another images like this here you can have the Arabians getting from the API right clothing cocktail dress dress yeah if I I just like that and what what would you do with those result and not only having the machine-learning analyzing those antic unstructured data you can also take advantage of those power power of the G machine learnings by using Google spreadsheet write this by with a few clicks on the Google spreadsheet you can easily import all the analysis to result in a disparate feed but this oh yeah here works and also you can easily can create some charts based on the analysis result so this is the property missing intervenors you don't have to have people understanding the in the contents of the images and the audience and natural text instead you can have computers understanding the images so that was my first demonstrations Resta Kolkata the second demo switches that is called crowd revision pot we have a Raspberry Pi based robot here yes yes this is the robot this is actually a commercial product called Gokaiger which has the Raspberry Pi with motors and wheels and I have written a few hundreds of lines of code to send a picture with its camera here it has a camera and send the images to the API and so the API will be returning the university without in a few seconds and what he can do is detecting the detecting the faces around him and it's emulsion so if you if you are REME faculty council is not working and this is the web console objects this robot so you'll be able to see what she's we are looking at right now so if you go here then he should be able to see my face here you go so you can see by what rectangle you can tell that the he's recognizing my face here and if you're smiling at hints it is programmed to follow a smiley face but the thing is you have to be really smart it cannot be a fake smile because the deep learning technology is smart enough to detect a fake smile and actually my sign is really great at doing this but I'm not good at it but that's right maybe he thinks this is a fake some I have why it's not working here mmm-hmm somehow it's not this is our it's not working here let me try again I think we have a few more minutes yeah here you go sir you see the green rectangle finally I got it yeah and also we have some other interesting features based on the vision API so if you put things right this so what is this what does it look like oh I have to turn on the speaker yes no no is its person but how about this it's plant yes did he no no that wording plan did you hear it lover is finally I got it yes post cap automobile yeah and how's this what a Ferrari SpA what is this painting gracias did you hear yeah so just like that so this is the power of the machine he because I was using kind of low resolution camera here so sometimes it makes mixes but actually the API itself is very has the high accuracy so it's now ready to be used for you solving your own business right now so please take a look at the product if you have interest so that was my demonstration thank you so much awesome I mean that's thank you for the big round of applause there for cars because doing a live demo like that is not easy but I think that was really funny we were joking we're talking a little bit earlier that we were taking with on the basis of having intelligence too when go why don't we just send it off to the casinos but I heard every scap'd in his room okay thank you guys so just to summarize on this and our discussion about smarter technologies in the workplace you know where that's really exciting point in time over what intelligence like this can really do to solve not only big problems but also how we can bring that into the enterprise I also think you know where that's really important point tipping point in terms of clothes and how enterprises are very quickly moving to the cloud and entrusting their data in a very secure place but then that just really opens up whole new opportunities in terms of moving away from how you typically thought about doing analytics to know using things like intelligence to really protect what you can do going forward so today you may be spending a lot of time storing and analyzing your data and looking at the past what I encourage and invite you to do is to work with us and talk with those with their partners to start thinking about what you can do tomorrow to start using some of these great capabilities this is game-changing stuff in terms of how you think about data bring together your unstructured data your structured data and then start thinking about what you can do in the future and changing the way you make business decisions that impact you and your customers and whole new ways there's no other capability out there in the market that were applying to these big problems that we can bring this also to use well that's really exciting and then just also as well in terms of productivity of your teams don't just think about productivity tools and and the way you've worked with them before think about the intelligence and how you can really make the broader set of your teams that much smarter they've got access to these great capabilities and empower them as well not just a few individuals
