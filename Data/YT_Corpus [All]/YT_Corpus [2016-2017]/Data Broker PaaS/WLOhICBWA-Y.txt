 hi welcome to cloud computing and Microsoft Azure I am Rohit sub Luke these chase cloud computing is the birds Verlin i tivo'd know if stuff is talked about it but only few people understand it properly so today we will try to understand what really cloud computing means how it is different from the traditional way we have been using computers are we already using cloud computing or we have to do something special to use cloud computing also we will see what kind of services are provided by cloud computing and finally we will have a look at one of the popular cloud computing service provider called Microsoft Azure so let's start so what we mean by cloud computing cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing resources over the Internet and what we mean by computing resources computing resources include the hardware the physical machine which contains the CPU the harness the network connections the internal memory which basically runs our programs then we have the software which are the applications that we use to perform some specific kind of work commonly the most common of them are like the browser web browser Internet Explorer Chrome then we have Microsoft Office the next year's data the data we normally store not hardest so normally all this surface on a physical machine which is residing next to us in case of cloud computing or most of most of this thing is in some machine which is residing in a data center far away from us and can be exist over the internet so the actual CPU power the hard instead is storing our data our data and even the software that we normally have installed on our system is on that data center machine we just connect to internet and access all those resources from our from a thin client which we have so so so it's like so normally what we have to do is like when we have to use a computer before you use a computer we buy that hardware machine whilst all our software's so now in this case we'd simply rent it out from the cloud service provider so we asked a cloud service provider ok I need this much CPU power this much face of hardest and you can charge me this much money per month so we just simply rent it rather than buy so basically cloud computing enables us to consume computer resources as a utility which is similar to electricity we don't need to have a system that generates electricity because rent it same is like of renting out ourselves flat rather than buying a home let's see this image they may choose what kind of things or services are available on a cloud system the services can be categorized into infrastructure platform and applications the infrastructure includes the hardware resources the platform includes the software platform that I used to build and run applications and the application area are the software's that a common end user uses for his work and which we were earlier normally installing and running on our own system all these resources are in the cloud or we can say internet and we and we can connect to these and use these resources through various kind of devices which can be phones smartphones laptops servers are these jobs and the tablet how does the cloud campaign provide all these resources do they deploy a separate machine whenever user ask for it so it's not like that the cloud company has huge systems so whenever a user asked for us machine a new instance of virtual machine with specific kind of configuration is created inside that system so basically we are sharing a pool of resources which are in the data center of the cloud company similarly for memory the hard disk which stores our data they don't really have a separate hardest for us they simply create a new storage area inside a huge space so basically we are getting our bit of resources from a huge shared resource pool you how is the user experience different in case of cloud so let's see how we have been traditionally using the computers for a home user we generally have a standalone desktop or a laptop computer in office similarly we could have a standalone desktop computer or maybe we are connected to a back-end server machine which may provide a lot of hardest space and many of the software's in case of cloud the home user now doesn't really need to have the complete CPU power or the storage area in his standalone computer a lot of that stuff can be moved to the cloud the harder storage area the software applications so he can simply have a thin client which has some basic computing power same a simple operating system to run on it so we can see like we have smartphones these days the tablets now and the main CPU power and the detail is available on the cloud you can simply connect to the cloud and then open your applications on the web and start using it for the office we will see later like how the organization moves all of its resources that were currently were the backend of now we will see what kind of services are provided by the cloud in Howard Isolde next the cloud services can be divided into three major areas these are infrastructure and the service platform as a service and software and the service the infrastructure and the service includes the resources which are like hardware resources these are like the CPU power the machines the storage area the network then the platform in the service is kind of the software platforms which are required by software developers to build their applications on and later run them so for example these can be the databases the Java Runtime dotnet framework the middleware the web servers the kind of things and in software the service these are the end-user applications so these can be like email application a world application office applications so for example Gmail is one kind of software as a service you will now see the three cloud service models in detail the first one is is it is infrastructure and the service it is the virtual delivery of computing hardware basically the nut and bolt of computing it includes the processing power we can say it as virtual machines and the storage area and the nut network the virtual machine means that it's not an actual physical machine but behaves like a physical machine it gets its bit of power from a huge shared system similarly is case of storage so you don't have a separate instance of hardest you don't have a separate hardest you have us your bit of space from a huge system so what are the typical consumers for these services they are the business organizations with news need huge servers actually they have been only having few systems in their own data centers but now they want to move to cloud since it makes more economical sense so how does it work now basically the working model so the organization's data centers and networks are now move to the cloud they don't really have to buy any hardware resources they rent it from the cloud vendor rather than buying the equipment is now owned and maintained by the cloud service provider so the maintenance staff and all that the origin doesn't have to take care about it all the maintenance backup security is taking the case clearer by the service provider what are the benefits for such a system now you don't have to decide like what kind of a system you have to initially buy you can just start with a small one then scale up and down as and when required you don't need to set up infrastructure in your own leader centers you don't have to maintain all those James and then you are basically renting out the system so you pay as per the use these provide a number of cost economical benefits to the organization taking service area in spas which is platform-as-a-service these are the services that provide environment to develop run and manage applications the services included all tools for design and development for example Visual Studio Eclipse then we have web hosting services with it's like web servers we have software frameworks which are dotnet framework Java Runtime then we have services for team collaboration which is the affairs github then we have dinner management system like SQL assure a typical consumer for passes application developers so how we use these services so for a developer development environment is now present online instead of his own computer he writes the code debug set online the chicken checkout happens remotely on the cloud since the kface github repositories are present there the data storage and access on virtual server versus online which is like the databases the web servers these are present on the cloud systems when we build the application the tests and employment happens on the cloud servers some of the benefits for searcher system is that you can work from anywhere then the platform applications you will have the latest versions for them anything that has been introduced new inter system you will be immediately getting access to it finally we have sass which is software-as-a-service these are the application or software services that are made available to customers over Internet the difference is that earlier we used to install and run the software applications on our system but now these software applications are hosted and they run on remote servers which we simply open them on browser or some web-based environment and use it so any application that is available on internet for example Facebook Gmail Twitter these all our sauce applications nowadays many of the desktop applications have been moved to web for example office on organizations can use the south's model services to move their applications that were earlier hosted in their intranet system and move them to Internet the benefit here is that it's now available from anywhere and from any kind of device the benefit is that you don't have to be on a VPN for the Ordnung a typical consumer for these services is a common Internet user or our translation employee who has been using the applications internally now how do we use these applications it's quite simple basim the user simply connects to the internet runs the browser opens applications and starts using it so whenever the user may be present if the user has an internet exists then he can use that application without the need to install an application on the citizen some of the benefits for this is you can access the application from anywhere anytime you don't need to install it you don't need any upgrades or patches and you have cross device compatibility what kind of people are using these services the users can be categorized into major linked to three kinds first I'll either our infrastructure and network architects these are the people who create servers manage them many the connections network connections in data centers these these people are the main consumers for the IIST services second one is our the application will purse these users use mainly the platform and the service for the development environment and running and deploying the applications the third kind are the common users who have been running applications using them for a long time these mainly used the SAS services and then and use it through the in the diagram shows clearly which kind of users are standing where let's now see what kind of cloud deployment models are there the first one is the public which is like open to everyone anyone can get resources from a public club so publicly accessible this is a publicly accessible crowd environment it is owned by and operated by a third party cloud Croydon so they run it for their own it's a business for them and they run it for making money out of faith the second one is private cloud this belongs to a specific single organization so normally the organization is all have been having their own data centers with their own servers and back in but basically the cloud architecture was not there in that case so people still needed to have some thick lines and alone desktop laptop systems to use it now the cloud makes it possible for them to use a thin client in any device and from they can access this cloud from anywhere so everything that was on internet earlier now it's available on internet also a large part of compute power and data storage has moved to the server site rather than to their own test oh these this cloud may be managed by the organization itself or some third party company the next one is the community cloud the comic community cloud is controlled and managed by a group of entities or organizations they have common objectives and concerns which allows them to share the resources and the infrastructure these are common things could be like the security the policy considerations this cloud it makes more sense for for these companies rather than a private cloud because it's more cost effective and the shared resource allows them to easily scale up and scale down as required another one is the hybrid cloud this is a cloud system which is comprised of two or more different deployment models so one could be public and one could be private so some organizations may have their own private cloud but may also use a public cloud this is because of some security applications data critical applications may be press them would like to put it in private cloud and some more more common one they would like to put in public cloud which allows them to scale and have scale down easily so these four models are the most major ones what are the advantages of using cloud the first one is cost saving normally organization with large of network of computers offices in different regions they have to man create and manage their own data centers the data centers for having huge servers and in a big IT staff to manage all moving to cloud allows reduction in cost of owning and operating computers and networks also in many cases organization doesn't know how big servers it needs what will be the future needs so initially in cloud they can start with a low upfront cost and have minimum number of servers later on as required they can scale up also the purchasing and installing all the system takes time in case of cloud this will be a rapid deployment and as such rapid entry turn on in with another benefit is scalability the organization can start with a small deployment and move up or down as required this scaling up and down is fairly rapid and they doesn't take much time and so you don't waste on tank also you can configure the system you have the flexibility to use extra resources at peak times so uh depending on the traffic the web traffic you can ask the cloud vendor to add more systems or reduce them according to the traffic another benefit is reliability the cloud vendor creates multiple redundant sites for your application also it provides backup of the data and services so that in case of disaster the business continuity continues and the data can be recovered east another benefit is in the area of maintenance in cloud the service provider does the system maintenance so the organization does not need to maintain a huge number of IT resources to provide systems support also to the end-user since you are using software the service the application is hosted on web and excesses through API so you don't have to install each of the applications on each user's system separately and manage the licensing accessibility since cloud is available over Internet your users can access the applications use them work on them from anywhere anytime this kind of system improves improves productivity of your company's employees the employees can work from anywhere and anytime so if there is something critical then they don't really need to be in the office they can work from anywhere and do the complete data also whenever new innovations or new features are added to to the cloud they are immediately available to everyone every use this slide shows the major public cloud vendors in the market today although every few days a new cloud vendor is getting added but still dealer the major ones first one is the Amazon Web Services then we have Microsoft Azure Google and Salesforce you have a basic understanding of cloud computing the kind of services it provides let's look at a popular cloud vendor Microsoft and sure what is insure insurance Microsoft's cloud computing platform and it is a public cloud system anyone can go and rent out services from here I sure runs on a worldwide network of Microsoft many tieran centers across 22 regions this is the azure official site I would suggest everyone to go and have a look at this site it provides lot of information on what kind of services are available what they mean and how they will help you in in your work a lot of fortune 500 companies are currently using Microsoft edge make sure provides a whole lot of services these services are segregated into the standard models like infrastructure services and platform services the infrastructure services include the compute storage and networking Hill compute provides the raw processing power and includes virtual machines the storage provides the raw raw storage areas and it's implemented in terms of blob storage as your files etc in networking we have virtual network we have load balancer DNS we have gateway support etc in the platform services side the most common ones are the developer services and the web and mobile services well per services provide the visual studio online the team project services like TFS github the web and mobile services include deploying and running of web applications then we have support for other applications like mobile apps logic apps API apps next we have the data services which includes fasciculation reader base we have document DB we have really sketchy we have tables this is for storing and manipulating structured data the analytics and IOT are becoming popular areas in IT world and the data analytics these states huge amount of data is being generated from different sources the search engines and become they generate huge amount of data which needs to be analyzed for marketing and other engagement so we have big data these days big data support is provided in assuring terms of HD insight then we have IOT which is Internet of Things so in coming days everything will be on internet your television your fridge even your electric appliances all will be on internet and they would be generating huge mount of data so that services can be provided for them both analytics and IOT services will be required for them and after they have supported an issue there are some other services also like media and CDN integration etc let's see each of these in detail we will now look at insured services in detail the first one is compute services this is for online processing power in terms of ayats we can consider it as a virtual machine so instead of buying a machine you can have an instance of a virtual machine which has a configuration as required by you in terms of pass the compute services are the application development services so these are fully managed platforms for professional developers in case of sauce the compute services like how much you are using the application and how much storage you may be using value links off the diagram here shows how much control you have on the services in different models so in case of eyes you will simply get a virtual machine managing that virtual machine will be up to the end-user so you will simply have kind of an Hardware you will install your own operating system you will have your own applications and data either stored there in case of platform-as-a-service you will also be provided with the operating system the framework development frameworks the runtimes the only things that you will have control over is the applications that you are welding and the data attack to it in case of software as a service you don't really manage anything the everything is managed by the vendor the mixed media services student services in terms of eyes you can simply think it like a raw data storage area which we can say as a sure Drive then this blob storage which is in terms of like storing files large objects which can be made it's videos and other stuff this kind of storage is for unstructured data to support structure data there are services available in us the first one is like the queue which stores and map stores messages in queues then we have tables with a survey Windows Azure implementation of a non sequel database then we have secured SQL Azure which is a hosted version of SQL Server which exposes many but not all of its feature another one is free discussion which is in memory data structure stored uses a database cache and message broker next we come to network services these services include virtual networks which is like the representation of your own network in the cloud then we have load balancer the purpose of load balancer is to distribute traffic across a number of servers so let's say you have a website and the traffic here is huge so one system may not be sufficient for handling all the traffic so we can have multiple system which have the same hosted web application the load balancer decides which server to distribute the traffic based on how much the server is being used currently we also have VPN gateway which connects the on-premises networks to assure through site-to-site VPN then we have traffic manager the Traffic Manager improves the availability and responsiveness of applications it provides automatic fail over capabilities compute data and network services are the core services of computing now we see the dwell per service these services are applicable more to Swift software developers the teams that work on developing a software together basically these services allow us to build and operate applications the services include visual studio team services these includes the development tools like Visual Studio Eclipse IntelliJ and even your own ID then we have version control software's which is like git for distributed version control team foundation version control for centralized version control other than that make sure also provides services for continuous integration so whenever Wilbur's are taking in their code they can automatically configure it to build the application validate and then deploy the application once the application is deployed performance testing can be automatically started on them so this will do or something like cloud-based load testing other than that program management tools like a child's team tools can burn scrum through which you can capture prioritize and track work are also available in a Peter Asher services web and mobile this service provides everything that you need to build and run web and mobile applications for any platform and any device there is support for various kind of applications the first major one among them is web applications it provides services for creating such applications like the development environment the software frameworks the web server and the backend data sources you can build and test these applications on cloud and finally deploy them so that they can be accessed over Internet it can automatically scale up and down so when you have large traffic on your website more servers will get added and load balancer will distribute the traffic to web servers and then when traffic is slow it will automatically reduce the server the next one we can have a look at is mobile applications these are for developing applications that can be accessed from mobile phones then we have ap applications these are the clock cloud API which can be called from Internet and the one we have as function applications these are lightweight functions that respond to events across asure on-premises and stash providers so for now we have got enough for theoretical knowledge let's look at some real stuff so how do we go in rent out these services let's look at the sure portal so we start with logging into the sure portal with our account when we log into the portal we will be shown the services that we can rent out so as we can see here we have number of services like websites virtual machine' cloud service SQL databases so in this way we can rent out these services so for example we went we can create virtual machines we can create virtual networks we can use cloud services we can set up storage accounts and we can define websites and so on to create a virtual machine we will simply need to select the virtual machine and we will show some steps which we have to follow the steps will ask us for the configuration of the machine which will include the processing power the memory the operating system and then we will be shown like what would be the cost of that machine in this way after few steps we will have the virtual machine up and running in few minutes so that's such an easy task so if you see so so currently asher has two versions of the portal the first one is Azure management portal this is the old one and this is the newer one which is assure preview portal they sure preview portals currently does not contain all the features which are available in Azure management portal but this features are slowly being added this image shows the new a sure portal which is called a sure preview portal so we can just have a look at this bottle it has geography chol map of the world which is showing the data centers and how they are running it has the marketplace area the marketplace shows like what kind of software's are available the billing part so billing shows how many credits you are left how many days you are left so as forth and we can go to the azure portal from here and start renting out the services so it's this is kind of quite easy to use I share subscriptions let's see how we pay for these services Ashur provides a number of subscription options to use these subscription options you must first have either a Microsoft personal account or a work/school account let's see some of the most common subscription options first one is a free trial the link to use this free trial you will have to go to the issuer website and sign up for a free trial option this will give you some dollar credits in a month to try out any combination of resources in a sure if you exceed your credit amount your trial will be suspended and it says this is totally free so you can go and try this out the second one is prepaid subscription here you prepay for a show services for a month or for a period of 12 month and you can receive a 5 percent discount on SEO services the minimum purchase amount is six thousand dollars next option is pay-as-you-go with this subscription you pay for what you use by attaching a credit card or a debit card to the account so whenever you use some rent out some service the amount for that service will be created debited from your card next one is enterprise agreements with an enterprise agreement you commit to using a certain amount of services in Asscher over the next year and you pay that amount ahead of time so these are some of the options for paying for the services I hope now you have a better understanding of cloud computing this was just a basic introduction so that even a common computer user can get an idea on what it means this session will prepare you to go and explore advanced cloud concepts thanks for giving your time all the best and take care
