 I could know everyone there is a full session start from my ntt data stat itouch cross perform for IOT designing evaluating large-scale data collecting and storing platform my name is Georgie mera that come from Japan and I'm happy to join the opposite oximeter in Austin and I've being presented just similar title on the Tokyo summit and i'd like to share our experience in this half years progress adventure in keynote in the journals and won the open stalker is coming to be the new stage and that just on the virtual machines orchestration of the crowd not only so the next the open stock is a become big software and we had support the diversity of IT systems today i will share the our trial to implement iot project IOT platform on the project and focus on the problem we are faced on the process on our IOT project ok tickets every times exclaim words that this is for informative a presentation so about us who won I'm humira the projector dip dealer and directing the OpenStack to new IOT platform this is a memory an auto annatto is a chief architect on that this project and leading a variation and the designing of the platform and ug ug is not come here but his grey engineer for implementing everything for the his good articles the weird also pressured the sector in the empty data corporation in other words the many open study guides and I'm eccentric on the opposite shift to implementing the cloud storage of the mobile carriers mail system or the other vaca carriers OpenStack system and the next to our team we have the opposite Hadoop team and they have the deep knowledge of the opposite hard oops bug and the young are the etc our main target in this project is a grotto technology and accessory for or OpenStack and abstract saved ship dock and disagree a challenging wonderful poker and also we are interested in the automation of IT platform as I share our experience in the killing brewery companies enterprise system in the last Tokyo submit they use the OpenStack and we are helped to the browser open stock with automation system then today I'll share that challenge was a IOT in this presentation the agenda is a t3 at first overview of the project on the next IOT platform we design is described on the last the evaluation and IOT platform on opens OpenStack as you may know I OT is a buzzing in the market and everything is connected to the internet now in our vision everything is connected to the net but the it is sometimes not internet or the private network but everything become collected almost computers the connected to the internet in nowadays and also smart devices but then recent days many consumer electronics is connected to internet and the medical genetics vendors up released new a feature connected connection in the home electronics next five or ten years are collected to be collected to car era will be become and this is a big impact for the IOT systems and the recent day construction machines like komatsu is a very a folk famous with a success story of the IOT system IOT enables data gathering coloring over the internet then many business users think oh let's collect everything then we can earn more money we can provide more good service but there is a good big issue for the iodine IOT platform everyone want to do big data analysis with IOT but gathering data from everything is not easy work nger know but biscuit person sometimes forget this so we are trying to this issue in our platform we are already implement the IOT platform for other SP style cross service star in for the sensor network we're is the public service on the October last year and the connect the many sensors for the water processing companies we use the technology for the this sensor network to using OpenStack Swift and Amazon s3 style obvious of storage and the implementer on the hybrid cloud public and private hybrid cloud also last year budding the new keyword industry fall from germany and europe and f word every fear the robot in the smart factory generate many many data for the system this is a big challenge for us to gatherings that such a big big big data to correcting gathering storing the system we are already experienced in the sun limited impact social influence system like a bender machine connection well as not factories some some small a POC of small factory or sensor networks and the last year we helped some utility company a power what gas company to arise a smart meter for the Japan market today we try to realize the huge impact to social influence system like a smart city smart grid connected vehicle this system will be deal with so many huge data so many cards is connected there are billions of car in the world wide is exists now and that will be depressed to the collected version current vehicles then every year millions of car newly connected to the system this is our target and we are try to theorize this demand on the our system I tell me just now there are four key element on the eye for IOT service of course there are most important things is a business applications to provide the value-added service for the customer value and the users but to realize the platform our system we need the IOT platform implements theater receiver dieterich data store under data analysis platform a Daedric is a new keyword for the story storing data like a stretch HFS Hadoop but this is concept of the every data it stood in sus some theaters lake and then moved the necessary data to analyze platform they analyze it so data lake is a stores stop rates also everything data on here to our target and the potential customers via demand is a very huge man for collection 1 million concurrent connections should be deals in the platform for the performance 10,000 are over transaction plus circus and second should be treated in the data receiver and very surprisingly a hundred petabyte paths over in the month this is this would be become in the next three or five years in that smart grid or connected bigger is released on the consumer market our goal is frost Act IOT platform on using the OpenStack from data center luck network to upper is meter we're connecting software and application and data analysis to every seam using OpenStack and related open source software ok then I'll change the talk with not from not all of the detail of the platform hi I'm an outer form entity data ok let me talk about a yacht approach from a technology perspective and before talking about sir IOT platform I will actually mention about IOT data in January IOT data has three key features there's the volume and variety and as a huge mentioned the scale over our target is a mission critical system and the performance demands are like this one for example IOT platform has to process 10gbps has to establish one mega conquer concurrent reconnections has to store hundred petabytes per data and have to support hundred date formats and so on then let me describe I'll go on the next slide so these are our goal we have defined three goals along to three key measures which are based on general demands in our target the first goal is warming concurrent reconnections you're cheaper tom has to establish MQTT connections between devices at the same time the second goal is 50 cured transaction per sec the platform has also received and processed advantage of MQTT messages without the packet losing its big challenge the last goal is five gigabyte per sec it has capability of data storage which can be stored by making a bipod sick that it will itself we have developed and operated IOT platform on our testing environment the last fiscal year from next slice let me talk about our testing environment we have a very edgy IOT platform on biometric and crowd testbed objective testing on PR network test bet is to do hardware benchmarking on physical servers on the other hand testing on crowd test methods to duel scale been drinking on the crowd ad re we should construct an test a IOT platform on full testing environment to achieve our target however we have tested on minimal physical and the crowd environment like this one due to time and resource limitations unfortunately and we have actually choose a ver else at RBS which is compatible comparable as open stuck in this testing so this is a detail of the instances and hardware devices for testing we have estimated the number of instances and hardware devices based on result of our hardware sizing yeah the number of key points of our testing environment is sleep the first one is 10 Gigabit Ethernet work the second point is here's memory cell point is many number of hobbyist drivers in our use cases IOT proteome has to process around five sorry L 50 cure messages pass hack yes violet would be a long 10 Gigabit Ethernet it's a huge heavy traffic and this is a component of our UT platform which can be plugged down mainly two elements data Shiva and dead like first data deceiver has three components connection gateway broker and receiver the second date like has also components cash converter and accumulator and dead store today so Apple territory we can share any test results on some ndaa but from this slide we can we would like to share your knowledge and experience about IOT proton how to realize I to perform on OpenStack before I'm speaking about how to realize the IOT propanol OpenStack I'm asking to you guys I OT it's just an use case on top stack what is the OpenStack OpenStack is just a curse of the where your partner yes what is IOT IOT is a just application completely now we believe IOT must build an infrastructure to support future in the internet so OpenStack supports part of the future infrastructure right we have seriously considered how to realize IOT platform hardware opens Dec so today we want to share the technical results requested for OpenStack and to-do items of OpenStack from next okay let me share technical requests for OpenStack for a while experience we have a file requests let's get talked about them one by one from next slide the first one as we mentioned we are challenging to realize IOT platform for mission-critical earlier some of the characteristics of missing curricula system or our target are hyborean and heavy traffic in our use case IOT proton has to process lon of 50 clear messages per sex as I mentioned just wild light would be a long chain gigabit ethernet so the number of challenges for IOT platform and infrastructure learning IOT platform is to the one is to receive messages from data souls Saturday in spite of heavy Latrobe o'clock DDoS attack the another one is the another is to store messages to data to a laboratory so we'd like to ask the infrastructure OpenStack with learning IOT platform to be supported I or guaranteed about network and slate this is fast very graceful OpenStack the second Liga's is feature of messaging blocking as you know OpenStack has already supporter message it's cute jacket but we are happy if over States supports not only support message queues but all services broken because perhaps based answered synchronous i/o and feature of the training tasks if work as faith popper to Layla is high scalability and flexibility moreover we are happy very happy if the message broker of a future OpenStack support multiple protocol for IOT nqs control this is a second request the satirist is management integration in the other IOT use case we need to care we need to care how we should manage not only computer resources of IOT platform that also computer resources of edge devices we are opening stack users like to do unified manage of all over computer associates by OpenStack do to reduce to operational costs the next 24 slickest is application performance monitoring in other words we will direct as openstax to support data gathering and data visualization data visualizing for application monitoring as we mentioned our i OT profile has mainly seed features to forstman needs data receiver the second one is state lake and southern is dead Eliza's this means different characteristics application are learning on the same platform therefore it is necessary to be able to monitor how to sorry how much load has happened on the horror of IOT platform and the part of the IOT platform to use Hardware resource effectively so we would like to monitor not only hardware and os the status that also application status we are happy OpenStack can provide any framework like elasticsearch frontier or qivana to gather and visualize an application log on OpenStack the last liquid is easy to manage data stores and et al niño to use case we have till requests the one is OpenStack can provide various data stewards for data analysis applications own convenience to another is OpenStack can provide any framework to use ETL feature easily et al currently it might be needed for combination data stores it is a kind of the inventor includes a wheel in other words it is a waste of time so we'd like to ask OpenStack to suppose any common framework about et al we believe this is useful for IOT use case okay these are redic our latest for OpenStack and then we have imagined an IOT infrastructure refracting out Jesus liquids let me show you the architecture on the next slide before I show our new architecture let me show the old man this is sold in the last OpenStack damage Tokyo so and then so this is a new architecture reflecting our request for OpenStack mainly update point our paws container connection gate array is monitoring authentication and authorization and ed airport ok about first container an edge management these are because we are considering how integrate its computing and ground computing about connection gateway this component has to process heavily traffic around 10 gbps result just murdered router might be accommodate all latest from our use case so we changed from the using power to router to connection gateway the last one is et al yeah ethier is important in IOT use cases I mentioned then we be ensured that our architecture mapping on current OpenStack this is our architecture mapping on OpenStack first container is corresponding to heat and Magnum you know a part of each gateway and the connection gateway our new turn berger current data only support mmm q naught message is broken taraba looks good for our architecture we are happy if tratas takes care of ETL future also so holla also looks good for us Swift is of course is great for us it is just fit to our architecture and then today we want to share five axonal items that OpenStack should do to be used for IOT use cases from our experience we are happy if we can contribute to a prospective diversity through this presentation okay let me share to the list for OpenStack to be useful in IOT use cases we describe five items let's get talked about them one by one from next slide as I mentioned the number of challenges for IOT Pratt home and infrastructure learning I go deeper at home is to the one needs to receive messages from data source Saturn in spite of heavily the traffic the another one is to store messages to data store laboratory so we direct ask OpenStack to be supported you're guaranteed flavor about networking storage the next one is messages brokers vote the point is what kind of API is should be designed for North parent systems and how many messages broker OpenStack should support from our experience we asked OpenStack to support this message broker like and especially a batch kathcar should be fine because it has high very high performance scalability durability and perks ability data streaming project stone foreign tea from and so on the sad part is each device management this is actually still discussing what is the best idea but now we get these will be super tell to do each device management the one is correct port phone crowd platform for IOT it's actually managed the edge gateway the another one is great platform for IOT as kickdown API like this figure by mobile carriers sis tell which hills educate very management system how should we manage both of nodes what is the best picture to do it if you guys are interested in this item let this case with last later the false item is performance monitoring we will direct to monitor not only hardware and always status but also application status we're happy if operas that can provide any framework like rustic search 20 were given it together and visualize an application log on Abu step the restaurant is et al other service country a bunch of ETL s are needed for combination data stewards it is a kind of the inventing the wheel if awkward sexy folds sensing like et al in interface like this figure it can be helpful for IOT use case these are our these are to-do list for OpenStack we thought okay let's go to the Assemblies of this presentation IOT technologies enables us to gather huge data over the Internet the internet the creates new body with data analysis we updated our out the architecture and summarize to too late to make IOT proton OpenStack then we believe IOT powered by OpenStack the robot any questions no questions okay okay thank you for yep and I was wondering how long and how much data you can ask store for a long time right because you are storing a lots of data as you set up if the petabyte per month right then do you keep them or just tell you know throw away your mom's what just wondering how do you deal with those huge day okay thank you for your question so actor actually so it's a depend on the our potential customers but we guess so data should be stored a long long year one year from now now as I questions then thank you very much for attending this presentation thank you
