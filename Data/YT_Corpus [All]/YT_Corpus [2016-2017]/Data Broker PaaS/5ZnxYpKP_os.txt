 so I'm Leo writer I run technology strategy and product development for Nimbus and I'm actually here to talk to about the missing metal we've heard him refer to a couple of times today it's actually an IDC it's a big eye to see terms so thought I point that out so anyway this this presentation is really based on years of conversations with customers prospects as well as fellow thought leaders so it's not like we just kind of did compile statistics like this is actually based on on information that we get when we talk to customers and obviously it's it's through our lens but you know we we can only talk to the customer so we talked to so generally speaking you know when we look at we look at the market we see the status quo which is typically workstations sometimes small clusters you know of people that that actually need HPC and then of course on the right-hand side is kind of a Nirvana the large you know labs and centers and so forth and I know I missed a bunch of them I just didn't want to pollute to slide with hundred logos but you know who you are and I apologize if I missed you but basically the addressable market is somewhere in between right when it comes to actually enabling HPC for for new users and to borrow a marketing term we call them the pragmatist in pain which is also known as the missing middle and these folks they're not passionate about technology one way or the other their passion about what they're doing which might be some kind of product development or design or whatever it is and they're not zealots they don't care if it's you know this type of interconnector that they just need to get their work done and by the way their works do on Friday so they can't spend six months debating as to what they're going to build or if we're going to buy it so in very general terms when we think about you know the missing middle is generally underserved when you look on the end user side of the market is vs are typically focused on productivity not necessarily performance and these folks are really running gigantic workstations that just take like two weeks or on a simulation or whatever it might be or clusters that are oversubscribed and and they're the end user vendors are not really speaking to them and then on the on the HPC focus vendors I mean ultimately we're all kind of focused on exascale and that's great we need to get there but again it doesn't mean anything for the guy we need to get a simulations done by Friday right so they're they're under served on both ends in the market and then on top of that you're under pressure so why because product cycles are getting shorter product releases are getting more frequent this is true but no matter what you're building especially for selling to consumers they expect everything yesterday for free so and on top of that there's lower barriers to entry to even design and build technology or any kind of product so what it means that there's more competition because now more people can build can do things that years ago only only a select few could do and of course that means that now people need to differentiate so that you know kind of the basics don't cut it anymore when it comes to designing products or solving problems so they have to you know innovate on features and do all these things so that increases complexity of what they're actually working on so that allows to the pressure of the missing middle and then finally understaffed we all understand this scarcity skills a huge problem usually when you talk to people they taught those how bad the economy is and how people are to work but when you try to hire someone you can't find anyone qualified to do the job and I don't you know i'm not i know this is a kind of a small section of the world but in technology i think that's a very consistent theme there's a scarcity of skills especially with specialized skills like HPC I mean most of the technology market is focused on information technology on commodity skills hpc is a very rare skill set right so when we're trying to hire these people are very difficult to find it even if we do the really good talent the one that's going to get your work done by Friday is really hard to find right now you add in Millennials who expect to be promoted to CEO within six months of being hired and you have to kind of balance that out while you're weeding through the workforce and of course your budgets are shrinking because you know for a number of reasons I mean we're you know skills are more expensive the economy does slow down in certain sectors so that means you have to do more with less so that all equates to being understaffed so if you think you're going to get help to get your you know get priority for your problem as the missing middle is probably not going to happen by Friday or anytime soon for that matter so let's think about some myths that you know not everybody believes us but we do hear these things from time to time when when we say that we cater to kind of the mainstream market they're like oh they're just running small jobs or they don't understand PC or notice kicking tires or just doing simulations are really not that sophisticated all these different things it's really easy to dismiss the needs of the mainstream when we're so focused on the high end of the market as a community so the reality is that these myths are really not true of course there are some segments some people in you know in the market that that do fall into these categories but generally speak generally speaking these are actually real people and by the way they're in every single segment in every industry that you can possibly imagine right so even you may not think of large enterprises a missing middle when you start looking at use cases and departments all these different things they don't all need to run 16,000 corfu in simulations all the time right that would be what a national lab does let's say so these range from entrepreneurs and contractors and you know kind of knowledge workers that are independent all the way up to you know large enterprise defense government etc and then a whole swath in the middle of departmental made enterprise project based teams that maybe within a large enterprise maybe actually smaller teams and of course when you add the distributed workforce in you know if you were to even procure a supercomputer where would you put it I've got teams in 20 different countries right so how do I get high make sure that their data gets there and so forth right so these are all real real problems at the mainstream market so if we think about it horizontally across all industries there's we see three categories of people who you know fall into this space first is the ones who actually need HPC but don't have it and there's a number of reasons why they don't have it they probably don't have the skills to actually deploy it but more importantly if they just spend ten thousand dollars a head on workstations six months ago and they try to go back to the CFO saying you know what these workers are too slow we've got to spend a million dollars on the cluster the guy's going to be like why did I just spend a million dollars on workstations six months ago right so the budget does those conversations especially in today's climate are really difficult to sell right and on top of that there are software license gaps so you know you're the workstation license for your solver is way cheaper than the HPC version of the solver and and procuring the license is not always that easy as well right then there are those who need HPC and already have some in-house but as we know and we've heard it today time and time again in-house clusters are almost cited capacity jobs are queuing it's difficult to get priority sometimes to get your work done right if the if the workforce is distributed and on different networks then you know maybe it doesn't do you any good to use that cluster because it's just the latency is too high or whatever it might be and on top of that the infrastructure is probably obsolete so it may not even actually be faster than your workstation right and that's just something to consider and then the final category that we find really exciting and we think there's a lot of potential here is the ones who actually need HPC but don't know they needed user non-traditional HPC use cases obviously machine learning HP da etc so again when these customers come to us they come to us asking for a bunch of GPUs they're not asking us for hpc well guess what if you need 500 GPUs you pretty much need HPC I mean that's just a fact right you're not going to get that from a workstation so this is a whole segment of the market that's growing now that actually really needs HPC but they don't really think about it as HPC right so if we think of digital transformation as having taken to physical model and not completely away but you know reducing the number of physical models we need to build and replace replacing that with simulation then what does the status quo actually transition to from the compute side and of course we think that it's going to be cloud for you know for a good portion of that and the analogy I like to use and it's you know it's kind of very different but if you think of the developing world when they actually embrace modern telecommunications they didn't go to like touch tone and then you know fiber and then this they went straight to mobile right from their aging copper infrastructure so it was a phase shift because they just bought the latest and greatest so if I'm a new company and I'm looking for you know to actually deploy new infrastructure and I you know at least the CIO looks at mega trends disease hey cloud you know that that's the big mega trend now that's the mindset that's going to start dominating and saying you know what why do we need to make all these investments up frontal we can just go off and effectively use the capacity on demand so we think that it for many companies there's going to be an actual jump from building their own HPC infrastructure straight to cloud right so how does it was the missing middle win with cloud you heard this all day long from like three different people I don't need to read this to you or maybe four or five different people i should say but basically you know one of the thing that i really want to highlight is the turnkey workflow and and software service specifically you know from our perspective is a must for the pragmatism pain because if you go to somebody who's running an application under work station today and they say well I need HPC and you say okay well here's a cluster go set it up that's not solving their problem right so that what they end up doing is finding a consultant or a broker or somebody to help them out with it because what they actually need is a way to run that same application but with 512 course or 2048 course instead of eight cores right they're not looking to build HPC infrastructure so it's very important that they actually can buy that class of service again to get there problem solved in a in a very you know short period of time but then what about the ISVs right well again we heard this mentioned earlier so answers actually announced elastic licensing very recently full disclosure new mix as a part of the elastic licensing beta so we've been working with ansys on this for a very long time we never thought it was going to happen but it actually happened so they actually embrace it said you know what cloud is actually has it has a purpose like we still want to make sure that you buy you know a lease or that you lease offer from us but we understand that you may not be able to predict all your usage and you may actually need more than you bought periodically so and that is a cloud concept whether you're running a private cloud or a public cloud the ability to scale up and down is a cloud concept regardless so for you know the the main customer quoted there which by the way avid is an index customer as well it was all about flexibility and for them it meant how do I manage multiple teams with simultaneous projects I have no idea how much I'm going to need from from month to month my knees are always changing so I can't really predict scale up front so and and these licenses are actually really expensive so it's it's not a matter of kind of guesstimating and buy more than you need I mean that that makes a big impact on your bottom line right now there are other vendors into space like CD adapt go for example that already offer on demand licensing so it's not just we've we heard this before that the market will slowly transition to this and we think that pay-as-you-go will become will become the go-to model for new is fees right think about you know anything that's happened in the last few years if new companies are coming out and building new codes or whatever it might be they're probably a you know they're born in the cloud age right so they're going to be looking at subscriptions and pay-as-you-go as the go-to licensed model versus because they've never built off-the-shelf software they've never built software that you download or you buy in a CD and install they built it in the cloud to begin with so how else are they going to sell it I mean this is kind of the default you know mo that that new companies are going to use but obviously the traditional SVS we believe are going to transition as well in fact we're already seeing that with certainly with ansys and of course with CD Africa but of course there are challenges for hpc in the cloud performance is not always as good as dedicated HPC so we understand that embarrassingly parallel algorithms scale really well horizontally in the cloud and we've heard that many times today but we also understand it tightly coupled ones not in some cases not so much right the sticker shock so yes there is unlimited scale but that also brings unlimited spend right so there's all kinds of things that have to be done you know when you when you do start embracing cloud because the meter actually runs as long as you let it at any scale you want right and that's that's great when you need it but it's something that you now have to deal with that's a little bit different than when you're out of capacity you're out of capacity great and it may actually still require retaining or requiring HBC skills because again if you're buying a kind of a cluster on demand you still have to load the software you have to test the workflows and do all these different things so again this is where class service comes into play right so there are HPC clouds that actually rise to the challenge right so how do you know do they address performance well there's real HPC architectures there's high-speed interconnects high-performance storage coprocessors accelerators like FPGAs and then of course high density and large memory systems are available from some vendors sticker shock well that can be solved with different pricing plans and actually if we look at the telecommunications industry they do a really nice job with a cell phone plan so you're actually you're basically buying dollars at a discount right you commit to a certain amount of usage and then you have the flexibility to burst and of course they tell you when you're about to go over so that you can commit to more and we have customers we work with that way and it actually works great in many cases right and then how do we solve the skills gap rule again we focus on turnkey workflows not infrastructure right so the idea is to sign up you choose your workflow in your scale maybe you choose a payment method unless you've arranged a p.o ahead of time and then you just go and that's that's kind of the ultimate idea of bringing cloud-based HPC to the masses so who's actually adopting this stuff again from the customer so we speak to on the right you basically have the more the industries that are really embracing cloud wholeheartedly again from our perspective on the left are the ones that will soon right so simulation and media are actually very mature the use cases are well understood they know what the deficiencies are they know kind of you know what the scale challenges are so those are our you know we don't have to kind of figure out how to do them we know how to do that right and they also happened a lot of times beyond the Mandarin project base which pretty much demands that you have elastic scalability right so that's that's a very natural cloud use case so it's no surprise that those are the ones that are embracing it initially and then of course you have things like machine learning that are actually coming of age or you know we've had you know neural networks for a long time I'm not trying to say this is new stuff but the current craze of machine learning is really happening in the cloud age right so again the go-to delivery medium for a lot of these users is cloud to begin with right in the middle you have industries where cloud makes sense you know in many cases but there are some challenges but specifically around data sets are either very large or that you know they just need to find someplace where they have the right type of storage etc I'm and then on the left in the energy space the data sets are very challenging but also there's a huge existing investment in infrastructure so the go-to mo there is to use what we have well the problem is that oil is actually really cheap right now and it's difficult to retain people to actually run those systems so there's economics conditions that are actually you know in couraging some of these users to either look at at least outsourcing whether it's it's maybe it's not public cloud but it's it's private cloud or saying you know what we may want to actually look at this stuff because we can get what we need right now without having to worry about retaining 20 people to manage the cluster right so I'm just going to run through a couple of you know like for use cases just to give you an example these are these are customers or partners of ours and you know we'll keep it brief but one of them that I can't name is global team of it's an enterprise with a global team of engineers to do simulation so they have 100-plus engineers they run primarily ice pack and fluent but they also run hfss and they actually recently acquired a small CFD software company that they had to integrate into their workflows and they were already doing this on our cloud so they said you know we need to put this on the same cloud and again that not only required software service but also platform as a service to be able to build this so when we said that a missing middle myth is about unsophisticated use cases well this really debunks it I mean it's a very sophisticated use case they're looking at you know there's lots lots of hpc packs 20 million plus cell meshes sizes and they need high-speed interconnects so the team is distributed globally so again cloud is a great way to bring people to allow people to collaborate globally it's one of the one of the big use cases as well their project based simulation so they do fluctuate so their challenges are really performance scale flexibility on spend and licensing and and then collaboration with teams across teams and geographies and they've been in production for 18 months so it's it's something that's that's been you know really good for us and for them as well and this use case is actually the USDA there's a white paper from Intel that actually we co-authored with Intel that I'm quoting dr. Brenda Opera there on the right hand it's I know it's a bit of an eye chart but you can just Google Nimbus Intel and USDA and you'll find the first PDF is actually this white paper so doctor opera basically says that you know they're getting what they need done in our cloud they already have some infrastructure and it's fine and they're simply you know augmenting their infrastructure with our cloud but she's basically saying you know what if you're doing this for the first time just go straight to cloud I mean this is a respected researcher in the field saying this is actually this actually works so there's no need for you to go off and build your own cluster to do gene sequencing right anymore and for them it was really about you know time the value no I mean just not having to build out additional infrastructure and reducing the management complexity infrastructure were their big pain points this is a company that does data science as a service so basically you're a company and you have a bunch of data and you don't know and you need to derive intelligence from it will you hand them your data and you give them some idea of what you need and they come back with an answer or some recommendations or whatever they're basically doing analytics on your data right so they do HP da and machine learning on customer data and again it is project-based so some days there they need lots of compute some days they need less right today it's a private cloud and they're actually rebuilding it us in our in our public cloud so we actually we do both private and public their big challenges our performance scale and this data and compute disaggregation so this is an interesting thing that was mentioned earlier so the commodity world looks at as big at big data as hyper converged infrastructure where they have the storage in the computer in the same box the HPC world looks at it as having you know network attached for anarchy's InfiniBand attached storage and what that buys you is a lot more flexibility you can actually turn off your computer which is by the way is really expensive because you're using really high-end compute and keep your data there you know hot without having to go off in archive and then reload your data and it also allows you to scale your data and compute independently so that's a really big benefit when you're trying to me oh maybe you're trying to do an analytic that today requires you know 32 servers but you know the data set didn't change in size so why provision another 32 terabytes of storage or learn 20 terabytes of storage what you can just use the existing data that you already have right and vice versa so that's a that's a very important consideration for them and then this one is a partner of ours who does photorealistic rendering in real times their front end to nvidia's ira technology and they enable companies primarily in e-commerce space as well as a design space of some of you may have heard of on shape so they actually have a way to to render straight from on shape onto our cloud and their challenges are they need lots of cuda cores and I need k 80s and or whatever the absolute biggest GPU they can get their hands on right so again even though they're not using any cpu cores barely it's still in hpc use case because they need a lot of these things right and of course they need to be pay as you a lot of these rendering jobs take seconds to complete but they need like you know thirty two GPUs to do it at that speed right because the customers basically designing a piece of apparel on a website and I want to see what it looks like with our name on it and they can't wait you know 20 minutes for that to come back right so invocation performance is very important they need their their jobs to fire quickly and we're you know return data quickly so how does cloud actually help deep learning so we don't have a lot of use cases that we can talk about right now with deep learning we've got a lot I call kind of the Wild West of hpc everybody's doing it but you know we're not seeing a lot of standards mature that we can turn into turnkey workflows but we all know that training a DNN requires scale but it doesn't run perpetually once you're done training it you can shut down those you know 200 GPUs right or fpgas order it might be a lot of the data actually is in the cloud that you're going to train it with if you're training in on images I mean that that's where you're going to get the image data from text etc all the texts ever written in in human history are available in cloud right now right now it's true if you're using your own data it's a little bit different but a lot of times you're training something on on unstructured data you're going to be using sources that are that are public in many cases as well in addition to whatever else you're using and you need to be able to rerun these this training on the man whenever you know whenever you do your validation you realize hey I need to adjust the variables running again so it has to be this this thing where you just never know when you're going to be training it but you don't need to turn leave it on full time right so looking forward this is what we see so economics are going to drive a lot of traditional hbcus cases to the cloud because it's it's it's a really tough case to make to say hey i need to spend all this money up front to maybe get it back for 85 years from now right in today's climate is a tough case to make at least commercially right increasing network speeds are reducing barriers for data transfer I mean we heard that several times today and and it is still a problem for sure but also there's the adage of how do you get what's the fastest way to get a petabyte from houston to dallas put her in a truck and drive it there you can do that too right there are ways to get data to your to your service provider market demand continues to convince traditionalized fees so if if traditional eyes feast don't adopt on-demand licensing what's going to happen is you're going to be disrupted by upstarts that actually just do it because at a certain point people are like you know what I don't care how good your stuff is here so I want to buy it if you don't wanna sell it to me that way I'll find someone else who can sell it to me because at the end of the day that's that's that's where the business case comes in right and then we think that more turnkey workflows are going to enable more instantaneous domain specific values so we don't want to sell IT services we don't want to sell to IT there's nothing wrong with IT but we want to sell to the user who is going to start using this stuff and like right now right so that's that's what we're seeing and what our customers are telling us so with that I think I have like 45 seconds for questions I have one so basically I work with the University in shirt and I've you are number one to ask is to train students Mike Novick number two is I can hear number two is to support faculty researchers huh but if we saw outsource all our activities to the cloud where do students learn and get and enough to get jobs with companies like midnight Olympics and other companies in the cloud well it's a great point I mean yeah we're not we're not suggesting that and as long as we'd love for a hundred percent of hpc to be in the cloud tomorrow it's not going to happen it's gonna take a very long time if it ever completely and it you know the National Labs are not going to dump their gear anytime soon and we obviously if you're teaching people how to do stuff you know you need the actual the systems there but that's kind of where infrastructure as a service comes into play so there are clouds where you can buy machines and you can actually teach people how to configure software on those machines now if it comes down to like how do you cable you know an infinite band switch that's a that's a very specific domain skill that you can't possibly do in the cloud necessarily but if you're trying to teach people basic clustering you know or resource management or whatever it is there are lower classes of service in the cloud that will enable you to do that without actually procuring that infrastructure but you know i'm not expecting for your use cases to be migrated anytime soon you know entirely but you know we are seeing a lot of interest in two commercials you know from the private sector so hey leo is a great presentation thank you a question for you regarding your the missing middle customers would you describe them as like IT decision makers or they are they more like the business decision-makers looking for something to help them on their top line yes so they're there in I guess in Microsoft terms they're bdms and tdms but they're mostly with the line of business so that you know or a lot of times for the unused themselves who then go and speak to their their department heads and say hey we need this so I t always comes into play especially when you're dealing with a large enterprise because they have to blood you know you have to you have to become a vendor that they can buy from right so we do this all the time we work with enterprise where we have to go through certification but but but what I t's not doing is implementing so they're simply saying here's our security standards you know we need to make sure that you can play that that we can get data back and forth that you meet you know the certifications that you need and this is a lot of check the box type stuff but once that's done it's really you know the end user it's literally self-service at that point right so so that's only in by IT projects we're not advocating like eliminating IT because we will if we were selling commodity cloud we would but that's not what we're doing I mean I we don't want to manage people's desktops for example or their email or whatever right so I T as a very important place especially with the kind of enterprise security side but it's really about you know certifying and and and in eight and then saying okay this is you know an acceptable solution go right so that that's what we mean by that thanks alright thank you
