 good morning good afternoon good evening whether you're listening to this live or whether you're listening to it in the recorded version my name is George Spalding I'm the executive vice president pink elephant coming to you today from Burlington Ontario and the discussion that we're having today I am NOT going to go through any sort of credentials I've been in the industry for about 30 years and it's certainly been a key part of pink for at least 15 years I think the most important credential that I have as a result or about what we're talking about today is that in 2006 I was one of the ten people chosen to be an idol author for what we called at that time Michael B 3 and Gary case and myself were the co-authors of the continual service improvement volume now these volumes the key core volumes of eiffel have since been updated in 2011 but basically they kept the roughly the shape and and the words that we put in there in 2006-2007 anyway that's enough about me so how much idle is enough so they now with the current current version of vital which was updated in 2011 it being now 2015 frightening Lee we might be due for another update I hope not the current version of i plus 26 processes five basics lifecycle phases and 26 processes and spread across those five lifecycle phases so when we talk about I told that is the scope of what you could do when you when you come with idle when you when you decide to and I hate these words i'm going to talk about them a little bit later when you decide to implement itíll or more correctly you decide that itíll is the right thing to do for your organization but let's but we digress let's keep going okay can you have too much of a good thing i believe yes is the answer you can have too much idle or more correctly you can depend on itíll to replace what i would consider good management good management decisions those types of things if you suddenly say well I'm going to put all my eggs in the idle basket that's not really what i thought was ever designed to do it was never designed to be an all your eggs in one basket it was never designed to be oh don't worry i don't need to managed IT I've got itíll now that's never what it was designed to be so let's keep you up so what we're really going to talk about today is what the spirit of iphone and also the other best practices a few of them really were about how they were created why they were created and what you can get out of them with some maximum value that you can get out of them and is that quote okay is it okay to seek maximum value and then not do other parts of it the answer the short answer that is absolutely so we're going to talk about best practice what it is talk a little bit about a maturity model and what that means and why you should think about it and then some a few warning signs and then some filters on how to make good decisions around best practices okay so what is best practice well we've got tons out there we've got frameworks and idols a framework obits a framework six sigma is basically a framework lee nike is a framework then we have really only one model and that's the CMMI model out of the car game Ellen its capability maturity model integrated comes from Carnegie Mellon University to software engineering Institute been around since nineteen ninety two or so was originally created to assess the maturity of software development processes that's what it was about it was back in the early 90s and we were now in the world kind of starting that we're in today we're technically almost anybody can pick up a computer and anybody can start writing code so part of the conversation was wait a minute women how do I judge what a good code writing organization code writing Department code writing business how do I a judge the maturity of that how do I a judge which one's good and which ones bad which one just bunch of kids in a garage versus a real live organization that's actually demonstrated processes and proficiency and things like that and then of course there's standards and the ones in our world the IT Service Management world that we care about would be iso20000 that was way back in actually 2002 2003 we started getting a british standard BS 15,000 then in 2005 it became iso 20000 that has since been updated in 2012 or 2013 anyway and then there's ISO 27001 ago into that because that's a whole nother conversation so so what's a framework now standard well it's as opposed to a standard a standard is something where they lay out the standard body lays out in this case is Oh lays out a number of criteria Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing Bing and you must do this must do this you must do this you must do this and if you do all those things and can demonstrate or prove that you are doing all of those things you jump every hoop and you can demonstrate that you have jumped every hoop you can then be certified against the standard and you can be iso 20000 certified your organization more correctly can be iso 20000 certified so the organization is 20,000 certified you can also have a certain level of maturity and specific processes which doesn't have anything to do with the iso 20000 certification and then there's these frameworks and the frameworks are out there laying out in many cases the processes which you would then use the model to measure your maturity and should you so decide you would then use the standard to actually get a certification for the organization or why can't I certify over on the left side why can't I certify with Idol or certified with cobit 6 signally night why can't I do that with my organization because there are frameworks okay so what's the difference a framework is a list of what I would call strong suggestions on how you might want to do something the title it's how you might want to set up and run an IT shop with cobit set up run an IT shop and provide governance and risk and value assessments six sigma is really very very stringent statistical measurements of process and quality and lean IT is a little higher level in terms of really a change in the way of thinking and the change in the way of acting and managing organizations as a whole and also now applied to IT so but frameworks are by definition kind of loosey-goosey it's a suggestion you can you don't have to we want you to adopt the framework I adopt the principles of vital and then I adapt them to my specific environment which means first of all I choose some and don't use others I adapt them I met I say well yeah that's the way that one is but I think I'd like to change that a little bit or my organization really doesn't do it that way and I see where they're coming from but I think it'd be better if we did it this way so no problem with any of that stuff when you're talking about a framework that's just fine cobit I told no problem everybody says great i'm glad you adopted the framework and I'm glad you adopted the principles and I understand where you're going with the adjustments if I did the same thing over in the ISO side that would be a nope you can't do it that way no you have to do it this way otherwise you're not jumping here the proper hoop so the framework is really a much to me to a much better way of improving IT and the reason simply is is that I don't what and what I've seen now as I become more and more expert in li nike when you when you reach the standard level at ISO 20000 there's no incentive to go any further there's no one sent it to continue to improve at all I'm certified I'm ISO 20000 service I'm done I'm finished whereas over in a framework side I'm never finished I'm always improving there's always continual improvement to be done lean I di toko but everybody is focused on improvement and improving quality and improving customer value so everything on the left side is about improving customer value in on a continuum basically never stopping improving as you move along okay so that's the key differences between those three areas so now we hear the words implement itíll and we're going good news we're going to implement idle terrible what a terrible idea why would be the key answer to that why are you implementing idol well because my boss said so or because my CEO read something in an airline magazine or because it's obviously the way we run a run IT so therefore we're going to grab those 26 processes and we're going to put them in let me tell you that's never going to happen okay no one that I know of no one no company no organization no university has ever put in 26 processes a title and had it work they might have attempted it but it's been a dismal failure so therefore where we where do we go with this first of all first you need a baseline you need to measure where you're at right now now you say well I don't want to measure because really quite frankly Georgia don't wanna say this but we kind of were bad we suck I don't want to measure that nope that's exactly when you need to measure you need to measure when you're not very good you measure when you're not very good or you measure whatever the problem is right now because the act of measuring is going to cause improvement the active of telling people what you're measuring causes improvement so you really need to get an accurate look at where you're at you need to do a baseline reading quickly now I'm not saying you need to make this baseline study or this assessment public I'm not saying you have to tell everybody that you're really bad I'm just saying you need an independent document or an independent baseline that's here's where we started ok so this baseline is also going to tell you where where your pain points are where what are the things that were the weakest at now that may be something that you you might not consider important or doesn't feel it doesn't seem to get a lot of press or a lot of visibility and those things might be the ones you want to go after first the things that are high visibility high pain and we're basically the the reputation of ideas at fault those we call that cherry-picking we call it picking the low-hanging fruit and is there anything wrong with that no there is nothing wrong with that there is nothing wrong with going after quick wins as you begin your iPhone journey so ok the problem is when quick wins become the long term strategy that's the problem if quick wins in round one get you on to round two perfect more power to you that is the way to go and the reason is because you're going to have to at some point you're going to have to walk in and say hey boss I want to do some idle stuff and I want to do this I think it's great and so many places that we know of many of our customers come to us we say great I will be happy to help you with this but the question is you have any budget at all you have any personnel that we can put on this you have any no no no oh ok so we're going to do round one out of our back pocket we're going to basically just make this up we're going to create staff from no staff we're going to have teams that basically already have full-time jobs so we we need some quick wins we need quick wins for a lot of reasons we need quick wins so that we keep people's interest so that they can go whoa wow we didn't we didn't really kill ourselves and look at what happened look at the improvement we made their what could you improvement we made their perfect that's the way to go and then that gets around to where we basically now have to go back to the boss and say hey boss you know we did everything we can out of our back pocket with no budget whatsoever in those math now we need to actually get some people focused and direct we assigned to this and actually maybe purchase a tool that we really that's going to do us through the next five years as we move forward in this world of I to an improvement and the boss is going to say well you said you've done everything you already can without any money what have you done and the answer is well now if you've done the baseline and you've been and you've done it well and you put it in a drawer and you didn't tell anybody about it now is when you pull it out now is when you say well boss 12 months ago we were awful doing this now we're much better 12 months ago we were terrible doing that now we're much better we've done another measurement in the in the meantime and you've been able to demonstrate the actual level of improvement as opposed to if you didn't do the baseline when you started what's the conversation with the boss is going to be like it's going to be all we're much better how much better a lot we're a lot better yeah that's it we're a lot better really stick with us so it's not going to work out the boss is looking for definitive data they're looking for specifics they're looking for reasons why they should now basically have people that they didn't have to have before and spend money that they didn't spend before in order to make improvements in the way I T is running so baselines important pain points are important no problem with quick wins and kill the quick wins become a long-term strategy because it doesn't last very long and we're out of quick wins we're going to run out pretty quickly the maturity model CMMI which is really the only one that anybody pays attention to so if you're going to involve a maturity model really there's no reason to go anywhere else so it's I tool uses CMMI cove it uses CMMI lean IP uses CMMI I mean it's everybody uses soon okay it measures five levels of process maturity so therefore what's the best level well obviously level five so therefore we all should aspire level five nope I don't believe that's true I believe what we should aspire to in certainly the first few years that were due any of this is level three level three is and the goal is to get to level three pretty quickly so I want level three and the reason is because I currently see about 75% of any organization we talk to and we say do you do I till they say yes now that's I got 26 processes and if you're doing one of them you say I'm doing item or if you're doing five of them I'm doing I hope you're doing ten of them i'm doing idol so there's no way for us unless we do further investigation to find out how doing out what doing item means so 75% of organizations doing Idol does not necessarily impress us when we discover that ninety-five percent of those 75 percent are doing incident problem and change and then they stopped so let's talk let's focus back on the on the process maturity so why do I first of all when you start when you start at level 1 this is like new young couple coming home from the hospital with their first baby they lay the sweet young thing on its on the bed sleeping and they go look at each other and they look at the baby and they say what are we going to do when it wakes up and that's where it starts they started inventing processes at that point you keep going until they're 18 20 25 years old and then you can finally kick them out of the house but basically it's it's a it's a beginning they have no processes in place they may or may not have tools they may or may not have a room or a crib or anything else depends on of course how much money they have but it also depends on whether they're ready literally ready I don't think anybody's ready for their first child but that's okay I'm way down the road on that one so but so there's no process whatsoever and they they basically begin level two is where the process is is socialized where I've got a bunch of people they've worked together for five years and they know they can finish each other's sentences they know what everybody takes in their coffee they know what everybody likes and doesn't like for lunch all of that and they work together perfectly there's not a lot of conversation about process they just work together symbiotically it's perfect you take one of them out of there and put somebody knew somebody fresh into that world they don't do well and the reason they don't do well is because the process they're trying to learn is really not documented not normalized and not not measurable not auditable nothing it doesn't the process is is between the people who were there so some man bring in somebody brand new and they say so here's what I want you to do and you say okay great do what Bill used to do what a bill used to do I don't know but he really did it well yes bill so there's no there's no real formal process and I think that almost all of us are at that level to process maturity in most of the processes we have level three is where we is where we grow up level 3 now it says okay whatever processes we have if it's going to be measured at a level three is going to be documented formal repeatable measurable monitor abow and auditable and therefore i'm going to be able to bring a new person into this i'm going to be able to sit him down and i'm going to show them the process i'm going to show them the process document here's the process here's where you fit in here's what you do here's the timeframes here's the time constraints here's what we have to do if you can't do this here so you have to go to all that stuff I'm going to do this all written down it's all there it's completely formal totally documented that's when we can start to say that we're getting to a grown-up organization now level 4 in level 5 i'm going to talk about today because quite frankly most organizations are not at level 3 in terms of process so level three is where you should aspire to when you get most of your processes at level three come back we'll talk about level four okay warning signs of too much Eiffel or too much framework in general too much something the and it's usually a middle manager that actually is getting into this is at this level it's not an executive executives on clap say yeah the title thing sounds good okay yeah sure go ahead the middle manager now delves into i tole educate themselves on itíll and some of them unfortunately become what i call the idle diggit the idle bigot is where well what's the question because the answer is I thought so I Tulsa idle obviously is where we're going I told Eiffel idolized you go wait a minute wait we're oh so it's an obsession with the process as opposed to the outcome and remember the definition of a service is basically outcome customer outcomes that they want with the value without understanding or knowing what the costs and risks are so it's all about outcomes that's what we're trying to achieve in in the world of vital we're trying to achieve positive business outcomes that's what we want so how do we do it well we do that by using technology usually and using processes and things like that but the point is that if we take our eye off the ball if we forget about the outcomes and forget about the business outcomes we're trying to achieve and focus on process process process and that's all we care about is process process process then we're really missing the boat so a Bible mentality with stringent adoption draconian adoption to the world vital to using Idid books as a Bible so we basically saying we have to do what's in the book and the reason we have to do it is because i tol says we have to not because we can come up with a reason what we have to but because i tol says we have to vary internally focused not not focused on the business at all the node conversations about business benefit when we're putting in process and when we're ramping up processes when we're trying to make the processes work all of that so we're not talking about the business benefit not talking about business outcome these workers tend to be dissatisfied because I go why am I doing this why am I doing this and then somebody says because idle says we have to enroll their eyes and they go you know I just want to say something I hate Idol I don't know why I hate it but I hate it because it's making me do things in my job which don't which I don't know there's a reason for things that might hear Idol hey sounds good I'll take two why do I have to do it cuz Idol says so sorry man you do not have a problem you have an incident people basically getting involved and starting to say wow this is a little weird so let me just talk to me go a little aside for a minute as I said earlier most organizations when they say they're doing ayatul are doing incident problem check so they're doing incident management problem management change management incident and change so which one should you know what of always 26 processes which one can you do first well that's actually fairly straightforward you're probably already doing incident management some way shape or form you probably have a help desk and which might have morphed into a service desk which means it's less reactive and more proactive you you have incidents you're managing them in some respect so this is basically a way to tell you how and what a successful incident management and request management process looks like and and then have you moved forward so that you can do that better all great stuff no problem I have no problem of Eichel there change management is something that tends to be a major pain point in almost every I tea shop and can go in quite quickly in in term along with incident management and change management is often the one that has the most payoff and also receives the most resistance and the reason for the resistance is because change is now is a control process incident management is not control change is a control process attempting to exercise control on the changes that go into the infrastructure we use the words all the time without really knowing what they mean under control is that under control you get that under control what does that really mean it that if if the infrastructure of an idea organization is under control it means that things can't be changed in the infrastructure without going through the change management process that's what under control means otherwise we have changes being made willy-nilly by well-meaning deeds and by different departments making them at different times without even telling the infrastructure change process what's going on or what will go on or what did go on all of that takes place it's the same thing then we have projects and application development and releases that go in as well same concept without telling or not giving change management enough notice to do anything about it problem management which is basically the getting to the root cause of incidents and then hopefully killing them and never seeing them again is very easy to put in but only after incident management is up and running so there so once you've got problem managed once you have incident management running and you're happy with it and you think it's in pretty good shape problem management is fairly easy to slip in because incidentally create the inventory of problems so you're able to track the incidents are able to analyze incidents and therefore you're able to create problems so that's pretty straightforward you cannot do release management without change management so there's another dependency so release management has to come after change management there's no reason for it to go in beforehand because doesn't make sense now we get to the big Bugaboo and this is where when do i do my Service Catalog when do i do my when do i do you know services in general and then the big one when do i do configuration management if ever so configuration management quite frankly is the most difficult process from an operational standpoint to get going the tools have come a long way and we have a lot of very sophisticated discovery tools that will allow us to basically automate the discovery of physical devices on your network and in some cases actually automate the dependencies between those devices by monitoring network traffic that's fantastic stuff that we didn't used to have so that means we can get a leg up on configuration management however it's only the physical devices that that works on sometimes it will go in and actually give you it'll read various services that are running and various applications that are running on specific boxes also great but still doesn't handle things like these six servers make up a system these three systems makeup underpin a specific service all of that stuff we still need to know if we're going to actually do business relationship management etc we're going to have to have all that so configuration management very tough it's very hard somewhat time consuming labor-intensive and especially rolling it out the first time is quite quite difficult so there's a lot of conversations therefore about the ROI of configuration management and what happens what's interesting to me is I hear people describe configuration management and the value of it always in terms of other processes boy I wish we had a CMD D because we could share resolve incidents much more quickly I wish we had a cmdb we could share get to the root cause of those problems much more directly I wish we had a CMD D because we could assess the impact of upcoming changes much better so they define the value of configuration management in terms of in relation to some other process well so now the question and this is where I'm accused of being a blasphemer in the idle religion so the question is this is there enough ROI when you in incident problem and change to warrant all the work and all the effort and expense of configuration management that's the question so if I have instant problem and change and I've got and that's what I'm doing for itíll and my next one up or the next one I want to talk about is configuration management and I go to my boss and say look at the look at the payback we're going to get when we put this process in is there enough ROI and the answer my answer at least is no no way not enough configuration management is too difficult and too time-consuming and too hard to to warrant the expense and and commitment for just making incident problem and change better and faster it's just not enough okay George then when bigger than us I mean it's configuration management a bad thing no it's great I wish I have it be fantastic in fact I think we all wish we had it as the first process but we all know that that in your nap so therefore we really like we really want it as along the way so when is it when is there enough roi well that's actually quite simple when the IT department makes the fundamental shift from being a true technology organisation in to being a service organization when they make that fundamental shift when they begin to define IT just in terms of services and in terms of the services that they offer and that is the definition of IT services and business outcomes that when that definition is the definition of IP then not only is there enough roi you can't get configuration in fast enough why because you're going to redefine success I go in a lot of IT shops I'm a pretty simple guy I ask simple questions I say to the IT people hey what's the definition of success in your IT shop the answer i get often is thought of silence bought a grumbling if I let it go on long enough I get ninety nine point five percent of the building on the backbone no incidents great customer service ratings on the helpdesk survey okay these are all good things but that's not really the definition of success when truthfully most people who do I pee on a daily basis come in in the morning work their butt off leave at night tired and they're not and hopefully didn't really notice much gain they don't feel like it did great things they did they worked hard but they don't feel like they really knew what success was and those rare days when they do are great well so once once you define things with services the customer is immediately going to say about a service hey how much said serve is going to cost me that's question number one question number two how good are you going to do that service question number three are you going to make that a promise and a promise in in our world in the world of iphone the world of I key is a service level agreement that's a promise that says we promise to provide you with this level of this service and and we promised a monitor that and we promise to talk to you about it every month we promise so just like in real life you don't shouldn't make promises you can't keep you should not write SLA so that you don't believe that you're going to actually pull off so the SLA becomes the new definition of success so now I have as always I have I know what good is I have just defined what good is I haven't I don't have to do great I don't have to do unbelievable I just need to do what the SLA says okay what do you need to do what the SLA says if you need a configuration management database that's what you need because if you're saying that this service when that service goes down that you're going to be in breach of your SOA what are you going to know when he suddenly that service is not up for the user which system does underpins a service which servers or set of servers underpin that system and how am I going to know all that if I don't have a configuration management database and I'm not able to trace the line from the business outcome down to the actual component that's not working in basically five seconds because now I have to start working on fixing it to get that service back up so the point is that's when the ROI actually kicked in that's when the figuration management makes total sense and is a total necessity as opposed to a wonderful add-on it's a complete necessity when you're in the service business suddenly service management service level management availability and capacity management all that stuff kicked in when you are defining success by your service levels okay so how to decide how much idols enough let's start with the operational stuff so the because what we're really talking about is operational efficiencies and I'd like to bring out another factor in here what happens if we don't do any item what happens if we don't do any processes I mean most of you are working in fairly large shops but there are small companies out there with only a couple or two or three or four ID folks how do they do it do they have processes or this kind of everybody do everything well pretty much and and I think many of us have been there pretty much everybody does everything and so what happens well we developed basically a hero mentality so we've got you know Jason who is the network guy and he also ends up being perhaps the pc guy and he accidentally becomes a printer guy and so that he's you know boy if Jason comes here then he solves the problem we never wrote it down we never had an incident we never have an incident process we just called Jason Jason comes in he's my hero he solves the problem did we know what happened nope I have no idea did we Jason though maybe he might have it in his head but the point is that what happens when we start to scale what happens in the company starts to grow really heroism this is really the business model for ID is that really going to work it doesn't stay well I can tell you that you can't say I'm going to go out and look for we're heroes you have to say yeah I need more network people I need to learn this I need more that but the point is that is that really the way I T is going to grow and become more efficient it's just by getting more heroes is that really the way we're trying to manage our people I want heroism I want heroism when there's a flood when there's a fire when there's an earthquake when you know something smashes in your building I want arrow ism but I don't want it to be the watchword of every day that's not it's crazy I don't get it can't scale it and it burns people out and we've suddenly they're out of there and says I can't do this anymore and they believe that I t has to be that way it has to be chaotic all right let's look at enough of my rant operational factors so what we do like to look at made IP ops cheaper more efficient cost less probably what if it made ops faster and better I mean these are reasons why we might want might want to improve our processes operationally more available more stable more reliable that's kind of a watchword a vital if you if you want to give an elevator speech of why you should adopt the active framework the answer is would you like the infrastructure to be more available more stable and more reliable yes I would okay then we have to do I toilets because that's really it that's what it does when you want the elevator speech that's it more available more stable more reliant was it lay the foundation for the next generation of technology this is a little tougher now we're getting into the future stuff and you know and most of the developments these days are in you know cloud and cloud services okay so that's the back end stuff we've got blade service servers and racks of servers okay we've had that forever what about served this is what about outsourcing things or SAS on PA SS paas platform as a service infrastructure service all of those things those are those are part of the game as well and is that is that going to allow us will it be easier for us to become what I would call a service broker in IT which I think really long term is the future of IT as an IT becomes service broker we do some services and ass we other services we contract outside we merge them together and offer business services to the business they don't care where they came from they just want them up and they want them to perform well it's that simple how about business innovation will this allow that the problem with business innovation is we don't know nit what the business is going to need next year we usually don't know and probably because the business doesn't know so what we find is that the business has needs to innovate much more rapidly than we are able to do that whereas so that we discover may be that an external provider might provide us with the agility and speed that we're really after so those are some of the reasons why you might want to go with certain idle processes the business factor will it make us more competitive as a business will it make us more streamlined will be well things be faster to market because time to market is something that NIT we don't talk much about but boy it's really their releases and projects have time to market changes have time to market numbers incidents have time to market have time to completion time to resolution mean time to resolve those all of those things that we keep track of these are time to market members that that basically always should be shrinking we want them always to be shrinking so it'll make will it make the business more competitive more streamlined how about a flatter organization will be more transparent where we'd be able to understand what the business does better will we be able to be more proactive in terms of the business will be able to go to the business and offer solutions to them and asked for and say remember the days Oh some of you might remember some of you people with gray hair might remember when in the 80s when we actually would go to the business and say hey there's this new computer system here's does the business of go Wow ah now of course subjected the opposite they're bringing us or they're buying the new computer systems on their own or the new equipment or technology on their own and they're coming to us and saying you'll support this right and we're going what what what will it make us more agile more innovative more valuable well hopefully one of those one of the ways we have to look at this is we need to be we need to develop a more agile IT department therefore that's going to mean we're going to need more time to take the new stuff in and work with it and become proficient at it so that might be a reason why we're going to outsource some of the other stuff will lay the foundation for the next generation in business products and of course everybody around here is talking mobility everybody wants everything to be mobile and mobile platform Internet of Things all the stuff that we keep hearing about all the buzz words you know agile DevOps Internet of Things mobile BYOD these are all nice buzz words but in the end they're real and they're going to happen or are happening or have happened and therefore what are we doing an ID to make sure that we're going to be able to accommodate that not just the stuff that's coming to us but what about our own business having to get into the world of mobility having to provide better and different business services more business innovation so that we can keep market share and keep customers and maybe a quicker payoff clicker ROI all of that becomes part of the conversation when it when you get right down to it in terms of whether we want to go with itíll whether we want itíll to be part of our IT shop and how much idle make sense which parts of either will help us do these things lastly the human factor will it allow will it foster creativity will it generate pride in the organization where the IT people feel proud that they are now part of an IT organization that's that's working well that's running on all cylinders that's not fire fighting every day every minute those types of things become key because when they basically fire fight every day they basically believe that that's the way this I tea shop works they talk to their friends and suddenly discover that not every I tea shop works that way some IT shops don't fire fight every day yes of course there's things that go wrong but not not as a way of life do I do we reward in the way we run this forward-thinking do we reduce the fear of taking risks does it allow us to focus on the priorities or if because if we don't firefight we can actually focus on what priorities exist on the things we've been told and that we understand our priorities what the business mission is what the vision is of where the business is going and therefore where I t is going in order to do that and fostering excellence as well and then finally what's the appetite for change in an organization because I ttle and frameworks like Eiffel fundamentally are about organizational change they change the organization they change people's jobs they change what people do day in and day out usually the executives are fine with it pretty much the folks at the bottom of the chain are fine with it the people who push back the most are middle management who see their sphere of influence either shrinking or completely changing when this processor that process comes in and this other process comes in so what we see out there in our world at pink is the middle manager pushing back pushing back pushing back because they don't see it to their advantage personally it's probably to be advantage of the organization but not their own personal advantage and that depends of course on their leadership style and a lot of the conversation around human factors really falls into and sits well with the Holy Nike conversation because one of the key principles of lean IT is respect for people and basically management as facilitator as opposed to management having all the answers the people have the answers they totally do have the answers but they have to be listened to they have to have time to have the answers time to have conversations etc so okay if we've got any questions and we've got any question drive a question tab you see something for a minute I've got a chat okay I bet I'm dumped out all right I don't have any questions see if you've got questions please feel free to go into the question area and let me know you you you you I guess let's go into the chat box since that seems to be the only thing that's available to me at least so if there's any questions at all please go in the chat box and enter your question I'd be happy to respond to that I don't see any questions at all so what I let me just let me just let me just wrap up then okay since I don't see any questions the key is that could you do 26 processes in item could you do 36 processes or 34 processes and go but I suppose someone could at some point someone could do it but I I don't know who would do it who would have time what do you get out of it hopefully you get a better running I tea shop that's all you're trying to do a much better running much more efficient much more I tea shop with people who like being there and people who like coming to work and who feel like they are contributing to the entire organization as a whole and you get a better direction with the business much more alignment with the business you like that word much more alignment with the business and you're able to you're able to say that you're able to look at once you get a certain kind of what I would call the tipping point of the of them you're able to get enough processes in place where things settle down a little bit then you're able to look at the rest of the processes and make a decent decision you're able to look at the pain points and still exist even after you have say three four five processes you're able to do that so I get get a question here which asks about assessments how would you what would the biggie assessment that you actually would use well there's several assessments out there but most of the time once again let me go back to come to the conversation we had the very beginning the assessment is not in any way an audit and the reason sign an audit is because I can only audit you against specific bass lines that you have to do whereas we already talked about free mort's they don't have those so what I'm obsessing is the maturity of processes so we talked about that where we say we we do the maturity of a given process or five processes or ten processes we measure that maturity and those are the maturity based on the CMM scale we get a number across the enterprise and I told talked about level three being the desirable number and what would be higher than level three well that's when we start doing integration scores between processes where incident management and change management are integrated where we were able to see things between processes it becomes where as an individual process will get one maturity now an integration score on top of that would make it a more mature organization so what we use is we have our own assessment tool called we call it a pink scan and we allow we either do it for you we allow you to use it there are a number of assessment tools out on the web there they are free for the most part the real question is whether you're able to do well an independent and get people with no agenda responding to the assessments that's what we would hope and that's certainly what we're after when we made the tool available to people as a subscription service we discovered that some people were very comfortable with that others still called us and said no no no no no we don't want to do it ourselves we want you to do so it was very interesting okay next thing is when to implement portfolio management so portfolio management in our world is letters to there's what we have is this project portfolios of course and that's where we basically have all the projects running under the PMO project management office and then individual project managers might indeed have portfolios and projects but that is the entire portfolio as opposed to a service portfolio which is the same concept the service portfolio is basically all the services they're offered by the organization when would you do that well you wouldn't do it when you're starting your first service or your second service you do it when you finally say whoa we're getting quite a few services here that we need to manage more as a whole because we're starting to run into resource constraints we're starting to run into resource conflicts we're starting to say well wait a minute how is that being represented in the Service Catalog what's happening so you start doing it when you know not your first service second service when you start getting enough services that managing them be is becoming problematic or redundant so you're starting to do redundant management in the world of services that's pretty much when you'd go with service portfolio management okay any other questions would you say you're at a maturity level 44 I an increment and problem if the tickets are fluid both ways between both processes plus documentation and all topics hmm boy that's pretty close to level 4 I would say so if that's truly it when they incident and problem go back and forth and everything is you know back and forth back and forth and when you make a change to a problem where you resolve a problem it goes back and maybe automatically updates incident records or refers you to the to the knowledge base when that's that's certainly we're getting towards level 4 on that one full documentation those types of things that's pretty close obviously I I can't do it without you know really looking or sending one of our consultants to look but I think you know you're pretty close if that's indeed where you're at ok any additional questions thanks would you if you apply reviews and reporting in CSI when I say level 5 I can't comment on level 5 I don't know that much about level 5 we almost no one we see ever reaches level 5 so but but like I said you seem to know your stuff okay all right thank you everyone i think you know pretty much everybody we're getting near the top of the hour this is being recorded of course and once we once we get that saved up we'll post this via our website at a lot of CB on youtube that role your access to it will be via the website thank you for sticking around I really appreciate everybody coming today thanks a lot good you
