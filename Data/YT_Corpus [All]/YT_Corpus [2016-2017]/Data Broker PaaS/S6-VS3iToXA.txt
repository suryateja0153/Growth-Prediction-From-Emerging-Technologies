 hi there this is sunol from product management at injury scaling a traditional lung or volume based storage solution can quickly lead to challenges such as configuration complexity day-to-day management or ahead or poor performance with tinges vm scale out we address all those challenges and provide an intelligent and seamless way to scale your storage infrastructure so let's take a look this is stingy global center a central management tool here i created a couple of vm scale out pools and added vm stores to them pools provide your mechanism to convert a number of stand-alone systems into a self-managed elastic unit vm scale out uses statistical modeling based on historic behavior of vm stores and VMS within the pool to look into the future and if the model predicts a potential resource issue it will pop up a recommendation to notify you and help you avoid it altogether it can predict space performance and other type of resource issues so let's inspect the recommendation here recommendation has three elements the first element is the issue that we need to resolve we can look for more details here the second element is how to resolve it the algorithm has gone through several hundred combination of VMs to find the best set to efficiently resolve the issue and finally the outcome if you were to execute this recommendation you have the full context to make an informed decision once I review the recommendation I can hit the execute button and vm scale-out will live migrate the VMS and also migrate their snapshots all the policies and metrics will be retained with the VMS so to summarize to scale with tintri all you have to do is add vm stores to the pool vm scale-out will automatically figure out what is the optimal bid the distributive VMS across the pool and ensure a higher utilization for your vm stores stay tuned for more on vm scale-out and thanks for watching
