 oh you got control all right great let's see how this works out I everybody my name is John Michaelson I am a architect I work for check point software when they were doing calls for pres owes this year we were kind of thinking well what what can we do that would be very relevant and you know also kind of mindspring so what I put together here is more about a thought leadership there should be no product relation in here at the end if you're interested I'll be around for a while we can talk about products specifically but it says checkpoint on here but the majority of what I've got going on in here is more about what's going on as far as the SDN landscape and where we all will you know should be thinking about moving forward so really kick it off checkpoints been around a really long time and there's only really only one kind of thing that I want to mention about checkpoint before you kind of move on and that is we are check point software we didn't even sell our own appliances until two thousand eight so when it if your existing checkpoint customers you're going to see a little bit of kind of our design in this whole thing in the first place and how we do things and how we've always done things and how Sdn is kind of just moving forward kind of the ideas that we've always had which is kind of nice so moving forward really simple why are we here why is sdn matter well we used to not care I didn't care in the 90s when I was building talking ring networks and working on mainframes I didn't care my network guys they didn't care they did not care at all they gave us a perimeter and they were just kind of over here you know trying to pick I pay attention I've got a perimeter I've got this internet thing that's kind of new and whatever doesn't matter but as we built their data center sorry as we build out our data centers we've got all these different pieces and we just protected the outside now is it and in fact there's even a kind of methodology to that I got that a little backwards sorry I moved on with slides around last night trying to desensitize checkpoint from this whole thing but anyhow IT security really got confusing we had the perimeter but then we had all these apps that started coming in there and what do we do about those we've got facebook yeah everybody's using it whether we want to acknowledge it or not this stuff's here office 365 is something that's fairly new although there's been other things like Dropbox and all these other tools that have been around for a very long time that are all of our customers internally who are organizations are using whether you want to acknowledge it or not it's there and as they come in there's just more and more and more and there's just nothing we can do about it we can't stop the flow of this stuff this is modern right so what do we do about this well we need IPS we need encryption between sites and internally at some points depending on who you work for URL filtering app control and if I mean all of these different technologies and that's that's how we handle it really and when we're talking about that Rimmer perimeter design can we do that inside it's a little more difficult a little bit of background this is kind of what I was doing in the 90s plugging things in just moving forward trucking along not really thinking about it but what did we add well first thing we needed was firewalls does acl's just weren't good enough then we added a death n occation servers because now i can't just have machines all over the place you guys remember windows 31 right no authentication things just came up and worked then we moved on we had to add to have VPN gateways and this weird thing called wireless came on and we had wireless gateways and for context my wireless gateway in about two thousand one I had seven thousand wireless clients all over the Twin Cities because i worked for the transportation organization and every bus had several wireless networks and it was a lot of fun but what kind of a ten occation what kind of security was around it not not a lot we had all the assessment tools hardened routers switches and you know network intrusion detection all of these different things they had a virus pile walls all of a sudden well now this is a lot of stuff how do we handle all this there's an overarching theme here is that this is a whole bunch of stuff that used to be not too bad when there is one or two or stack them but now it's everywhere when it comes to things like God treatment facilities whether it's clean water dirty water doesn't matter things that are on the the the list at the federal level that need to be protected all of this stuff has to be there and generally speaking it's complicated one of the organization's I used to work for ran all the way treatment plants for the Twin Cities okay well that doesn't sound so bad right however what happens if somebody lets the effluent out into the river with I don't know half a tank of chlorine or any of the other nasty chemicals that get used now clean water is what we all think about when we think about things that are important right because that's open the tap is if it's poisonous well I'm going to kill 30 40 thought you know maybe a thousand people heard of whatever if you poison a river you're killing counties and entire States worth of people so needless to say it was really really really scary to me when I went to one of our treatment plants one time and because we had this routing loop and I couldn't figure it out I ended up having to drive 10 miles out in the middle of nowhere and we get there and well I ordered this thing so I could get to it from home well all of a sudden our entire network was completely run over because the person in charge of those two plants had added this line there's nothing we could do about it so we needed all of these types of tools and we hit into even we even get into the encryption back and forth nowadays to you know just more and more and more and more and the analyzers that's the really big thing I personally have had to deal with every one of these technologies and it sucks at a scale just flat and simple so what foresters has been telling us for a number of years now is that there's no more chewy so we're talking about that old mentality the older design mentality from the early 90s when we didn't care what was on the inside well now we do and the only way to really deal with this is not trust anything oh that sounds complicated how do we handle add well realistically what it comes down to is that all of these little pieces every single one of them has to be authenticated and verified have an encrypted channel absolutely all of these types of things in order to get to where we need to be and really what it comes down to is this massive management overhead there's technologies that have been able to do this for years and years and years NSX is not the first thing to come to market that can handle this however unless you work for the federal government or dealt with banks 10 years ago you didn't care that's really what it comes down to the market is changing and sdn is really enabling all of this type of stuff enabling security in a much easier fashion than what we used to do what we used to have to do so moving forward segmentations new perimeter how many people have heard that right the last two three four years I work for checkpoint I've been here about five years everybody's been pushing thats try it what's true until you have things like target happen and then you have things like Home Depot happen and then have you know and on and on on I know I personally I handle target for a number of years I'm tired of talking about target i'm tired of hearing about it but they were our Hiroshima that's what happened that's why we're all still talking about it what needs to change is the visibility needs to go up micro segmentation is the new perimeter yes that's actually not something the security community has been pushing this is something that specific vendors have been pushing with newer technologies and I have come to believe that those newer technologies can become security enablers for everybody so if we think about the evolution of the data center pretty simple physical right everybody knows what a box is the second tier is the virtual data center well that's that's like 15 years ago anybody remember gsx how about el par now help iris virtualization and it's been around hall on quite a while right I mentioned mainframes in the beginning what was that same thing not this stuff is not new it's just got a new label on it because it's become commodity so as we're having conversations with customers i prefer architectural high-level discussions i don't like getting in the weeds about tech this that or whatever just because it's not really constructive for my perspective what i try to do is have a conversation with the folks at this table for this table or this table and try to raise that so these different groups within organizations are actually talking to each other well private cloud is kind of forced that and and single somebody out here so what's your opinion of what private cloud what's the definition of private cloud your definition well sure shirt that be public but what private okay that's a great yep um anybody else so the definition for private cloud really is the same as column to accept now we've added api's to it to automate things that's really the only difference am I using VMware here sure am I using kvm or Zen sure OpenStack whatever sure doesn't matter over here it's the same thing except perhaps I've leased it from somebody and there's a bunch of api's in it or I'm doing the AP is in my own data center that's it I'm automating things and that's the only difference so when your executives or maybe your exec yourself your sea levels when they're talking to other sea levels yeah we just built this wonderful private cloud thing and nodded on it you know we can automate it evident well now you know that's all they're talking about they just upgraded their data center to 1.2 it wasn't a big thing was not a big jump the big jump really is a hybrid when we have private cloud or public cloud excuse me public cloud is your things like a sure HP AWS things that you can get to and operate from home right well what's what did I WS really do to push the market what a viet AWS really did to push the market was they established a really great codebase it wasn't that they had this wonderful virtualization tech what they did is they wrapped all their api's around it so you can write shell scripts that will fire up entire data centers and i've actually got a couple things if we have time at the end that if you want to see i can show you some of this stuff and it's just one line as long as it prepped right and the private side of things that hybrid all that is is the merging of the two so now I've got my private data center with api's and I've got the public data center with ap is and I merge those two and that's hybrid that's it it's not super complicated and in all those vendors out there that are spewing just piles of acronyms at everybody and that's all they're really saying so one really big part of this well I'm getting ahead of myself sorry he'll move on so this is a data center we've all got them whether it's that big or small our minds one rack you know but everybody's got them and kind of the common theme here is companies very large companies have gone and they've gone and you know honestly it's just call it what it is they lay people off and outsource a lot of companies have done this now what I'm seeing is that folks where I'm from Minneapolis so there's a lot of big companies that have outsourced to like TCS then you guys you use Tata consulting they've even one of the larger ones in town they even are using them for archit I know so the people we deal with our senior architects and there's four of them and they run a multi-billion dollar companies network because they've outsourced their everything else that's just one aspect and what I'm seeing come around is that this happened and a lot of my friends that work there you know they all had to find jobs three years later these architects architecture teams what they're having to deal with is the fact that these people don't exist anymore yeah they got TCS or whatever other company but it takes nine months to roll a server 200 Aizaz average now it's really ridiculous then the other thing it adds is that when you have people in the data center making changes you're incurring additional risk so what these large companies that have outsourced are finding is that they're having to turn to software companies and going we need automation I don't have people to do this anymore even when I had people it took 100 days to get something done and now the time is doubled tripled its so this one Gavin McCants i would encourage everybody to go watch this that's from 2012 and this is my entire summary of what we should be doing in terms of SDN landscape and if there are if there's at people in the room if they're sea level people in a real amount I don't care what you do but if your application developers are not thinking this way they're doing it wrong that is my opinion and a bunch of people on my team because you know we live this up what CERN did is they had to change the mentality entirely with their new data centers because everybody that wants that got that copied down just google the data center evolution there was a webcast in 2012 and really kind of opened my eyes to what's going on they had to change their service model and you know if you don't know who certain is certain is the is a research research facility they're the largest and most heavily funded research facility in pretty much the world they run the supercollider the big ring smashes Adams right and Europe lots of cots of computing power if you've seen any of the charts about how much processing Walmart uses over Thanksgiving believe it or not these guys use half of that and target is a tenth of that this has actually at more processing power and dynamic content management then some major retailers because of the data that they're crunching anyhow they had to change their entire service model for the next gen data center what we use to do is we had pets we had servers and we own them and we love them and we fed them and we took care of them and we patch them right we upgraded them well that's fine they're unique lovingly hand raised and cared for it right something gets sick nurse it back to health sure that's what we did with server farms now in an SDN landscape we have the automation and baked in that allow us to treat them like cattle and the server people don't want to hear this because their means learning new things that's that's really what it comes down to but we've got pets and cattle and in an SDN landscape in an automated environment whether it's any platform I don't care what platform it is if you're patching something you're wasting time if you are not dynamic your competitors going to eat your lunch that's all there it comes down to this entire model relies around the fact that your cattle your VMs your service machines can be shot at any point in time and replaced and it does it takes a little thinking or get around this but this isn't just a WS this is not just a sure this is the modern data center where I build things and pull up a specific docker stream live as a new banking connection comes in and that specific instance gets torn down and thrown away after that connection goes away I know banks that are already doing this some very very cool stuff I thought we were ahead of the curve last year and then I saw that I was in Toronto and one of our customers that happens to be very good friends with my boss showed us some of the really cool stuff they were about to launch and they actually unfortunately they were able to lay off about 1800 people they're a team of 30 now but because of all this automation yes huge reduction absolutely ridiculous that number went down to about 120 for the first year as they built all the new automation and then that number went down even further as they went into the status mode anyhow the point is it's because if I bring a machine up and I don't like what's going on just get rid of it start a new one done sit total different mentality change hopefully you've seen this before this specific slide is actually give credit where credit's due I stole this infographic from EMC a couple years ago but it's really really informative it's got a lot of data in it this thing is stand out here sorry the transformation factory really we're going from the old way of doing things we're making model a's model t's one server at a time hold teams of people building routers and switches and shipping them out and getting upgrades done and all this kind of stuff up to completely automating everything and up at the top here this the software design defined data center and that's the whole point it's not just an acronym it's where everything is going you wouldn't believe it I've even done the customers that only had you know very small data centers with a couple hundred servers and they're going after this full automation model too because they know if they can't be agile some guy in a basement writing code is going to take their customers and that's reality that's actually what everybody you know needs to deal with the future is very elastic slowed maintenance all these kind of things scripting is king that's all it comes down to now I t as a service broker this part in the middle on with the automated and repeatable horsham that one to me I to us that a little bit and say let's take this automation and enable security at a higher level because if i take the fact that i don't have to check a bunch of boxes plug in a firewall you know plug cables in put servers in the fact that somebody has to doesn't have to do all that means that inherently the complaints about security should start to dissipate if I think about security up front and as part of my deployment actually plan for it so if I'm scripting this many dacono if I'm scripting a couple hundred lines of code in order to roll out server there's bm's and load balancers and I'm doing all this it's actually really easy to have a couple extra lines talk about at firewalls or IPS or whatever I need this number is I'm sure you've seen this over and over I couldn't bring myself to take it out the real thing we're worried about here is this lateral traffic inside because that number is something like eighty percent most of your traffic is inside the data center he I assume you've seen something like this by now already too with a capex and opex and this kind of thing when I mentioned the large companies laying everybody off that's where the optech savings in is is not saving anybody money as yours not going to save you money i don't care if microsoft says not going to happen AWS is not saving you money it's about operational flexibility that's really what it comes down to that whole agility column that's the bigger deal so everybody you've ever seen an application service catalog I've got a video I'm going to drop to in a little bit just one I don't want to waste your time if you have if you have our everybody's already seen it it's basically the web portal that means we go to when they request a server and new servers disappear but that's really kind of where we're going to this really this guy here really has to do with the frames it's more of an explanation of the specific technologies that everything I'm just kind of summarizing glazing over but really hyper visor I got to change the color on this one that didn't turn out so good hypervisor I don't care what it is again azor kvm and it's you know esxi I don't care what hypervisor it is the SDN layer there's a lot of players um what I've seen most recently in the last 14 months are running around doing my job is that a company's a year ago they were doing this internally to determine who's going to do a CI and who's going to do NSX that was kind of the big fight are we going to do a CI are we going to do nsx are your data center people they want the vmware product the network people they want the cisco product that was a year ago ninety-nine percent of the conversations I have with customers now are about which parts of each are we going to use most customers at a large scale in any way are going to have both and they're starting to realize so I don't care that Stan platform I don't care which one it is cloud management pretty simple that's the orchestrator that talks to all of these things right and again the fact that I say I don't care about a CI or nsx or new age or who it is doesn't matter right and there I forgot all right next so we do have some new challenges and I put the questions in there because I don't think they're new I think it's just a revitalized conversation because new technology today not windows NT technology today is allowing us to do things in an easier fashion than we had 10 years ago 10 years ago to get to the level of integration that we have in some of the technologies that are coming out now I was very very difficult it was very very expensive so first one is the perimeter gateway all right we know that have to have one we got it but what it doesn't do is protect your lateral threats right all it takes is one admin to log on to the console of one windows box and go to their Dropbox or go to their Gmail or open anything and the whole farm could be toast that's all really number two this is the harder challenge changing IP addresses things are sleeping they wake up we're all starting to build these VDI farms now so people don't have workstations and they can have remote access and all this kind of stuff a vm works up that doesn't have a patch you know all of these different things it's all about that dynamic content piece that's really what it comes down to especially since those farms are moving all over the place right now we've got VX land kind of like GRE only on steroids take a machine put it from datacenter A to B it'll hide the subnet changes I don't care cisco did something like that a couple years ago but it didn't really take off except at a large scale mainly because i think they try to do it on a hardware platform that had a lot of limitations so the third one is all of these things with all your platforms that's really where we hold private cloud public cloud private cloud doesn't matter how do I handle all this stuff really it's all about managing managing managing all those tools remember that slide with all the red tools all over the place how do I handle all this well as we move forward how do I manage this that's the bigger question of the day we go forward Red Hat is this a big list of all the cloud service providers yes but huge choices companies are going through this and going oh my god what do we do they've all got their own ap is mostly JSON based so those old dogs in the room more gray hair than I got JSON learn it live it you're going to need it all these different tools have their own security feature sets so does it make sense for you to try to use vcloud private data center with azure or with fujitsu or with any other service provider and then try to use their security tools which and for the most part are nothing more than overgrown ACLs with some logging and that's not just you know saying that out loud because i work for checkpoint that's actual fact go and read some of this amazon zzz ACLs for example there's security groups they didn't even have good logging until a version came out the spring and even then guess what they do if I want to log have to insert more quarters because if I've got a server and I want to log off of this flow well I got to use the flow monitor all right quarters that's a service where do the logs go oh they go to my box they go to my digital then they go to the the s3 the s3 bucket well that's another quarter so you can't you can turn on logging sure but you're going to use a specific feature that you should have just baked in very high visibility is key as your I have this one pausing here because I want to make one point a year ago Asher was nowhere in terms of my visibility and my customers it was all amazon it was all nsx it was all a CI if your are an MSP for some of the really big dogs you talk an OpenStack the MSPs are all talk and OpenStack with center or Ubuntu and kvm because it doesn't cost them anything they can debit and the people that debit can move on because their contractors and then they can just operate it and they can build really really slick interfaces and all this really cool stuff but overall it makes them more money this is where VMware's had a hard time with the MSPs because they are expend of an MSP zai SP landscape they don't like that anyhow Azure is easily forty percent of what I do today one year later VMware in these other companies they poke the bear Microsoft is spending an enormous amount of resource capital everything in order to in order to overtake everybody in the central region alone the vp of azure networking has a hundred and twenty Rex open that's a lot of bodies nationwide the data centers themselves are purpose-built unlike AWS which was an accident and if you haven't heard that story i'll give you the rundown longtime got time amazon built their cloud to support their customers that's not you and me it's netflix its monster companies right the excess capacity became AWS it became sellable to us once they realize they could actually act like they were making money using it selling it right as error is purpose-built the networking actually is better if you heard about this thing classic versus resource group mode resource group mode can be concerned considered as your two point O hit July ish last year changed all the API is pissed everybody off but it's better the last point I'll make is that because there are three main security to dev centers for a sure if you're a checkpoint cost to really be interested to know that tomor teller who used to go around to conferences like this in black hat and is a fairly well-known person in the security circles within the US he was checkpoints chief evangelical for a number of years as well he's actually one of the heads of the azure security program he went to Microsoft a couple years ago he also brought a whole bunch of people from checkpoint one a wonderful relationship with it with them it's actually really really cool to be able to have conversations with their product managers directly and all that kind of stuff so moving on this part is just a personal feeling having dealt with VMware and other companies for a number of years I feel HP Oracle everybody else is just asking you to trust them buy our stuff it'll be all better now on you're going to get locked into a specific vendor if you're looking at a shiur or AWS for example they have these things called direct connect and Express route there a fiber based service right straight to your company cool I don't have to do VPN over the internet and I don't have to pay for VPN gateways great now you've got a hard line with a monthly bill straight to your cloud provider are you stuck there for a while yes you are it's a business plan it's a business model so just pay attention to that moving on I feel strongly that the top of rack best-in-class model is thoroughly broken and needs to be tossed away and if you look at some of the Gartner stuff that's coming out in the last 18 months to two years they're starting to agree previously I bought the best product from everybody if you have that kind of money otherwise you used a couple smaller integrated solutions right what happened oh forgot to click sorry ap is our King now period end of story if you're not using api's integrate your security solutions with your network solutions and I can't help you you wouldn't believe how many conversations where I've been in a room with some executives and their architects and have actually had to defend the architects because yeah weird it just works like this like some of these people have no idea what they're even talking about why just go to Amazon and I get a console just like VMware and he's sitting there telling as CIO that and I looked at them I don't want to get this guy fired but it's all about the API integrating integrating integrating that's it I really believe this one of the things I lifted from this conference and in Calgary and this gentleman is actually one of the founders of the bsd movement and tuck in its entirety so i'm just gonna go through that where operational security is it relevant from our perspective from checkpoints perspective adding security features that are easily disabled are completely pointless we are all about prevent i am all about prevent and that's all there is to it i feel the industry has misled everybody for some time I'm happy to work for one of the companies that has never said the things that some of our competition says detections find remediations okay don't block your network traffic it'll cause an operational outage things like that they're telling the ops people what they want to hear in order to get their coins give us your quarters it's okay what really happens is you get breached and then you can say hey you guys saw service that helps me with this too right what's wrong with that model seriously what is wrong with that model I'm going to sell you a box that shows you you're screwed but if you call me maybe I can keep you from getting fired with this team of people that will come in I'm supposed to be agnostic I have a hard time with business models like that that's very clearly on some companies and there's there is not just one that acts operates that way about half of our competition have teams and act like that is what it is I don't believe it lastly what is the job of the security department anybody wrong in IT security here everybody's has an answer right it should be it should not be slow stuff down really to manage risk that's it that's all we're supposed to be doing as managing risk right well with all of those solutions being thrown at you how do you handle that oh my God look at all these choices we have to make well simply pull it to secure all this infrastructure you need a security tool that is easy I'm not saying you need to need a big red easy button but you do need a tool that allows you to automate everything because once you can get to that level where you can automate everything the complaints from your apps people start to go away security slows my job down it's the firewalls fault that's a great Dilbert slide I think every firewall admins cube I've ever visited has it but api's can eliminate that problem because it forces everybody to do it up front it forces you to think about it and not come back and say we need to do a service chaining okay what's your plan oh we just deployed three thousand VMs okay well guess what it's actually not that bad to retro that type of environment any other thing I get my point I got stuff out order the other point about that is that this automated service that we're talking about automatically deploying security of any flavor your vendors better be on their best behavior and do a good job because five years from now it's going to be that easy to replace any of us because in an SDN landscape where things are all automated and scripted if I don't like this widget what do I do all i gotta do is change the flow to a different inspection point and turn off the one I don't like that means things better work from my perspective right and if you're the champion of this technology that you've had for 10 years for your sake to obviously but you know it's a double-edged sword it forces us to stay honest and and work harder at the software level but it also gives customers leverage and why would I be standing up here telling you this if it's negative to me I don't think it's negative to me I already work for an award-winning company I don't care we're going to do a good job so moving on there's three major points you need to ask any vendor that you're about to engage with in an SDN landscape one can you provide automated insertion of advanced threats threat prevention solutions it's pretty simple the answer to Muslims yes but these are the three things need to ask to how about automated provisioning of those tools once they're deployed and what this means is IPS profiles URL filtering updates application updates say there's an open SSL vulnerability do I have to wipe that whole thing to fix it or can I just you know is there just can just push patch whatever that kind of thing to the security engine not the whole box cattle security visibility inside the data center I need good visibility inside right down to the vm Nick your tools need to do all three of these things that's really really all it comes down to this one all right I'm doing good on time um this is I was going to close with a little video and this what this is is if you've seen a demo from VMware in the last 90 to years you'll recognize this this is the vCenter Orchestrator interface notice this is not a checkpoint product this is just one of the many many many orchestrators that I get to deal with daily it's kind of fun this is a cookbook once I press go it's going to start doing and the stuff that's doing is telling a checkpoint manager here's my whole agnostic part just kind of went out the window for the last minute but sorry had to do it I don't have any demos of other guys stuff essentially that service chain can get kicked off from a web portal that your admins are using or it could be an admin clicking go like in this fashion and what I'm doing here and I know it's hard to read but these are at group had machines to group install policy all of these different things that you would have to do in the in the dashboard or in your security tool in order to provision this right somebody does built this cookbook ahead of time and anytime a new pod gets rolled out or whatever security comes with it so as I click go and I got to get up here so I can toss it so we're starting and you see a turning green I missed it dang it anyhow what it started doing is going through that service chain so again that could be initiated through a web portal that your admins have built for their own use or for your IT users use or whatever or it could be somebody building that manually now what we're flipping over to is what is occurring on the checkpoint side pala VMware vmware is telling us what to do so if i hit go you're going to see rules you see objects in the database and this is all in real time with a dashboard open all this stuff is just populating because vmware says so this is a level of integration your tool needs to have some of our friends out in the world are doing similar things but so far our integration has been tighter so these are all machines these are rules firewall rule base you know there's a threat prevention policy attached here there's a you know the drop the wall the logging all of that kind of stuff I provisioned everything oh and the first thing it did what you can't see in here was it actually told it to create the virtual gateway in the first place so i created the virtual gateway and then it started writing rules around it and then at the man you know the video plays out at the end here you see it actually provision provision security done that took all of well I talked longer than it took to actually happen so when I was talking about those three things you have to have this is it that's the level that's where kind of the the gold standard should be from my perspective that's everything I had to talk about I will be around for a little while if anybody wants to talk about specific products and how we do that or enable this but have a great day and
