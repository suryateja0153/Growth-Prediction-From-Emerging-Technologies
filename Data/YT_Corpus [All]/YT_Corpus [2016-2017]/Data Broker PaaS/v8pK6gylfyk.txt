 let's get started hi again thank you for coming here today I realize we are between you and your on the lunch so we will try to get you all out but 1:30 so today we are going to talk about beyond Bosh and CPI so what that means is you know basically Oh a journey for the last one year so in May 2015 last year a little over a year and I remember the day because last year the summit was right after Mother's Day weekend so I travel the day so last year it was just moving and me at the conference our CPI was an early preview and we demoed it and we're really glad to be back again here this year and share our incredible journey the last one year releasing the services running customers in production and building a Microsoft cloud foundry community within Microsoft so our goal today is to share our experience and a journey I think if you don't mind intense light next please about us who are we as I mentioned right we have a small cloud foundry community within Microsoft there are few folks here in the room as well in addition to us I'm a program manager primarily working on as your past services as your first party past services and open source / open source path service integration as well and with me is Gil Gil is a partner architect who primarily focuses on is v onboarding and we have link who heads the team who is a program manager for cloud foundry project and she works in the open source team so this is just a small team the rest of us are you can find us in the booth so today in the 30 minutes we want to walk away with these three takeaways cloud foundry plus a short so we'll spend a few minutes talking about the why and the how then we want to show you how you can easily get started with a click of a button deploy cloud foundry on assured and finally we just announced the a short service brokers these are service brokers for a short first party services and Ning will do a demo of that thanks name so before we get started right let's look at what is supported today Claude 400 units your where are we what supported so number one is the open source Cloud Foundry is generally available today in addition pivotal Cloud Foundry is fully supported we also have a single quick mod template in our marketplace that auto that allows you to deploy PC open as your with the click of a button and just announced hard thing is the service brokers so these are the things that are today's supported in Azure and if you go to the next line oh and one more thank you so just to quickly give some highlights of cloud foundry and as your in terms of what's supported so you know a lot of questions customers a lot of folks ask us you know why do we support Cloud Foundry national what is the primary driver the number one reason for us to work on Cloud Foundry is many of our customers have asked this so it's frequently asked by our customers it's a great option for running Java workloads on Azure in addition it's fully owned and supported by Microsoft and it also has it's backed by our executives so it's actual executive commitment in addition we have a great joint engineering model with pivotal and now we know in the from recent news you might have seen Microsoft is also invested in Puritan success so load up again in just one year you know this project picked up a lot of momentum and a lot of cold highlights to share so a lot of you know in in the next couple three four slides I want to look I want to give an overview of some the most commonly asked questions and try to summarize where we are so the first question is where does the Cloud Foundry fit in as your ecosystem so adjure has a lot of past services so our customers ask us where does it fit in the ecosystem when to use what so this this diagram is what we call the path continuum this describes all of the path services in Azure you know starting from the IR side to the past soil and in between and I'm not trying to cover all of any of this in detail in except our boundary but if you look at Cloud Foundry Cloud Foundry sits at the same level as other first-party services it's built on the same infrastructure like the rest of the services and at the end of the day we leave it to the customers to choose the platform that's right for their applications all right so this is about Barrett with the second next question that gets asked often is in what regions can you deploy cloud foundry and a short today so if you go to the next line so if you've seen as your regions so as Joe today has been announced in 32 regions so this is more than any other cloud combined and out of beans 24 or operational so this is a huge huge investment serious stuff right so we are making a big bet on this growing our infrastructure the goal for Azure is to be in all major regions and we're a sure cannot be as your stack will be there so I just wanted to actually take a quick pause and ask a question that I wanted to ask in the beginning but I forgot is how many how many folks in the room use Azure thank you this store doesn't count it's all magazine okay a few of you so for those of you who are not familiar right so this is one of the strategic investments where Azure is the investment on growing all these as you region's so close and so out of these regions some of these are sovereign clouds for example as your China is an example which is sovereign cloud Germany which was pronounced it's also a sovereign cloud so these are all the regions there's another government cloud as well so these are all the public cloud and sovereign clouds where you could run Cloud Foundry all right next one little bit about the Bosch project so bashed bashed CPI as everybody may know room knows what CPI is so I will not talk about it just like any other CPI for any cloud actual version is also fully open sourced we have a dedicated engineering team that started small and it's growing it's aligned with the community engineering practices we work very closely with the community so if anybody in the room has work with us on this project many thanks to you and the most important thing for us is the whole CPI the whole rack it's designed to work both in a short public cloud on the azure stack which is an on-prem data center so when plot 400 when it becomes available our goal is to make it easy to deploy cloud foundry in Azure stack so yeah and we have a committed roadmap some of it will share today if you want what's coming in the pipeline please feel free to stop by our booth next line yeah so the last another question that we get often is you know this is a new service go on in production just like any other services how ready is it for enterprise workloads so you know today with cloud forward in the last one year by you know by working with customers we have actually exercised many enterprise scenarios and these are some of the examples so you can take Cloud Foundry and do an active-active configuration or a multi deployment you know this is just a topology I put there you know things like securing your deployments isolating them so most of the enterprise scenarios are supported today and many of them are in the roadmap all right so with that high-level overview I'm going to give it to deal to talk about pivotal Cloud Foundry all right I'm gonna pay attention to where the boundary is on the stage okay thanks candana and as candana mentioned I'm a sure architect I work exclusively with ISV partners who are onboarding on to Azure and enabling their solutions on Azure over the past six eight months my life has become almost exclusively cloud foundry and pivotal cloud foundry and we were working very closely and this is just some examples of the work that we have done over the past few months is a picture of a hack fest we had where we brought together a group of people who were just getting started within Microsoft on various projects around Cloud Foundry we brought them out into Redmond we had some pivotal folks who were doing some training with us and then we did some of our own projects and out of this we have a growing community we have I think our we have anybody uses Yammer we have an internal Yammer group it's got almost 100 folks on it and words actively working together and supporting each other you may have seen the Ford project announcement so a lot of us worked on that either in one way or another behind the scenes helping each other and in addition you may have seen around the time of the Ford announcement that we brought to market a marketplace offer which I'm going to talk about in a second which allows you to single click out of the marketplace and deploy a test environment in Azure we're also working side by side with pivotal engineers we have a juror engineers who are going to be spending time with pivotal directly and we're also advising on architecture with our customer advisory team and you know again starting with candana and Ming's work which we're all very lucky that they started we're fully supported on Azure so how can you deploy Cloud Foundry with one-click I like to think of this part of our presentation there's easy ways for you to get started even if you I saw we had I'm gonna just call it 20% in the audience who have played around with Azure these couple of slides I threw some links in here and these this content will be available to everybody after the summit but it's super easy to get started with Azure and it's super easy to single click and get started with Cloud Foundry on Azure so a fundamental basic foundation of this is the azure resource manager and that is essentially the API for everything that happens within a sure and it not only is the API but it includes a really an easy template driven way to create things in Azure so you can build a JSON template you send it to the Azure resource manager and you get stuff it's all related so I'll pre-configured we actually have an extensive library I'm going to show these in just a second but we have an extensive library of pre-built templates to construct a lot of common use cases with in Azure and the open source Cloud Foundry the first release that came out last year the Bosh components and the initial networking is all based on a pre-configured Azure template which you can go to and you can look at that so again resource manager is foundational to this from there you you use arm and then we have now built a marketplace so a lot of popular software solutions that you may be familiar with may be used to using in the cloud are available in the marketplace from a single click and based on that we built the PCF on Azure offering and additionally if you get into trouble we've done a really nice job in partnership with pivotal writing a deployment guide so let's take a quick look at these where is the browser okay so first starters oh it's on the needs to be moved over to here alright okay now I can't see the screen can we make it a single screen all right I'll just improvise so you don't usually hear people talking about documentation as being very exciting but if you haven't looked at any of the Microsoft sites lately we've put a tremendous amount of investment into the documentation there's a lot of great examples as tutorials there's getting started guides and there's really tremendous detail about how to do things this is just the example of the resource manager documentation landing page and it's really quite extensive so based on this where's the mouse okay we over the sense resource manager has come out and this is something that Microsoft is really doing a heck of a lot of work on internally and with the community is we built this library and it's you can see it's on github anybody can look at this anybody can contribute and participate of quite a lot of common use cases of pre-configured solutions that you can deploy right on to Azure and again you may have seen this at some of the previous presentations but this is our G a guidance for Bosch and cloud foundry on Azure so again you'll see there's a resource template in here and then from the resource template and though your your Deb jump box is created and then you can go right in and launch deployment scripts just like you would on any Cloud Foundry and this is the marketplace so let's see what that number there it's now 3,700 and growing and a lot of my colleagues are actively working with names you would all recognize in fact actually I think this was yesterday we just made a really nice announcement with Jenkins so there's Jenkins integration so we're working really closely with them so just to give you an example if you look for any of your favorite solution sitting here you're likely to find them if I go in here and search for pivotal hopefully I typed it correctly all right and there is the offer so if I select that how do you have time okay good I can single click right into here and it's going to launch so let's just take a quick look at what that does for us so that deploy button and actually if you look at the Quick Start library that I showed in github every single one of those templates also has a deploy button and what the deploy button does is it just takes the template starts the azure portal and takes you right to a launch page with the template now when you do a marketplace offering you you the quick launch goes to the partners launch page and you can see there's extensive description and it's it's really pretty much what was on the marketplace landing page also is in here and I'll show this at the end but this way only at the bottom the deployment guide is here as well so if we which I didn't that's the deployment guide okay but if I click on create alright we had we were using several people's laptops so we have different logins so what you would see if I had the correct login here is there's an entry screen there's a few fields that you need to enter so that Bosch has the right credentials in order to create things in Azure and then also this is a commercial offering so you do need a pivot token but it is a 90 day free trial and then that would start to launch the entire Cloud Foundry now this is a pre set size that's meant for pocs and testing but it's again you enter your secure credentials hit click and you're off to the races and so again if doing that this is okay this guide will help you all if you hit something that's an issue this guy do this is probably in here okay we've done a pretty a lot of people have battle-tested this just to make sure we have all the appropriate guidance in here so let's go back to PowerPoint yet expands to somewhere like 50 I think the actual numbers in the deployment guide Donna but it's something like 50 60 VMs as it you know Cloud Foundry has a lot of worker roles and then it settles down to like 30 35 and that's when the audience yeah and that's all automated it's just you know runs and so if you have entered all of yours we'll get back to here you will see all of your VMs running once you've launched so this is just a screenshot of a running Cloud Foundry that has several VMs so with that / - minguk we're we're kind of optimizing it all the time the last thing i've seen was somewhere in the hour so time frame of course you know any cloud foundry that you would launch that is gonna depend on how many you know how big you make it right this is like we said about 30 to 50 VMs okay so onto service brokers thank you so we are the engineering team for a sure open-source and in the past two years our major focus is cloud foundry and enable cloud foundry adjure and we work closely with the community with our customers and has seeing an incredible journey here you can adjust as Donna mentioned CPI is the first project we work on with that that is the first interface we have between Cloud Foundry and Azure and we we have a preview last year about the same time for the summit and the end of last year we finally announced the GA and CPI is just the first step beyond that actually there are a lot of more components in Azure that can contribute to the ecosystem of Cloud Foundry and from this graph you can see for the infrastructure of Cloud Foundry and at different level we have component in anger that our customer is interested and asking us to integrate and contribute to clock on J component for example the application gateway for routing and load balancing for a generic added active directory for authentication block storage and service service brokers and then our Microsoft operation manager suite for monitoring and logging so today I'm going to focus on service brokers because as Gil and Kadena I just mentioned we just released the public preview of our first batch of service brokers last week hiccup quick look here here is um here are the five service brokers the azure blob storage event have service pass radius and document DB these at the top on the top list customer is always asking and you can also see later I'll show the UI we have a simple and consistent interface so whatever you are comfortable today to develop for service brokers and your existing platform it's consistent you can use the same way to to configure it and to use it we call it metal service broker what this does is we have one single service broker interface you only need to install and configure one service broker and after that all the services the five services is included in this package we just need to enable it and this is totally open source so it's open to community to contribute and adding feedbacks for different roles for Cloud Foundry for service broker we have different guidance for admins we have we have guidance guide you through the process of creating service finding services and for developers we just need to all you need to do is to utilize the environment variables to access the service incidences and then for contributors and we have guidance on how you can write your own service brokers - if you like any address services you can use the same way to add to our package so next I'm going to take a look so this is where our service broker in github and we have the system and a service broker here's the overview and the guidance for admin and guidance for each individual services the service bus and the event hub in same service and then the contributors guidance okay so um the next I'm going to walk through the step how an admin can deploy and utilize a service broker here I already have a Cloud Foundry deployment and with that I just install our mater service broker as application to this Cloud Foundry deployment and right now since this is a PCF deployment you can see if I check this marketplace that these are the default service brokers that is taught and that does not have any agile services yet so what I'm going to do is I'm going to first create a service okay let me double-check that okay so I seem to me the service broker is currently crated this is the matter service broker I just mentioned which is appear to be a single service broker but it contains all the services in order for you to access all the service order services you need to enable them so enemies enable the service broker they're bad at pack I mean just yes a little bit bad of typing okay so we enable the first service broker which is the flat storage let's enable the next one which is address service pass okay and let's enable remember agile service bus high post service pass and even law now enable the document DB and finally the readiest service servus okay so all the five services is now enabled what we can do is we can do a marketplace so from here if you look at the marketplace you can see the azure service brokers are already here and they are available for the developer to to use next the admin wanted to make a service instance so the the developer can take advantage of it so he first need to create a service I'll specify the plan okay my spelling is really bad okay so it's already created seem to me so in order to so the service is created in order for the application to use it you need to actually you actually need to look at your applications so let's go to our application and here so if you look at your application you will find so all you need to do with your application is you can take advantage of the service the involvement environment variables we just created for you so here you can see that's the actual blog service and then if you have the services enabled and then you can access the environment variable so here what okay so finally let's take a quick look of this [Music] so this is the PCI app manager with the plum font redeployment and you can see with the marketplace all the address service broker is now in a vault and you just need to run your application to find it later okay thank you so we have a couple of other sessions if you want to learn more about a sure we have a session on dotnet and then we have also tomorrow a panel where you can come and ask some tough questions no because these guys are taking some starting the amount of questions but hope to see you around in the booth it's not there thank you [Applause]
