 you the newspaper review courtesy of James uses chief market analyst at j g KFX let's get that right DK FX exactly yes like all right we've got we've had quite a rough weekend with the terror attacks and I mean that this is a horrific news there but there was also the Queen celebrations there was pouring rain the pouring rain the football this is but it's still about breaks it isn't it it's all about brexit I mean looking over the weekend and today's papers today I've been fairly similar we're looking at that same situation with bricks it dominating the papers trying to tell us that it's moving into different areas of the of the markets in terms of the the fears that we're seeing which is going to happen and of course we've got more polls coming out and like I think it was a back end of last week we saw Ladbrokes slashing the odds to three two one for the brexit to happen and now polls this morning put the leave campaign ahead of the remain campaign but we've seen that already it's interesting that the bookies haven't changed the bookies are still on like say seventy percent yeah remain and thirty percent you know on the other side and something's going to do some money well the interesting thing is and I always we know these polls when it comes to the Scottish referendum or the election they're all allowed to rubbish we can we can't take hardly any of them for the worth the paper they're written on but you look at some of the polls the general polls that people are voting on like you silly at the poll on Twitter that someone puts on all the poll on a website somewhere that people just have to click that have to do anything about the majority of them keep coming out sort of seventy percent for the league campaign and I think there's I not that I'm more inclined to believe them than the other polls but I'm more inclined to believe them than the other polls so there is a big league campaign does have it says what I was saying to climb chambers of a dbf n that this is a sort of question that you're speaking people to people face-to-face in the office other places like that as it's a bit of a subversive things if it had the establishment to say to your for brexit type of people who are breaks it sir also slightly strange as well is it in the in the office and in many general places it's more polite to say you got remain whereas in the previously of your own home and you're clicking on a mouse you can I can actually come up with your with your real view well that the privacy of the appalling box as well that's the that's the big question and it and there was this feeling that if the turnout was high enough it would mean the remain would would win but I think there is also a shift in that now and which means that if the turnout is big enough those people that are the shift in the lead campaign and the the changing in people's minds means that if the turnout does happen to be pretty big then it could be the brexit that wins I mean I think what this tells us is that none of us got any idea how everyone's going to vote it's you have to wait for junior 23rd well it's not of course look so long to go looking at the headlines there's a few different things so the first one is from The Times this morning builder puts brexit clause in contract and this is Galliard homes is is the first that that's coming at us the biggest property developer in London who's coming out and and now for potential homebuyers that they're coming out and saying well look you put down and tell us that you're going to buy this house and we will put a clause in your contract that says if you change your mind and the UK votes the brexit then we can cut out no strings attached which I'm sure there is if a modest fee and what is Fianna as I've been find out bit of a small small print that would be involved in that as well but I think it just it highlights that obviously from mortgage approvals and and house building and those situations we're likely to see after the the referendum result whatever the result work maybe the figures that we then get after that in the preceding months and we know a lot of these economic indicators are lagging anyway because they're showing us numbers from before we could well see a drop down a lot of those economic bits of data which would feed into everyone's hist Asteria after the vote that if we do see whichever way we go we're going to see maybe a little bit of negativity in terms of these numbers and I think it's very interested in the fact that we now have a have house builders going in saying well obviously the numbers are dropping tins or house builders can't get people to side binder the paying the stamp duty or they're offering to pay stamp duty yeah nine Elmer's often do there but the other point is that you got that you got the vote but in fact the other problem which these house builders have in house buyers is that even if it's a remain there's going to be so much uncertainty if it's a tight vote it's that this might happen Cameron resins and we're looking at quite a few months of potential uncertainty and then you've got the u.s. elections as well so as far as putting you know by in a spending a million two million three million pounds not perhaps not the easiest time to do so now you can understand why people are fearful and of course it's maybe this gives people a little bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card even if you are I mean I was wandering around Chelsea yesterday so first sign a few few for sale board you haven't seen for quite a while yeah now of course ID a bit ly the oldest did tells you that foreign investment may be looking to seep its way out because we don't know how many how many foreign investors are owned those properties in Chelsea but i'm getting the percentage pretty high up was wondering they're just trying to pick up a couple couple of houses of course your target hunting exactly ever looks at bargain i think she'll sit right next slide also on the brexit side yeah and this is breakfast little area with the FX side yes yeah his seat beyond sterling now we know sterling is the biggest area that has seen the most amount of falls so far but then there is this this fear moving into a lot of European missing bond markets particularly and ramping higher yield to all-time record lows a German tenure at I guess point the thing is one basis point is it not in this morning something like that so we've got a feeling of those whether that's to do with breaks it or not but with the paper's like to tell us that everything a negative is to do with the brexit fears or the referendum discussions but even though the FT are telling us that breaks it fears seat beyond sterling we know that the battleground for this in terms of the markets is going to be on sterling and that night that 23rd is going to be a very very volatile time in terms of currencies obviously this that result is going to come out at some point during the evening we're all going to be in our offices 24 hours a day exit polls on the exit polls and all of the different points and every single one which we're likely to see bouncing around is going to give us such huge moves that the potential opening on the foot see the next day is going to be it's going to be huge it's it's not going to be like an election it's not going to be like the Scottish referendum situation it'll be ugly that the biggest thing since the erm i honestly think so i think this could be a real it is a really really important time and i don't think we all know that everyone's heard the different stories either way we all know that both sides of the campaign are fighting the the worst probably battle you've ever seen with no information from anyone but what we do know is if you are sitting on the sidelines it's there's gonna be a huge amount of volatility and traders that are relying on that sort of volatility and taking out all sorts of economic and results and what happens here and there forget about the vote forget about how we vote traders looking for volatility are going to get it on jun 23rd 24th there are going to be big swings but of course you have to look at other situations like swiss national bank situation and things will we just don't know the result can be really really dangerous for very all of the trading account know so the night well that the volatility would come from an exit poll which was you know 48 52 or something and just absolute right down the line then over overnight were just waiting to see that the way they're wearing tix one so I tix the other side someone's one here someone's lost their this is it's going to be awesome vote papers over there yeah yeah there's a line vote hasn't been counted they've lost the postal bag and all those things right okay next next slide away from slightly away from brexit yeah wife and breaks it a little bit but really does stay in this is george osborne's and real charm offensive to the chinese as we know for a long time the gut the UK government has it had this big charm offensive towards the chinese and one of those big reasons is because the UK is the hub of currency trading is the the hub of foreign exchange trading huge percentages of not just trading in the the trading in the euro trading in the dollar trading in all sorts of currency pairs comes through London and George Osborne has stepped up his a charm offensive with with China about getting the more you on a remnant be whichever way you want to call it but getting that more trade over to us here in London but of course the fear about this and of course he said this headline is London lead the role in currencies global stage because there aren't many places that historically been able to trade you on it becomes much more popular in the in the last 18 months to two years or so but the fear is again coming back to a brexit and this is why half of the battle ground has been fought here in London and in the city is the fact that London is the hub for currency trading but can the breaks it and and potential voting out really puts couple to that where does the large amount of euro training go now personally I think that's that's a lot of rubbish that they could it could move away from here but there are generally those fears and this is the interesting point in the time today this story talks about how they are moving ahead and the charm offensive continues and the UK will be the the leading place to trade do you want but it also like every other story in the business pages has a little sideline that which could pretty much read PS be careful because bricks it could ruin all this and that every story in the business pages could have that little um this yeah it could have that line to say be careful because the breaks it could ruin it we're just at the end of time but just quickly on this fed silence I suppose if they're saying the size for the feather is not much to talk about on that one row it's not much talked about and I think that just comes in is a big week for the central bank's this week we've got Bank of Japan we've got the Fed we've got the Bank of England and it could be silenced across the board from all of them whereas two weeks ago or so it was rate hike from the Fed was pretty much nailed on for june so that the changing shifting it in in the markets and how we see it and with all the breaks it discussions that might be just a little bit of a silver lining for everyone at the moment to just keep away from the volatility a little bit james shoes cheap market analyst for OG k FX thank you very much for coming today thank very much be back the break welcome back delighted to welcome Clem chambers who's the founder at a DVF n to have a little chat with him this morning Clem good morning good morning right I just wanted to talk to you a bit about the the last time you spoke and then what what's happening now but we're getting a rather bullish over the last couple of weeks but it seems to have all gone pear-shaped over the last few sessions well I think the brexit is worrying the international investors in the London market and I think they factored in a 800 point drop if we get a leaf oh and a 400-point pop if we get a stay boat and you know the bookmakers the same two to one against but the market just doesn't stop there there in factors in the impact with that two to one actually comes about oh it was a bit off year maybe a bit off the ADV FN remit but the the sixty-eight percent chance of a remain but the bookies are putting the brexit ears ten points ahead in the polls and how does that work out well I mean polls does anyone take any notice them anymore after the Tory party win at the election I mean the pollsters are going into this online polling world and the online polling world is a completely different user base and in fact I think it's probably populated with trolls so you're getting phone results which are really pretty much what the book is are saying and then you're getting these online results which are wildly divergent so I think online polling is being shown up as being you know a 14 methodology and I think and that's what we're going to see at the referendum result run you don't think that people when they're speaking face-to-face with a question somebody questioning them will say what will say remain or they don't know but in private they will have stronger views and say well that you know actually I'm a brexit person especially given the way that it's a bit anti-establishment to be of the leave campaign well I think that the world of online cheating is this pestilential and I think that that overwhelms pretty much everything and I think that's what you're seeing online and polling i think is being messed up with by the actual people that are being polled you know we see it time and time again don't we online cheating everywhere you go there's people writing bots to do this and to do that and I think the online polling is not reliable and I think the telephone pole bling is much more reliable I think that's reflected in the bookmakers odds right and you disagree describe the possibility of a 600 point to drop for 800 point drop but if there's a if there's a breaks it would that be an opportunity to buy we do we fill our boots to the footsie of that level well I think they leave I mean I don't mind either way as an individual I think I probably vote to leave just to be an annoying person but um I actually think that and the leave vote will be disastrous because I don't think Parliament will pass it I think Parliament will say no we're not passing that and that will just cause all sorts of trouble and ask therefore i think the leave will be relatively catastrophic if that vote goes through not just economically because the EU will have to crucify britain to keep the EU together but also because i think and the the our government the structure the alene will have vote against with their own power to stay in Europe so we won't be leaving so will a vote to leave and then government the Parliament will say no no no we're gonna ignore that as they can because it's an advisory referendum it isn't an binding on Parliament and people keep forgetting that Parliament will not undo the business will not do the negotiation will not pass the bill to leave the EU and I think that is a huge risk if the leave with the vote that there'll be this sort of schism between the people and government and I think if that occurred that would be hugely damaging so I think the 800 points could be a right first movie i think i could get a lot worse the other point is that as we've been threatened the the Scots would have a second referendum to leave because they they don't want to leave the EU according to mr. salmon and others well I mean it's there weren't independence from England and they want to be part of the United States of Europe good luck to write but I mean is that it's almost a case of the bluff pink although because if they did actually have to vote after the first referendum when oil was a hundred dollars a barrel they did they they didn't leave now this situation presumably they would be even less likely to leave so it's it's but it's just a chaos it's the chaos in between isn't it really it's just a case I mean I don't think in 10 years anybody would notice a great little difference but I think in three they would and if Scotland on tonight estates in Europe as a lot of people in England don't want to be then that's fine it's not the end of the world to be part of the United States of Europe it's actually a pretty rather good i should think for most people i mean most working people would love to have the pensions of of northern Europe would love to have the health care system of places like France which actually a lot of people emigrate from the UK to get french or german and health care system a lot of people would like the working conditions all that stuff they actually really like that you know you're it's a great place to live so it's only a matter of nationalism that we're discussing here not long term and prosperity but you know that's what politics is all about it's a shame I sell the other the NHS was the best health service in the world apparently it isn't i can't believe that it will be i've never used it mobile happy that Matt might be a healthy move but just to finishing a finishing off with the financial markets we're hearing all about the bond markets and yields at record lows and all sorts of chaos at which hasn't been there before what to explain to a layperson what the chaos is in the bond mark at the moment well what's going on that is not really written about is the Fed has 80 billion dollars every month to reinvest into bonds because they have however many trillions innings five with an average seven year um life all those bonds so every month 80 billion plus interest is a cat is their internal cash flow and every now and again they that back into the bond market and that pushes money out so you get a compression of bond yields because the fed is buying 80 billion of them probably underpinning of them and if they're not buying it regularly month or months maybe they have one month two hundred billion of bonds to buy so it's like a rolling QE support and that's causing fluctuations and other markets because as the bonds are turn into cash I'll see that tracks money out of the market as the Fed takes that cash and puts it back into new bonds corporate bonds buying sold bonds back that cuts the yields on bonds and pushes up prices elsewhere now the worrying thing is I think this is going on right now but it's not pushing equities up so equities are quite soft even though bonds are actually firming really really strongly because of that money flow that I just discussed so that shows you that actually exes are really very weak but the money that's been pushed in is supporting them so we're getting this slide summer weakness that we're seeing now but because it could kick off anytime and we could get a sudden rally I mean these markets are controlled by central bank liquidity they're not free roaming Marcus anymore so it's really once more back to the politicians or the elite and bankers and bureaucrats who are really calling the direction of these markets and why they have control over them because their policies are working not much will go wrong the trouble come as if ever they lose control if ever their policies don't have the fact that they want to have that's when we'll be in trouble but I don't think it's quite some time yet I take it you weren't able to share these views at the Bilderberg meeting over the weekend is that correct clan well I called meeting in all my underlings went obviously right Scott know Clem chambers CEO at a DB FM thank you very much for speaking with us today thank you we'll be back after the break you okay welcome back I to welcome manhunt who's floating especially from island to see us today from chasing returns which is trading analytics software can you explain it to me and to us so what that's all about absolutely so most traders don't really understand where their trading edge is so they have a strategy and they understand their strategy but actually most people's trading edges in their own personal psychology which it relates to how they implement their trades so for example traders behavior changes when they're fearful when they have a string of losers or maybe when there's a lot of volatility in the market and previously the way traders think about it is they intuitively react really quickly when they're under pressure and we're chasing returns is trying to do is trying to slow that process down so effectively rather than overreacting when you hear a squawk bringing out some big news what we do is we give you a series of metrics so you can see where your trading performance is strong and ease a week and you could make better decisions so it's holding up a mirror to your trading it is holding up a painful bush in my case it can be it can be but it can also be very positive because regardless of your trading ability you've got some positive edge and you've got some negative edge relative to your overall average the other thing is that in the text books on trading you're told to keep a diary but trades and do all that stuff but after a day on the markets the last thing you want to do is write down you know what you were doing 841 when you turn I kinda quit on the hit on the DAC so this this makes it all easy this is all automated it's automated your trades get loaded in from your broker we let you tag a trade with one word right so your journal can be a series of words but if you want to tag your trades that's available for you to them filter so for example if you shouldn't trade around NFP and you do you can tag the trades that you did and then you can go back and see when how do they perform relative to my overall trading strategies for example right let's have a look at some of the slides willing to illustrate your point sir velocity yeah so velocity is again when we look at trading psychology different people suffer from different habits velocity is looking at how fast people trade so what we do is we measure how long you close out a trade how long you wait to get back into the market and here we see a classic case of a trader who's actually profitable most of the time but twenty-five percent of his trades are executed in under two minutes of his last exit so he's taken all the emotional baggage from the last trade and he's jumping back into the market and he's taken some huge losses so that's a classic example of somebody who needs to we never recommend somebody doesn't take a trade but he certainly needs to think about he's disciplined when he's making those those fast trades discipline is perhaps the key of the whole exercises all right one is the key we're chasing returns helps people is it prioritizes where your discipline needs to be so you know a lot of traders have there are 400 things they'd like to do but when you look at it this way you know for this trader there's only one thing he has to do and that is be really really careful when he's trading quickly was awaiting more than two minutes before it jumps in a game he could try waiting more than two minutes but he may carry the baggage for longer right so initially what we suggest is you size down those trades for a while until you improve the house it's a few size down and spend that trading capital more efficiently in a better trading edge for the same risk you'll get a lot better return well the discipline part here I mean for me it is it is a key because the reason the people or people who get into trading which is a wild west rock and roll thing to do typically they're not your average boring account and lawyer doctor they they they are people who are quiet risk risk on let's say maverick type characters and the last thing you can do with them is make them discipline themselves otherwise they would be doctors lawyers and accountants or at least doing that you know all the time are not doing any trading so that is a big thing to change it's a massive thing to change and it doesn't happen overnight so we kind of look at it in three different parts I think awareness is critical so when I spoke to that trader and said do you realize you're jumping back into the market really quickly and you're losing money the trader said yeah I kind of know that but when you say this is how much money you're losing that really helps people focus because if you can turn it into numbers then you actually have a reason to improve and the other thing is we also focus on the positive so if you have a positive edge of being a very successful trader on a Wednesday right and maybe your friday afternoons aren't so good why wouldn't you trade more on a Wednesday and less on a Friday and the other thing is on the discipline part apart from losing money you're not gonna have an electric shock going off every time you do a wrong trailer I mean how how do i mean the spotting this is one thing spotting your good points and bad points is one thing with the software then what's the cure how do you help on that area so what we do is we have some goal setting and we believe there's only two reasons you lose money you either lose too often or you lose too much so it's really simple you know you can look at all the various reasons why your strategies failing but we break it down into those two pieces some people suffer from both and some people really suffer from one over the other so what we do is we look at your batting average which is how often that you're winning and we look at your risk reward ratio and we let people set a target to improve one of those right or bows if they really want to but really you want to focus on one thing at a time and so it's kind of like a gamification system where now you've set yourself a present personal target and then you have to give it at least 100 trades and try and improve right i mean my father is a young 84 heat razor dax he's because I I watch him i watch him I can tell what is good points and bad points are so he's great on the short side after three or four trades in the day things start to go pear-shaped etc etc there's no I mean it's go it's quite tough to get him to change this is its pattern if you see what I mean yeah well I think so much advice goes out to traders that says put the same bet size on every trade and really if you use money management really effectively your dad should be putting on a much bigger bats eyes in the morning and reduce it in the afternoon so the same trading capital over the course of a day is going to return him but the other problem is that the week when the DAX is going up he's got he's got nothing to do which if you're a gambler you know which most people are in this area that's going to keep trading so it is it's quite a challenge but if you get it right if you know if you help clients get it right it can't make a big difference absolutely so me neither I mean other examples of people who turned situations around yes and so and this particular trader who was not profitable before they started using the platform in January is now consistently profitable that's only one data point but what we find is when traders start to use the platform they tend to slow down their trading and then when they start to get confidence around the habits that they really have that work for them they tend to size up again so there's actually seeing i can imagine seeing this and seeing your performance the good and the bad actually gives you confidence to get it right and make sure they're as much as much green on there as possible rather the big negative yeah bars yeah something that just seeing this graphically helps people understand where they're going wrong I think seeing a graphically really helps when we look at any Hobbit it tends to be fifty percent red and fifty percent green because it's all relative to yourself so you're better and worse you know in some places but actually what we like to do is look at your overall trade history now look at the last month and when people see that improving that really motivates them we got five sides to go so I just want to get through what they show day of the week okay so this is a classic very young trader who when he has a bad day he gets himself together comes in the next day and he makes money and then he's overconfident and he literally just gives it back so it's like a yo-yo all right so that's a very self-explanatory thing seeing that we can we can't we can't would change hopefully change the methodology there yes yeah so step one there was positioned down on your negative days right so if you had a positive day trade smaller the next day and just even the act of knowing it's a weakness can sometimes help people whereas in other cases they have to work harder to try and improve their habits okay well next slide so this is looking at behavior after consecutive losers so we know scientifically now that when we're thinking terms of loss we make completely different decisions and when we're thinking in terms of in terms of gain so you know a winner 50 quid is only phony feels half as good as a loss of 50 if you know what I mean right I certainly do know what you mean yes so and what typically happens is traders kind of have a cut-off point this guy's happens to be too sometimes it's for so he's after one consecutive loss his returns get negative after two consecutive losses those next trades are even worse and then once he's had three losses in a row he gets his discipline back he sort society sorts it out but when you look at you know I think it was yeah seventeen percent of his trades right lost the entire pnl right so he just fixed that problem alone he'd be profitable okay I was just thinking what would happen if this was applied to other areas of life but maybe that's foreign to us for a different software in a different conversation next slide please time of the day which is the morning you know the but the morning when you're fresh in the markets are moving easier than later in the day you know everybody's different and in this case this guy is not great on the opens in either case in London or New York he's actually better in quieter markets but it can be very different for different people so again it's about what our software does it is personalized so your charge on my chart with the same strategy and the same returns may show completely different habits okay let's move along start now the call to action that call to action so there's a 14-day free trial all you have to do is spend five minutes connecting your data in from your broker and after that it's a 49 year subscription per month right is that an easy easy thing to do as far as connecting everything up and you do have to be a rocket scientist to get or do you know you don't um it is different for every broker so if you click on you can if you just go to the next slide they're all the brokers that are currently supported so for example would metatrader4 there's a five minute set up and then you get live data comes in every time you never have to look at it again can he do that on a demo account as well so yes you can oh right so that would be something I'd be interested myself all right excellent just just because i think it's the demo the demo account can be regarded as almost useless because you're not that you don't have a stress and strains but in a way if you get it right yeah on that and you can see what your patterns are maybe you can emulate that and just do the same with real money when it comes through and i'll be the web I'd be thinking yes and the other thing you can do on this platform is you can tag your demo trades and say their demo and then your live trades and then you can compare the two and you can see if the habits are changing because they do change for people sadly though if they certainly do but this this you've launched this quite recently existed exactly right so you're still at introducing this to the market and and seeing what's the reaction been so far so overwhelmingly positive we haven't had a trader leave yes but maybe that's early days it really opens people's eyes as to what's really going on with her trade history and for a lot of people who've been keeping spreadsheets you know the daily toil of trying to make sure it reconciles with your broker and keeping it up-to-date and that pain has gone away so for those people disciplined enough to do it they're delighted to have it automate it and for people who never got around to setting up the basic you know good habits of analyzing your data at the end of the day it's it's you know particularly the first time you get in there and see all those habits it's really weird if you're a beginner definitely worth a go just so that you can need about 100 trades I'll hold that mirror and see see you exactly whether you're it maybe even to decide whether you're suited to trading or not well absolutely and hunt from chasing returns thank you very much for flying in today we'll be back after the break you hi this is a man from zacks traders cafe with a look at some bulletin board hero stocks on Monday the 13th of June starting off at borders and southern weather we got this decent consolidation above the 50-day moving average at 1.9 two pens so that's the black line and just below the 200-day moving average at 2.22 pens our size already bounced three times off the neutral 50 level that's a leading indicator on potential upside and that should target towards 32 for the three to four pence area over the next month or so as in the case of that line drawn through three pence from the autumn this week at this stage only a weekly close back below the 50-day line would really add cast the upside argument into doubt at this stage on two met mincha one of friday's big movers and impressing the of this consolidation that we've had for the best part of two three months there was a decent spike in the shares all of that within a rising trend channel from as long ago as November really well there's no break back below the 50-day moving average point2 pens we're still looking for as high as point 35 pounds over the next few weeks stock which is new to the bulletin board heroes is modern wafer a broadening triangle here and bear trap recovery from below the former April support that was at the sixpence level really while we're above that looking as high as 10 pence which would be the December resistance line projection especially after that decent weekly closed above the 50-day moving average at 6.41 pence old favorite next roxi petroleum which stop being a favorite for a while but looking at better as far as this sir consolidation that we see at the moment at and above the 200-day moving average 8.88 pence while r above thats a good chance of a new leg up to retest the initial 2016 resistance above 10 pence the time frame on that as soon as the end of next month the best case that are a target of the stage as high as 15 pence which is the top of an october rising trend channel another stock which we haven't seen here for quite a while is serious petroleum after that bullcrap through the 200-day moving average and point five pence in march sherbert starting to regroup here for the bulls although probably dhone a CEO of mine ended a close above the 200-day moving average at 0.34 pens before going long again after these after a couple of false to torn breakouts or breakout attempts that we had for april and may target above the 200-day line as high as point six five which is the top of an october rising trend channel finishing off with tiziana life sciences a nice gap to the upside through the 50-day moving average one pound of 139 pence initial target here 171 pence over the next four to six weeks the big target over the next two or three months as high as 250 pounds which is the top of an october rising trend channel that's it for many more updates at the same time tomorrow you hi this is a mere paas acts cafe with a look at the major markets on Monday the 13th of June starting off with the foot 2 1 105 ad after that bull trap through 6400 the market should have tanked fully the following month but we had a little delay a double bull trap through the 50-day moving average at 6219 for may and june and now we're down below the 200-day moving average at 6148 while below the 200-day line we should head back towards 60 50 60 50 zone which is post march support with the risk of as low as 5828 which is the febri where the late for every support for the footsie 100 index break of RSI support as well that uptrend line from from may should also give us added downward momentum on this occasion can't rule out just another range bound to consolidation above 6,000 but this time after all these attempts to break hard to break through 6401 would be more confident if one was a bear obviously that there will be a bigger break down than before onto the dax and similar picture here after the final may attempt if by this market to rally double top really above the 200-day moving average at 10,000 35 after the bull trap in april as well through the 200-day line so that really does suggest that we're in a here going down for a larger decline than previously released form a initial target here 9500 and then after that filling the gap maybe down towards a 9000 zone over the next month or so if you're cautious on the bear argument you wait for that may 97 37 floor to be broken on an end of day close basis before pressing the sell button at the stage any back above the 200-day moving average would really delay or suggest that there was a flaw in the bear argument on to the US markets which really did give us a quite a strong indication of bullishness of June we even had a break of that seventeen thousand nine hundred resistance line from April but it does look as though that was a bull trap through eighteen thousand just through just about through the 18,000 and what if we get back below the 50-day moving average at 17,000 788 then one would be according atop of this market and at least a return towards the 17,500 zone for the SP it's Sea Wolf effectively a double top with the April support through April resistance rather then we headed up to 21 11 we just clear that this time with a 21-17 peak so it's a bull trap on that particular level probably back down to at least the 50-day moving average of twenty seventy six initially and then if we fall below that on an end-of-day closed basis then it's down to the 200-day moving average at 2014 onto the nasdaq and here we had never quite such a confident move here there was this sister other strange consolidation above 4500 getting effectively blocked by that the top of that april gap just around the 45 50 level situation now is that one would look for be looking for the this market to find support at the 200-day moving average of forty four oh seven which is the bottom of this February's uptrend line or up trend channel rather and then after that down to the main support for this market at 4300 over the following few sessions on to the currencies and the big news here really with the cable and the loss of that one 4350 level i call it at 140 350 level of the remain line below that's the risk of a brexit and that's the way the markets behaving potential target while we're below 140 350 as low as 1 35 which is the bottom of this falling trend channel from november onto the euro and for the single currency it's not quite so dramatic but still heading towards the floor of this triangle 112 $1 12 here over the next few sessions probably an early a quicker recovery of the 50-day moving average of one 1308 would really delay that prospect the main support here obviously the 200-day moving average one 1095 and again with the our side below 50 we would expect a drift towards that zone at obviously nothing here quite as dramatic as well as we have seen for cable onto dollar yen which is continuing to be quite a difficult situation for the Bulls back onto the floor of this falling wedge formation does suggest that in fact anything lower than 110 580 will be able gives this market quite a painful break to the downside and we would be looking for at least a move towards the 10 450 level 105 55 obviously the support from last month and lots of trading opportunities offered around that area but at the moment it does look as though we are going to overshoot that former may support perhaps by a yen or so finishing off with gold and gold benefiting really from the woes in equities and other areas as well right above the 50-day moving average at 1250 dollars and while we're above that the minimum on the upper side would look would appear to be thirteen hundred dollars which was the may peak and then on to 1350 so quite geometric as far as the price action is concerned there or the possible price action that's it for me more updates at the same time tomorrow you
