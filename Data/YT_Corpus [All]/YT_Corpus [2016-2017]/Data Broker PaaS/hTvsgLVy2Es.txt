 hello everyone my name is upon and I am working with click to cloud as a part of technical support team today we are here to demonstrate you the process for installation of open shift with dotnet capabilities using some simple installation scripts but before we move ahead let's get to know a little more about a company click to cloud provide solution having capability to run a windows application on openshift cloud let's move ahead with the demonstration and see the topologies that will be implemented here as you can see we are going to deploy Linux broker Linux node and windows node to run Windows applications on open ship environment using our simple installation scripts the IP and hostname displayed with Linux broker Linux node and windows node will be used in this demonstration here is the architecture diagram of open shift as you can see here the broker is going to communicate with Linux node and windows node using activemq services and sshd services a developer can connect to the broker REST API using our HC command-line tool and the end user can connect to the respective applications through load balancer now let's see this in action the first steps is Lennox broker deployment in order to deploy a Linux broker we first need to plan DNS configuration and system requirements in this demonstration the configuration used is displayed on your screen as you can see we are using App Store example.com for cloud domain where we are going to host our application openshift dot example.com will be used for openshift force broker dot openshift dot example.com will be used for broker fqdn for system requirements we are using the OS and other parameters as shown on the screen be using a red hat enterprise linux 6.6 with OSE subscription for OS the ram used is 10 gb with 150 gb hard disk and 4x core processor this configuration being used for demonstration is not the minimum requirement for hostname we are using broker door to open shift rod example.com now that we saw DNS configuration and system requirement let's discuss prerequisites for Linux broker the supported operating system is 64-bit version of red hat enterprise linux 6.4 or higher for this demonstration we are using red hat enterprise linux 6.6 base64 image on a 10gb droplet there are various methods for deploying openshift enterprise but for this demonstration we'll be using OAC v2 installation script make sure you are connected to the internet for deployment you will get the installation script with a Ropin chute dotnet solution kit you can also download the script using the given commands on the screen we need install dot SH an open shift rota set scripts now let's see the deployment in action we have logged into a linux broker server and we have already downloaded both the scripts let's run installed a set script once you run the script you'll see this main menu will come to these options one by one let's first go with installed broker press one to install broker next it will ask you for a reddit subscription account as you already specified that to install openshift enterprise we require reddit openshift enterprise account without which we cannot install openshift enterprise press yes to provide information entire red hat username your password your pool ID you will get this ID with a subscription account this is required to download the open ship packages from the Red Hat site once you enter the pool ID it will ask you for EM collective password you can either enter the password manually or it will generate random password for you and a yes from mongodb for openshift entire passwords here next it will ask for the domain name as we have already specified a domain name let's enter it apps dot-com it is a cloud domain where all the applications will get hosted your host domain your broker fqdn next it will ask you for broker IP address it will ask you for selecting the gear sighs we have three options for this demonstration we'll be selecting small next it will ask you to confirm all the information that you have provided press yes next it will start with openshift enterprise deployment it will take an R for this to finish after an r you can see that installation has completed you can see the services deployed over here and you can also see the generated password press ENTER to continue next to check whether the broker is successfully installed go for option three check broker after selecting that option you can see all the services all the deployed services and install packages you once it gets done you can see the past message that we mean that the broker has successfully deployed press ENTER to continue now go to open shift console and see if the site is working or not enter 6 to exit before logging into console reset the demo user password here is the command it will ask you to enter the new password after updating the password log into the console and check whether the site is working or not open the open shift console from a browser enter the open ship URL over here it would be your broker fqdn or broker IP address of your server provide your demo user name and password here you can see that openshift broker has successfully deployed and you can see the console but we can't create our first application yet as we do not have any cartridges available over here we will require a node where we will deploy the cartridges for windows-based cartridges we require windows node and for Linux based cartridges we require Linux node in the next part of openshift enterprise installation script series we'll see the deployment of windows node
