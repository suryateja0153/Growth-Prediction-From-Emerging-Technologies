 welcome to everybody all right so let's go and get started you know this is our first town hall meeting in the spirit of the election cycle I thought we should have a time how meeting unfortunately will solicit was busy he's not be able to moderate so we're going to settle for just be myself at night but one of the things about the tahoe that i like is that it's really free form right because you know you can stick recorder me I'll talk all night but really I love the interaction with the audience and questions and when I do this live it's a lot easier because I can read the body language and I know when I'm losing them so it's uh it's a question of you know if you feel that I'm getting off topic here please oh please let us know in the comments now what I'm going to do is I'm going to open with a brief opening statement that's going to be a Saudi political nature to keep please bear in mind that we're talking about accidents equal servers in the end I have a few things and I share with you guys there's a lot of great resources and then we'll go into the town how many well we'll be handing out the mic in the audience and unlike Trump we're not going to kick you out if you slap protesting all right I only ask that you let me speak and response to your protest that's all I ask all right so we're not doing any pledges either we're not going to raise our arms and salute and do any pledges for voting here either so um you know I like to talk about access in general and where access is going and how what I've seen in terms of my interactions with the microsoft one of the things that you may not be aware up and you probably don't because you're not a nexus MVP is we have a compatible pleat overhaul of the access team in Microsoft and I think that's a good thing I really do well it things to happen was one the team managers actually contacted IT impact which is the name of a company here in Chicago and she's requested to do I know any clients that she can visit in to see firsthand what the how to use access and the company imagine my my my jaw dropping when she call me right and she said she wanted to see what am I one of my clients and be able to interact with her so we set her up to actually was what Robert Robert who's on the phone here the consultant 15g ideas by senior exes comes up it was one of his clients and she went out there sat down with them and they explain how to use access and he said Tino access was the best thing since sliced bread but it so happens for this particular client we saved them hours and hours of work every month so it was really quite the experience for people to hear that from the client you know so that's very heartening and we do what they do have frequent meetings with us and and we have one coming up here soon so I'm hoping to see the vision but you know i emailed we have this private email group that goes out to every access and weep in the world and one of the things that I did was try to make a case for access and the future of access and the fact of the matter is apart this polling is my manager impact and those companies that can leverage access I said look you know you've got the opportunity to shape the future this product for the next 5 10 15 years we have a new team in place but we have now is thinking about the features you know be that the future of access web app sebacean client and one of the biggest things they was away with last November we had our MVP conference meeting ever me say this they're going to go back to the desktop client and prove it and that was so it was like lifting a 2,000 pound weight off my chest because you know I really it was upset by the fact that they had to start the client they said no it's mature enough we're not going to invest on there that's all stuff when I interested in so slow my blood would boil when I go to the axis with me p conference in prior years and i even blogged about the fact that I was not here I would there would be no applause in that room he was me we had the word guys on the left and the Excel guys on the right and you would hear he's applause these tears goes up every time they were introduced in feature to those MVPs there was also a thing happening with the access group so the fact of the matter is you have to capture the lightning I told him he has to make this is your moment right and before it's too late and when is it going to be too late well the fact is that there is no other desktop database that comes even close to access when it comes to market penetration this just isn't now you have a palace out there like alpha anywhere and there was another one on the Mac FileMaker Pro and you know that's it and so there may be several very inches on that so the fact is I think that's one of the issues the fact that there is no major competition I can assure you that if Google came out with a web based database system right there really has word compatible system we have an excel compatible system with Google came out with a database system that allows developers to create forms reports store deed I have a relational database be able to store that deed on the Google infrastructure in the cloud and have the power of that Google engine behind us that was truly be Bravo groundbreaking they haven't done that yet and I don't for one don't know they but the last year's April Fool's joke if you ever had a chance to go back to my blog to see it and Lucy might be able to post a link here Robert but being a see you guys in my last last April Fool's joke I did google buying access it was a tongue-in-cheek it was a tunneling cheek ever full of joy because obviously that would never happen so you know I am the future of access I think it's better now and so I compare that to the clock the atomic you know you have these scientists that came out with the nuclear war clock I think we're like what ten minutes away from midnight midnight nuclear war and doing the cute mr. Cuban Missile Crisis it was closer to midnight that we've ever happen and so I think you know that's the thing with access i think we you know we were able to get away from midnight with this new group and i'm hoping to hear great things from them serves where we're going with the product and how is going to go from here i'm a big believer in a desktop model and we submitted a whole host of soldiers suggestions to the excess team that's one of the events to be in accidentally p that's why i urge you guys to do that and so one of the things that when I hire you as a consult with the firm Africa so affirmed the first thing I tell you is we got to make you Nexus MVP and so I really have too much staff myself with Ben and you know we're working on Robert be an excellent VP in you know it just it just allows you to submit these kind of ideas interact with the access team get some free software has some wonderful experiences all right and the other aspect is this is that in other words touch suggestions right and so we went through some exercises some stuff was very archaic because you always gets out that those French people who just throw stuff out there you just got wonder what kind of feature they're looking at me talking abut I couldn't understand some of the features that we're talking about somewhere a lot we're very popular you know one of the things that I suggested is a connection object an access that would not require having odbc drivers for six or server have it bake them directly incident now if you ever want do you ever want to eat that than real life you can download the power bi desktop client and that power bi desktop client you can go to power bi calm include the connectivity you need to connect a sequel sir because i just installed it whoever actually one of Roberts clients as well he's working with then we create some from dashboard so there and so um you know you I thought I had to install the sequencer native clients and I didn't have to so what can't we have that kind of same experience with access right why can't we have that and so it's really disappointing when we don't have that and then that allows you here's what happens the typical access with sickle cell replication you may have 20 tails right dirty linked tables a hundred tales on the wii does solutions where we've had close two hundred and tables that's go on a table LD that but the access probation so this is simply a reciprocal order header order details form right where it's an order entry database and you load the order form you at the top of the forms the order had a table and if you get details to what was ordered against that order number right there there are all the different items in there well you open the form like there and access it's going to open multiple collections sequel server just at one form you multiply that times all the people on the network they are using the application now you're looking at dozens if not hundreds of connections to sequester or definite line network traffic unnecessarily vs race so one of the things that we do is we are we talk about easier adodb which you can find here tapping the power easy after a do w easy adodb and when the techniques that we use there is we use one single connection object in the back end code so you follow all our connections with secure server right so everything goes through that just one connector queries past not passed credit by queries and code a recordset commands right data we receive through to the server goes through one connection because we don't want to crease that bottleneck and that's one of the beauties of access web from nex river that was one of the ideal issues with adt projects and that was a lead fan on to the adp bandwagon band i wish i would jumped on board soon one of the advantages of adp was he had that it was fun everything from one connections looking man have you had four forms or ten forms open and three reports or for queries you would look at the server that would log into the sequel server management studio and serve as I receipt it was just what connection from each user so uh Redmond does have that code base right there a DP code bases they go back and tap in so they can rewrite it from the ground up I think power bi is the roadmap that they can use in order to do that so I need to double-check though it probably i installed the sequence ordinary client why it was and so i may have done that by just finished installing and now came by came over to this median I need to check on it but if it doesn't that's something I'm going to suggest to them to the access team is look at how power bi did it how connect some multiple sources without having to store additional hard additional drivers right so one of the things that I also see in terms of access is you know we we continue to be amazed at the flexibility of the Father and so it seems like lately we have clients that want to expand the investment they made an access to the web and so that happens with the incorporates equal serving solution so that's one of the things that one reason I go sell something to a new class customer right I usually say okay I usually ask them my family uses you got this is five users ten years just went to users ATM both 3325 I'm already thinking six or Express and the way I sell them on that is two things first of three things actually number one is the stability right where you when you can add and users and i canna cross the deal is just not sequel server is never going to corrupt on you whereas a pure access solution many of you may experience over the years Chinese character is missing data you know blow their files all the guarantee they go way out the door when you have sequel server express second aspect is that is the ability to extend that data to the web once it's a sequel server then you can create a website that can tap into that database and webster in place and be able to extend that to the website you for example if you have again a client a lower order entry system science can login via the web and leave those orders on the client's website as well and then the employees in house are interacting with access whereas the people outside the enterprise are using the access portal I mean the excitedly and exporter the web portal right so that's a patent application we would design let's condition a single service then the last thing is security because I still to this day I still walk in that places where I still see some say if there is such as HIPAA and credit cards Social Security numbers being stored in excess now I realize that I'm three trading current topics we talked to you in the past but I think it's important you've got the tool set in place if you're in that consult and be able to go out and sell your services your client can be able to say you know what these are the reasons why you should do that and so I want you know if you talk about resources one of the biggest resource I want you to keep in mind the start he reckons experts com / start here and this I you know at this day I still come to this page like if I need to clamp the levant drivers I kind of start here and download the client 11 drivers here because ex-microsoft make it so difficult to find these drivers on their website it's not like there's a page for the drivers you have to go to the installation sequel server page and then from there take the secretory install and then it gives you a few I was just too way confusing just way confusing right and so we do that nowadays they have a odbc driver for sequel server yeah be careful that's not the one you want because they one does not support adodb now they're saying they adodb is going away for now who knows when that's going to happen for now we're going to continue using adodb and at least a bit concerned about not using it because we are huge investment in the best you only have to trust transition over to the DAO and using pestle queries in order to accomplish the things I things will be accomplished with adodb is so darn so much more done convenience so we may have to reformulate the easier adodb too easy dao so that we can have the technology platform place as compatible with microsoft vision the other aspect of this is the easy OD tebe which already saw us amazing so hey this week one of the biggest things is sequel server for linux look at this i'm going to go ahead and put paste this into your chest so if you want to go into chat and follow along with this you have this link all right the first one to access xmas car so i start here let me give you that one too I'm distance chat so just open the chat in WebEx but one of the things is big announcement to see this this week it's all over the web you may have heard about it sequel server for linux and you know if you look at this stuff they don't talk about sickle supra lyrics until you get pull all the way past all this stuff for 2016 all the features 2016 and then it starts talking about linux and this is this is a typical microsoft vaporware because there's still nothing there this is all press announcement saying Blue's gonna we're going to work on sickle serve with linux guys and it should come out I don't know maybe next year mid-2017 will get around to it and so the fact of the matter is they got nothing the ad is a centerpiece out this press release they have nothing we get a test there's nothing for us to look at and you know we don't know how much is going to cost I mean think about linux people are so used to paying what nothing right mysql is free and apache server is free all maintained by the community and so i would think that they would officer for length free a variation of that which is sequel server express which is also free but windows i right and so lots of buzz about this announcement I for one think it's vaporware and I'll believe it when I see it kind of a thing approach on taking the fact that matter is it will be great where you can have successor for links because a lot of times what we do here at the impact is we have PHP developers and staff and it's a less solution right is using apache but we don't install sequel server drivers in our patties virtual machine to be able to connect back to a single server database and there's some really great stuff that we do in PHP that we can't do it that nap it's easy to develop with instance on certain issues and so we do sometimes do both things so we get PHP developers and stuff that doesn't focus on staff axwell persons some of these active developers are PHP developers so it just went makes it really good to be able to grab somebody from our staff be able to the side not just the exercise with the websites so this is encouraging we'll see where it goes then nothing i want to encourage you to do is to sign up for brento stars blocks scores are calm / blog or you can go to Brent overcame click on the blog league here and then I'm going here so i get these via email i signed up i subscribed subscribe link in brent is a microsoft legal server Master Certified Master and there's only a few in the world and unfortunately they stop popping that certification but it's very competitive you can read this story and now you become a psycho server black belt level 10 10 and see how you got to it they no longer offer that they may have something similar I don't intend to be a sequel sermons he and I always tell people not a sequel server expert i'm just an expert in the interaction of access with sequel server but birds got some really good stuff i blog and this is how I keep up with single server to lean ishy ators when you sign up you get emailed from him in terms of interesting articles around the web and just a great resource for media stay up to date what's happening out there there are other sequel server logs so if you know of any other one that you're following please let me know in the comments or speak up now in terms of that but I what happened like Brian actually met him last week in SE co sorry here in Chicago so that's me here sickle serve in Chicago have a nice little table there with the IT impacted and I had to put the wall painted red so it matches my banner and my desk alright and so it was a wonderful opportunity have 400 attendees here in chicago and i purchased the table wasn't that g but i think it was worthwhile and i actually gave away a little drone here as you can see my raffle prize a little drone here enjoy drone i got these at the car place we are high net programmer so if you know of a great human done the programmer we can do it and this was my topic I was I asked me to speak last minute at on the topic of how to construct our consulting practice from home and that's the topic that's also the interior my heart because you know a lot of promises I thought a lot of times you have consultants are there people who are active developers want to strike it on their own right there currently working for somebody or the work on contract work and you want to be able to start the business and you just can't you don't have the skill set how do I go about finding people how I go about the marketing plan I'm the total what's it gonna cost me to be a consultant and so I answer all those questions and one of the things that I do is we have this discover the power of your data phrasing that trademark that just love and actually you own let's go over the power of your data comm and we just hired a part time marketing person in the organization we want to be able to promote that website that the it's neutral right technology agnostic it's not there's nothing about access on that what they might be right now but we're going to probably find to it doesn't include in which technology and NASA is not talking about the concerns I have access but rather it's for the general public that we can reach out and expand our brand other revenue streams Carl an area and so as you encourage you to check out the co Saturday that come to have them all over the world into Italy here in the US Yosemite that calm and be able to look for upcoming events as well as search right so if i put in early because I know giorgos if i come here on the phone with us with familiarly there isn't a penis okay but I'm able to see Europe and see if that shows up well in our global regions right time then to see what happens so easier if I go your middle east it'll be clear this up so Europe Middle East Africa so that's a great here a great excuse to go to Vassar is one in Vienna coming out Belgian a desert you know nice thing about Europe is all very close right you would think that no Vienna is actually very close to at least just a train ride away so do this and be able to participate and then there is what the plan B is way ahead of time so one of the things that would encourage you if your nexus consultant is to speak as these events right so say for example you're interested in one of these like Paris would go there and here you would go to the speaker's page and they still have speakers that they're still looking for speakers will say you can apply right cough for vehicles is probably March 18 so here you have to complete a speaker profile then once you complete that then you can submit your session and it doesn't have to be technical my case I Sandra sessions on how to how to be a the consultants right but a lot of times people have this hunger for x is equal sir because nobody else talks about that b is equal sara lee's nobody else rice tonight so usually it's just me talking about access and I out to my fax with sequel server now do this so I would encourage you to speak at these events and does help you and becoming Nexus MVP no it really is a good event usually what happens they have multiple tracks so for example if we go to the event home here and I go to actually let me just go back to the website six-sided I can't pull up the Chicago event w recently hand she was talking about here Paris oh Paris we've always have Paris alright let's see in the u.s. past events there you go Chicago so here in Chicago if you look at these here sessions scheduled they had a lot of trash in Chicago PolyOne the biggest ecocide they have four hundred people here in attendance you've got breakfast and then they got lunch and all the pay was ten dollars to register because a lot of the sponsors pay for this stuff so they have one two three four five six seven eight tracks Fanning the whole day is to go saturday or wider range of trapped topics all right supercharged transaction logs western sequel server 2016 this was an amazing chat that I was able to catch sometimes they have the PowerPoint you can download like this guy's got the pharmacy right infrastructure for the DBA well one of the things that is because I was a speaker on here i am down here either way at the bottom I was in room 215 and that was me wish you could live there glories consulting life my things we do is with his speech is to invite you to do in the Friday before a lot of people fly in the travel and rightly so they like to as a great gesture of gratitude hey let's come out to the side of speaker dinner so that was invited to be as part of speak for dinner and one other thing that I was able to do to let me see if I can find him here it's a Tomas return it's almost grocer design secure server hrs eight he our infrastructure to meet the SLA right so I almost done with his presentation because I didn't that helps us to see his presentation but what the hell things that Thomas does is he's he is an amazing guy in terms of what he can do for you in terms of architecting sequel solutions and so one of the things was he got hired to design solution for a European customer that wanted to be able to track the stock transactions but just not any specialized actions do you wanted to pet to spec track any stock in the globe and see all transaction is back and he wanted to see all those transactions talk in the pricing of a second at the table on Friday he was going on and on about Holly architected this he says well basically you would need sixty four terabytes of memory in memory on the people server and you would have to have a 24 virtual machines right because everything is going virtualize now you guys with multiple clusters right so imagine this monster this the big iron that you would have to involve to have 24 virtual sequel server in the Windows servers and then within each one the serviette sequel server and then have 60 4 terabytes of memory so you can store and be able to call up the entire financial transactions history of a spock at any given moment in history of man within a fraction of a second and so just the pcs alone that are we going to be connecting to the solution have to have ten network cards ten network gigabit cards the pc check on the bees like the pc on your desktop we have to have ten network cards also being to the network you can play cards just so you can get all that data bundles from a psycho circus I see the Buddha if you're looking at a terabyte of data and fraction of a second you can't just go have one network card you need to be able to distribute the load across ten marked cards on the pc and be able to receive all that data from sequel server so that you can do the analysis and so you know i started giving a hard time and say well wow that's great and he tells me first of all I tells me he doesn't see this thing whoever get built Femi it was just ridiculous he / engineers based on the requirements they gave him and so he thought they would ever get billed but one of the things that one of the themes says I asked him but joking says at what point do you think the machine would become sentient you know do you think you'll be 2017 2018 before so i can be ready with my survivor supplies and be able to have enough water hand and all that but he told me they flash humming it's just not going to be it's just not gonna be so this is an interesting guy this guy I mean this guy he sees like the I site you know I stand with the hair now it's just like with the accent the German accent you just you just can't still believe so what here is he talking about papers he likes to write a lot papers you know and this is his firm entity data and then topic at what I didn't talk to him about but you know he's another guy he stick a quarter him a talk all night and so he was quickly come to my table and start discussions on what he does and one of the things that you gave was he worked at a Japanese project where he received some specifications from the customer and the specifications were wrong anything everybody working on the project knew they were wrong they were impossible to meet but because he couldn't go back to the original requester to ask him to change specifications as he would lose faith in the rest of the company he just had to design it the way he asked for it think about that here you have a project that's involving Thomas was quite expensive is already where I'm sure is in the 250,000 our spending weeks designing and then fighting with IT now to talk about in a minute to get things done all because and not being able to change the project parameters if we do the wrong because some guy is worried about losing face and coming suicide because if he does I mean think about that for a minute you know then you wonder why did japan is in the recession but the fact of the matter is that he he designed solutions where you can have an amazing response back from the servants now a lot of you may have heard that sometimes when they implement these high-end sequel server solutions they use fans which is a storage area network and basically think of fan that has a bunch of hard drives like the one we saw in the paper slide here not this is also analogy so here's a check that as they see where the hell i saw that here this right so you have well that's a chart but there's something similar you have little slots and every hearts lights on hard drive so you may have you know 100,000 terabytes in the sand and then you have sequel server reaching out through the network going through the bus of the pc in the server then going through the switch and then going through the through the fan bus and then we cheer data to bring it back to Seco servants so what a lot of times what he does is so the customer you just friends he has taken accessories s-pen 1.2 million dollars on a fan and he told them that they just really just this can't use it install the CI dioses what do you mean I can do I just want points too many other thing says if you want results that are fast enough it's basically impossible to move that data from the Santa sequel server to the website in order to be able to show us the device fast enough for your requirements of GS in this project and a lot of times and you know a couple years back that's what had us started pad up is in memory storage of data a lot of people want to see that data faster and faster these days you know when you're going to and year when you're high frequency traders or there's a lot of topical applications where you need that data in memory you don't need that a hard drive you don't want to consider the weight requested data from a local hard drive right then read it from the local bus on a PC and then put it in memory and then finally serve it up to this web server would then turn will have to put it on the page for you to see and so he tells me a lot of times he has to fight with the IT department this of course can take weeks or months because they're resistant than you know and he actually pins to them said the speed of your sand could be the best in the world but because of the physical prop physical properties electrons going through your infrastructure coming back we just can't use your hand you're better off using this solid state drive on the sequel server itself and that would be faster run circles around right so how much faster will fan maybe a gigabyte per second whereas a locally stored these are just example members he told me action always I forgot but just to give an example of a fan might be a gigabyte per second but as a local Sandra's solid-state drive on that circle server with be fractions of a second and that's the major difference we talking about life or death situations with these high speed high availability solutions that you need them and so I start talking about ebay and Facebook and Amazon these are these are properties that we use every day right I use them every day as well those architecture happens this is you'd be surprised one a lot of that stuff is not as quick as needham you don't need to be quick right think about it you really care if you have a posting from your arm on Facebook diminish you press the Enter key that's okay if that policy shows up 30 seconds later or one minute later right so when you're looking at your Facebook feed that data doesn't have to be immediate so if it takes the infrastructure facebook to commit that transaction back to their database in the cloud a minute two minutes nobody cares nobody cares how long it takes out may show up on your feet immediately but it's like my show up anybody else's until 30 seconds later a minute later right and so the same thing with google google has these web crawlers across your web collecting data and that's how they can stress the results because they have a database number again well the web crawlers are posting transactions back to the database at the same time you have users using the browser search for database for the website and the correlation there is the same way they don't care if the transaction web part of the crawler is back marked by a few million records so what you don't you take you too little it's going to be there will be a minute before you you just see that with that story that was posted about Carl Icahn kardashian on the gawker website big deals right so you can't we do the stretcher Kim Kardashian oh those turkeys were included because guess what the website was crawl 30 seconds ago and still has me committed to a database nobody cares and same thing with Amazon dije change the prices on the product they'd add products remove parks it's not mission-critical to see that immediately it's mr. critical that you did you get the order in right when i press the button system in my order that they get a debt submission could hook about the aspect of listing products and changing prices it's okay if it takes a fraction of a second they're not going to build infrastructure people handle that data strings and so one of the things that we developed the itm pack this is the last thing and we're going to talk before we start to the questions is token boys calm this is a product that that we launched me boo stress it with bootstrap means we solve we saw financial and this is a firmer of data that goes comes and goes I'll give you an example of mo login here to the to the class and i'm going to create click create new board this is usually a sequel server in the back end numbers pick a template and well i'm going to take pic is for the doc schedule right so i have multiple docs in my in my company and they have different trucks waiting to bit unload and though right so I'm just going to look at here i'm going to say sequel axis with sequel demo great one of the things I thing about this is the fit for example somebody cuz there's this system right that's available so if I want I can go ahead and move this that can call the truck driver so you know this slow going go to doctor don't worry about back one just were there so I just moved in I could have done this in Excel but the problem the Excel is I have to make the space for the cell and then it right over time so here I mean to change medium and so on it's done but more importantly once this once this part car this truck gets unloaded it's gone right so here I'm going to right click and will delete that transaction is gone in that transaction is no longer stored in a dive is why because nobody cares that a march eight at seven-fifteen p.m. we unloaded a truck on Doc number seven nobody cares when we care about this in the inventory transaction system we have that talk and at the inventory nut and our database right that we do care but this is for data that's not that's transient it's here today gone tomorrow and so it's only aspects that is harder to explain to my team I did on the team about that so this is a really nice product I mean when you can move tokens around i can i can move columns around I can't read columns around and absolutely and which is so on the developments during the beta but eventually one charge ten bucks for it ten bucks amazon subscription-based model right so if you guys can if you guys are fair to me can open the account for free and test it provides feedback I know I get out here grabbing the 11 so I can move this here and I can move this column around I got grabbed the greater the squares and this is something that you know the only why because eventually you can represent a revenue stream that's outside the y-axis with single server consulting business right right now we are so good at what we do Robert can take a project finish in a matter of weeks I kind of have this next project lined up right it's not going to take them sometimes it does taken months and is actually working across this but for the last three months but cycling taemin six months or 12 months that's the nature of access we quickly work on things and so it's important for me is the filter work to be able to keep the channel open with the opportunities my leaf on a full of the opportunities that we can when he finishes one you can quickly go on to the next one but we sell this right if you think about if we saw this the ten bucks apart 200 people that's 10 times 100 that's a thousand dollars revenue community must if I get a thousand people that give us 10 bucks I still out awesome nice thing about that if one of the least it's only ten dollars a month right so if I don't just takes off now I'm down to 9,000 Anna nobody cares we still gain the bulk of money revenue subscription every month that's the beauty of this right and so if i can get thousand people give me ten bucks a month then really can't $10,000 and we can get 10,000 people give you ten bucks a month now we're looking at a hundred thousand dollars that's not chump change and I gotta think that there's 10,000 people in this world who could use this product be able to use it right so now we use internally where each programmer at the Heather so Robert is here I'm here we have project and the project management teams whose project around so because it's so easy right so Robert I can't reach this cross grandsire maybe we'll assign to another programmer I mean they'll do usually this is an embolus the other thing is I can come in here and i use it for product lines production lines so I come in here and I do you're here production lines so these are like one line to have a factory right in China and I'm here in Chicago I'm the only effect in general it's important to me as the owner yeah I know that they're what they're producing on each line what they're producing what they're working on what day it is so this is again a tool that allows the folder here in the US to react to and work with the people in China so here for example if I want to be able move this up here for this production line so this is the next part to be used then I can quickly do that and that's reflected already Gina immediately now usually people who do this with Excel spreadsheets why because I used to be a production manager most of my career I've in the production manager pharmaceuticals and food and so forth and they'll use Excel spreadsheets what the prom with Excel spreadsheet is your emailing back and forth they become stale we don't know which the latest version it's hard for people to work and so then when Google came out with their version online version a lot of people switched over to google but gettin still that is easy to move things around that it is like it is here Priscilla's a person that we just hired to do the marketing stuff so it please log in these creative board let me know about your experience creating the board go to the side process send me a link Jaso to ITN pipe com let me know what you think about the product and so forth alright so I just drank some water nombre answer your questions who's got a question for me shoot comment question observation did you show a ninja code behind disk this is all done with PHP f tickles over the back end and I wouldn't know exactly where the code is I just have people do it for me okay the PSP broker programming demon very nice Thanks I mean if this comes out of the I used to be a production manager at premise pharmaceutical company in chicago and i have the production schedule on my office on the magnetic board so each one of these were small magnets with pieces of paper and i would write skincare to amounts and never had line button at the top and so forth so some outline magnetic board so anything you can do with my men report you can do with this now and share this poor with other people so forth thank you thank you very much them this how much time would you say is put into this project do you believe else only three months to do this I mean it was amazing how fast he was able to get this done it was just one for grammar using PHP we create this application for me and then we've been fine clean ever since like the next version you'll be able to just as the column west and the row height and but you know I'm not comfortable charging ten dollars a month and so I had what people testing that's right to be able develop this and have a group of 50 100 people during the beta test Fenian you know uncomfortable charging in 10 oz Muffet we haven't put it through his paces yet I became nine ninety nine dollar ninety-nine cents that's what we want at a lot 10 yes ten bucks 999 well we're vegetable link it with paypal or some other payment system and then we'll have your credit card fine we'll just do the continued every month so more importantly if you look at the if you look at the website itself let's let me see if I can take you back to the website we have some really nice possibilities and one of them is the ability has like an airport monitor here you have these monitors here with the token board and so we have a we have a setting and the token board that's billboard mode so once you see your bill blow mold it'll auto refresh every 30 seconds you don't have to login as long as you have the URL so you can have that billboard more running on the pc right these are all driven by pcs in the back end and then you can have a shipping box schedule so one company once called company calls up says hey we have a lot song and we want to police know what the doc schedule what's happening is the truck here not here so it's my problem we'll just gorgeous use this in billboard mode we never end up doing anything with a half of me but now a billboard when it came out of that so if I come in here I go to settings let me see save a skill bournemouth hear this activate ill vamos and i click on there i can send the email from appointing I can grab this good and that anybody's in has that link in watching a pc now I have to log in to see the bill to see the bulletin board in the the token board in as a read-only right so everybody 24 is there when I having to log in or expired a session or anything like that I mean there's a lot there's a lot thought they went into this so ask me how many people have open accounts with talking boards how many people voted against 715 like before this less than 25 people yeah I never even know what this anything was like this you know yes that's why five people so that's my challenge right how do I get out the word right so we tried Facebook and Twitter even you guys who follow me you have you didn't actually shared in my block when it came out I need to do but we need to do a better job better a better job now when I went into google adwords because you know a lot of times you know we get our most of our lead for google adwords and I advertise a simple production scheduling I was getting hit and it was getting people to use the pocket sign up and so forth but it was costing me thirty-five dollars per person so i had to stop doing that we projected to cost versus you know and you know i don't mind paying 35 at the hang around but there's no these two have a charge anything and how do you think like that our tank i have two destructive urges go ahead how did you pick those words simple production scheduling did you do the keyword search on adwords yeah this is this maple producers well no this is what i would think somebody who might use my product with type in well there's a part on adwords where you can go in and put in sample keyword phrases like that or just single keywords and it'll show you the distribution of how many times they've been searched on and so forth so what i do when i'm doing any kind of AdWords for a customer or whatever is i do those searches and see what keywords in their industry are going to bring up the most hits oh do you know the tool was the called it's part of AdWords you just go in and look up keyword search look good login real quick but if you tailor your keywords properly you can minimize your costs and you know get the hit you once i order cute token board so if you said you had togar boards I'd said what the heck is a total good right yes so this is my AdWords account we spend a lot of money of different campaigns here so now if I go to visit tools yeah I believes that keyword planning your planner ok we just lost Italy they need to put their sequel server on us fanta SSD oh yeah go ahead do that you can put in to say put in a token board I'd be interested and then you know you have targeting right now you have you got to change your targeting a bit I think the dog needs to get walked just kind of like I have a problem very unhappy yeah so maybe the key words none right so didn't get get a PS and you'll see the search volume trends there and then you can further tailor that to what you want to have happen so you can see by month where the most searches are and stuff like that and you can also if you look over at the bottom air suggested bids they'll show you which ones cost more and so on soaking water live in Milan opera around with a bunch of different keywords and keyword combinations to demographics and find you know get an idea what might work the best mm-hmm so we put in a phrase here possession scheduling scheduling tool that's a blow it up yeah went up to 25,000 playing software look at this coyote but it's with more dollars that would be the actual key words you use those planning software yeah for production planning software or you know it shows you the choice is there look at these look at these key word veggie shut up yeah that's why paying so much competition high competition meet high oh boy and so you can I hate the money you write head one is right cuz we might say that that's not going to work because it's too close for it exactly that's why I mean I'm going to pay when it comes to access because I get the typical sales point the average between five and twenty five thousand dollars so I'm going to pay 21 dollars per click to get a five-thousand-dollar jobs but I'm not going to pay 6.1 dollars to get ten dollar customer every month right well and you gotta look at your conversion rate too so you know if you're paying 21 dollars per click and it's taking you 10 customers you're paying 210 dollars per customer which again with that kind of let us show you to my hammock really bad idea in boards you see if I can bring it up here you can see it just so be up here active I mean I was getting a good decent return on that sometimes you could take things too and if you further you refine them they get a lot less costly yeah so for example you send production planning software you might say doc planning software or something like that correct planning we're just planning software that's more general but I'm saying a lot of times you get more specific the prices go down because not as many people are using those keywords yeah so you might hate a combination of four or five more specific ones pay a lot less per click and get a bit it just has got a result I think this is different do the first get right there was my memory board online magnetic board and i would get 32 clicks on magnetic board and they 10,000 president point three one percent at these 32 plus cost me $14 right that's not too bad if you're converting you know ID is how many does your converting yeah so 49 and the average person so here I got 49 clicks magnetic board so a couple of things that were going to one thing he says i'ma do so much join 1871 which is a startup incubator here in Chicago and it's very inexpensive it's like 300 bucks a month and we know the last time i was there that i was there for week before i talk and i actually heard this guy talking amazing talk he just got Howard Tony the seal unbelievable insights but as I'm walking through the joint they have posted those on boards right so they have spoken voice he just don't know it's talking boards yet do you have all these post-it notes say let's give myself but let's hope that there's no when it comes along and just lacks all these notes on this board so to lose their positions on the board so these guys these people all these startups have these posting most all the place they're my idea of client and so what are things I'm going to is join and be able to leverage that and you know hang out with these kids and see if i can i can get them to use token board so that we can get that pin market penetration and we're looking for and then we're also doing this pub press releases and that's what the marketing person i hired is going to come in everything but Edwards because that was just too prohibitive now one other thing if you bring back up your sample token board sure see if i can say that up just like i like to build on those by list I could see potential applications for that now one question I have is how do you create this talkative sorry God Todd Bennett Oh Todd thanks for joining is this your first time yes great what do you do we provide technology services but I'm a longtime programmer so the access done a lot of work in access yeah oh great well thanks for joining us the can how do you recreate like one of those blocks you have to create it from scratch or what you do is you double click on the lock and then you type and you can give her different colors for the background color and then we're going to accept now you got the black and can you copy one of those existing ones yeah you can copy and then right click and face okay I got your man Keith keep hitting me ma'am I'm trying to think of how i would use this well you know that's the thing that if you do figure out and nothing the way to wait there love to have you permission to use as a template because I figured we had lots of templates that we had one for tennis but then the website is geared to production scheduling so one of the things we need to do is probably redo it and be more generic where you could have dates for example I could see this being used even for like like you're planning a seminar okay which presenter is in which area I mean you correct as of stuff correct and then you can easy juggle the topic sandy and the presenter is in the rooms and so forth and well not one operation of this that we haven't explored yet I've always wanted to do is you token itself represents another token board so we can you can actually type in animated data here gotcha so now you have a 3d you have a 3d modeling system right where but this you have unlimited space i could type as much as I want it will take it right like a metal field exactly it's a memo field so but the only displaced so much of it right right so you know the other aspect of this that this my branch into another token board and I still don't see how that was might relate to concisely with the use of talking where people will say so Todd sees each are you are we linkedin already a you and I linked on linkedin no I don't think you are oh please Jack to me the one of the things what might consider doing is making this an upper level management it was something where they can see all the deliveries and all the you know what I mean yeah dashboard as you will yeah like an overview for you know so that they can go you know look at this but because you know management can just see everything that happened correct so that's that's the link to an inventory system right yes and that's nice thing is that we can we actually quoted the client that client that wants us to put the Billboard motor in there in their lunch one recorded their twenty two thousand dollars integrate with their existing RFP solution because they were you were having pong so people did they have they have a lot of docs yeah they're 22 docs and the trucks will be lost in the shuffle and if the thing is okay here the thing is they created they created Pepsi canticle full of cans and when you sell cancer Pepsi they don't want to store the cans and the prisoners one store in their bottling plant do you wanna just in time delivery so what would happen is that they would miss the delivery in Pepsi with dinging four hundred thousand dollars because their production line was down waiting for these cans and so you know if sometimes it baffles me you have a hundred-thousand-dollar problem and you can't spend twenty two thousand for me to solve it for you what really that's a whole other discussion yeah yeah really you know business tomorrow is complain they don't know this may be greater than 0 science and they don't know they don't operate their business correctly another thing is you might be able to like take all of line for move it to line five all right yeah multiple tokens that's coming an expert get slick but the way look it's easy for me to talk I'm not doing it yeah yeah probably you're probably better off just moving life or here okay and then just moving down over here now time five and a movie not bad but you know the movie the column itself over here yeah yeah no but if you can do what you just did and then you should be able to do in programming too yeah yeah so just I just may move everything in line forward to light fire but that's a good point yes dancing is the other thing is you can export the excel so I can export to excel and I can further do it and there I can print I mean and this was all to vote it didn't take me a hundred thousand to do this guy's no I am just sorry you imagine you imagine all these intrapreneurs in Silicon Valley will give millions of dollars and they the other day did this falter like I had a million bucks all my guys the other possibility is here you're telling it's too cheap sometimes people don't want to buy something that's too cheap well mean we're talking about this SaaS model right i mean this is not they lead generation tracking their companies I mean I had a client and he merged with another client and did not understand the concept of intellectual property so part of the reason this they took my software to but it was okay i got a second client and the reason they didn't want to use my software they spent i don't know a couple hundred thousand dollars building something that wasn't as good in fact in the meantime they have you used my software because they couldn't get all the reports but they do simply said that they didn't want to use my software because it was too cheap hey be interesting yeah they're a lot more you know people who idiot these are the same guys who dismiss access out of hand is mickey mouse well yeah absolutely and but they're deadlocked on spending 1.2 million dollars on erp system that comes in over a budget and delayed by a year and it ends up only helping them eighty percent of the time look it's a whole other discussion Citibank and I they asked me to do a project plan to convert a project and what and I in it which is a waste and I spend they came as they looked at the end the numbers 2.1 million i can do it for free how can you do it for free you know two-point million you know you just you know your project plan is stupid I said I'm here as a consultant what we'll do they wanted to convert your power bill do whatever will start converting all the reports over as people ask for them I you know it won't take you that long and then at the end will convert the input screens no no that's never going to work they spent six million dollars on a product that didn't work no it's all right common pretty common yeah I sometimes in my citibank stories with that's why they have a little red umbrella over their head now alright well look this has been great guys I hope you enjoyed it you guys maggiore trusted yes right joy tonight's topic we do at least once a year how much played every day absolutely so I have a gift card and for $25 amazon and the winner of this is going to be todd todd very much thank you very much for your comments yeah could you send me your email so we can a gift you the card the card tomorrow alright Linda always a pleasure Linda got a gift with me last week when i took out to dinner your bad Philippa I I'm happy the Taj getting the card how many how many pro access programs does it take to find a dinner place um quite a super fun wasn't really but then I'm not going to say what happens because I'd be a barrel oh it's okay I i got my house yesterday trying to find my parking lot which was of course the street i started i went to a store and you are guys I could do that right I know I know still love you anywhere in the dark experience all right this is really great great and you know conceivably and I I may want to say some my clients this I mean I wouldn't do it you know tell them to have you do it but it's it's really fabulous no absolutely sign up as many people as you can't help me out here I'm dying on the vine car yeah great way to pay me back for all the hours you put in taxes you sure got a little later showed ya why I actually might know a couple already tuned one possible application I don't know if you could tackle this industry but it seemed to me like maybe restaurants you know how they always show sure the orders you know they could see Miss maybe V if something like this have them out in the dining room you know correct correct and so why 18 says that when you do the drive through McDonalds that's what they look at soaking board let's see acaba what's so great not beauty out beautiful yeah yeah this could be scared if something very much like this for a beautiful yep Skippy chairs where you have been chairs and you guys get seriously exactly and there you know some time somebody calls in sick you want to reschedule the you know people mm-hmm oh you may want to do some non persistence right no it's not persistent yeah exactly it's a four-door to delete the token the data is deleted yeah so uh kinda need to know it for the day you know like who's coming in and out were they do yeah some of years in late you know you could switch things around and exactly yes okay your kids a poor man scheduling tool basically yeah could you change the color of an existing token yeah you can go in here and you can maybe use the color coding system say okay Mary Jane is scheduled for nine o'clock and then which comes in turn it to orange and now that means she's on site or whatever sure yeah I can see a lot of applications for this yes very simple but powerful oh thank you thank you very much that means a lot to me guys yeah Oh excellent very very nice alright will also appreciate the work with feedback and we'll see you back here next month day and and sold you out and thank you very much
