 MSX doesn't tend to provide software on its own we know when you provide software with the people providing the service when the unusual things MSX does is to actually maintain an in-house development team and that's very positive not only because it means we're quicker to act but because it means you've got a technical team who have quite close links to the actual operational team who are going out into the field so that when we have a particular challenge that's got to be met we can negotiate or design actually with the operational people together so that our solutions are distilling the knowledge we have down into it into a process control because it's my experience that however complex you think a task is there's only so much that can't actually be automated so what we really want is we want our people making proper business decisions and having the heavyweight data processing reporting Excel filling in that kind of thing put that somewhere else make that automated get our people out into the field get the knowledge from our people and get the value from our people and then just have transparent reporting so that when you're hiring MSX you can see exactly what it is that you're getting I know a lot of our customers like to look and they like to go okay so i've got an engagement across the whole of europe but actually what are we doing in greece what are we doing in poland and and they can do that they can drill down they can actually see the activities that are being carried on in the different markets and then of course we have to understand that not all markets the same so you might have Frances decided to ask some custom questions on a particular survey or the German market there's legal restrictions in place so we can't behave in a certain way so what we tend to do is we work with the development team with the operations teams to make sure that our software actually builds that kind of knowledge into it so that when we have a new engagement for a new customer it's pretty quick to get it up and running because you've already got that experience and we know how to do it that's really what big data is about it's about there's three these people talk about volume variety and velocity so if data is coming in really quickly there's a huge amount of it or it's some of its files and some of its pictures and some of its video and some of its text those are the challenges that big data really presents to us so the online tracking of vehicles you're getting a load more data points you've got data coming in a lot quicker and traditional methods of dealing with data relational databases that kind of thing no longer really cope when the scale gets very very big if you've got a call center and you've got 50 million people you could call who do you actually call if you can only make 5,000 calls so as the numbers increase it gets harder and harder to work out the analytics that you need to actually reduce costs and get the maximum benefit so we just have to be really aware that security and data are you know they're a baseline to everything we do what we do is we in in the UK we have a dedicated server room with freon gas and with locks and all the rest of the kind of thing we also have a lot of security protocol so people can't get to the data it's encrypted so some customers we will put into our own in-house virtualization and then other data which is less sensitive or customers understand the security model that's on the web we might look to be putting into cloud computing so using those technologies and addressing our customers needs in order to provide better insights faster processing better reporting anything that really helps
