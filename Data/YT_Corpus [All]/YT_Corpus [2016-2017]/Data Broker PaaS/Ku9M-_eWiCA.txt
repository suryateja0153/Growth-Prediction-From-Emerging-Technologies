  ANNOUNCER: Collaboration is critical to productivity and productivity is critical to success and growth. But when it comes to the technology behind collaboration, it's easy to get thrown off. Valuable time can be wasted dealing with servers in need, instead of the business at hand. Downtime is a daily risk with mounting security threats, unpredictable natural disasters and a lack of resources to manage them all. And to further complicate matters, you have employees with different needs, on different devices, working from different locations. We get IT.
