here from the VA today and I am really excited today a little bit nervous to be recording my first VA today episode and so I am not with Allison Mathews from VirtuAli she's based in Moira Northern Ireland and she has worked as a VA for the last couple of years after working in various industries and automa in Luxembourg and so wanted to chat today to her about her VA journey and her experience and maybe give some tips and tricks to other VA is out there in the community so welcome Allison and thank you thanks for joining me today okay so yeah so first of all I just wanted to find out exactly what your VA business is and what services you specifically offer mm-hmm so I started my business for 20 admin solutions about three years ago noid and this I don't really have a niche but I find that most of my clients are really people who tend to be out a lot for different reasons during the day and have quite data intensive type occupations and so I help take the admin pain away that's the kind of model of my business and that really can be anything from helping people who maybe are organizing events and helping them with all the background Ackman I have some clients I she need help checking the dinner and I helped some people who would travel a lot to do their travel bookings and I also go in house to help people sometimes streamline your systems or to take minutes a grievance cases and things like that where you need someone quite neutral and he's not really associated with the business to do that and I work in partnership with other independent a charm advisors to do that so it's a bit of it's a bit of everything really I think the real idea is to take anyway that's the kind of model of my business okay so yes as you said it's quite varied and you've gone on doing different tasks so did you have to do like a specific training and to be a VA or did you have specific tat or skills that you were able to just bring to becoming in a VA how did you sort of come become to be a VA well I kind of I had 15 years experience I actually did I did my degree in French in German but then I did a post-grad diploma in European Business Administration so I've worked really for 15 years and lots and lots of different industries I was an export administrator a Sales Administrator travel advisor and a PA for a long time and a project administrator so I had lots of different admin skills and I didn't really I didn't really have any tree and such because I had that kind of very very background and I thought well you know I can put those skills to use in a different way okay so yeah you said um I studied French in German so is that hard you ended up being in Luxembourg like it's quite an immediately after Bay yes yeah no it's quite funny I think how you end up in place because I when I was in German when I studied German and I had to go for one month to Germany and work a certified student placement right and it was a career which is on the Luxembourg German German border and I flew into Luxembourg and flew out of Luxembourg and went to look somebody one weekend so I was there and then about six years afterwards I saw job advertised Luxembourg and thought that's a really nice place and they speak French and they speak German and the job I had they actually wanted someone who was near a native English speaker but he spoke booth and so I went to work there's a ton of bilingual secretary in a way okay so do you bring those skills like language girls to being in BA do you find that there's much call for language skills in the VA industry or is it something that you just sort of have in the background as an extra and I say I would just sort of have it in the in the background it's an extra certainly it helps sometimes when you're booking things abroad to be able you know to understand things a different language but mostly it's about the admin rather than the languages and I have lots of friends here translators which is obviously a different industry as well so if people really need translation help you know there's other people I can pass them on to yeah so you're talking there but you know you have friends that do translation so that is the potential niche that you could go down if you you want it to you but yes do you think going down in Asia is important for a VA or is it just important for some bas and for others sort of more broad varied skill set what what do you think about certain itching diners these sort of a core yeah I don't know there's a lot of sort of VA academies right there and some will say to you or you should have a nation and some say you shouldn't and the thing that I've learned very much with anybody that you talk to in a business is that you should always have different strands and actually sometimes if you know yourself don't intend ish you may find yourself with very little business if something you know something like wrecked your business we always need to have different little strands and then that way you'd be a bit more secure I think so I don't really have a niche but I say my clients when I look at the profile of them are quite nation in themselves okay so you're maybe your clients or the people that you would try and contact would be more niche based but the skills and the sets of work that you would do for them aren't necessarily in each piece it can be a wide variety of anything so that's quite good that sort of leads on to and what I would say and well well I think it's important I don't know probably do the same it would be ongoing lifelong learning especially for ya you know everything's changing so quickly there likes some media like myself there's so many new tools and platform skill sets that are that you know companies are looking for so would you advise anyone that would would be moving or thinking coming into the VA sort of world to continue on with their lifelong learning and is there any specific so the barriers you would maybe recommend um oh definitely the lifelong learning important thing you know you sort of sometimes forget when you're self-employed that you have to still you have to put that budget aside for sort of CPD and I know I've done I've done a few courses online with different academies there are and I went last year in in June I think it was to the northern VA collaboration conference which was in newcastle upon tyne yeah no nice because in Northern Ireland we don't really have we don't have yet a conference or any kind of sort of physical meet up for the years and actually when you're in a room with other people and you know I always think as well known around were a little bit behind in the virtual assistant industry like there's a lot you know them the industry in England has been growing a lot longer than it has here so we can always learn a lot from other people as well that's maybe good for you and I think northern Olympia so you were talking about sort of some of the online comic academies and that's how we know each other well one of the ways we know each other is through as we shall be Academy and social media and but as you say like that virtual online academies great but it doesn't doesn't substitute and that face-to-face networking meeting even though we're virtual assistants and we actually and you think it's you know there is a big importance of the networking so you get to know other potential clients but as well as other bas for that support because it can be quite a you know it can be quite a sort of lonely lonely an eye sore working lifestyle and it can and I think you do because every industry you have your specific problems and I think virtual assistants really you know I meet up with a couple of virtual assistants face-to-face and I think you do you have specific problems and it's good to actually sit down with someone and say how do you do that or how do you do that or how do you deal with this and at the same time because we have different specialities if a client comes to you and they have a specific task that you can do then you girl I've got a friend Gail you know I'm past that work over to her and that way you know we're all work we're all helping each other which is very important as well yeah so that's the point we could I discussed and talked about with other bas on yourself you know there you're not in competition with each other you are but you aren't you know so it's always good to be there and be supportive and one of the groups online groups I'll be part of would be the supportive EAS and associates as well as the likes of VA Connect society of va va helpdesk and there's lots and lots of others and they are so helpful you know being a part of one of those network groups that you can ask a question or just basic support or even and cheerleading you know come on you can do this use it you know even say and I've seen people saying oh I'm really struggling with this just like no you can do it if you need any help just get in contact so yeah I think being part of those networks and those groups are really really important so from that I was gonna ask you do you have any specific tips or tricks or I should say tricks but any tips or any advice for many people that are considering becoming a VA or even you know some more experienced bas that you've come across that's maybe a new thing or any specific advice Danielle what would you have where she'd known before you embarked upon this journey and I meant I actually met Caroline Wiley from the Society of virtual assistants last year and she's very very honorable but she does every year she does a survey or she surveys virtual assistants over in the UK and then she drones up the results of things like you know what is the average amount of money people are making one of the different times people are doing and bricks that all died and I actually think that if I had find her it's very very start that would be a very useful thing a document to have seen because I think at the start you don't know how to set your price and you do you don't really know how much you can charge and I've met a lot of people as well who you sort of think oh being a virtual assistant is going to be a really easy route I'm going to make a fortune and you know I'm gonna work nine to twelve and that'll be me and I think you do you don't realize in fact that okay you can do me if you really want to you can do seven hours of client working today but then you're also having to do quite a lot of work on your own business every week and I think that's I think the biggest piece of ice I would give is to research before you become a virtual assistant what it really means and that's advice for being self-employed some stuff nice too for entrepreneurs small baby a bit of research and yes talking about that the survey that Carly Miley from the Society of EA's did I yes that would have been something I would love because he's like hi I had struck I officially started myself sort of at the start of this year but last year I've been doing but some pieces of work and it was like somebody came to me and asked me well how much do you charge I mean really don't know you know for certain tasks it would be this for very niche niche tasks it would be that's enough yes it was very sort of confusing about what you know charge as well as you know what all does that need to cover you know it's he just as are not it's undercover you know your expenses your today pension anything so yeah it was really good when I find it myself and and so lastly probably what I wanted to ask was wouldn't want of II find has been your biggest challenge and your well you challenges and your biggest achievements as a VA so far I think the biggest achievement for me is that I'm still going here starting the line because there's no I became a VA because I wanted I wanted more flexible work and I'd worked in lots different industries and I wanted to help lots of people and that's what I love about it and they know that is the great thing but it's all there it's there's a lot of uncertainties and it's hard and but yeah I'm very thankful that I'm still going and the challenge is what it's just been all a learning curve you know I met a new clients actually on Friday and I was explained about what I do and he said so every day really easier to be get up and you don't really know what's going to be through not you and you just have to learn the things and get on with it and I said yes I said that's terrifying yeah yeah terrifying in some ways but in other ways it's like Oh something I want to learn you can't look did you learn a job as well so that's quite exciting you know you get paid to learn as you do your job another things you obviously know because that's the service you're offering but so it's the flexibility I think through being a VA that's a reason why I became one having two small children and just trying to fit in full-time work my not was never going to work so becoming a VA and I'm delving into a different area of business that I wanted to was it was a great opportunity scary did you jump into it but it was I wanted to do it for years so yeah I think it is it's quite good and it's an achievement for anyone to become a VA and set up on their own because setting up your own business it's scary in itself never mind doing the actual work um and so very last point I would ask do you have any big final well not final goes but any big goals that you've set yourself that you want to achieve in the next couple of years Oh like to get awards because I think at the start you're just you know you're just but you're just sort of concentrating and okay I have to get it's go in and then keep going and then you get a bit bigger and you think actually you know maybe it's time to apply for some more words and people once though it was the VA newcomer Awards with B my VA you might be a yes so we'll see we'll see he's that would be very nice to do something like that and so if anyone wanted to get in contact with you where would they go walk to platforms do you exist only on one of your contact
