 hey guys I'm brenigan here and today I want to talk about five ways you can protect your time [Music] all right so as entrepreneurs and business owners we are incredibly time poor and every minute counts so we need to learn to get really efficient with how we allocate our time so particularly if you're just starting out and you're one of these entrepreneurs it's having to do everything you know you're gonna have to do that and you're gonna need to get smart with your time but also too as you start to grow you're also gonna need to learn how to allocate those things and then time management really becomes key so guys I'm Ellen brenigan from founder cave I've been an entrepreneur for over 15 years and I understand that in that journey having support and resources to help you along that journey is key so if that sounds like you and you like what you're hearing here today then please hit the subscribe button below like and comment and all that good stuff and hit the notification button if you'd like to know when we post new content okay rule number one of protecting your time is to plan and prioritize this isn't a video about goal-setting I'm assuming that you've already done there and that you've set your goals but once you've done that you can now set tasks and you can allocate times there and if you don't have it laid out in the plan it's gonna be very easy to get distracted and it's gonna be impossible to track how you're actually going against that plan now having tried this out for years and really focusing on prioritizing my time I found one of the best ways of doing this is employing Stephen Covey's time matrix which you can see in the link below now Coby outlines us in this book the seven Habits of Highly successful people so basically what he's done that has established at every tires can be put into one of four quadrants and again you'll see a link below to that diagram if you want to follow along so quadrant one is our important and urgent category and is in a very much firefighting mode now we've all been there and we're gonna be there time and time again so there's no avoiding there and you have to do it but I guess his point is you should be focusing on quadrant 2 which is the non urgent and important stuff because if you focus on that more and you plan better you'll actually be firefighting less so quadrant 2 is where we really want to be this is where we're working on the business as much as in the business it's where we're planning for the future we're budgeting we're doing all those things that avoid us getting into trouble later the other two quadrants are urgent and non important and not urgent and not important I think it goes without saying he tried to stay out of quadrant three and four as much as possible another trick for prioritization which I swear by and honestly this changed not only my but how we did things as a company and that's to focus on one thing so I came across this concept in a book by Gary Keller called the one thing and the basic premise is here is once you prioritize so you've done your whole quadrant analysis and you're in quadrant two and you've got your most important tasks based on the goals that you're trying to achieve what you do then is you list them out and on a daily basis on a weekly basis on a monthly basis on an annual basis set a time frame and then establish okay within that time frame what's the most important thing I have to accomplish and then everything else follows on from that so you're focusing on delivering that one thing so for example you might set out your to-do list for the day and you say to yourself okay what is the most important thing I have to do today in order to achieve the most important thing for the week in order to achieve the most important thing for the month etc and here's the key thing you do that one first the basic premise II areas before you get distracted with everything that comes into your day make sure you complete that one thing first whether it's a 15 minute job or a three hour job or whatever it is but once you've completed that you know that no matter what else happens in your day because let's face it happens no matter what else happens in your day you've completed the most important thing it's gonna be very very satisfying it's a great way to stay motivated so again the book link is in the description below so I would recommend you check that out as well okay point number to obtain calendar anorexia I absolutely love this term it's a term coined by Ryan holiday he's the author of the obstacle is the way among many other books so again links below I highly recommend you check him out and it's such a great term I'm really trying to live by this calendar anorexia I love it so basically what you try and do is you you become as ruthless as you can with your calendar so really do you have to have that meeting could it be 15 minutes instead of 30 try and block your calendar out so that you're focusing on the most important things now as an entrepreneur especially if you've got a team around you you kind of need to be in the office and you need to be there for your team we all get there but there will be ways to get around it so maybe you come in an hour earlier or depending on the work habits of your team but also to you can employ tricks so we have a rule in our office that anyone with headphones on that's a please don't disturb me signal they may or may not be listening to music but you email them or you you ask permission to engage at them later headphones on means no no I'm focusing on my one thing please leave me alone unless it's of course quadrant one and it's super urgent then yes but realistically how often does that happen so a great way to do this is whenever you get a meeting request hit tentative and and really sort of test out like you know do you need me in this meeting what is the agenda for the meeting what are the outcomes can you come and see me instead of me having to come and see you anything you can do to convince them so that you can focus on what's important and look don't be afraid to say no if you don't think it's an important meeting say no other useful hacks here so I switch all notifications off I don't have social media notifications I don't have email notifications I don't even have text message notifications I also refuse to answer any phone number on my mobile phone that I don't recognize and look there are many things you can do to protect your calendar another really good book is the 4-hour workweek by Tim Ferriss he's got some really great strategies of how to handle automatic responses and meeting so I can I suggest you check that out but the point here is just clear your calendar as much as possible so you can focus on that one thing and the most important things that drive your business okay I touched on this a little bit earlier in the video where I said if you've got a team around you you're gonna have to learn to delegate that was a major learning curve for me oh where should I've done it so much earlier but you know you start off and you have to be jack-of-all-trades and more often not your master of none and then you start hiring the masters so they more often or not they're gonna do a better job of it than you would anyway so make sure you delegate have a plan again back into quadrant 2 you should be putting in there delegation plan delegated authorities all that stuff so it all starts to run smoothly because it can become a nightmare if you haven't planned it out all of a sudden you've got all these direct reports coming at you and it becomes chaos but once you've got a plan in place and you're delegating you as the entrepreneur and founder you should be focusing on the long term on the one thing the main goal for the business and and looking at the big overview let your people do the things they're really good at support them of course we're required but let them do their thing and you'll find your business runs a lot smoother and you'll have much more time to focus on the more important things point number four and I'll stress here look this does come a bit later and you have to have the cash flow for it but it's get an assistant even if it's a virtual assistant even if it's part-time just a few hours a week but get somebody to come in take away all the things that aren't critical to the high level goals of the business so that you can focus on that so I'm thinking here in terms of you know payroll ordering stationery for the office you know office manager type tasks but also again calendar management there's no better way of clearing the calendar than having a gatekeeper there to basically say no to everybody you know you have an assistant there that they have get past before they can even get to you so look this was a big learning curve for me I waited far too long and I regret not doing it sooner but now I've got one I've never looked back and to be honest with you the office can run itself now it's one of the best things I ever did and it's really allowed me to focus on the high level s piece of the business so last up here number five and you might think it's obvious but we all fall victim to it it's stay away from the email trap again go to that one thing switch off all your notifications no distractions you know allocate times for emails and understand that email is essentially mail it's not real-time messaging it's not a conversation if it's really that urgent they'll pick up the phone and call you trust me so first of all back to point number four I don't actually check my own email if you've got an assistant that's something that you can hand over to them and it takes them you know a lot of trust to do that but once you've done it it just reduces your workload so much and really do we all think that the emails are that important it's a nice way when you've just hit a wall to appear busy and feel like you're doing something but to be honest most of those emails can wait if it's really urgent somebody's going to get up and walk over and talk to you or they're going to call you I had an email technique where basically I would look at anything that had me into if it wasn't into if I were Sisu gone I'd look at who the person was and you kind of get a feel for who are the people who are not so worried perhaps gone then you start to look at okay well who my customers my shareholders my direct reports etcetera then you start to look at those and again you know go through the subject line are you copy on it is it just a nice note gone what are the ones that you really have to respond to and again in what time frame and you'll find you know if you've got like a hundred emails I'd be surprised if that was more than ten to be honest if we're being brutally honest with ourselves more than 10 they're not very critical to be fair okay that's almost it just one little bonus tip I know this is supposed to be fire but this is the bonus tip it's track your time so there's a great tool called rescue time it's based on the whole Pomodoro Technique where you allocate 25 minutes blocks of time you crank through your work you have a 5 minute break you get on to the next thing and I find it works pretty well sometimes you need to go a bit longer but it's just a good that keeps it a nice cadence and it keeps you focused on the things that you've got to do anyway guys I hope this video was useful if you like this video or not please leave a comment below again if you want to
