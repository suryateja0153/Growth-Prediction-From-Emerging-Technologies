 (rock music) (cranking) (screeching) - Hey Brad? I just bought this lift kit from customoffsets.com. Do I install these shocks body up or body down? - With the shocks you're using, you're gonna want to run those body down on your truck. Is there anything else I can help you with? - Nope, that's it. Thanks Brad! - [Alexa] Only Custom Offsets has Brad!
