 how many of you have never hired anyone before right is this new territory to you well that is what this video is gonna be about today is I'm gonna share with you the four things that I require or that I'm looking for what I am looking to hire a new staff member Hi! Roxanne Ray here. How many of you are at the point in your business where you need to hire staff hire people to help you implement help you sell help you with operations right and how many of you have never hired anyone before right it's this new territory to you well that is what this video is gonna be about today is I'm gonna share with you the four things that I require or that I'm looking for when I am looking to hire a new staff member the person I hire needs to meet all four of these criteria and so I'll just tell you a little story I when I got started I didn't think that was ever gonna need to hire someone I really thought oh this is gonna be a solopreneur and do everything on my own and when you get in business and you start out we all think that right or maybe you start out and you know that you're gonna hire someone eventually or maybe you have a capital to hire someone right off the bat but most people when they are starting their own business especially when they're kind of bootstrapping things they are doing everything on their own and then becomes a point where you have to make a decision of I can either just stay where I'm at and maybe take on more capacity but always be in that feast or famine right because when one clients finished or they leave then you need to go search and get another client gasp in time not only servicing but but prospecting right so there's this whole little life balance to business anyway but when you finally make the decision to hire a staff member most people have no idea where to look what to look for how to you know how to do any of that okay so I'm gonna tell you what I did and tell you so you learn from my mistakes and then learn and do it the right way okay so when I was hiring for a an assistant I actually hired two assistants at the same time and I I thought I did a really good job at vetting them I had them do a video interview because I was hiring for someone that didn't necessarily have to be local to me they could work from home so everything could be virtual so we did virtual interviews and then I gave them a test I asked them to rate themselves on skills you know one to ten how skilled they were in certain soft layers and things like that and then I gave them a task and I said complete this task and send it back to me and the two people that I did that with were I was very impressed with and they helped me hone in on this criteria I'm gonna share with you here in a moment and I hired them both the same time and that was probably a mistake because it was a lot of work to train two people at the same time and I had them doing very different things since they're both assistants I figured one could do certain aspects here the other one could do that all kind everything else okay so I kind of split it in half and uh the one that was doing really good she just took everything took the initiative was really excited listen everything I said was really organized which is something that I needed and I'm generally an organized person but when you run a business and you're like million balls in the air you get disorganized very quickly so I needed that I needed her to be organized for me and the other person was gonna help me organize my prospecting and even do some calling and prospecting with me well after a week I received an email from this individuals telling me that he had his sick dad was sick and he couldn't work and it was just a little odd in my opinion so I tried a problem or but he wouldn't respond to email any further he wouldn't respond to Facebook Messenger so I immediately revoked his access to everything but it got me thinking what did I miss what were the signs I feel like I could there's probably red flags there that I should have seen but I overlooked for whatever reason because I was new to this I've never done this before so let me share with you four things that you need to have every staff member meet and that way it'll hopefully prevent you from having that kind of nightmare situation that I had where you put all this time and effort into training someone and then they just vanish and disappear the first thing is they want to be part of the bigger vision for the business so it's important that you share what you're striving for what you're working towards and share that with the individuals and and see what their reaction is see if they're excited if they want to be part of this bigger vision that you have for the business and if so that's a really good sign and you'll know intuitively if they're excited or if they're kind of ho-hum about it but if they buy into the bigger vision for the business then that is a really really good sign that kind of checks off number one number two is look for someone who is resourceful and takes initiative in fact this probably should have been number one because this is so so important whoever you hire they need to be resourceful because you're running a business you're going a million miles a minute you're probably working weekends or working evenings I mean since you have the flexibility of a business you probably maybe take time to do errands during the day and you work in the evening I do that sometimes or you go to gym or whatever but you are all over the place so you need someone who could be resourceful and not always relying on you as that resource right so someone who can either go on YouTube can ask their network can search around in the files that you have for the business but you need someone who is resourceful and part of that is taking initiative right so initiative to be resourceful or initiative to not just follow directions but also take it a step further so let's say that you assign something to them or you ask them to complete something and when that person is doing that task they recognize that oh I probably you know maybe this piece goes with it right and I could go ahead and accomplish that finish that task for for you and then present it to you as a whole package versus just doing this part presenting it to you you recognizing hey we need this part too can you go back and do this part and then then we're going back to bite see how much time is wasted when you have someone that just takes initiative and sees those things and does them anyway it saves your sanity let me just tell you it saves your sanity so look for someone who is resourceful and takes initiative number three this is also very very important is you need to hire a problem solver not a problem finder so what is the difference right because there's problems are gonna arise there's always going to be situations always on the issues there's always only be buyers to put out you know million balls in the air okay someone who is a problem finder will find the problems and then come and tell you about it now how how like annoying is that I mean for lack of a better word like that is stressful you don't need someone who's just gonna find problems for you because you can do that yourself right but you need someone who's gonna find those problems and then solve them from for you and then come to you and say hey I found this problem but I fixed it right because that also builds trust in that person that they're gonna find something and they're gonna take care of it they're not always again and rely on you as that resource they're gonna be resourceful take initiative solve the problem and then let you know about it so it's really important to find a problem solver versus a problem finder all right the fourth thing that's really important for you to have when you're hiring a new staff member is somebody who wants to learn and grow now that sounds so simple right most people want to learn and grow but it's really important to find someone who has that desire that that sort of innate desire to learn and grow because that's gonna what that's what's gonna keep them with you for the long haul that's what really is gonna bring them into your world and want to stay there for a while because they know the bigger vision for the business they're resourceful they take initiative there are problem solver and they love to learn and grow so all that it's kind of like symbiotic together right because some of us who was resourceful likes to learn and grow because they like to learn new things therefore they find more resources and so forth sorry it's getting dark in here because there's a huge storm coming across the bay here but those are the four things so just to read all right to recap the four things you need to have in a new staff member these four things they have to have before you hire them before you even decide to hire or you're only going to hire them because they have these four things is they have to buy into the bigger vision of the business they have to be resourceful and take initiative they have to be a problem solver and they have to want to learn and grow they have a desire to learn and grow so if you are hiring new staff members or if even if you already have staff members you're looking for new ones or this is new to you you're starting to do this for the first time take it from me find people that fit into those four categories and you will thank me later trust me you'll have a great staff member someone you can rely on someone you can trust and someone that will help take your business to that next level all right y'all take care I'll be back with another video soon bye bye
