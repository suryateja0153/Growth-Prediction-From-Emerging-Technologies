 Thank you for calling Aira, Cory, This is  Amy how can I help today? Hi Amy, how are you? I'm well and yourself? Good, good, good. Today at Perkins, we announced the collaboration between Perkins and a technology company called Aira. that's introducing a technology that helps people who are blind actually to see using remote assistance and a special camera. Aira basically is like having a person with eyes, kind of next to you or in your back pocket. By Perkins stepping in the middle, bridging the gap we can not only help users get better solutions we can help vendors be more successful introducing new products.
