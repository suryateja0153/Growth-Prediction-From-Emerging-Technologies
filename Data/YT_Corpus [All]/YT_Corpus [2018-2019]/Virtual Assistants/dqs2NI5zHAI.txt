 why do you actually still type in the year 2018 that was a question I asked myself or I was challenged by that because as you know I try to use the smartphone as my one and only tool all the time and typing here can be very slow so speaking is much faster than typing and I realized that like 18 months ago like end of 2016 the speech-to-text got way way way way way better give me your iPhone and peas iPhone both have it built in let's see how that works hey guys I think I will be late today for the meeting so can you wait for me is that okay and I think I don't know exactly what I'm saying here but it's quite easy to translate no matter if it's Google or zero lot of bite me are good you have to choose with the iPhone if it's German or English and Google detects it itself so I'm not saying I use it all the time I have sometimes when I'm public somewhere a keyboard that I can open so if I like really want to process stuff on the phone and I don't have the large screen or a laptop I have the keyboard still which is a very good one I can link below which one I use I actually use a Microsoft product the thing is that if you're reminded more and more often to use that you use it in more and more occasions and it will speed things up a lot and the thing is you need to think before you actually type and this also helps compared to typing to think through it what you want to say and then say it these are the reasons why I think typing is 90s and I hope it will be over soon this support is the keyboard this row of keys is called the home row
