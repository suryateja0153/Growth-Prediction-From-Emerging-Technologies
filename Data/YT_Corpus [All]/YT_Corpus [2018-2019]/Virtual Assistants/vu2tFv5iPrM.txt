 what's going on guys. Juan here and on today's video I want to show you 2 methods that you can use via Google home to send commands to Tasker on an Android device so let's get started. For the first method you can use AutoVoice which is a very popular plug-in for Tasker if you never used it before you can download it from the Google Play Store. You can find a link in the description below after you download the plug-in you need to link AutoVoice to Google home so open the Home App tap on the menu icon and then Explorer search for AutoVoice and then tap on link and select your Google Account now whenever you want to use AutoVoice via Google home just say OK, Google Plus ask AutoVoice or let me talk to AutoVoice and then the command that you would like to send to Tasker. Now the next step is to create a profile in Tasker that will recognize the command sent from Google home and execute a specific task so for this example let's create a simple profile to turn Wi-Fi on and Bluetooth off when we are home and the opposite when we are not home. Open Tasker on your device press the plus icon to create a new profile tap on event plug-in AutoVoice and select recognized here we need to configure AutoVoice with the phrase that we are going to use via Google home so tap on the hard way and then tap on command filter here we are going to type the following this part of the phrase is going to create a variable called status now any time we say the phrase change phone status to either home or not home it will enter the words home or not home in the status variable last we need to select Use Regex and we can back out to create a task that will execute this actions for this task we are going to use the if condition so tap the plus icon task and select If here we are going to use the status variable we just created and we are going to set the value to home then we are going to add the action to turn Wi-Fi on and Bluetooth off and also a flash notification to let us know when this condition gets trigger then we are going to use Else If to trigger the opposite actions for when we are not home to make it easy we can copy the options above and change the values okay so now let's go ahead and test this out. Hey Google, ask AutoVoice to change phone status to not home all right getting AutoVoice command sent change phone status to not home Hey Google, askAutoVoice to change phone status to home sure here's AutoVoice command sent change phone status to home. Okay so everything is working correctly now AutoVoice also has an advanced feature and is to use natural language from Dialogflow formerly known as API.AI with dialogflow you can create a better conversation system where you can set up multiple phrases to trigger a specific action and you can also customize the response that you get back from auto voice via Google home I'm not going to be covering this feature in this video but I did make a tutorial video a while back when it was still in beta. You can find a link in the description below if you guys would like me to make an updated tutorial video about natural language definite let me know in the comments below now the second method that you can use to send commands to Tasker is by using IFTTT and they join app I personally prefer using this way better because, 1, I don't have to ask Google to call a service like AutoVoice, 2, I can also set up multiple phrases to trigger a command and 3, I can customize the Google home response. Let me show you how to set up the previous profile using this method the first thing that you want to do is go to IFTTT and create a new applet click on "This" and search for Google Assistant now select "Say a phrase with a text ingredient" here you can enter multiple phrases that can trigger this command the dollar symbol works like a variable which means that when you say change phone status to home or not home it will replace the dollar symbol with the words home or not home now for the response we are going to enter the following and we are also going to use the dollar symbol click on create trigger and then select "That" search and select Webhooks and then select "Make a web request" before we continue we need to get the join API link so go to the following link you can find this link in the description below here select your mobile device and then click on join API to get the API URL click on show next to the API key now on the text field we are going to type the following copy the URL and go back to the IFTTT website paste the link in the URL field then we need to replace the word value with the text field ingredient and we need to surround the text with this now this is very important for some reason a space is entered at the beginning of the text field ingredient so we'll need to remove it to avoid issues with the Tasker profile. Ok so we are done here so click on create action and then finish next let's create a task of profile so open Tasker press the plus icon to create a new profile tap on event plug-in and then join tap on Text and then under the text field enter the same information that we typed for the join API text field going to variable names and set up a new variable called stat now let's back out and create a new task for this example I'm just going to use a task that I use in the previous method which is already set out with the same variable name we created for join if I were doing this from scratch then I would open the if condition search for the joint receive push status and then change the value to home or not home everything else pretty much will stay the same okay so now let's go ahead and test this out Hey Google, change phone status to not home sure setting phone to not home mode Hey Google, change phone status to home sure setting phone to home mode alright so everything is working correctly I do have a full written tutorial about this video on my website so be sure to check it out you can find a link in the description below thank you guys for watching thumbs up if you like this video don't forget to subscribe if you haven't done so already and I will see you in the next video
