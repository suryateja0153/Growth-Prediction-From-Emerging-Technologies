 Hi my name is Connie McKee and I'm an REIQ trainer and member of the Property Management Support Service (PMSS) team. On Friday 24 August the PMSS team are hosting the Practical PM Day and the day is exactly that - all things practical property management with a lineup of practitioners and guest speakers. First in the lineup is Nick Brown and Sean Roberts our REIQ Legal Counsel and they're going to provide the answers to the top ten curly questions the PMSS team have handled. The Queensland Police and meth-screen as well as SAS are going to provide us with information about identifying and dealing with a meth lab situation and Aon Risk Services are going to cover the all-important topic of making sure our owners have the information to have the right type of landlord protection insurance in place. The PMSS team have noticed an increasing trend of PM's dealing with domestic violence situations so we're really fortunate to have a guest speaker from Q Shelter who are going to come along and provide us with the various options that're available when we're navigating through these types of situations. Four highly respected practicing Property Managers are going to share their knowledge and experience, with Katy Knight and Yvette Patterson sharing their tips and strategies as to how they managed to stay out of QCAT, and Dot Hamilton and Hayley Hill are going to provide us with their thought pattern on which structure works best in PM - portfolio, task, pod or somewhere in-between, and additionally they're going to share their insights into how they integrated Virtual Assistants into their businesses and what that's achieved for them in relation to efficiency, service standards and profitability. The last session is titled "Stop feeling like you're going into battle every day with your owners and tenants" and it's going to be a fun session because Nick Brown, Samara Bedwell and myself, all members of the PMSS, we're going to have our skills tested because we're going to go head to head in a roleplay situation and will provide our best practice suggestions, scripts and dialogue as to how we deal with conflict in a bond situation including carpet cleaning, tenancy arrears as well as maintenance and the flow-on effect obviously to tenants so the feature days are always booked out, book your spot and I look forward to seeing you on Friday 24 August.
