 Are virtual assistants spying on you? Voice-activated devices are finding their way into more and more homes. Can they be trusted to respect your privacy and security? Even though conversations are encrypted, new research suggests that popular voice control platforms may be vulnerable to silent audio attacks. There have been reports of home voice-activated assistants recording private conversations and making accidental shopping orders. Voice-activated devices store search history, and it is often saved until you choose to delete it. Even if you don’t provide them with your address, they still track your location based on your IP address and other signals. They do that to set alarms for the right time zone and provide you with relevant weather and traffic information. The smart speakers are convenient to use, but check the privacy settings on your device, think about the information you provide and, if you don’t want something to be recorded - just unplug it.
