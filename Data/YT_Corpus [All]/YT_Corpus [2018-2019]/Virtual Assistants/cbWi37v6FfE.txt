 Mooooommy! Confession - sometimes I play hide-and-go-seek with my kids just so I can have TWO MINUTES of silence (crash noise). Confession - I went to college. I even got my degree. but sometimes... I feel like I'm wiping my kid's butt with it.  Confession - I love my kids SO much. Seriously, I'm afraid I may EAT them I love them so much. But sometimes, I want to be more than "just" a stay at home mom. And that's when the "mom guilt" sets in. Mom guilt is defined as the unavoidable and unexplainable pressure all mothers put on themselves to get 110 hours of work done in 24 hours. So here's what I decided to do... I started a business. ... a virtual assistant business actually. Something I could do at home, with my kids and feel like I had something that was still MINE. And the craziest thing happened... I was actually HAPPY! Not right NOW am I happy but... in general... I was happy. It's ok. Be a full-time, stay at home mom. Work part time. Work from home. Work full time. Do what is right for you. Because YOU being HAPPY is what makes you a better MOM. Know somebody who needs to see this video? Share it with them and tag them in the comments below.
