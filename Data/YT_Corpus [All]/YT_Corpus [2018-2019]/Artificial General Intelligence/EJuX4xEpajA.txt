 I explain every concept around Artificial Intelligence in one minute! Game on! Artificial Narrow Intelligence is good at performing a single task, such as playing chess, poker, making online searches or weather forecasts. Artificial General Intelligence can understand and reason its environment similarly as a human being would do, therefore it’s also known as human-level AI. We are far from that. – írjuk ki Artificial Superintelligence is even further down the road. It would be smarter than the best humans in every field from scientific creativity to general wisdom and social skills. What helps us create A.I? Machine learning is a method for reaching Artificial Narrow Intelligence referring to creating programs based on data as opposed to programming rules. You can feed it with a lot of radiology images and let it discover recurring patterns. Finally deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks, an artificial replication of the structure and functionality of the brain. It's efficient at various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing or translation. Did I leave something out? Let me know! The A.I. may be with you!
