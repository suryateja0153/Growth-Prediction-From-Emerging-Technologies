 I get to say it out loud iRobot Ujjain machine machine learning diversity and opportunities so you can see quite diverse up here tons of opportunity and I don't know one or two AI experts so we're gonna get things started the way we're gonna do this is once again we're having a panel mentality it's about looking at the continuum of thoughts everybody's perspectives and just having a good time so I'm gonna look to you Gary okay what AI technology interests you most moving forward in the next three years what a AI or technology doesn't yeah no I get it I mean I think about AI a lot I mean I think I think what I'm most interested in is that there's an enormous amount of things that humans do that is really dumb yeah right and so what excites me about AI is I think people get hyperbolized into oh my god people gonna lose jobs and all this things and for me I think that people are gonna be able to focus on far more interesting behaviors because things are gonna be eliminated we were told that tractors were gonna eliminate jobs for farmers and that this was gonna be devastating so for me at its beginning just because I grew up as a merchant the amount of things that are happening in customer service that are being used by an enormous amount of people that the same question is being asked over and over the elimination of simple questions that information is at the fingertip especially when layered on top of a voiced device like an Alexa or Google home has has me extremely excited so I'm gonna go touch upon so Alexa Google home in personal AI is what I'm really excited about I actually a couple years ago in like an IndieGoGo type of personal robot I got to meet him this year buddy at CES it's really exciting so cool and I I've spoken to Sofia the robot I really look at that as definitely the future being able to interact with AI and having them in our lives in a daily basis more than just Google home and Alexa and Siri but I like for them to become you know my personal assistant do all the things that I don't want to do and make my life a lot easier so I look really forward to that happening so now who wins and who loses with this technology that's a good question I think simply put those who are prepared and are ready for what's coming and at least understand or aware what's coming will probably win and those that don't before she won't I read a report seeing that just like self-driving cars or vehicles the net jobs lost worldwide will be about 60 million right and it's not just the taxi drivers the truck drivers losing their jobs it's the ecosystem around them right you hope to make us many cars you don't need any supply areas just the truck stops the diner's the motels the support those guys will go away the question becomes is what do we do with those people some people we can probably retrain upskill for those jobs of tomorrow which is probably six to eight years out and some people we can't can't tell someone that's like in their mid 40s married with some kids that hey guess what you go back to school for six years so we need to try and figure out what is the right thing to try and do for these people in common how does this impact our kids and future generations what information is very important but something that Gary said that I thought was it was something about how I felt about AI when I learned that hey I was helping a lot of farmers when it comes to their crops to you know to really predict because we've been having issues with food and they were saying like you know by the Year 2060 food was just gonna be all messed up but our farmers um getting a lot of information from AI which you know has a chance to to feed not only our kids but feed us in a healthy way and I think it's important that we just continue to educate and give as much information about it so that our kids because we got kids out there that are brilliant and now it's just about exposing them to that so I think that's how as a I was helping I mean and we've seen it help kids who like I said we have issues with sight kids who've had disabilities um its health care with education excuse me incredible yeah it's incredible and um and it also they've been using it to diet to dissect when they think kids might be looking to drop out of school and and hopefully come up with ideas that will keep them in school so I think that's another way it can benefit our youth but um I feel you know we have the ability for it to benefit not only our youth but us as adults too I'd love to just build on and I just I just think this is such a fascinating conversation on the winners and losers we're now three years into this conversation where people realize certain people are gonna lose jobs it's gonna be another five to seven to nine to twelve years when this starts hitting scale I struggle not that I'm right or wrong I struggle that if you're a truck driver and you know autonomous trucks are coming and you have a 12 year head start to address your vulnerability it's hard for me to muster up super big tears for that guy or gal losing their job when they have a 12 year Head Start that this thing's going away and I think that a lot of us are having these conversations rightfully so because we have a lot of compassion that these things are gonna happen but at some level there's a very interesting line about accountability when this is facing you I mean I don't feel bad for toys-r-us going out of business nobody cried for the bookstore's when they saw Amazon was coming to get them and so I think that there's a very important conversation that this is gonna take a while but when we get to that moment where does accountability in this knowledge but that's why what Gary is saying is it's true but at this and along with that that's why people need to be exposed and get the information so the accountability can be like yo you knew about this you knew about this so you could have done something but everybody needs a fair shake it's America we want everybody to get a fair shake we know that's not what's been happening but everybody deserves until you're in to your point that's what gets me so excited about this my big thing is you could live an Instagram explorer for nine hours or you can get your google game up you know I mean that's what's so powerful about this you know whether it's immigrants or minorities or female like what what you think about the scale of Technology its ability to potentially level a playing field is so remarkably powerful if I could just comment on that I think those are both really great points and I think that's the question we're struggling with as a global society because we're reaching an inflection point now of we can do great things right are we gonna rice the challenge learn a deal more complex work higher value work be more creative where we're gonna go the route of infotainment and watch YouTube videos watch Game of Thrones and other things and right now I don't know which way will break as society but I'm looking at the future work and I think the future is like our data is what will allow us to earn income so we're and also universal basic income I think about those things all the time ai is taking over all the jobs and we have to think of other ways to earn income and of course infotainment is definitely one of them but just basically our own deal right now I use Sweatt coin I are in $600 a month just by walking that's it so guys seem a little bit bashful I just think this is interesting I think history can help us so much you know Game of Thrones or listening to music or watching a video of somebody escapism has always been such a foundational part of us that the circus was the leading place that people spent money on during the Great Depression blows my head off like people people don't have and the circus is dominating why because life was super hard and getting those two or three hours I'm sure you know when I listen to an album is like that's escapism that's look for me to balance it's a very interesting human trait that we you know are thinking about and I just think it's a remarkable time so just to kind of bring this together to balance the two of you and bring this panel together when we're going to the humanism view of this once we've equaled the playing field if you're not moving forward you're moving backwards right we're all accountable for it whatever we do next true all right guys I want to go off script so I want to kind of play on what you guys were talking about and bring you guys in and you all seem very comfortable so bear with okay there's this common misconception we talk about artificial intelligence right it's an amalgamation of technologies computer vision NLP voice recognition data processing in the cloud storage in the cloud many many other things robotics and this idea that it's going to be part of this fourth Industrial Revolution where we're gonna disintermediate everything and put everybody out of work is often misconceived right because some people would say that the jobs are gonna go to the first or the highest paid repetitive and highly objective jobs arguably radiologists are more at risk than a truck driver so I want to kind of go through that and ask your opinion on what jobs you actually think change and what sort of opportunities that open up for us comedy okay if I start with you well yeah you can start with me I know one thing that a job you won't lose if you're a good artist I mean I also think you know as Gary was alluding to certain forms of entertainment and things that we enjoy you're just not gonna lose that job like I mean I still want to see LeBron James you know like simple as that like can't replace that you can't replace that you can't replace Frank Ocean you know you can't replace common you know the thing they did with Tupac and all those Holograms holograms but there's nothing like having the real thing yeah all right man thank you Gary let's bring it your way don't walk it down guys look I think I mean you nailed it anything that's repetitive and done you know on the back of you know technology or you know is going to be fundamentally vulnerable yeah so you know it's funny same thing with the internet I remember when the internet like started becoming real and people actually had a well I remember thinking with with Amazon hey bookstores it's your turn right and then uber came along and it was taxicabs it's your turn you know to me everybody's gonna have a turn outside of that that is black and white I think what Commons referring to in which is so powerful about art is that it's gray right I think anything that is black and white is remarkably vulnerable there's so many things that are done there by people that are typing away at a computer that are a human typing away at a computer to create an action for another human is 100% vulnerable mm-hmm whoo what about you I look at this as an opportunity for all of us to become polymaths Renaissance men and women to be the day of being specialized in a skill that's not happening anymore you know right like common you're an artist but now you're also doing tech stuff I used to do so many different things before I did this I was a behavioral therapist I had a VR company our company a blockchain company I'm a VC so many things I look at this is a real opportunity for us to learn so many different things and let let the AI take all the repetitive jobs they should I don't think there should be any more slave labor this is an opportunity like I I was just in China for the last month and there's no recycling at where I was because they have humans to ever separate all the recycling well for that country for those people really thrive they can start thinking about more things than just surviving when they I can take over it and because of that little smartphone they can all look at becoming infotainment on their entertainment and their data that's really exciting I agree that's great so Neil I want to close with you on this one you you are you're very modest but you are a master inventor you are a master prognosticator what what do you see happening here I I want to start by just trying to summon up that machines are about productivity and people are about creativity right there are things that machines do better than people but there are things that people do much better than machines and we have to keep that in mind and I think what's going on today's people are surprised by some of the things that machines are good at people say well ok driving a taxi or a bus that's one thing but how can I do something a lawyer can do but if you think about some of the tasks that you know lawyers do coming out of law school they're very productive type of tasks and the goal is not to you we're gonna replace all those guys with that we're gonna free their time up to do more complex work more creative type of work and maybe that's case strategy maybe that's more engagement and understanding the client and what's going on I think what we really have to deal with again as a society is understanding how our work how our lives are gonna be transformed by this what could we do that's more that's more creative and I don't think this is a unique challenge for us you know technology has always been there and reshaping our lives I think it's that the changes are coming faster and faster and I think that's what people are struggling with is the stuff we're talking about is not twenty years away in some cases it's not even five years away it's already here what do we do so this shift that we're talking about opens up a subject and this is a unique panel because we can go from deep tech to diversity and culture and so I want to hand this one off to Denise because obviously this cues you up beautifully for the next question on what this means absolutely so at the end of the day guys the tech industry has taken a lot of fire for not being diverse especially at the top echelon so why is diversity important what does it mean to the future and what opportunities does it bring can I start with this this is something I'm super passionate about I started the women in black chain foundation to address this specifically I was tired of being the only woman at the table in every tech company and every meeting and yes women join join a telegram channel but it's it's it's really important for us to be diverse because if you if you think about it on a technological layer if you look at box chain all around the world in every corner of the universe well if it's in every corner of the universe it's going to take everyone in every corner of the universe to be put in this and that has to be more than just you know a white guy it has to be every single one of us and if we're talking about the new era of wealth creation it has to include because in the dot-com era it was mainly men it's like 90 percent men were able to gain from this well here's an opportunity I myself have been able to gain from this and I want everyone else to come with me and join this revolution so I'm so passionate so yes diversity is very important everyone needs to come on board and educate yourself do whatever it takes you know look at every YouTube channel follow Gary and everything you know there's so much out there just do what it takes and get everyone to join you well said yeah and I you know I mean this is the world man everybody has something to offer like it's just we just all have something to give to this world and and Jeff brought up something when I was talking back there like that I a community that I didn't acknowledge was the Native American the First Nation brothers and sisters who I saw at one point actually getting in tune with some AI technology to through something I was doing with Microsoft and it was like man so many gifts have been given to the world from different cultures and and from women and men and from people from from Africa to to India to you know to the United States and they come from so many different backgrounds so it's it's important that we that we get to use use our technology and have diversity but it's also one of the things that's important that that we educate first so the people that are the people that we're asking to step up and see these jobs are prepared and have what what Gary said the accountability to do it but then we also have to recognize some of these companies the people the higher-ups have to be diverse to like we have to have diverse people in the boardrooms making decisions or it's just like or it's just basically like what we've been seeing in our country for so many years yeah we're gonna we're gonna make it diverse we're gonna make you know bring more people of color in but are they making any decisions are they getting any opportunities to be a part of some of the significant change to skip coming from up top and that's where I think diversity is gonna have to start from the education and of in the top there's so many levels to get to diversity to be honest yeah I was born in Belarus and the former Soviet Union to me it's it's a it's a very important subject because take out the first of all it's human if you are not a human that believes in it you're you're unbelievably vulnerable and and unbelievably in a defensive negative place but take that away let's just make it raw about business and like make it about what people tend to make it about perspective and context our strengths not weaknesses to only it's almost like if we were talking what if we talked about food you know shitty it would be to just eat Italian food you know Italian foods rad but it would make no sense and so for me I'm fascinated by companies that all look the same all the decision makers look the same to me very honestly especially an environment we now live in today and I don't mean the political environment I mean just where the evolution of Technology and opportunities are it's a vulnerability it's laughable to not take context from all walks of life from different angles I'll tell you one that I'm unbelievably fascinated about that is not talked enough about in technology tech you know we talk up thank God we're talking so much about brown and black and minorities and females but we don't talk about ageism at all you know I'm unbelievably a big fan of people in their 60s 70s 80s and 90s because I think they have deep context for life but people that are 70 and above are completely getting on in our in our ecosystem and so I've been thinking a lot about starting an incubator that is actually incubated out of a retirement home so I've always thought you know I came from a whole lot of little and so I always thought I had an advantage because I think adversity is an advantage so I think in general why is it important because you'll do better if you have a divorce diverse team if we're not representing the entire stakeholder environment at the very top you're vulnerable I'm also concerned about like who's programming this AI if it's not from a diverse crowd of people who were to program we're not gonna get the protocols that are needed to represent what we want this is one demand this is way more important than people think I'll give you the comp in real life everything for a long time was just made for righties what about lefties Yeah right yeah so people may hear that and it may not understand but if you're a who's a lefty out there right so I think neela we wouldn't leave you out of this conversation a hundred percent agree with everybody and if we write you up a really critical point because you've already seen with some AI solutions there's inadvertent bias and the training right you look at google vision I know those guys didn't mean to do it but it was really good at recognizing white men and that's so much anybody else because it was built and trained by white man and I think as we're moving forward doesn't become more integrated in our lives and it's gonna start doing more to assist us with decision making making sure that training is as bi as free as possible has the multi-perspective is going to be critical I can tell you that in my work with the United Nations in the span of about six months a lot of the world leaders went from is this a Skynet type of thing - we need robot judges robot judges are to reduce bias the court system helped more people that kind of stuff but it all boils down to that training and without the right diversity we're gonna keep making those same mistakes shift gears just a little bit and take a time trip back with me everybody on this stage is a product of the third digital revolution we grew up with micro electronics revolution digital information technology information systems it's foundational changed everybody here you roll the clock back 4050 years we had just landed on the moon the idea of private rockets was ridiculous unless you were building them in your backyard there were no microwave ovens there were no smartphones there were no cell phones the Internet as we know it wasn't invented in fact its predecessor ARPANET only started in 1983 stem cells nobody even knew what the genome was at that time so I want you to put your thinking hats on and tell me as we move to the precipice of this fourth digital revolution right we are saying unprecedented technology we have quantum computing coming which changes everything possible nuclear fusion as a power source we now have robotics artificial intelligence machine learning and more computational power on a phone that Gary pulled out of his pocket then used to run universities right so play it forward to 2050 Neil I'm gonna start at this side with you because you you this is your job this is where you live what you do for right plus we got this aim here could I like this was planned by the way tell me and tell this crowd what you think we can expect I will tell you we're moving so fast it's really difficult if I were to run the clock back just ten years who were to predict it something like uber right I think if we're going to 2050 what's gonna happen I can I'm gonna throw it out there and say one word cyborgs we're already seeing a big move towards human computer integration they've already done like experimental surgery and they could put digital cameras that are blind person's eyes and transmit the image so they can see I think 2050 will be cyborgs who I'm already into that now I look at us being able to have not only cyborgs here on earth but doing stuff in on other planets I already started my own embryo portfolio so that I could have my own progeny in Mars when we start doing that I think that's the future my own one concern is that when the cyborgs come that there will be less human interaction interaction like I won't need a man anymore cuz I have my own sex robot but I think there will be a lot of training needed for us to interact with humans so that job will be available URI your thoughts I hope I think sex robots are gonna be amazing so I'm not super like passionate about the nostradamus business you know I there's a lot of things that were gonna be closed on there's gonna be a billion things that we could never even think about you know for me what stands out is what I'm fascinated by technology is I think it's throwing us back if you ask me the best indicator of where we'll be in 2050 I think things that we were doing in the 17 and 1800's play out let me give you an example let me give you the one that really stands out for me what what social media has done is it's allowed us to know much more about each other than we ever could before at scale which was far more similar to what was happening in the old days when your little community was your whole world and you did know everything about every massive extension of the vieta so hundreds of the more interesting things to think about in 2050 and maybe 2100 is I think things that we've put on pedestal religions marriages are gonna become dramatically more vulnerable well III think that the shadows of our society are being exposed by technology there's nowhere to hide and I think most of the institutions that we hold near and dear are actually built up by the shadows of our society and so I think this gets a hell of a lot more emotional than people think I actually hope that we become a hell of a lot less hypocritical once we realize that we all have skeletons and we all have massive flaws which will then allow us to have a hundred years of pain which will then lead to a hundred years of nirvana I like coming gonna bring this one home for me you mean work absolutely everywhere I mean look you're asking the person in Friday least has the ideas of where we'll be in 2050 I am a person that likes to stay in the present but if I do I have a album called B and I was about being in the present just being present right but if I do have to think about the future in an hour what I would like to see ai and technology bring us maybe we have a cure for cancer through and and as we talked about earlier maybe it'll be healthier foods being put in neighborhoods that don't get healthy foods because the technology and maybe we can even use technology to advance rehabilitation as I talked about in prisons I'm just talking about dreams I got right maybe technology or help bring us together more as people and what in love would be the center of it in technology or just be a tool of it so those are the things that I dream of in my dream world cuz I'm a dreamer but right now I'm staying the president I'm grateful to be here with you brilliant people beautiful man thank you thank you I think we can all agree to that but all good things have to come to an end and a huge round of applause for our guests
