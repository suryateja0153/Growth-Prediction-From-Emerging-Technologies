 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Myla. We are working on reaching in standing. Okay. So, I am going to try to have her standing at something and reaching down. Yep. Yes, good girl. There you go. Can you push it, Sweet Pea? Good girl! So try to keep her supported while she is propping. Good girl! I would like her to keep one hand holding on and one hand free, leaning down just a little bit. Uh-huh. Good girl. Good girl! It's a way to work on standing and reaching. Right now, she is needing a good bit of help, but tends to be a fun way to work on trunk strength, leg strength, and balance. Thanks a lot! See you later! Bye-bye!
