 My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my Myla. She is going to walk on the treadmill...supposedly... So we have not even tried this before so I have no idea how it is going to go. She is a little shyer than she was before. So let's see what happens. Oh boy! Oh, wow. Okay now, I have got to turn her around. I'm gonna squat down in front of her. We are going 0.5 miles an hour. Okay. I know it. Let's try it anyway. We're gonna go for one minute. Try it. Oh Heavens! Let's me see if we can try taking steps at 0.5 miles per hour Oh my! Oh! She is in her save me mode which is not very conducive to walking. Oh, let's go! Let's see. Okay. You got it. Here we go! One, two, three... Oh boy. We have another 15 seconds. You ready? 1, 2, 3, 4. That was good! Oh Heavens!....1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, That was not good bad, sweetie. I have to try it again Okay (groan) Hey Myla! What I saw was potential. How old is Myla now? 16 months. I would say if she knew me better that there was a chance that this young lady could start taking some steps on the treadmill. If in the next little bit if they try with somebody she knows and likes, it is possible she could start taking little steps on the treadmill. Treadmill training is pretty standard practice now for children with Down syndrome and low tone. So let's say they ought to give it a try. I hope this was helpful. That's our third try at this, and we will try to get in a couple months. Thanks! Bye!
