 Hi! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm a pediatric physical therapist. I'm here with my co-instructor, Myla. We are going to teach a back strengthening idea. She can sit but she often slouches when she sits. So I'm sitting with her feet trapped (sound effect) between my ankles. I am going to put a toy that she might be interested in down low. When I tried this before, she wasn't interested in going down to get it, but I can help her (sound effect) go down and get it. And then she can come back up. Good girl. I can put it down low...I going to help her... go get it. oh oh oh and...oh golly. My gut feel is that is is too low for her to go down to the floor by herself (sound effect) then you can help her get it. Then have her come back up. Way to go!!! That is a simple idea to work on back strength. Thanks a lot! See you later!
