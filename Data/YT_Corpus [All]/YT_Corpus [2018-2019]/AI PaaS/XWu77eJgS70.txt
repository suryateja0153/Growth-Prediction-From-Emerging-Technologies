 Our major focus is on the banking and financial sectors. The banking and financial sector is 21% of IT spend in the country. A large portion of this goes towards the data center, the DR Backup, and then storage. We recently completed a very large project for a global rated special company. They operate in five continents. There are 16,000 people, and they're growing rapidly. But beyond the fact that they have a capex constrained, we found that Azure was the right solution. It was the right solution in terms of the price, in terms of the time that we had to deliver and make it go live. We were able to complete this project in a record time with near zero downtime, and a most painless deployment.  Microsoft has two things working to its advantage ; a basket of products and new technologies, and faster partner support system. We are [inaudible] about block chain and serverless computing on Azure cloud. We are upgrading our recently built 90-seater remote delivery center to cater to our global as well as national customers. As a company, we are moving from product to people, and stock to skills. It has been great experience so far with Microsoft, and we are ready to go wherever Azure takes us.
