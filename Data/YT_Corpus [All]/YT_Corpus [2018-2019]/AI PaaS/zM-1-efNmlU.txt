 Hi! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my co-instructor, Myla. She is 16 months old and has low tone. I am going to try the other piece. Before we did wheelbarrow walking,  so weight bearing on the arms. Now I am just going to try knee walking. She is wigglier than she was before. So, let's see how I do. I put her on her knees between my knees to trap her. I am just going to try to get her...Ooops. She got me. Yes, I know. I hear it. I hear it. I can tell. I know. I know. So what she wants to do is pull that leg through. So I am just blocking it. Oh I hear. She got me again. There we go. I can see. Let's let that one go. Uh-huh. It looks like I can not let it go too far or she beats me. Mmm-hmm.  Let's try this one. I know it. I know it. For some kids, this works like a charm. For Myla, she is a little more talented than I am. I will take that. Yeah, yeah. You have got talent... oh...and tears. So it is a way to work on the precursors of crawling. Thanks a lot! Bye!
