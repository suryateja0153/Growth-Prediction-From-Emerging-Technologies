 Hi! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist with about 30 years of clinical experience. I am just going to give another simple idea to work on core strength. I'm here with Myla who has low tone and my microphone cord. She is about 16 months old. She still has a little bit of a Buddha belly right here. So, we want to work on...maybe not in the mouth... working on core strength. So to get those abs to pull in, I am just tilting her back. Whoa! Tilting her back. Whoa! I've got my hand in back to catch her, just in case I tilt her too far. Whoa! The longer you make her hold it, the harder it is. The further back you go, the harder it is. Whoa! I know it? Want that one? Oh no! Hang on! Whoa! Whoa! It is a simple idea to work on a core strength. Oh! Myla says, "Enough!" I hope you find it useful and I'll see you another time. Bye-bye!
