 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm a pediatric physical therapist. I'm here with my co-instructor, Myla, who specializes in teaching exercises for kids who are low tone. Myla is almost eight months old working work on a pulled a sit. I'm using my legs as an incline board to make it a little bit easier than all the way down flat. I'm putting my thumb's inside her hands. My fingers hold her forearms and I'm going to pull  her up the sitting. I'm also going to work to keep her legs in. She tends to put them out really wide when she does trunk work. I going to try to help keep them in. Good girl! That was great and we're going go down too. Up and down. I see you. Down we go. I'm going slow to try to get her to work that head and neck. You're playing with the microphone!... and down you go. Nice job! You did super! That's it for today. Thank you so much! Bye-bye!
