 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with a one-year-old, Myla, who is getting so BIG! She can sit independently when placed in safe places, but she's not getting into sitting by herself yet. So we are going to work on a one hand pull to sit. So I'm just going to take one hand. I am going to have her go toward the camera just for politeness. So, I'm going to take the opposite hand. I'm gonna bring her this way. Oh Heavens! I am going to have her push up with that one arm and then pull on up to sitting. There you go. So you take the opposite hand. Roller her away from that arm. Have her push with the one arm to help get up to sitting. So it's just an easy way to start working on getting into sitting. I do it on both sides. So I'm just going to be polite and go toward the camera today, but you just pull her up to sitting. We'll do it one more time for the camera. Hey little girl! Hi! Thank you. Come on up. I'm stabilizing the pelvis, just to give her a little bit more support. Good girl! And then from here just letting her finish it off. What a good job! You did so super! That is pull sit with one hand. Thanks a lot! See you later!
