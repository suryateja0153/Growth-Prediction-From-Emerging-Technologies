 from Yorktown Heights New York it's the queue coverings IBM cloud innovation be brought to you by IBM I welcome back I'm Peter verse of the cube and we're having conversations here at the IBM innovation day the Thomas J Watson Research Lab in Yorktown Heights New York we've got a great conversation Don boliya is the general manager of cloud developer services at IBM welcome to the cube Don thank you very much I said welcome back to the John yes thank you so Don we were talking with one of your colleagues Harry hunter who's the CTO of here at the cloud infrastructure team and about the fact that we everybody is talking about the rate of growth of data and nobody's really discussing the rate of growth of software which is perhaps even more important ultimately to business what is that rate of growth look like and how is it related to the role of cloud yes that's a great question I mean with my role as kind of owner of our platform services from the cloud perspective one of the things we've noticed over the last probably five or 10 years is just a massive rate and pace change with respect to iteration on the software development cycle so they started with mobile I would say and then is moved to cloud since then where you know the expectation is everything is updating all the time you know every day all times of the day within our own kubernetes and container service as an example we push over 500 updates a week to that software stack on behalf of our customers and so I think there's a rate and pace of how things are changing from that perspective but then there's also the fact that everybody's leveraging those services to then build the next generation of software so in our in our case we have a set of base services that I provide for things like containers that then the Watson team for example uses to build their micro services which are then you know realized as machine learning and and other types of services that they provide so you see this stacking of software if you will from you know the high iteration rate at the bottom all the way to the next level in the next level and and the ability to unlock value now is something that happens and you know hours in some cases or a couple of days whereas before just provisioning the software would have taken months and so we're really seeing just a whole change in the way people can develop things and how quickly they can get to the end result now we're here at the Thomas J Watson research lab and downstairs is this wall of all IBM fellows and one of them was EF Cod the famous originator of database and the role that sequel play etc and relational database technology he wrote a seminal paper back in the early 1970s about how the the notion of developer was going to evolve over time he might have been a little aggressive in thinking that we were gonna end up with these citizens of developers then we actually happened but we are seeing the role of developer changing and we are seeing new classes of professionals become more developer light how is that relationship changing the way that we think of developer developer services that you serve yeah it's a great question I think first of all software is is sort of invading almost every single industry and so you know people have got to have some amount of those skills to be able to function and in kind of the optimal way for whatever industry they're in so what we're seeing is that as we've built more and more foundational services the act of actually creating something new is more about stitching together composing orchestrating a set of things as opposed to really building from scratch everything from the ground up and you know things like our Watson services are a great example right the ability to tap into something like that with a couple lines of code in an hour as opposed to what would have taken you know months years whatever and even really frankly been out of the reach of most developers to begin with is now something you can have somebody come in and do you know with a fairly low level of skill and get a good result on the outside so we've got more demand for code as we move to general business more people participating in that process cloud also enables past a lot of new classes of tools are going to increase the productivity including automated code generation how is the process how is that tool set evolving especially as it pertains to the cloud yeah so I think one of the mantras of cloud is automation and in order to standardize and automate that's really how you get to the kind of scale that we would see and say a public cloud like like the IBM cloud so it really is kind of a fundamental premise of anything you do has to be something that you automate and so we've seen a whole class of tools to your point really start to emerge which allow people to get that kind of you know automated capability so nobody thinks of for example creating a you know a build pipeline these days without using a set of tools you know often they're open source tools and and there's a lot of choice within that whole spectrum of tools and we support a bunch of different varieties but you would never think today of having a build process that isn't totally automated right that can't be instantly recreated even the whole process of how you deploy code in a cloud these days is sort of an assumption that you can destroy that and restart at any point and in order to do that you really need the automation behind that so I think it's a base premise now I don't think you can really be at the velocity the people are expecting out of software without having a totally automated process to go through that so any digital business strategy presumes a date as an asset and things that are related to data are assets including software might are we going software is data when you come right down to it and we want to exploit that data and generate new sources of value out of that data and that's one of the predicates digital business but at the same time we also want to protect that that those attributes of data that are our IP our enterprises distinction as we move forward with software how do we reconcile that tension between more openness and generating a community that's capable of improving things while at the same time ensuring that we've got good control over our IP where it actually does create a business differentiation no that's right and you're right data is king so you know the software can do you know a set of things but most of the time its operating on a set of data and that data is where the true value that you can unlock comes from our policy from an IBM perspective has always been that you know your data is yours and and your to your point in its IP that you that you may want to protect and we try to give you the tools to do that and so a lot of our philosophy within the cloud in particular is around things like bring your own key where you have control of the keys that encrypt that data that's in the cloud in fact we would like to be totally out of that loop quite frankly and have it be something that is controlled by by our and that they can you know get the value they're looking for and so we'll never have a situation where one of our services is is you know using or acting on data that that is really you know not ours to use and so that's been a fundamental premise of the cloud as we go forward and and again we continue to provide a set of tools that really let you manage that and to your point you know not everything gets managed at the same level some things are highly protected and therefore have all you know layers and layers of security policy around them there's other examples where you know you're you're relatively able to make that open through a set of API is for example and let everybody have access to it from our perspective though that's really a client choice and so for us it's about giving the right tools so that they can do the job they need to do February 2019 San Francisco IBM's taking over San Francisco with the IBM think show what types of conversations are you looking forward to having with customers what excites you about the 2019 version yeah so I mean it's it's a great venue it is absolutely you know something that I look forward to every year I know my team looks forward to it as well I mean the amount of interaction we get with clients I mean it's really all about the clients stories so you know what are they able to do in my case with with our cloud services what can I learn about what they've done and and how you know can we then leverage that to to make our services better and so you know to me it's it's all about you know what you can learn from others and it's a great forum to be able to do that and there's a lot of great things that you know you can dive deep on you get access to a lot of the IBM technical experts so I have all of my you know fellows and distinguished engineers they're you know on hand and and just great conversations there's all those great insights that you get from it highly recommended done boliya IBM general manager of cloud developer services thanks very much for being on with you thank you once again we'll be back from IBM innovation day here at Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights talk to you soon
