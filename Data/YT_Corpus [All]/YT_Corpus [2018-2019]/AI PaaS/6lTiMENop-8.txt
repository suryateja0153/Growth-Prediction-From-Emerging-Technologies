 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my co-instructor, Myla. She is sitting independently, and I want to challenge her sitting balance. In the clinic, I would start working on therapy balls, putting her on balls and bouncing her  around and putting her on therapy swings and swinging her and challenging her balance. But I really wanted to make these videos things that anybody could do anywhere. So everybody's got a sheet or a blanket or something. If you'll set them on the blanket, put something soft. I've used pillows. We are going to challenge her balance with movement in a really simple way. I am going to hop up. I am going to pull her along on the blanket. (sound effect) You can start off slow. You can go faster. You can go wilder. You can start shaking and wiggling. I am going to pull you back again, so you can be on camera. The acceleration and deceleration is what challenges children. Most kids love this game...yes... love this game. They think it's so fun to get to go for a ride. It is great from a sensory perspective, and it's great for challenging balance when a kid is exactly this skill level. We are all done. That's a simple idea that you can use at home. Thanks a lot! Bye-bye!
