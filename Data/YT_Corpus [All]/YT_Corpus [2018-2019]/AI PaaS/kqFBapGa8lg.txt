 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm a pediatric physical therapist. I'm here with Myla. Hi! We are going to try a  take two of the treadmill. She just turned one year old. So, we are going to just see how it goes. I'm going to try with shoes off. One, the shoes we had were kind of slippery. And two, with barefoot, you have a little bit more foot input. So we're just going to try. Alright. So, we've got the treadmill going at 0.5 miles an hour. It is the slowest it goes. I am going to squat in front of her. Then I am going to turn her around. We are going to see if I can in one minute (which I am going to start any moment now) if I can get 10 steps. Hey! Hi! There you go... What is going on here? Oh, Myla! Oh, Myla. One, Whoa, Myla. OK.One, two-ish Three. There you go, Myla. There you go! Four-ish. Five-ish.Hi! I know.   It's still a little bit tricky. Oh! You are being a very good sport. Yes, I hear you. I am getting sometimes a a little step with left and a right step to. She's much closer than she was before, but this still looks exquisitely tricky. There you go! Good girl. Okay, okay okay okay. Oh! There we go. Let me sit down where the camera can see me. That was trial two at 12 months of treadmill walking. We'll try again another time. Thanks! Bye! (Pant, pant)
