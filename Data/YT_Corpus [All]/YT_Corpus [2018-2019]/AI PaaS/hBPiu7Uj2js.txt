 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm a pediatric physical therapist. I'm here with my co-instructor. Her name is Myla. She has low tone and Down syndrome. We'are going to do sit-ups on a ball. The ball could be a little bigger and a little bouncier here. But this works. This works. It's a good way to have a dynamic surface to work on trunk control/ sitting balance. I'm going to do sit-ups on the ball. So I'm going to ..YAY! ...I am going to bring her back... Ummm... that would be the other direction, back here. I will let her rest on my forearms and then try to get her to sit on up. Yahooo! So I am using my elbows in to keep her from falling all the way back and then she sits up. My elbows are in. I hold down her legs and she... Oh My! You have got to sit up...Sit up... There you go. So, it is just a way to work on.... good girl... abdominal strength on a ball. Way to go Sweet Pea. You want to tell them Bye! Bye! Oh! That's right! Bye! I think I see you later! Oh! Bye!
