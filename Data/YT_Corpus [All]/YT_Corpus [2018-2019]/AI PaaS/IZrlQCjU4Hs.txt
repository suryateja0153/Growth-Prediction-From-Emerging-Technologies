 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm here with my co-instructor, Myla, who just turned a year old. It's a big time now. Oh! We're going to try standing. It's something we worked a lot on the last time I visited her. So, I'm just going to pick her up and try to put her down standing and see what happens. Yes! You! You ready? (Sound effect) The last time, I may play a clip of her last time, she didn't want to put her feet down at all. Here  she's at least willing to have her feet down on the floor. I would say she might have 10% of her weight through her legs. So, she needs a little bit more support. I'm just going to do a simple one where I trap her feet and stand her up  with a little bit more support. Oh! She thinks it's rude. She's really pushing through her legs and nicely. I think last time I really had a block at her knees. Now she's pushing those legs straight herself. Sorry for pulling up your dress. Sorry! That's a big change too since the last time. You are doing a great job standing with weight through your legs. Yes, okay, So that's a simple way to work on standing when they're not wanting to weight bear on their own. You can just block your legs and help hold them standing. If they need more help block at the knees too (whispering: But she doesn't need that anymore) Thanks Bye-bye!
