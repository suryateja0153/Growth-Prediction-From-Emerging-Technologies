 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist with about 30 years of clinical practice. I'm here with my good friend, Myla, who is my co-instructor. I'm teaching ways to work on lower extremity strength. One of the things with children with Down syndrome or low tone is they tend to keep their legs out really wide. It's useful for a period of development to help find ways to help let them practice gross motor skills with their legs in. So I have made in about three minutes a set of figure eight straps. That is what I call them. I've made straps out of therafoam to go around each of her thighs. Let me hold you up sweet pea. One that goes around one leg and one that goes around the other leg. They are velcroed on the side. I've tied them off in the center. Now I like this way because they could pop off...on and off for diaper changes. If she was to keep this set, I'd cut the tails on this knot a little bit. They can go underneath clothes a little bit more easily, but help hold the legs in and help hold socks half on and half off (I'm joking). So if she was wanting to have her legs a lot wider this would help hold her legs in again. It's something I would recommend using a couple hours a day just to practice gross motor skills with her legs in. If she had a big tendency to have her legs out much wider. I do them starting if it's blocking rolling and up through starting to crawl. Once they start to crawl I stop using them because it's a little bit harder to crawl if your legs stuck in together. So it's a simple idea I use therafoam...theraplush... but it can really be made out of anything. Thanks a lot! It's a simple idea I hope you can use it. Bye!
