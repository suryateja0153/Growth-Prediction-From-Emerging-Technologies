 [Music] hello welcome to this session which we will be talking about migrating apps to the cloud and we have a question to you that's systemic or random and my name is mamoon Halle I'm a principal cloud architect with Accenture's Google Center of Excellence and I'll be joined with my colleague Greg what Greg buck scamper who will be talking to us also through parts of the presentation an important one as well so let me spend a minute talk about the session overview and what we're trying to accomplish as part of this session the first part that we are going to talk about is talk about the business priorities and challenges with migrating apps to the cloud and talk about what do you need to do when you start this journey of migrating your existing workloads from either on-prem or existing cloud provider to Google and then as part of this process Greg will walk us through Accenture's approach for the cloud migration so that would be the first part that we spend on on this particular presentation then I'll take the presentation and talk specifically about what are the tools and the best practices that we do as part of specifically moving these workloads into Google cloud platform and then on the third part we will spend some time talking about some experiences and sharing some lessons learned from existing client examples that we have helped in migrating to the cloud so with that in mind I'll hand it over to my colleague here and who will talk who will walk you through the first part of the presentation hi good morning my name is Craig buck scamper I'm one of the leaders in Accenture journey to cloud practice and that's really our vendor agnostic component and so you'll hear me talk a lot more about process and methodologies Wallman moon is going to talk about specific examples and technologies so when when our clients start to talk about moving to cloud there's this this temptation that we see of clients looking to say there's all kinds of technical problems technical debt and issues that I need to resolve before I move and when I move to cloud I want to take advantage full advantage of all of the capabilities and features that cloud has to offer and what we see is that can lead to problems so as an example one of my clients which is a oil and gas conglomerate basically they looked at at their environment and they said we need to fix all of our Active Directory issues we need to fix several security issues and we want to take all of our applications to pass cloud if I everything and about two two and a half years later they basically had nothing to show for it because they're just stuck so in that case greed is not good when we start to think about planning we have to look at the the ideal situation in the situation in the real world and in an in the ideal situation every application would be fully standalone the application stack would be fully standalone so you have an isolated application server web server database server be no interaction and then even if you peel away the technology the user communities would be completely separate there'd be no interaction you had no no interaction or no conflicts with other business priorities or other initiatives but we all know that's not the case so the reality of the situation is everything that that we all work on is very much intertwined right you have shared database servers you have shared web farms you you have application teams that are focused on several priorities across different applications and you have to work around those things those are all things that we have to address when we're thinking about migration planning so if we talked about planning it's really not a binary situation it really is a spectrum and on the far left-hand bookend of that you really have this this concept of just throw stuff on the truck and move it and and that's really you know you walk in the door you grab a few things or you grab your entire your your entire portfolio of applications and servers and you move it and then you just see what happens and what we see we actually do have some clients that try to do this on their own and what we see it happens is they don't understand the impacts they experience major issues during the migration problems with latency problems with application and GUI performance and ultimately their their migration loses momentum because they lose the support of the business in the user community on the other end of the spectrum is that really the scientific approach and it's this concept of must understand everything about the applications and the servers before you move them and quite frankly that's just as bad as the concept of throw everything on the truck because you can really get stuck in that analysis paralysis mode and not want to move until you have perfect information and so the goal is to find somewhere in between that suits your organization in your migration approach one of the next things that we need to talk about is we look at migration planning is what are your business drivers for migrating to cloud when we first started migrating to cloud a few years ago really the drivers were all around these concepts of cost savings and efficiency get things into the cloud where we can size for average utilization we don't have to size for peak start to make use of that as a service capability turn things off and on is needed but now as we look into cloud there's many more business drivers and values that you can get out of that the IT agility and the innovation and ultimately the business growth and business agility so we're moving beyond IT cost to to IT kind of generating revenue to really cloud driving business revenue and you have to take that into account as you do your planning one example think about it that is a as a retail client that we had originally had started to look at cost savings that was their primary driver but when they got into it they realized they could start to take advantage of the the analytics and machine learning capabilities and really immediately jumped to getting this business growth and business agility so again those those are some of the factors you need to think about so you'll hear us talk about the the different steps and the different data points that we think you need to collect when you drain migration planning and planning really - a lot of people is is all about what date are we going to migrate things and and we would argue that you also need to think about how are you going to migrate it what approach are you wanting to take and and really don't think about that is one approach for your entire migration think about that on a per application basis so there's really a ladder or a curve here of effort versus benefit and the the the first adoption or migration method is really this concept of data center consolidation or basic capabilities and this would be moving applications and servers primarily to to consolidate your data centers like you'll hear people moving to cloud just the dr environment or you may hear them move content to part of the content delivery network in order to take off some of the capacity out of their existing structure the next step up in that is to just do is lift and shift migrations so just take your existing applications with minimal configuration changes and adjustments and move them into cloud as is and then you continue to ramp up and you get into a little bit of transformation moving to containers and other technologies like that or you can do full-blown transformation and really recode or refactor your application and take full advantage of all of you all of the features and capabilities that cloud has to has to offer and like I said one of the things to think about here is that each application you can really pick and choose here if you have an application that that is verily is not maintained but is heavily used for certain periods of the month that really makes sense from a lift and shift perspective you're not going to get a lot of benefit out of refactoring and recoating that application whereas on the far other end of the spectrum if you an application that's driving a lot of business there's a lot of data coming going it's very actively developed that's going to make a lot of sense to think about a transformation approach and go through the effort and work to transform that application and recode it from scratch potentially ok so as we start to talk about migration methodology there's really four challenges that we're trying to overcome in the migration when we think about planning the first is understanding the inventory a lot of people struggle to understand what are all of the servers they have in their in their environment what are all of the applications that they have in their environment and then now that really leads us into the next step which is sorry the next challenge which is understanding the dependencies between those which applications use which servers which ones are divided out into your different environments between your non production in your production environments and then probably more importantly for migration and dealing with some of the additional network latency that we take on when we move to cloud is is understanding these application to application interfaces so when you move one application what's the impact going to be to the end-user experience and is the application still going to be functional and then on the backend what's the impact to batch and those kind of things the third challenge there is is around optimizing these repeated efforts if you're moving more than a few hundred servers there's a there's a script or a process that you're going to want to follow and and that's one of the reasons we talk about these different migration patterns and you want to be as efficient in that process as possible and have the same script that you're executing over and over you don't want every migration to be a snowflake that you have to figure things out every time in the last piece that we're last challenge that we're trying to address in in planning is really understanding your resourcing needs every organization that I know of is resource constrained and you have to figure out how to work through that and how you do that is one of the ways that you address that is with proper planning and laying that out laying out your different move types across your schedule so that you can predict what your resource requirements are going to be one of the reasons that that that we like our methodology for for planning these migrations is that we really take a business driven approach to this so you'll hear of some migrations being very server centric they talk in and they'll just pick up some servers and move them and and I would argue that's that's a recipe for disaster that's gonna cause problems straight away if you walk in and you begin working with the business and then go downward top-down you should see a lot more success when you're doing your planning so you start by talking with the business understanding which business units want to migrate to make sure they understand the the value of that and then naturally you should start to see business units that are early adopters or groups even within business units that are early adopters and some business units that that want to migrate later or last from there then you can start to dive in to their applications the different environments get to your your servers and your shared infrastructure so this is really the the guts of our migration planning process and there we go so it starts on the left-hand side and that's with understanding your application inventory and I think it's probably well understood that you need to understand what all the applications are in your environment and you need to from a technology perspective but you'll also benefit if you'll start to understand both also the the business view of the application when is it used how's it used how many users components like security if you do have a little bit of technical debt that you want to address understanding that those kind of components and then same same situation on the infrastructure side what are our what are all of those servers in your environment what operating system are they running what operating system and that's particularly - you know if if the OS is not supported in your future state environment or you want to use the opportunity to upgrade but collecting that kind of information from there then you're starting to build that mapping or those linkages between the servers and the applications and again that's that's both the application to server which is one part of it but probably the more important part of that and the more difficult part is that application to application mapping you have to understand those interfaces so that when you pick them up and move them you may have the same thing you move the highly coupled applications together at the same time and maintain that in user usability so then once you map those infrastructure to applications and applications to applications then you need to go through the process of identifying the move approach and that's back to determining which of those applications are going to are going to get the value of cloud and to what extent so if you're if you want to assign the lift I as lift and shift if you want to do or refactoring or containerization need to do all of that thinking or at least an initial pass during the migration planning phase then once you have that mapping and those that move approach then you take that mapping and you use that to create your bundles and bundles or move groups and in our methodology the the bundle is really the atomic unit or the smallest unit of applications and servers that can move at the same time so you know that as you're talking about doing a move you know that bundle that group of servers and applications all has to move together if there's a problem it all moved back together and likewise when you start to think about waves to us a wave this is just a date so it's a bun a wave is a collection of bundles on a date so then once you have that bundle or those atomic units of servers and applications that need to move at the same time to preserve that end user experience then you can put them on the schedule and that schedule really starts with a a strawman or a framework of what are your possible move dates and you typically we we see certain dates fall out because of month in physical clothes freeze periods having to do with either busy times of the year or with holiday seasons you can also start to see components of the schedule fall out for particular business units or particular application teams because of other campaigns or other initiatives they have going on but that's where you place those bundles on those move dates and then once you have that you have a fairly robust schedule at that point that you can use for resource estimation in those kinds of things so how we handle this from an Accenture standpoint is we actually have have built instantiated our methodology into a tool called accelerate for cloud and accelerate for cloud really is a is a workflow tool when we looked at the the tooling environment so there's a lot of great tools out there to drive these migrations but they're technical tools right there they're good tools for taking the servers and the applications and getting them up into the cloud it's not really a lot of good tools to drive the work behind the migration and drive all the tasks and so we have this tool called accelerate for cloud and it takes us all the way from that inventory stage where you load in the inventory and then you start to match and map it it takes us through an application questionnaire process where we ask the we load it up with information from a CMDB other spreadsheets and any other data sources that are possible and then that gets passed back to the application owners to validate that information and plug in other things that we need for the migration and then from there we can use that to drive the schedule we use it to check our bundles so it actually keeps track of all the mappings that we've identified and the interfaces between applications and then we can use that to validate and make sure that we've accommodated all those interfaces as we're putting the bundles together and then it turns out a number of reports that allows us to take reports back to the business and say here's when all of your applications are migrating go to individual owners so here's the different events that you'll have is that good or bad based on your scenario in situation and then ultimately it drives through to the final migration which is beyond planning but it gets us down into 15-minute increments during the actual migration where we can track the migration of hundreds of servers at a time can you hear me guys okay great alright so that was an important part of the migration that usually gets forgotten in many small and medium type of companies who may think that just because I can take an image or a server and move it to Google cloud platform that basically means the majority of my job is done and reality is far far far from that and I'm going to start looking at some of the more details so Greg gave you the twenty thousand foot view I'm going now down to about a thousand foot view you talked about how we can do some of this in GCP and what are the implications and things that you need to be aware of and what type of some of the adoption patterns that we see as we talk to our customers in the field so there are customers who basically still insist on the fact that we still want to do it on our own right and for those who are insisting to do it on their own basically all the things that Greg talked about whether that's the planning figuring out the inventory the mapping the bundling the scheduling all of that that basically goes back to your lab right and if you were to look at these type of activities here whether it's assessment planning or the networking scheduling or their application or whatever additional activities that you need to do you need to take a deep look within your organization say do I have the capability the skills the time and willing to assume the risk if I were to do that on my own all right so that's key question you need to think about as part of your taking that upon yourself to go and do it from A to Z so that's just something to point out because there are still these folks out in the field that they think they can do it from A to Z on their own without looking at it from a holistic type of perspectives and understanding what are the implications of the app migration type of process now if you were to look at where Google can help I'm sure many of you have looked at the Google cloud platform and that's why you're here trying to look at well what are the tools the things that would help me as part of the migration process so if we were to look at this slide basically to presents different consumption models and the things that are the typical suspects for migrating to the cloud so when you look at infrastructure as a service platform as a service in SAS different companies will be a different end of the spectrum and some companies may be at all ends of the spectrum when it comes to these type of consumption models so from Google's perspective we have different type of constructs or capabilities that would allow you to say okay well in terms of SAS one of the key things that we look at is Google Cloud storage and that's one that we want to basically just try to get our data on it start doing some backups that's a recovery and all of these type of things past perspective we have lots of constructs that would help you to get there as well in terms of the data that would be required to be migrated with these type of apps and these are some of the constructs without its cloud SQL datastore BigTable bigquery spanner doesn't matter all of these things are managed for you and they can be used as part of the migration and if you're looking to import or export data from SAS type of applications you can leverage the services of data flow that would allow you to do that from application perspective you have different set of options as well so if you're starting with IAS you have compute type of capabilities with the GCE Google compute engine type of capabilities and you have also the ability to leverage containers as part of the process and then you also have from pass perspective if you don't want to go and and fiddle with that you can look at it and say okay well I want to have the ability to just not worry about that and leverage things that are already procured for me and that's where you leverage Google App Engine and kubernetes comes somewhere in between between the two and certainly Apogee comes into the picture because if you want to monetize or provide these type of API interfaces to your applications that's where Apogee can be part of the process now what are the migrations that we see in the field when it comes to GCP let's start with a simple case the simplest of cases is Google Cloud Storage so this is basically somebody is trying to do backup disaster recovery or somebody may have a static website that only contains at this point you know just watch the HTML and and some JavaScript that basically what you can do we can just migrate all your content into Google Cloud storage its global it's replicated content is accessible through URI you can point the DNS to it the whole website can be up and running in minutes so that's something that you can do if you want to leverage see the ends you can also look at the ones that Google has partnered with that makes you even more faster type of access to it and caching at the edge of the network if you are saying well okay that's too simple for me I have more complex stuff and that's where you can start looking at the Google compute engine and we start looking at well what type of rogue capabilities and power that Google cloud platform brings to the table right so that's where you start looking at different type of machines that are available to you whether it's Linux Windows and and live migration from Google as part of the process or you can look at it from I have standard machines that are available to you out of the box I need something that's completely different because I'm special you can still go and do that create the amount of CPUs and RAM for you and the storage that caters to your need rather than using what Google Offers out of the box you can have the ability to create custom images and you can take snapshots you can make these snapshots available to other people in different projects you can also create or deploy a container image as part of VCE so if you have built your containers you can deploy them directly on on VMs from Google as part of the process and you have the ability to procure up to 160 cores I just check that in the console to see what's the maximum because that number changes so you have up to 160 cores four terabytes of RAM and up to 64 64 terabytes of storage that are available to you and on top of all of that you get all the benefits of elastic type of capabilities are to scale up up scale down monitoring all of these things that you get as part of Google cloud platform on the other end of the spectrum you might come and say you know what I don't have the patience to deal with all of this I want something that's much easier I just want to go my developers go give me a Java environment and they want to start thing I don't want to fiddle with IAS and do any of this machine setup or any of that great so that's where Google App Engine comes into the picture as part of the process you have two flavors of Google App Engine you have the Flex and standard standard pretty much the same they're both fully managed type of environments they're auto-scaling they're virgin as part of the process flex gives you more capabilities than what standard offers standard offers four languages flex offers you four plus two and any type of language environment that you want to add because you can incorporate this as part of your process you have the ability to do the the all of these type of environments are backed up for you using the datastore SQL or GCS cloud storage that are available out of the box the auto scale to zero for the standard part so basically you can use it for free if you build it up and nobody's using it you don't have to pay for it for the step for the Flex it scales down to one so somebody would have to pay for that if nobody's using it and flex also gives you additional capabilities like root access if you want to where you don't have that as part of standard and if you're coming and saying well that's great but I'm a company who is running significant type of workloads that are running on my own Prem and they're taking significant amount of time to be processed can Google help me with that of course they can and that's where we start doing the burst out type of mode in hyper type of clouds where you can provide some connectivity between you and Google there are many options you can do VPN direct interconnect peering and you can use the Google cloud power to get some of this type of workloads move to the cloud let them run when you're done they scale down and you don't pay for additional work that you don't have to and you don't have to procure any of the infrastructure or your on-prem and you don't have to worry about that ok now I procured all this infrastructure nobody's using it right so that's a good option for those type of companies who may be interested in that entry point as part of Google cloud platform so there are many options for you look at your potential use cases what you want to do out of that and select the right path and for you and look at it from a holistic perspective as well and you can look at it from a tactical perspective if that is the only thing that you want to look at and continue with that now as we look at GCP migration and type of objectives right there are many stations along the way where customers look at it and say well okay my objective from moving to the cloud is really about you know I want to have my dev environment or my whole infrastructure on on Google cloud because I think it's the right platform for me from dev testing and production that would be one option for customers looking into it other customers may come and say you know what I all just want to use it for disaster recovery backup or others saying you know we heard that you have great tools and capabilities around big data and machine learning and that becomes the primary objective of moving to the cloud so it it really all depends on you what you want to do with it but for for this particular example that I'm trying to explain here is this is a company whose primary objective was to accelerate app delivery and leverage Google cloud platform to do that and what type of capabilities that Google offers to you in this type of realm right so I talked about the the the GCE type of components and the fact that we have Jake EE as well in terms of kubernetes and the fact that we have these wonderful clusters that kubernetes can allow you to spin and scale up and scale down automatically you have also the ability for the container builder so if you want to build containers on GCP you have the ability to do that and if you don't want to use docker hub you have an alternative that is provided to you through the container registry on Google cloud platform you have the ability to leverage App Engine as part of the process and just announce the cloud build is also one of these tools that you can use and look into as part of the arsenal for building or accelerating your app delivery on the cloud you can also have the ability to import VMs take snapshots images and do anything you want to with that plus the availability of all these container optimized operating systems that are available to you out of the box from other customers who may come look at it and say okay well my destination is really machine learning in AI because there are many things that would would be beneficial to me from my particular use case and with machine learning in AI I think you know one of the key things just to remember and keep in mind is to sort the hi prom from fax and and the first thing you need to do whether it's Google cloud platform any other type of cloud provider is to understand what are the real use cases that you're trying to accomplish right lots of companies right now are saying we want to do machine learning yeah I without fully understanding what does that mean or without fully selecting the right use cases and having the right data in order to get to machine learning so once you put that aside you have the right data you have the right use cases you've done your homework now what Google cloud platform can help me as part of that and we have tons of capabilities but it all starts with the basics right the basic is basically getting your data to Google cloud and we have lots of tools from Google perspective that allows me to cater to structured and unstructured type of data allow me to cater to OLTP or OLAP type of loads so it really depends on you what what is the right platform or construct for you to get the data to Google cloud once you make these type of decisions you start looking at what type of tools that are available to me in terms of you know I want to use the Google transfer service or I want to use gsutil or I want to use any of these providers that offer the transfer type of capabilities to me as part of the process so there are many options to you and in in previous session I talked about these options in detail and data migration to cloud it's the whole session about that so cannot cover all of it but but these are part of the key decisions that you need to make as you start in this particular journey to machine learning and then you also have the ability to do the cloud native support for Hadoop and that's in the form of data proc and they just announced the auto scaling of data clusters which is a great thing to do it's in beta right now but it soon will be in in GA and that would allow you to automatically scale up scale down in these type of clusters as you move or your Hadoop workloads into Google cloud platform and then we have the best of breed and ethics and machine learning tensorflow is the number one adopted open-source tool for machine learning it's open sourced by google right it has been used in google for a long time it's number one adopted and we have the bre built models the perception api's and the auto ml type of capabilities that are available to you plus from exploration and and analysis you have the data studio data labs and Google Analytics 360 that are part of the mix of the tools that you need to look into as you migrate or your destination becomes the machine learning now a question that always comes up you know as I move to the cloud you know lots of companies or lots of individuals think that your architecting is is one of those sexy things that I have to have when I migrate to the cloud and the answer is not necessarily true because there are lots of statistics that show that there is value in lift and shift so I really don't have to just react attacked my applications to the cloud to gain the benefits of the cloud there are cases you know where it makes a lot of sense to go and reaaargh attack the whole application or portions of the application so that you could leverage these type of things but I think you know one of the key things that you need to look at am i as an organization equipped with the right tools and skills to take on such an endeavor right so three architecting and and going into microservices pattern and all of that stuff and the impact on devops and how you go from regular monolith type of systems into suddenly micro services and and how that impacts the whole organization is not a trivial one so you need to be really aware of the implications of doing that and once you cross that barrier then yes you're architecting could be a great thing to do for the right use cases for the right situations in this type of example that I show here this happens to be an insurance company they had a great algorithm for underwriting risk however that algorithm was not taken into consideration some of the additional data that's coming from different sources and they wanted to do something with it so what to do with that so they said okay there are certain pieces that can be refactored or we can start looking at that data incorporated and then I can create an API so that other components of the business could leverage that new type of functionality and the architect thing made sense in this particular example right so it really depends on your situation now a question comes up also with the GCP migration tools from Google what's out-of-the-box for me if you were to go to a project in Google and you look at import VM you will be provided with two options cloud indoor and velocerator May 2018 just about two months ago Google announced that they are acquiring well-off strata and it would become a Google company in the coming month or so there are many sessions on villa strata but the primary differentiator between the two cloud indoor is a block level type of migration so if you have an application with 10 terabytes 100 terabytes it's a block level migration that means the whole thing needs to be migrated and it cannot be operated until everything gets migrated to the cloud Velo strata on the other hand allows you to split the storage from compute and it migrates the compute to the cloud and it allows you to execute on the compute part while it reaches out to the data that's still in the on-prem type of situation and then silently it migrates the data streams it into the cloud and if something goes wrong you can roll it back and and stays where it is so it's pretty neat type of concept as part of the process on average it's about 10 minutes for migrating images there is an example on YouTube or they migrate SugarCRM in about 11 minutes and it's pretty impressive now I'll just go back and and and remind you of what Greg mentioned earlier greed is not good right because you know you can come and say ok well if it's that easy let's go and start migrating no the answer is not that I'm not trying to say that yes it's easy and nice but all the things that Greg have talked about you know the dependencies the infrastructure all of that and here are things that you need to look at as part of your migration you know it's like as you start where this where are these VMs going what is my project structure am i creating one project multiple projects 10 projects right what am i doing about my network and VPC and IP management is that happening on its own or somebody doing it for me what are my DevOps practices how my developers and engineers are going to do when these images are suddenly backing up and how do I get images what where do I store them right all of these things are important identity and access management are you creating the groups what type of groups what type of roles you know moving from unprimed to a cloud type of model are there any things that you need to do certainly yes and then you have to look at from security perspective firewall rules routes etc what's happening there what ports you need to open which applications are talking to which applications and finally you know who is going to manage all of that are you going to leveraged a key driver and what capacity what are you going to do with the logs what type of dashboard things intelligence that you're going to glean out of that I'm not trying to make it very hard but I'm just giving you a dose of reality in terms of you know when you migrate there are many considerations to consider as part of the process and all the things that Greg have talked about that's the prep work that needs to happen before you start putting and importing that VM certainly you need to start with a POC start in baby steps see how the process works get some comfort level as part of the process and then you can look at much grander type of journey into migrating process down the road so with that I'll hand it back over to my colleague Greg and who will walk you through example then I will finish the last two examples so as we look at some of these client examples we talked about some of the questions you'd ask and I think the technical questions are all pretty apparent to us but we would also recommend you think about a different line of questioning around some business questions and really some some project management type questions and I think you'll see how these kind of played out in the client examples that we're going to go through but first and foremost to kind of shape your migration plan and how you approach planning should talk to your your the IT and and business on you know what are the primary reasons for moving to cloud is it just cost savings or are you trying to get some of the additional agility and innovation and business growth out of that and what are the expected outcomes again those those questions are gonna drive some overall themes and help you understand if your plan is going to accomplish those and then from a project management perspective you really want to think about you know how fast are you wanting to move to cloud is that what what does that mean from a pace so if you if you want to be done in in six months and you have 2,000 servers can you actually do that many servers every month do you have the capacity to do that or do you need to look at changing some factor there what's the budget that'll tell you you know if your if your plan comes back and tells you that it's all refactoring and you know it's gonna take you thousands of hours per application you probably don't have the right plan and then the other the last couple they're just going to tie into into those so the first client example here is it's a leading marketer and distributor of beverages and this is an organization that had about a thousand servers it was a mix of Windows as well as some proprietary AIX and an eye series that drove a significant part of the business process and from a business perspective they were looking to get away from their heavy assets and they were looking to offload everything from their data center to bottling plants and really shut down some capability within this one particular business unit and so how that played out into their migration plan is it ended up being basically a lift and shipped migration of about 500 servers just a regular I as migration but then they looked at those proprietary platforms and for the AIX they did the the business case and they said that's worth transforming so they didn't have to pay AIX and and some of the middleware service charges going forward and so they moved about a hundred hundred fifty servers that way and then they looked at the iSeries we looked at a couple of different things to do with that and ultimately they said it's too important and we don't want to invest a lot of money in this and so they kept that separate and in a Colo and then as you would expect and anytime you got any through through a large transformation about 200 servers that just fell off because of decommissioning not being used anymore so why overall it was a success and we did a significant amount of planning there were some lessons to be learned here and this is the initial migration plan and then the actual migration plan as it went through evolutions and so you can see that red dashed line on the left hand side that was the original migration plan and then in parallel the the company was executing an s AP moved to cloud as well and ran into some problems there that sucked up resources that we needed to use for the non s AP migration and so that shifted out now the interesting thing here is why we did have to replan because we had collected all of the constraint information and some of the other business and project management information when we did the plan we were able to replan in the course of just a few days take that back to the business and application team say does this work for you they signed off and then we started to execute again and then you'll see that we didn't then we had to replant one more time the other thing that was going on as they were shifting their network management to another provider and that ended up causing some problems with the network delays and connections and those kind of things and again we had to go back to the drawing board but we were going to do that very quickly because we already had all the data collected and we were able to lay that out again so one of our arguments here is certainly need to do pretty good planning but there's you're at a certain point you lack you won't have control over some of the parallel initiatives and you're going to get influenced but if you're planning data is good if you collected the right information you can adjust and pivot to that very quickly thank you okay so let's walk through our second example and that's financial and healthcare services company and that company basically they wanted to migrate certain number of applications for a conference and they wanted to do it fast so it's right from the get-go do this quickly right and the assumption is you know we have done the homework around which applications we want to migrate because these are the ones that we needed and the candidates were provided to us as part of this process you know you need to look at it and say okay well are these the right applications before you start the migration process because yes the customer may come and tell you these are the applications that I want to migrate one of the key things that you need to ask what are the dependencies are these applications standalone can they function on their own or there are other dependencies that you can so if I go and flip the switch from A to Z and then these applications once they go to the cloud is that okay or there are other things that I need to worry about turns out that one of these applications was not the right application to migrate because there were lots of dependencies that they were not aware of right so even though that the customer is the one who recommended what type of application to migrate they were not aware of hundred percent of these type of dependencies and that's very common it's not every company that know everything there are lots of people who know or write this application without eelain's documentation and doing something that you may not be aware of so just pay attention to that as part of the process so what we did we end up doing we we designed the right secure architecture for them in Google cloud platform we did our due diligence when it comes to these type of applications and we selected the right metaphors from Google's to migrate them and the applications were migrated and the project was a success from key lessons learned perspective is trying to understand what type of workloads in general so I'm going to talk in general here about workload prioritization so some companies may come and tell you well what is the criteria for workload prioritization some companies may approach it from the fact that you know from TPS per second transactions per second so the more TPS per second most likely that application is more of a mission-critical right and that becomes a less likelihood candidate that you need to migrate first so that's one of those things that you probably want to put towards the middle or the bottom of the list because depending on the mission criticality if something goes wrong business may be disrupted so you may want to start with the ones that are more simple right the ones that has less interfaces the ones that may not impact the business and a significant analytical workloads are typically one of these workloads that you can prioritize to the cloud because what you can do with that you can learn a lot from learning from moving these type of applications to the cloud and and seeing what type of lessons learned and what type of skills you have in place so that you can adjust for the next mission-critical type of migrations as part of the process the other lessons learned is skills I think you know if you are in the job market and looking for somebody who knows Google cloud platform very well you don't find many of these people in the marketplace right that is something that a lot of companies that we know of are struggling and that is something that you need to pay attention to as you put your scheduling plan and and who is the right partner that you need to work with as part of the migration process the next example that I'll talk about the Sailaja global bank basically that bank operates in North America and has a global presence the problem statement was they wanted to migrate a risk application that was taking about five hours to process but significant amount of cost that has being that's being spent on the horsepower that is required to go and figure out all this type of risk and all of these calculations that needed to happen so as part of the process we looked at the application we looked at the the existing components there were some we had all the time to do that so I'll emphasize that because there were elements of really textured or a architecting some components of the application so we had all the time that we needed to look at it investigate and figure out okay here are certain components of refactoring that would be required looking at the cost that's being generated or created we looked at a construct in Google cloud platform that's called preemptable VMs anybody heard about preemptable VMs okay very few preemptable VMs are among those key wonderful things in Google Cloud where if your application is not mission-critical you basically procure a via you say I want that to be preemptable what does that mean Google would schedule that for you it would run but if Google needs that capacity for that VM on a 1-minute notice they'll take it away they'll Park everything and then when they're done with that they'll restart it and it will resume right what do you get in return for that about 80 percent discount on the cost of the VM so that's pretty significant so if you have these workloads that do not need to be on all the time and you can leverage preemptable VMs sure all power to you this app this client saved significant amount of cost seventy percent of the cost was saved by reusing preemptable VMs and we also were able to really tech some of these applications and use the micro service pattern as part of the process but one of the key lessons learned for the customer here is they did not have enough people with the right skills and DevOps and that's where the partner came in and kind of provided our own methodology when it comes to how you could use these type of patterns within your organization what type of assessment that would be needed what type of gaps and what type of recommendations to fill these gaps were provided and pretty much it turned out to be a very successful story at the end of the day so so the last thing that the question we asked at the beginning of the session anybody still thinks that it's a random job okay good no hands shown I'll just leave you with this this is just one comment from a dimensional research why are application migration projects are late and over-budget basically the statistics and the survey that they have done they found that yes there is value in moving to the cloud lots of companies who moved the cloud were able to achieve the benefit of the cloud and but the key statement that they found that initial projects were more difficult than expected taking a year or more some of them are failing seventy-five percent of these projects that took longer fifty percent of the participants revealed that they are over budget so the key things that were basically uncovered as a reason for that expertise security concerns resource shortages and competing priorities were listed as the primary ones so it goes back to our story you know don't do over greed and if you don't have the right skills leverage your partner as part of the migration and hopefully it will be a successful one thank you [Applause] [Music]
