 hello! There was a trick that was discovered by the website moremixedreality.com on the cliff house, that allowed us to fly outside of the boundaries of the house so I wanted to try if this will also work here in the new Skyloft environment. The trick basically is you use your controls and you use the directionals, I mean you press it and just move forward. So let's try here ... yep it works we're now flying away from the Skyloft, it is interesting that this flashes that probably is on the video, are also happening on the mixed reality goggles, so I believe this is because it's outside of the boundaries of the environment so it's like flashing from time to time. Yeah it is yeah so it moves very slowly so and I bet all of that skyline over there, with the buildings, all this is very low-level rendering because it's far away and then you can see down there, so the buildings are in wrong perspective probably because they didn't expect that anybody will be looking into those or looking from a different perspective, so those buildings would show up as if they are standing yeah but this is a cool trick because you can have a different perspective of the scenario so you can see the city from behind and also the house from afar I will try here too to make a circle around the apartment, the loft let's see how it looks I will accelerate now the video so it doesn't get boring while flying this slow enjoy!
