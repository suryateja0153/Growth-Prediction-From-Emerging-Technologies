 Bloom came out of a little experiment that we had, where it was just creating a shape on a screen, having it expand and disappear. Really, it's just a very simple tech demo. What I've liked about this project and this space is that you're creating things in a virtual world, but the people outside are actually in the real world watching it as well. It's not quite so divisive. It really is truly mixed reality. It's blurring the lines as to where one starts and one ends. I think it's a bit of a sense of magic, actually. You can also start to interact with other people. It's quite magical, actually, where two of you start creating things in the space around you. I don't think anyone's experienced anything like that before.
