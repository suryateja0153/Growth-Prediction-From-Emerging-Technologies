 This is a pioneering community. They're going to make sure LBE goes from being just a startup activity  to one that it's actually established. The people here, we're gonna make that happen. It's always a pleasure when Microsoft learns about what people are doing  with our products that we didn't know about, and you see how far they take them. This is a High-Five Glove.

In the showcasing, AVR flying to space experience for everyone to see what would it look like  if you would fly into space. The seat he's sitting on is the hardware that creates the whole experience. I'm really happy to see how much the developers and country creators and operators have embraced our hardware,  and that they should work with us in here, and continue to build for the future. We see people wanting to be  more entertained. Not just the standard entertainment,  they want more stuff. I think that LBE would be like the place where you're going to be entertained. It's really fun to be on the forefront of a new industry and to be helping to work with so many amazing content  creators and technologists who are shaping the industry. You're feeling like we're part of  building something new that's going to impact so many people in a positive way.
