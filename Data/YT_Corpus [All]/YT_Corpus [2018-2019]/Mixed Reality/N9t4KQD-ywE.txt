 - Hi my name is Lucas. I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil currently live in New York and I am a Mixed Reality Developer. For this year at Build, I'm really hoping to be able to talk to the HoloLens team and the whole mixed reality Microsoft team and see what they're up to. Mixed reality is a thing, and it's here to stay. Throughout Build we're going to be talking about what that future looks like, we're going to be talking about how to build it in the present with the tools that we have. So if you're interested in this new frontier that we're walking into, you should definitely follow me. I'm a Mixed Reality Developer and join me at Build.
