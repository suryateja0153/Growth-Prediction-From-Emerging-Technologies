 [MUSIC] Hi there, I am Becky Ho, and I'm Product Marketing Manager for 3D in Windows at Microsoft. And welcome to our tutorial of how to use Paint 3D to create your very own 3D objects. Paint 3D is a great way to explore your creativity and bring your ideas to life in a whole new dimension. Today, we're gonna show you how to use Paint 3D to create 3D objects that can improve your presentations, like a science report for school. We're gonna make a 3D volcano that can be seen from all sides. Let's get started. I've already used the marker tool to sketch out the volcano that I wanna make in 3D. Now first, let's create the volcano base. I use a pre-made 3D cylinder shape and match it up right up against the line of my 2D drawing. Next I'm gonna use one of my favorite tools called 3D Doodle to draw in the sides of the volcano. And so here I'm gonna do a rough outline of a volcano shape. Look how it instantly puffs out into a 3D shape. I'm gonna do the same on the other side. [MUSIC] Just drawing a general outline. [MUSIC] And now I have a canvas for me to start working my design. And so, what I'd love is to be able to start texturing on some layers and some colors onto my 3D shape. And so I'm gonna click on the sticker tool and click add a sticker to be able to add a custom sticker, to be able to start wrapping around my 3D image. This is a picture of a volcano I found and look how it instantly wraps on to my 3D shape. I'm gonna resize the sticker to make it fit right on to my model. And without much 3D training, you can see how it does a lot of the work for me. I click stamp, and because I'm working in 3D I rotate to the back, [MUSIC] And I stamp the back of the object, and I move onto the other side, and do the same. [MUSIC] And look how it's already starting to look like a volcano shape. [MUSIC] And then I'm gonna do the same for the base. I'm gonna rotate the base to face towards me, [MUSIC] I'm gonna choose the sticker tool and resize it to fit right onto my volcano base. [MUSIC] And then rotate it to the back and do the same there. [MUSIC] So let's take a full look at the design, you can see it's already starting to shape up like a volcano. [MUSIC] And I'm gonna rotate to the side, cause I wanna make my volcanoes look a little bit fatter for the presentation. [MUSIC] And then rotate to the other side. [MUSIC] Next, I'm gonna build out the layers of the volcano. [MUSIC] And so, I rotate it to have it looking towards me. And I'm simply going to use the copy paste tool to be able to copy and layer on different parts of the volcano. And you can see it's start to blend into each other, which is a super cool and neat effect. So you don't need much 3D training, but what's cool about this is I can use the copy paste to be able to start building on parts of my model. [MUSIC] I'd love to have a lot of different layers into my mountain and so I continue copying and pasting to be able to add more dimension. [MUSIC] Cool, so it's already starting to look like a volcano. Next what I wanna do is have it look like the volcano's been cut in half, because I really wanna talk about the lava in the center of the volcano. So I move my volcano up to the top and bring back my canvas. And here I'm going to use the hard edge tool and start to trace the rough outline that I've already done. [MUSIC] And then I am gonna do the same for the other side. [MUSIC] Perfect, now I'm gonna turn off the canvas and then use my handy dandy sticker tool to be able to add a little bit more texture onto that shape. [MUSIC] And then make sure you turn it around to texture the back as well. [MUSIC] Perfect, so let's bring back our model. [MUSIC] And move the center pieces into the front. [MUSIC] So I'm going to use the Z axis, [MUSIC] To start to layer on different pieces of the model. [MUSIC] So I'm gonna do the same for the other side [MUSIC] And start to line up the pieces. So let's take a look at the model, [MUSIC] And let's check it out from the back. Whoa, so that's looking a little thick so I just resize it so that it'll look more like it's been cut in half, and do the same for the other side. [MUSIC] And now we have a volcano shape. And what are volcanoes best known for? Lava, so I'm gonna choose a bright orange from my brushes, and use the spray can to be able to color the center of the volcano. [MUSIC] And you don't have to be super precise about it, because what Paint 3D does is instantly color onto different parts of the section. So I'm really highlighting into the middle of the volcano, and it's really bringing a little bit more depth and dimension into my volcano model. And because we're working in 3D, we're going to switch it to the bottom base [MUSIC] And then really get into the bottom, to have the lava kinda flow out. [MUSIC] And then next, I'm going to use the yellow spray can to be able to just add a little bit more depth and color into it. [MUSIC] And I'm creating some rays as if it's spilling into the earth. [MUSIC] So let's take a quick look at our model, [MUSIC] That looks awesome. I love how, in just a couple of minutes, I've created an entire volcano model. Finally, let's have some lava erupting out. So I'm gonna click on the 3D shapes, into 3D doodles. And then continue to sketch out the outline inside of a volcano, as if I have lava spewing out. And then I love how I've now transformed this into a 3D shape. And so I'm gonna use the Z axis tool to bring it more towards the front, and then I'm gonna use the sticker tool to add in a new sticker. Here's the picture of some lava I found. And then I'm going to add this right on to my flame, [MUSIC] Just to give it a little bit more color. Then I'm gonna turn it around and do the same for the back. [MUSIC] How cool does that look? Looks like real fire coming out of the volcano. So now we're on a lava roll. So, next what I'm going to do is turn it around and start to add in some stickers to the base. I wanna make it look like lava is spewing out of the volcano. And so, I wanna add another custom sticker. And look how it stickers right onto my lava mountain. And so here, I'm just gonna resize it, stamp it right on, and then continue turning my volcano and rotating it to have it look like it's coming right out of the top of the volcano. [MUSIC] Perfect. [MUSIC] With lava comes smoke, so I use the 3D doodle tool to create a cloud. And so here I'm going to group my volcano, move it down a little bit, [MUSIC] And then choose a gray color and start to doodle a cloud shape. [MUSIC] And then I'm gonna use the Z axis tool to move it to be right above my volcano, and then I'm gonna use the sticker tool to add in some cloud texture. [MUSIC] It's looking slightly ominous but super cool. So I continue to stamp away, and then make sure you turn it around and do the same for the back. [MUSIC] Just continue to stamping on the different textures to build this really cool cloud effect. [MUSIC] And so I simply turn it, and look how cool that already looks. I'd love to have some dinosaurs around my cloud and my volcano to add a little bit more  color and dimensions. So I click on Remix 3D which is our online library filled with thousands of 3D models And then I type in dinosaur [MUSIC] And look at what other people in the community have uploaded. There's a lot of really cool dinosaurs, but I really love this raptor. It's ferocious and scary. And so you can see it's  a full 3D model that I'm now able to insert into my design, and I want to kind of have him leaning into the volcano, and look like he's  climbing up a bit. That looks awesome. And so now let's take a quick look at our final design. [MUSIC] Well that brings us to the end of the tutorial. To recap, we've learned how to use Paint 3D's tools and features to make a volcano that can be shown from all sides. We even opened up the volcano to show lava from the inside. With Paint 3D, you can show more details and visual depth in your work. Don't forget you can also use 3D objects in Word, PowerPoint, Mixed Reality Viewer, Photos app, and more. I'm excited to see what you will create next. Thanks for watching. [MUSIC]
