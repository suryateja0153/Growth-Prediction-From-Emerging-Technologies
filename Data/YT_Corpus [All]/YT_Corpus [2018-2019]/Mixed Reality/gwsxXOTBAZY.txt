 thanks for the introduction my name is Tom Han are from in unity of Manitoba Canada I'm a pear burger - planted work hire in supporting mix the reality haptic skilled in liquid flow the work was done during my internship at Autodesk research Toronto and where I was supervisor by Frieda Anderson and the table across man so with the developmental we are AR technology than the products and the variable haptic devices are getting very popular as they can deliver comparing techno and the haptic sensations even at the level of fingertips and most of the current L haptic devices are used only with virtual objects they are often made of wonky and rigid mechanical structures and the motors that are mounted directly to the users hands and the fingers which created a impede the users natural could continue institutions and dexterity and in many weeks the relative scenarios units need to frequently switch between activates the Warthog and the inductive method of physical objects and in such cases the degree to which a user's fingertip it covered by rated material directly affect how much how they could actually interact with the physical world and of course there are some existing approaches to fulfill such needs in the mix to reality scenarios so for example the size of the haptic device could be reduced with a numerical approach but the if some factory still reject and EMS could be used to trigger washoe force feedback well the user is holding a physical object so this is approach is a promising but these are limited to the kind of the sensation that can be produced and up to this morning we thought we were the first to propose of a few three filled through a haptic solution the Tac Toe which was branded just a few hours ago this they apply the electro techno feedbacks with thin film form factor attached to the scheme well even though we are a late beta later we have the sensation of the temperature and the pressure to these fields through optics which I will explain later and in this work we develop the head or e mix to reality haptic device that enables virtual haptic feedback without disturbing on the user's natural tactile sensations over the physical world well they are very in the devices and we use the term mix the reality haptics to describe the devices that can enable virtual haptic feedback without impeding the users epic sensation of the world or the physical world on the same location on the body and this device allows the natural tactile sensations of the physical object to be felt directly or augments the natural tactile sensations with some new feelings so for example with these Lego blocks not only does the device not interfere with our sensations by the a tomato makes the Lego feel warm code or bus depending on their configuration so let's see the design of the device the prototype of the hydro brain is composed of same flexible latex tube that it slightly slide over the skin and provides the tactile sensations of the pressure vibration and the temperature on the fingertip where liquid flow so liquid flow has there were interesting properties that make it suitable for this application first liquid flow has a very low modifiable properties such as the pressure velocity viscosity and the temperature by dynamically adjusting the rubber heads of these liquid flow inside a tube a range of haptic feedback sensations can be created and second the you delay created to deliver haptic sensations allows the end effector to be located away from the equipment that drafter the flow of the liquid third they could hide like water if income compressible and it's able to provide us room force but can be removed from the fingertip to allow the nature natural transitions to be felt and we build a hydraulic circuit to drive and control the liquid flow and the generator to the sensations we use the water in our case as it is easily accessible and whether it's stored in two rather words one contains hot water and the other hold each whether were had a peristaltic pump which draws water from the reservoir at a controlled speed computed from the devera the pressure vibration or temperature and the water flow flows from the pumps and if combined the yotube chamber this trip chamber not only mix the water that it at different temperatures but also dampens the pressure fluctuations introduced by the peristaltic pumps and the pressure and temperature sensors attached to the to be mone to the data of the liquid and the property input to the systems to make sure the accurate sensations are being rendered and the world her traveled from that we've chambers through the PVC tubing to the finger bone room before they actually passed through a controllable sorry the solenoid evolved that stops the flow of the water this allows hydro rate to increase pressure or produce vibration sensations and when the valve is open the water flows into a terminal rather it will be later recycled the logics cube becomes empty when the water flow is not activated and with the world open or capes static flow at a constant pressure level with the world closed under which this implementation hydro rain can be used the impose passive and active modes in passive mode it supports natural textured dexterity and allows the user to sense and interact with the real world focus on how users can operate with the touch school while wearing the device and the users can use the device invent all dirty conditions or perform the activity activities that require manual dexterity only in active mode it provides the techno sensations of the pressure vibration and the temperature on the fing tape I will briefly explain how they work the pressure is produced by clothing the solenoid evolved and preventing the water from flowing back into the terminal rather were as the volume of the water increases the pressure within the tubing that as well the system can produce pressure ranges from there upon the one Newton's 2.6 Newtons for now and the to render vibration the terminal solenoid valve is opened and closed the in rapid succession as the water is pumped through the system and the system is able to run their vibrations from one Hertz to 50 Hertz as the moment we're running a single pump as a 12 walls constant rate and temperature all opposed a is produced by controlling the speed of the two pounds lateral water from the reverse a PID controller is used to control the ratio of the hot her to hot to cold water and the system is able to deliver water in the range of two to 50 degrees about the way limits the output to 15 to 40 to ensure users comfort so let's see the evaluative use evaluation so we actually run two user studies to evaluate hydro rain the objective of the first study was to determine the how well users could differentiate the different lavato render the techno sensation produced by high jewelry after a brief training section for each sensation modality the functional inch over the stimuli that the ring would actually provide was divided into three five or seven levels of the granularity trail participant completed three repetitions of each of the three granularity levels for each of the three modalities resulting a total of 135 testing trials per participant and in each block participants were shown or trained inside of the stimuli corresponding to the current granularity levels the result demonstrates that hydro rain was able to reliably produce haptic sensations at different levels and the participant could accurately distinguish among reliable though haptics stimuli on each transition and performed relatively Wow even with five levels and the second study was conducted to access the degree to which high jewelry actually impedes the wearer's natural sexual sensations and we use the four common techno sensations that could be impacted by the use of the high terrain in this evaluation including pressure vibration temperature and the texture a pressure was produced though we're a small platform that was constrained to move along a single dimension different methods bringing in weight from the aeroponics rate to 480 Newtons were placed on top of the platform to produce a range of pressures vibration was produced though with a small a protecto a motor that could be activity the between at 8a and the 250 Hertz and the texture was rendered using five 3d printed texture samples with different identities and lustily temperature was granted using a small pot here module with a heading to provide the stimuli between 14 to 42 degrees and the similar to the previous study each transition stimuli was divided into five granularity levels and each under each sensation the stimuli was given to the participant at a random order and we asked the participant to which level the stimuli they just experienced and also tell participants completed the reading subjected today under two conditions based on where the youth that they are pair finger to receive the stimuli and documented condition where they perceive the stimuli using their index finger we are very in the higher green but they see in the passive mode well the difference being a curative we're wearing the ring was significant slice them without a brain the actually factor was a quite a small edge only three point seven percent so from this more effect we can conclude that well that us have some impact on the user's natural perception but the effect is quite minimal so let's see what patterning can do in our different scenarios and the feedback of hey Doreen could be used that we enhance existing technology that does not have haptic output of abilities for instance for instance when you really are children polka on a tablet the device could respond and provide haptic feedback corresponding to the elements in the book and they also tell me demonstrate mixed reality scenario where where the Warthog elements in the same can not only have a visual representation but attack to reference representation as well additionally because the u.s. does not have substantially impedes the users natural sensations so they can seamlessly switch between acting with real objects and and the interacting with their warsha ones and meets the reality haptic could also be used to augment existing static objects and structures and provide the feedback to augment the real world with haptic information for instance if the structure of the room was known by running fingers over a wall the reemay increase in pressure to indicate a wider frame its structures were located behind the wall and the well developed in the prototype of the haggling we realized that further work is actually needed to develop a prototype that is more self-contained and will allow the water to be recycled and we anticipate the future hardware development particularly in the area of micro fluidics that will result in Hollyweird devices such as evolved and pumps that are smaller require less poor and can be more readily integrated into variables and to summarize how during it misty reality haptic device that enables the various sensational pressure temperature and vibration through user studies we demonstrate that by delivering tactile sensations to the fingertip where liquid flow the user can experience the sensations of the pressure of a bridge and the temperature without dramatically impacting their fingers normal sensations and the mixed real haptics offer benefits for applications that require also our particular ability to sense a physical world and perceive haptic Ottomans augmentations with that I would like to thank you for your attention and I'm happy to take any action thank you very much so we have time for two or three questions hi Sean Homer Stanford University cool project I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the testing that you did on the basically haptic perception while wearing the device you mentioned pressure and temperature vibration but it seems like for a lot of different things that we might want to do with our hands like tactile spatial acuity as well as like contact position on your fingertip or contact spread might be very important and unfortunately didn't get to try the device but I'm wondering if you could comment on kind of the effect on that side of things we took the four sensations to task because three of them are actually relevant to the sensations that the Hydra can actually produce and part of it has made the in the passive mode so that we can observe when we're in the rain how much the people's natural sensation could be affected and then we actually build our own devices to do that and set up a breathable arrange for people to tell so I guess just qualitatively like when I'm wearing it can I feel like you know localized pressure at all localized pressure yeah not just like you know around the bed like tell that I'm touching but know that I'm where I'm touching to my fingertip so in the studies we didn't okay so we even tested that a specific dimension but I assume it is highly possible because actually we ask the user to makes the unnatural movement to touch the the example the web protector motor and if they can perform it with a given the posture for example then they probably will be able to perceive the local location information and our the the logic to the tube actually is pretty large that a fully covered most part of the finger pad and so that it's highly possible for them to save that thank you thank you hi I'm Shannon from national tower University and seems to me that you have to carry that bottles of waters when you are using it and and I wonder have you ever tried a pneumatic actuator like using air flow so maybe I'm wondering that if the pneumatic and hydraulic actuation was the difference in terms of the I have take sensation you can emulate well there are a lot of differences between the numerical approach and with the hydraulic approach though mostly important to are for them the first the the air is actually compatible and the water is not so that we can actually reduce the latency of the of the time when the antigen is produced and second with the water with highly daily produced the temperature sensation by of course we use the hot of hot water and cold water but it could be hard with the air flow thank you speaking of latency what is the latency of this device so depending on which transitions we were producing it's it's about one to two seconds for the pressure and vibration because we have a long view before our current implementation and for the temperature it's about five seconds although this is not sound it doesn't sound good but actually it could be improved in the future by shortening the tubing and using or stronger pump example okay and another nice but I wanna like I wonder we introduce the system you only say about how the flow flows into the device we didn't Mason about huddle as they flow out of the device I guess I have to have some kind of way to stop the flow from flowing on top the device to produce pressure right yeah so we I actually mentioned the we used a solid on wall for at the end of the circuit to open the closed door so you have to sort I want to produce air bubbles in there to produce a actually you know only why a tip does both oh okay thank you okay one final question all the verse notary University of Waterloo so if I understand this correctly it sounds like in passive mode you get the feel through and in active mode you might block some of the textures you're feeling because you're rendering yeah so I'm wondering at how much thought you've given to be able to do like an overlay so I mean your vibration like can you how possible would it be using this technology to try and feel a texture while adjusting its temperature for example using hydraulics so that's a good question no we actually solve about age as our future work and we think that would be a very indirect ssin by combining different sensations at the same time because the water has definitely has leased property so but a controlling it is a very hard to be honest so we will create as the future work okay thank you very much yeah thank you
