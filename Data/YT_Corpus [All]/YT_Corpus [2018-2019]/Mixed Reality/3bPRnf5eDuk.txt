 Finally we could make an event like this in Eastern Europe, as far as I know it is unprecedented: there were no Mixed Reality or HoloLens hackathons in this area. We enjoyed ourselves so much, it was a great team building opportunity as well in this cool environment. I believe it was a great opportunity to get into this new, promising technology of the future. This is actually our first Hackathon, and we are actually enjoying it a lot. It has been a tremendously good experience, we have learnt so many new things and thanks to Microsoft, we actually got to play with HoloLens and other Virtual Reality devices. Absolutely, I love it! This is like so many people who’s got great ideas and a little bit crazy you know, all the nerds. It’s a great opportunity to meet people, to get connection especially in the virtual world for now. This is new technology, so you can meet actually the real nerds here. It was so cool, I am very happy that so many teams attended the event and that they could make such great and almost ready applications. It looks perfect here and so many talented people are here, it’s for me an inspiration to meet the other developers, to talk with them and also make some ties with Microsoft. I believe that those teams, who came for this hackathon and could make such great solutions in these three days, they will be the ones to spread this technology and they will be the first pioneers in this market.
