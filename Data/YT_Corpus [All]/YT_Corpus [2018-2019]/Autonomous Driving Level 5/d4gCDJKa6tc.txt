 when Mercedes invited me for a nighttime autonomous test drive at CES I was worried that my video would be too dark to watch well as it turns out after sundown is the best time to peek inside the machine i'm michael fisher of mr. mobile that's nicole scott of mobile geeks and we got a first-hand look at how mercedes teaches cars to drive themselves so Las Vegas is the final stop in what has been a five-month test-drive across five continents for Mercedes intelligent drive team the purpose of which was to gather as much data as possible about driving in as many settings as possible for every country Mercedes sells cars and there are different driving regulations different road layouts and the behavior of the people on those roads is different too to get a car to learn how to better assist a human driver and eventually drive itself takes a mammoth amount of information and this s-class test car has a mammoth piece of equipment just for the task this is not the system that actually does the self-driving surprisingly that's this much smaller magic box rather this is what records all the data the car gets as its driving up to 12 gigabytes a minute so that Mercedes can analyze it later on fun fact the equipment works so hard that even in the January desert cold it's not necessary to run the heat in the car all the data being collected comes from the cars sensors in addition to the ultrasonic proximity sensors dotting the exterior we've got a radar system behind the grille up forward exterior cameras covering front side and rear sensors that monitor a ton of car systems internally and cabin cameras that watch the driver so Mercedes can learn more about human inputs remember this is a test car not a production model so whenever it's rolling there's always a human behind the wheel who can take over if the system runs into a situation it can't handle as we drive the streets of Las Vegas I get an up-close view of what the car sees through all those sensors uses the combination of radar optical and ultrasonics to see and classify objects in its view and that fusion of sensors means it knows the difference between not just a car and a person in a crosswalk but also the difference between a person standing alone and one holding hands with another person or walking a dog or pushing a shopping cart 10 times every second the brain of the system updates its information and makes new decisions based on it when there's a choice to be made about dealing with something aggressively or conservatively the system plays it safe but you know safe doesn't mean the same thing everywhere part of the reason this was a world tour was because drivers in Shanghai for example don't deal with pedestrians in the same way as drivers in Las Vegas cars on the Autobahn used different following distances compared to cars in the outback a road markings differ across regions you get the idea thankfully the car doesn't have to work from scratch when it's trying to figure out a new roadway a partnership with here maps gives it local data for many regions my takeaway from my half-hour in the passenger seat teaching a computer to drive a car is weirdly not all that different from teaching a person that's not to say it's easy we think about it driving is hard there are so many variables on even a typical spin around the block not to mention the once-in-a-lifetime random unexpected event that turns on a split-second decision that's why companies working toward the self-driving car can't just simulate this stuff they need the kind of random data you can only get from unpredictable humans in a chaotic world of course companies also need the technology to harness that data and the scale to learn from it across the whole planet Mercedes isn't the only company doing this but it's the only one to have given me such an in-depth peek at the future of driving one last bonus look at that future came at the end of our drive at the moment much of the technology being demoed here is used to assist a human driver not totally take over for one but when cars do go fully automated they're gonna need a way to communicate with people enter these fancy headlights which are actually projectors not for impromptu movie nights although that's definitely possible but for communicating for example to tell someone waiting to cross the street that yes it's safe to cross I see you and I'm not gonna run you over that's something a driver communicates with eye contact and maybe a hand gesture in today's cars but something a self-driving Auto might do with a system like this of course you need a different solution for when the sun's out but one step at a time folks this is just a quick peek if you want to hear more thoughts on the Mercedes intelligent drive tour I had a great chat with Nicole Scott immediately after this test-drive the video of which you can find over on her channel I'll drop the link in the description and the comments big thanks to Nicole for inviting me along on this one and use that same comment section to let me know if you'd like to see more videos like this in 2018 mr. Mobile CES 2018 coverage is brought to you by thrifter a new way to save money on everything from gadgets to home goods by shopping based on value and not hype check out the latest deals at thrift or calm and tell him mr. mobile sent you this was my final video from CES 2018 folks next week will circle back to smartphones laptops and maybe a wearable or two subscribe to the Mister mobile on YouTube so you don't miss it and until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends [Music]
