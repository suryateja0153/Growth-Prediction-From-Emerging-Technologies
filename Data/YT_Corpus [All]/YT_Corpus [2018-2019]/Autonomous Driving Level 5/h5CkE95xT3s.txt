 A STATE SENATOR )S VISION FOR SELF- DRIVING CARS IN NEW MEXICO... IS CRUISING FORWARD. SENATOR JAMES WHITE )S JOINT MEMORIAL WOULD CREATE A D-O-T COMMITTEE TO STUDY THE NEW TECHNOLOGY... THEN RECOMMEND CHANGES TO NEW MEXICO )S LAWS TO ALLOW THE SALE AND OPERATION OF THEM. STUDIES SHOW SELF-DRIVING CARS ARE ABLE TO REACT MUCH FASTER THAN WE CAN... MAKING OUR ROADS SAFER, LOWERING THE RATE OF DEADLY CRASHES. WHITE SAYS THE IDEA IS ALREADY A REALITY IN STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA. we don )t want to be left behind certainly i can say about half the states have moved really fast some states have not but we need to be part of one of the players we need to get in the playbook is what i like to say THE MEMORIAL PASSED THE SENATE TODAY 34 TO ZERO. IT NOW GOES TO THE HOUSE.
