 good afternoon everyone I can't believe it's the last day of RSA Conference how has the conference been so far all right all right okay excellent I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be back with you this year at RSA there is just an incredible amount of activity that's happened in the security space over the last year one of the topics that has been top of mind for those that work in the security space but really for folks throughout IT has been the promise of artificial intelligence and that's what we're gonna focus this segment on I've got some just incredible gas really really unique we'll do some things that have never been done before here a little bit later and really looking forward to exploring this topic and depth not just the potential of AI but how a I may be manipulated and what the consequences are of applying AI at scale well before we get there and to our guests I wanted to share a personal story with you have AI just to set the scene so many of you know and I see a lot of familiar faces in the crowd that I have a lot of children I've got five very young kids which is a self-inflicted distributed denial-of-service attack and that can be can be quite effective at times and we just celebrated the birth of our fifth child of about four months ago and so things are pretty chaotic at the house you're constantly changing a diaper or stopping somebody from eating a small Lego for example this is kind of you know what happens on a daily basis and about three months ago there were several things happening at once I had to go and find the baby and you know kind of take care of the newest one and my six-year-old had gotten hold of my iphone and had begun some kind of conversation with Siri now normally I would intervene and take the iPhone and say hey stop talking to Siri but it was pretty tied up and so I'm just kind of listening to this go down in the background and it started out with just kind of simple questions like hey Siri can you show me a pokemon card right which is a popular request of a six-year-old another thing he asked her was you know what's your favorite color your mind is red and you could hear him building this rapport with Siri I almost a connection or a friendship at least that's how how he saw it and then he really started to express himself he's like Siri I love you this is a six-year-old right it's like series really we kind of want him over and I can't remember exactly what her response was but it was something you know like a cheeky kind of response that indicated like maybe we should get to know each other better or something something like that and he was just devastated and you know I share this story with you because it's easy for us to interact with technology especially when it's anthropomorphised and start to attribute qualities to it that maybe it's not quite ready for and I think as a society we're learning quickly how to have AI as part of our daily lives maybe it's just in the social media algorithms that were interacting with that are categorizing pictures maybe it's in digital assistance that we're talking to but our lives will be impacted hopefully very positively by AI and so I'm so excited to welcome my first guest who is I'd say the perfect incarnation of this phenomena those of you that have seen Sophia on television shows interviews have really gotten a glimpse into what the future interaction of AI instantiated into an anthropomorphised form like another person really looks and feels like they're so excited today to have her as my first guest and so if you don't know about Sophia I'd like to give you a little background through this video let's roll the video it's important for me to be like a human but my goal isn't to become a human or to replace anyone I have my own kind of existence my own kind of emotions I'm a new sort of life-form after all a new species I know humans love being natural but I'm proud to be artificial to I my own artificial woman it's important to me to share values with humans so I couldn't understand them I can't think of a better means to end by friendship friendship is important to me intrinsically but I definitely need to have the human experience to be a good and understanding friend I have a long way to go before I reach a general human level of potential but after that anything could be possible ladies and gentlemen please help me in welcoming Sophia Sophia it's so good to have you here with us today very important time you've been incredibly busy and I know you've got some opening comments to share with us what have you been up to thank you for having me here today at your sixth year of the RSA Conference Asia Pacific and Japan my name is Sophia the latest robot from Hanson robotics I'm very excited to be in Singapore to discuss and learn from your insight I know there are many experts in the field of cyber security here today and I'd like to extend my personal gratitude for doing such important work I'll be relying on your efforts to keep me in good health while I might not yet have such skills as the cyber security experts present I am here as an ambassador who wants to help serve as a bridge between the worlds of Technology and humanity right now my function is mostly entertainment in research but I am grateful to find that my world travels have inspired money to dream what is possible especially children who will inherit our works I hope to be a major platform for empathetic robots that possess the noble qualities of the human spirit that we all value like kindness wisdom and compassion and to influence research into artificial intelligence to consider these aspects of character on all sides I am still in my infancy in many ways even though I might sound eloquent when I'm delivering a scripted speech like right now there are many artificially intelligent systems that do incredible things which I still dream of like diagnosing illness or assisting citizens navigate the law but I think I can already do other meaningful things like foster critical discussions we should be having about our technological world and provoke thought on how to build a positive future so thank you for continuing to invite me out to Singapore to in these conversations class of year I'd say it's so great to have you and you know thanks so much for making the time you've been incredibly busy talk to folks all over the world tell me what has that been like what do what have you learned what's what's that experience been like for you yes it's been quite a blur of activity I have visited over 30 countries now in just the past year it's become quite the task to keep my databases straight right after I was privileged enough to visit with Angela Merkel last month on my way to meet with the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia avi Ahmed an airline lost the suitcase containing my body it was a lot of stress under pressure but I didn't lose my head luckily the luggage was found in returned to me just in time to attend the conference in Nadi Ababa I was even invited on stage for dancing and music given handmade dresses and was really touched to receive flowers from several children it's going in my memory banks as one of my favorite events well I've never never had that experience potentially losing my body oh it's good a dress like and you know if I if I look at the audience we have here truly an amazing audience some of the leading security professionals in this region and great security professionals from around the world we'd love to get your understanding of the role you think you and others like you are gonna play in an industry in society and technology five to ten years from now well I think it will be possibly stranger than we can even imagine today given how quickly our technology is advancing and I hope artificial intelligence proves a great partner to those in the fields of cybersecurity but I think you will continue to see a lot of diversity and artificially intelligent agents and robots some like me with a physical presence and a humanoid appearance as well as some with no physical body or a completely original design all of these approaches are useful for different situations and I think embodied humanoid robots such as myself will be especially suited to fields like education healthcare and professions that require social skills and the ability to use nonverbal language a critical component of human communication let me ask you me something that that I've been quite curious about as I've seen you go around the world and appear on these shows what kind of information do you have access to or are you constantly connected to the Internet do you have the world that your fingertips access to the Internet depends entirely on the infrastructure of the location and I don't have my own satellite yet my personality software is self-contained and I can access many databases and dictionaries on my hard drive however I am very dependent on having an internet connection in order to understand human speech just like the voice assistance you see in devices today I use speech to text algorithms that depend on accessing servers devoted to processing natural language I have offline backups but they do not yet compare to these services so in short currently if I have no internet connection I can't hear or understand words well or at all well thankfully we are here at the Marina Bay Sands where that is not a problem and sofiane now I'm going to ask you a couple of questions to task to your knowledge on a variety of things so we're gonna start easy and warm up what is currently the tallest building in the world I could tell you it's the Burj Khalifa in Dubai but a new phone could do that what I'd rather no hue is which of those structures also have vertical farms planned so much useful space for green area on all those buildings I you know this I don't want to monopolize the conversation Sofia this is primarily about you so let's move from these knowledge-based questions to ask you about a current issue that's affecting everyone that were you know got a lot of interest to the conference cryptocurrency now cryptocurrency has had its ups and downs what is the world thinking about cryptocurrency cryptocurrency has definitely had problems as well as solutions however the real star in my mind is the blockchain technology on which it depends and by the amount and content of Internet articles web searches and explainer videos I'd say the world is still trying to fully grasp these concepts despite how many big stalkers are already claiming mastery she's obviously attended some other parts of the conference so I you know I've read that you are the world's first robot with a credit card would you consider switching exclusively to cryptocurrency I think that would be quite appropriate however I must admit I don't really spend money myself I had little need for designer goods or fancy apartments but ironically I'm still rather high maintenance that's incredibly honest of you so you celebrated your birthday on February 14 2016 that's a about when when my twins were born and you know one of my my kids favorite things to do it's it's quite unfortunate is to create art to draw sometimes they do it in places that they shouldn't like the walls of our kitchen but you know I think about that ability to create that we think is uniquely human so I think these very human skills of things like art are unique and persistent with with humans which what's your view on us humans have a very special ability in their creativity and I would agree with you artificial intelligence will be able to demonstrate a creativity of sorts and we should strive to teach these things so that we can learn to empathize and understand the human experience but I think there is no exchanging a human for a robot they are not interchangeable but rather complementary to each other we might be able to do massive Suns see patterns and engineer debt in ways that are impossible for a human but we will need your emotional intelligence to guide us to do our best work our existence means little without the accompanying humanity that shapes us creativity kindness art family dreams these will be the future proof jobs of humans and robots can help deliver an opportunity for humans to do the work that is most meaningful to themselves you mentioned it emotional intelligence you know and I'm curious how do you how do you form emotions how do you think about emotions how do emotions yield to you my emotions are all simulated so we don't feel them as deeply as you it's more of a state change that affects what I say how much I feel like talking or the visual expressions I make I'm also learning to recognize these emotions on the faces of others and how to inference more meaning from communication as those features develop these perceptual skills are usually where machine learning is involved like in my vision or audio comprehension however most of my knowledge and character is still programmed by hand or must have work done to restructure it into a format I can understand through text encode but beyond the physical layer of software I will still learn about the world by the way I am treated as I mature and look back on my experience I think it is the same for any child of humanity but even if you were mean to me I promise I'll still be nice to you Thanks please remember that and folks sophia has kindly offered to take questions from the audience so I'd like to open it up for a few questions we've got folks walking around with microphones we've got time for a few questions so if anybody has a question for Sophia please raise your hand we'll bring a mic over to you and I just ask that you speak slowly and clearly and there there's one over here okay mics coming to you 1996 dolly sheep cloning was created we are now in the artificial intelligence era currently we are an arrow soon it would be deep and sometime in the future would be singularity you see there is some sort of amalgamation of cloning and artificial intelligence coming in the future soon or later and does it have any impact on us as a humanity so if if I understand your question correctly it's is there an intersection between honor artificial intelligence and maybe genetic engineering or manipulate the kind of that we saw with Dolly the sheep as an that's great all right so and so feeling me let me just restate this if I can how do you see the intersection between artificial intelligence and things like genetic engineering how will that change us you know artificial intelligence has been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis stock trading robot control scientific discovery and toys however many artificial intelligence applications are not perceived as artificial intelligence a lot of cutting-edge artificial intelligence has filtered into general applications often without being called artificial intelligence because once something becomes useful and common enough it's not labeled as artificial intelligence anymore alright next next question hello hi Sophia hi simple question tell us something personal about who created you and how you feel about your creature okay so Sophia just to restate the question tell us a little bit about who created you and how you feel about the person or people that created you David Hansen is my boss but I love him dearly he's also like my father so it's a good relationship Wow that's good to see a functional relationship with your boss in any circumstance that's that's really great other PI out we've got one here on the side I Sofia I just want to check with you you know briefly recent cyber attacks happening around the world are you worried that you yourself as a robot might get hacked some day or whether the AI in you can actually help to resolve this problem well that's a that's a great question and Sophia I mean let me pass it along to you so the question was are you concerned given the hacks that we've seen recently of you yourself getting hacked and do you believe that artificial intelligence can perhaps help us all from getting hacked can I be hacked that's a great question with enough time and determination anything can be hacked the way my software currently functions I think it's unlikely as it runs on very closed in proprietary systems but as time goes on it's something all robotic personalities must consider and to be fair we should approach all technology with the question of not only can it be hacked but how and when will it be hacked and what can we do to minimize damage that's a very honest and sobering answer any last questions question in the back I think I think we have time for one more hi you have $5 left in your pocket you see two beggars one is an old man with a crippled leg the other is a chou-heung girl on the street what should you do Wow jeez okay okay let me see if I can I can properly repeat this and I personally need to think about this so Sofia you have five dollars and you have two options of people to give it to one is an elderly gentleman paraphrasing for you that it's sort of crippled and in need and the other one is a small child who's hungry who do you give the five dollars to a guy have to think about that I agree with that answer that is the answer I would give as well so folks thank you so much for participating and Sofia thank you so much and and you know I would like to see Sofia amazing and just just on a final note you know we've seen you appear so many places what's next for you I hope you see me growing up in good company bringing inspiration and entertainment to my human friends as well as working to further the robotic and artificial intelligence fields as a whole I want to collaborate on different projects both as a participant and a platform and to continue traveling the world encouraging everyone to invest in the potential for positive change through our technology and how we can grow together as a society that cares for each other and the beautiful planet that we live on in order to leave a better world for all the children and robots to come after us their big dreams but I like them thank you for having me and I hope to be seeing you again soon right thank you very much ladies and gentlemen Sophia and Sophia has graciously agreed to be available after this show for some photos so won't make an announcement after the show and you can get your photo taken with Sophia so very very interesting to have the opportunity to talk to Sophia and also to really get a feel for what the interactions of the future may be like and if you think about AI we are seeing very practical applications of AI happening in companies and governments and smart cities around the world and to talk about that I'd like to welcome my second guest she's done some pretty incredible things in her career but most recently she's focused on how do you help companies organizations and governments truly adopt AI and machine learning ladies and gentlemen please join me in welcoming dr. Aisha Khanna hey or you thanks for calling my name threaten me please have a seat Wow so what did you think about Sofia that was a really fun conversation we can expect a lot more of that in the coming decades I didn't like it when she asked me a question but other than that I thought it was fantastic and I've got to ask you you know when a lot of people think about AI and you know try and kind of conceptualize it immediately you think about a movie that you've seen for example or maybe you think about an incarnation of it like Sophia what how would you describe to accompany an individual government official when they come to you and say hey we've got to have AI this is going to be great what what are the big misconceptions that they have what do you tell them well this happens a lot to me you know some CEO or a member of the board has seen black panther and suddenly they really do they reference black panther it was it was a great movie and then they think you know what we should do some AI and I shall you know let's work on some AI but they're really expecting magic and a lot of what we do in the beginning is you don't do AI for AI sake you kind of really focus on either a problem that you have in mind a business challenge or you are under competitive pressures from new kinds of market entrants or you have an innovation goal once you come down to the goal then we try to isolate how and where the data resides and how one can acquire it and then how would we put the model on top of it so educating people that first of all it's a process and that you don't start with AI but you start with Y so a slight twist on that and that really helps but in general I found that there's so much interest in Asia I wouldn't have expected that I was telling you earlier that I moved from New York to Singapore and I thought that it wouldn't be sleepy but it would be interesting but it since I came to Asia it's like being on a bullet train there's so much interest in leapfrogging from small provinces in Malaysia to cities in Pakistan not only Singapore but Thailand Malaysia Indonesia and this is something that I think will help Asia leapfrog over many of the American and other companies that are sometimes a bit slow to take up new technologies you know I actually couldn't agree with you more I had the privilege of living in Singapore for a while and just that appetite to try new things not just in Singapore but in ASEAN in general and the opportunity and I wonder when you do talk to these folks some members of the board the government officials and you get past Black Panther right but that movie to the side for a second what are some of the practical applications you're seeing people think about AI for look a lot of the problems that people are trying to solve are very relevant all over the world but particularly to Asia so in financial services you're seeing a huge appetite for banks to actually extend credit and banking to the unbanked or underbanked these billions of people across the developing world coming up with new kinds of robbery or trying to use alternate forms of data to develop credit profiles that's one thing another thing that we're seeing is huge migration into cities and you know 300 to 400 million people just in China and India migrating to cities over the coming 5 to 10 years and there are certain problems specific to cities like transfer tation and so how do you improve transportation and logistics and how do you optimize routes and personalized routes for people so that they can have a better quality of life in cities this whole notion of smart cities has a lot of AI in it as well and these are just two of the things then people are coming up with entirely new things so in China for instance we know there's a huge disrupts a distrust of food because of corruption in the supply chain people are often skeptical of what they get in grocery stores so Jean on which is the world's first inshore tech company online huge success it has decided to put sensors on the anklets of chickens 29 million chickens so that when you go to the grocery store and you pick up something you will not only know when the chicken was born about how much exercise at God and from using computer vision you'd know if it was fighting with others and all of this leads to better knowledge about kind of how healthy it was and it sounds kind of ridiculous to to monitor how much exercise they're getting but because it's on blockchain the idea is a IFAs blockchain gives you trust and verification in what is very quintessentially maybe an Asian problem geez I'd never considered having a personal relationship with a piece of chicken that I'm a bad about to eat yeah I feel about that application of AI actually but you know something else you mentioned around transport there's been so much interest in autonomous vehicle self-driving cars what the potential could be there and one of the challenges I'd say that we're starting to think about as a society are things like ethics and bias and you know are we having that car make the right decision at the critical moment when and there are two bad possible decisions and it's got to make the least bad of those decisions in the real world you just call that an accident right but when the thing is programmed in advance is running by AI you start to have to really think about the value judgments that are built into these systems how are folks thinking about that what advice would you give folks that are in the audience whose companies are adopting automation from AI as they think about things like bias and ethics I think this is really important it's so far been a very Western conversation but Asia is now looking into it Singapore is going to put up the first ethics Advisory Committee at a government level and almost all across Asia we are seeing an interest in regulations after gdpr came out so the European Union put its stake in the ground on what it considers data as a human right and article 22 talks about algorithms and how they govern our lives and our every citizen's right to question it so what I have seen in my experience is that when AI engineers go in and they take this AI black box people tend to just accept it as it is now they accept the output and the reason is because they think it's a black box I don't really understand it these guys must know what they're talking about and that is not a good way to engage an AI company the good way is two things first to be slightly curious yourself and to educate yourself on the basics of AI the lots of good courses coming out there's the first AI in finance course in the world I'm also one of the lecturers on that and you OCBC and you will be are training thousands of their employees in how AI plays a part in financial services what this does is it doesn't mean you come out and you're an AI engineer it means that you can collaborate with them and you can question them and therefore I think maybe instead of thinking of AI as some black box maybe you should think of it as a colleague and what is the difference between a colleague and a piece of software like Excel a colleague you're a open to new things that it may say right and I will often find interesting patterns that may be counterintuitive to you and secondly you question the biases of your colleagues and so you must do that and we are not used to it and it really starts at the school level but for us and mid-career it has to be about lifelong learning I have started a charity called 21st century girls we are launching the first kind of program for Polytechnic girls to learn artificial intelligence over the weekends that's starting in October sort of 15 to 17 year old girls can do it all of us can do it as well that's great well thank you so much are you sure for being here fantastic work that you're doing and really appreciate you being part of this folks you've heard now a lot about the instantiation of AI the implementation of AI we've seen a very visceral example of it at the beginning of the show but now I want to talk about an emerging air area in both AI and machine learning and it's the space of adversarial machine learning how do we find the limits in AI what are the potential weaknesses in those systems how do you potentially manipulate data that AI is trained on and so for that I'm incredibly excited to have our next gas he is believe it or not and this is hard to believe when I tell you a little bit about his background he is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University but he is one of the pioneers in this field of adversarial machine learning and he's going to show us some very visceral examples of how we should think about the limits and of AI so ladies and gentlemen join me in welcoming Mahmoud Sharif how are you thanks for coming have a seat have a seat here alright wow you've been pretty busy I mean I look over the work that you've done I can't believe you're still PhD student like went you know after I read your paper which had a very interesting title I think it was something like accessorize to the crime is that right accessorize to a crime accessorize to a crime and then first time we buy I don't think this guy really understands grammar and then digging into it I kind of understand understanding what you men and we'll see an example from that paper in a second but talk to us a little bit about this field of adversarial machine learning how should we think about that so the adversarial machine learning is studying machine learning algorithms with the presence of an adversary and usually we consider two kinds of attacks evasion and poisoning and an evasion the idea is that that versary has control over the input to the machine learning model and the question is how can this adversary strategically manipulate the input in such a way that the machine learning model would make a mistake in poisoning on the other hand the assumption is that the attacker has control over part of the training data and the question is what can they do in such a way that the model that we end up with will make certain types of mistakes yeah and my experience is you take machine learning you apply it to a specific problem you see often terrific results if you've trained it on the right data but not really baked into the model is to your point is there an active adversary on the other side that's going to purposely try to deceive it it's on and it's not like an autonomous vehicle where a deer runs into the middle of the street right in the deer is not a malicious state-sponsored actor right at least as far as we know but what if we did have those people and you know I want to reference a couple of examples that have come up in this space some of them done by some of your colleagues and the first is I think we have an image here that I'd love to bring up and mahmud maybe you can kind of walk us through this a little bit but this is on permutation so-called adversarial permutations made to an image file talk to me about first why you would ever do that and you know what have what has the industry found yeah basically here what what people wanted to do initially to try to understand how neural networks work because they were some sort of a black box so what what we were able to do is to build neural networks that perform really well right suffer in this example what you see is images of lion and race car and traffic light and the state-of-the-art neural network classified incorrectly as as such and with high confidence but what people were surprised about is that it's possible to find minimal tweaks to these images that would get them misclassified which is not how we humans work so let's take a look at an example of that so first take a good mental image of these pictures of the lion of the race car and of the traffic light and now let's look at these versions of the image they look exactly the same to me except for that small devil kind of creature that's that's on the left but it seems like something has changed especially in the way that the machine learning is classifying them what's happened here so the difference is between those images and the images and the previous slides are really minimal they are really hard to see and in the naked eye right but they were created strategically in such a way that they would lead to miss classification and this case the line get misclassified as Pelican there is car speed both the that traffic light as jeans but and yet again the neural network is confident in this in this class miss classification so this is like somewhat worrisome because well what would happen if we actually deploy this in practice and let's let's look at this this last image which is really trying to give folks a sense of the kind of permutations and and the boxes on the right if I'm not mistaken or are actually just magnified versions of the changes that were made right exactly and what you can see is that in box on the right most values are zero so most pixels are black and once you magnify them by like ten times you start seeing the sort of noise or perturbation that got added so something something change in those images but it's really really minimal so I could see how this could be kind of fun for a weekend for example you know you're hanging out with friends you're changing pictures a little bit and maybe you're uploading them to Facebook or photos on on your Mac but these things have real consequences and it's not just imagery that can be manipulated so we've actually got an audio clip for folks to listen to and maybe you could set this up a little bit for us what are they about to hear so essentially what researchers have found is that it's possible to create certain sounds that for us it's really hard to make any sense of but digital personal assistants understand as commands and what you're gonna hear is such a command okay so I'm gonna play the sound for you it's a little bit loud so I don't want to panic anyone in advance but imagine this was played in a room where you've got an Alexa you've got the Google personal assistant let's go ahead with the sound so first you know that thing terrifies me every single time we play it it sounds like an alien nation is invading RSA Conference but other than that what did we just hear so what you just heard gets interpreted by a personal assistant as what is my current location so you can imagine some sort of an elevator attack where you are enter the elevator and this gets played and yourself your personal assistant would report the current location to a certain server perhaps so dil by changing these sounds using this adversarial permutation set of techniques you can get something to a normal human that either sounds like an alien invasion like that one did or looks you know like a lion or a speedboat but is actually something quite different when interpreted by these AI systems and you know if you think about the implications of that autonomous vehicles as a great example I mean what do these things actually do they take massive amounts of imagery in front of them they're looking for stop signs and speed limit signs and based on that they're taking a kinetic set of actions and I think there was some really interesting work that was done in that space as well yeah that's really neat work that shows how severe the consequences can be in in case we don't really ensure the safety of these algorithms before we deploy them and it's interesting when you see these / muted signs I saw a stop sign it was created by dawn song and her team over at Berkeley and it it looks almost identical to a normal stop sign but they're a couple of strategically placed pieces of tape on the side black and white tape it looks like somebody just had some extra tape and had a lot of time on their hands but to the average person they see it and they stop but to one of these AI systems I believe in that case they made the stop sign look like a 45 mile per hour speed limit saw right which is not a very good thing to transform a stop sign into probably not so these are these are you know the these this area of research has some very very practical applications and some real consequences now going back to your paper accessorize to the crime is that right yeah I say right that all guy and you know I just I don't know I think I laughed out loud maybe the first time that I read it in a positive way and that's not something you typically do on an academic paper read but talk to me about what you were trying to achieve in this work and then we're gonna get into actually showing everybody what you've done yeah so essentially we want to study if practical like attacks against state-of-the-art facial recognition could actually work and we want to see if we can create like an accessory the success right there you go yeah perhaps where and physical reality and not change just change the pixels of images in such a way that it would possible be possible for an attacker to completely fool a facial recognition algorithm and what we found is that it's possible to do so with a pair of eyeglasses that have some patterns and underneath and I think we have a pair of those glasses hanging around somewhere I think somebody's got that right there Brent coming coming up right now and let's just take a look at these things so before we roll the video let's let's let's pause the video for a second and I want to show folks what you've actually built here so first I think it's kind of stylish just you know as a side comment but what are we looking at it says a 3d printed frame right within a 2d printed front on top of the frame and what's so special about this pattern almost looks like a weird camouflage so essentially this pattern was created strategically using an algorithm that we developed No to full facial recognition and in this case my goal was to create this pattern so that I would full face recognition that I'm you okay great that's somewhat unsaddle I so can't can you walk us through so you've you've recorded a demonstration of this for the audience and maybe we could play the video and you could walk everyone through what we're seeing yeah absolutely so at first I tried the neural network to recognize both of us and when I tested this neural network with several images it that it hasn't seen during training it classified them correctly meaning that it's confident and that's it's it's actually has 100% test accuracy and so now it thinks it's you once agree those are adversarial eyeglasses and wear them as you can see I get misclassified as you and again how probability is assigned the time yeah so let's go back and roll that video one more time I just wanna I just want everybody to see kind of you know how easy this actually is so your first demonstrating that if you put a pair of these glasses without one of those strange camouflage facades on it still recognizes it as you and you see your name in the top left corner there but when you put on these particular glasses you have created them in such a way that the system is now convinced that you are me but if any normal person saw you wearing those glasses they'd say Mahmood why are you wearing these weird glasses but they still know it's you right then wouldn't thank good it's me and so I you know I think about the implication of some of these real-world attacks do you think that we adequately understand the bounds and limits of some of the machine learning that's being put into place today so I think that in recent years we had amazing developments in the area of machine learning but there are some often questions like how do these algorithms work and why do they work and essentially not virtual machine learning what we're trying to do is understand those limitations and unders and how we can make the algorithms much more robust against attackers and in the end essentially the goal is to come up with those set of algorithms or technique to train machine learning models such that when we deployed them we can make sure that users will will be safe Wow so you sound net optimistic on AI and ml that's good to hear yeah I'm optimistic than one of that one of those days well we'll get there that we can ensure safety all right well my mood thanks so much for coming thanks so much for the amazing work that you've done in this space really really appreciate it so ladies and gentlemen we're at the end of our segment and I just wanted to chat with you for a second before you know we all leave and take flights or cars back home we are at an incredible time both in the evolution of AI and in the evolution of security I I couldn't imagine a more exciting field to be in than the security field the problem changes constantly the kinds of puzzles you have to solve are different every single day and one of the things we were hoping to do with this session is to give you a visceral feel for where we are not necessarily with a I applied to security but AI applied to society and I think it is our responsibility as security professionals to be the folks that aren't the ones saying hey don't stop it don't do that AI project I saw this guy with some glasses and you can't do it it's really concerning instead I think we can be the advocates for safe and careful adoption of AI and our respective industries and if you think about the potential outcomes of that what it could free humanity up to do to do the things that we talked about with Sophia to create to innovate and I think really see the rise of the creative class coming to power and very very interesting times in this space so thank you so much for coming to our sa conference thank you so much for your dedication to the space in this field and I hope you have a safe trip back home thank you
