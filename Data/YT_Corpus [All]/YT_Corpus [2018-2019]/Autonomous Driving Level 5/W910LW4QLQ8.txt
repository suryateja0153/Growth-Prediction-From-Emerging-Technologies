 Vision 1-7-20 "Driving pleasure will also play a role in the mobile world of tomorrow." Where do you see Audi in one year? In one year from now - that is relatively easy. Siegfried Pint Head of Powertrain Development Architecture, Control Units and Vehicle Integration We will have successfully launched the Audi e-tron onto the market and, consequently, will be experiencing the first electric car offered in the premium segment. We will also see the first fast-charging networks on European highways and in America, and with that, will also ensure the vitally important long-distance mobility of electric cars. Where do you see Audi in seven years? In seven years - it's a bit more difficult to see what will happen in that time, of course. But I am firmly convinced that electric mobility will prevail. We will have the drive form across the board in all segments - in small midsize and large vehicles. In my view, the issue of charging infrastructure will have been resolved, not only for long-distance trips but also for car owners who can only park in public spaces. I believe that a great combination will emerge: Level 3, Level 4 driving - meaning automatic driving on the highway - will be possible in combination with electric mobility. That's a truly great thing for customers, because the driving task can then be handed over to the car and you can use the time for yourself. Where do you see Audi in 20 years? I'm convinced that mobility will essentially be green, and that electric mobility could therefore be the dominant form of locomotion. Especially in combination with what could by then already be Level 5 - that is highly automated driving without a steering wheel. But I am also convinced that the issue of driving pleasure can and should continue to play a role in this beautiful, new, green world of mobility. For me, this means that the basic human need for locomotion and dynamic locomotion will still be around in 2038 and that mobility will still be fun.
