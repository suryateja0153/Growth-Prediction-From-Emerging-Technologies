 [Music] hello everybody hello everybody great my name is Chris Leben and together with Justin lawyer we are product managers on Google cloud and we'll be talking to you about machine learning on GCP so I'm a very transparent person I'm going to make it very clear what I hope your takeaways are from this talk one I want you to be really excited about what you could do with machine learning to I want you to feel confident that your organization can successfully implement machine learning with Google cloud and three I want you to trust that with Google a is focus that we are the right platform and partner for your mo workloads three takeaways and this is what we're gonna be talking about for you to get those takeaways before we dig into it I just want to say thank you we all have limited time with our busy lives you've chosen to come to Google cloud our next conference in this session so just thank you so what can ml do for you it could do a lot of amazing things if your organization has any competition I guarantee they're looking at ml now ml's not necessarily for inventing the insane if you're in transportation it's not about how are we going to create teleportation it's about taking your existing businesses and processes and being able to reimagine and reinvent what you're doing today there's three kind of big areas that ml could help with they could help you get insights or your customers it could help you innovate your products and help with automation let's look at automation real quick self-driving trucks and cars taking the businesses that everyone's doing today with transportation and cabs and making it faster and cheaper and easier and safer let's look at innovation one of our customers Disney uses our product auto ml to innovate their retail service they wanted their user experience to be really quick to find the product they're looking for so you used a web interface to create a custom model no ml expertise needed and now in their search experience you could type Mickey Mouse on the beach and it finds all the products related to the beach and Mickey Mouse really cool really easy and insights let's say you're a plane manufacturer or an airline and you really care about safety thanks to IOT there's tons of data that these instruments are doing and what if you collect that data what if you process it and what if you could predict that maybe there's a part on the plane that needs maintenance before its regularly scheduled insights for safety so feel excited about what your organization can do so show of hands who here their organization is looking into machine learning today great one more show of hands who here things they understand what machine learning is okay about half of you last question who knows what a machine learning model is okay most of you so I'll just touch over this really briefly machine learning is about data and taking data and getting insights in action there's all kinds of data out there images unstructured text relational databases sequence information and what machine learning is is taking that data taking an ml algorithm of various sorts and passing through that data through that algum algorithm with a huge set of infrastructure and as you pass that data through the machine learning model is created and this model gets better and better the more data the better algorithms the more infrastructure and you use that model to create insights automation and innovation so we we all know this service web search Google's been an AI company and the data company for 18 years now collecting the world's data making it accessible and usable by all and we have a lot of expertise in this area large-scale data centers AI experts data experts and what Google Cloud is is about bringing that expertise to you with ml this is a nice little story about how we internally have implemented ml successfully our internal AI team called brain they create ml models take a bunch of data through an algorithm pass it through a huge scale of infrastructure and create ml models but not every single software developer at Google is an ml expert so what we've done is we went around to our software developers and trained them here's how you could implement ml with these existing models so what this graph is showing is the number of source code repositories that our developers are using the brains ml model to implement successfully AI into internal services external products and we're bringing these types of concepts to Google cloud on the right you'll see a bunch of products that have integrated ml and AI I'm not gonna talk about all of them I'll talk about to my favorites so I'm a father I have three kids and I take a lot of digital photos of my kids the ridiculous amount maybe a hundred thousand in total and I had this Mac and I had some hard drives and I was worried about storage so I got Google photos free unlimited storage that's great cheap its scalable I don't got to worry about backing things up but really the innovation was the search feature it has facial recognition and knows who my kids are I can click on a picture of my face my phone type in a word like a beach or a boat and now it goes through a hundred thousand photos and finds the exact photo I'm looking for in the past I would have taken me 20 minutes to find ML is innovating and so could you so no matter what size your organization is no matter what type of technical staff there's different ways to implement ml and we're going to be talking about both ways the first way is to use our ml models you don't need to be an expert youse need to be a software developer or your organization taste does any programming language on with the rest api simple to use if you're a CX out there or executive trying to decide do i fund a project it's very low risk to take the high quality model have a software developer use an API and implement it get started really quickly and the other out is to build the custom model maybe you're a domain expert in your space or you have access to the data and you want to create your own in my model so we have a bunch of tools for experts a bunch of hardware to get you fast and cheap ml processing and this is where I'm gonna hand it off to Justin and he's gonna talk about these in a little bit more detail thanks Chris so thanks very much for coming today we're gonna talk about how do you find the right tools for your job as a an expert in your field so first of all is as Chris was mentioning Google has created a lot of machine learning models for specific applications to power Google applications and so we then I wrapped REST API surround these for you to consume we call these some perception api's because they're typically around human perception and how the user interacts with the application so quickly going on to the next slide here there are three main categories of these api's one is for regarding site the other is around conversation and the third one is around language I think it's important to maybe walk through each of these really quickly so you can kind of understand out-of-the-box capabilities and you can get without you doing any coding other than using a REST API and then implement that into your application so first of all for site say you've got an image and you want to understand what's in that image automatically you pass that image to the vision API and you can understand what the objects are within that image automatically and you can figure out where the faces are and it can tell different people for the video understanding API you can pass it the video and it can tell scene transitions different objects within that video you can basically search and find what you're looking for within the video or across videos if you're passing multiple videos OCR often people have documents that they've scanned and you need to kind of understand what the heck is in that document maybe PDF message if whatever it is you need to be able to not Jeff in JPEG you might pass it into the API and then it will automatically detect what are the what are the words in that document and give you that raw text afterwards or what maybe you've got an image of a scene and there's signs on the wall it'll give you the the text of what's on that sign so the OCR is really really handy in everyday applications the adult content one is actually one really really important because you might get user-submitted content you don't know what's in that image you need to make sure that you're not presenting an inappropriate image to your users so the adult content is detection is a really easy way for you to detect you know what's going on in the image and is that something you should filter out for your users for the conversation class of API is the audio decks you might have a streaming audio file that you then need to figure out what is being said it will then transcribe that event and give it to you it's useful for videos for real conversations with people for TV shows whatever it might be the reverse is also possible you might have a text string that you need to read out to your user well you pass the the string to the the application and it will then create the synthetic voice that you can then read off to your user chatbots is a way for you to engage with your users and program the interactions you would like in chat directly with your user and program certain kinds of conversations to go on and help them with customer service calls or things like that from the language ap is one of the things that's really hard is if you got freeform text what the heck is that really saying we will map out and figure out the the context of what it's saying map out the data structure of the sentences give you the parts of speech so you can figure out okay what are the nouns what are the verbs what are the relationships of these and then you can do something intelligent with that structure sentiment analysis is a situation where what's the mood that's being transmitted along with those words what we've had is we've seen a lot of good success trying to monitor for instance the sentiment of customer service emails or chats and when things are getting out of hand being able to escalate that to manager so you can kind of make sure things don't spiral out of control or if you need to understand if something's aggressive or calm or happy how do you kind of make sure you're categorizing things appropriately if you're like rating some customer service calls things like that in translation it's a great way to just automatically translate from one language to the other and we'll talk a little bit about that next as an example so for instance say you are a game developer and you have an online community and they're but they're coming from all over the world speaking different languages you want them to be able to talk to each other in real-time chat you can basically have the ability to translate to any of the other languages so the Translate API makes that really easy or you might be able to get inbound customer service emails and be able to translate that to a language that your customer service rep understands so that they can then find the right article to respond to your customer so the nice thing about these api is they're basically just REST API so basically we give you a snippet of code you pop it into your your app the only thing you really have to change is the key and the URI to point to your data and voila off you go can't really get any simpler than that the the other nice thing about this is well the next question that comes up is well what about performance how well do these actually work they work really great for common use cases for some cases you might have a problem that Google's never had to deal with or you might have to deal with a situation that with a lot more detail than Google has to deal with for instance Google would probably tell the difference between a bolt and a nail really easily but if say let's say you're a manufacturer and they're you've got two thousand different bolts on your production line how do you tell the difference between these for your parts well what we have enabled is a cloud auto ml so you can provide images of all of your parts labeled and we may not be able to distinguish them unless you give the labels we then train a model for you well then you get a REST API endpoint that you can then use in your application so the nice thing about that is it's really easy to use and you don't have to know machine learning we do it for you but then you can use it in your application so the next question is well how well is this work it actually works better than all the open-source models out there and so you get a great performing model and it's really easy so it's been really helpful so the so that's actually one category of way to use ml another way is let's say I've got data scientists and I want to build my own model because I've got my own data and it's a custom problem that I need to deal with well there's two different ways to do this one is using the cloud manage services and these are services where you don't want to deal with the infrastructure we'll deal with that for you that way you can focus on your machine learning processes so we've got data frock and data flow so you can deal with your pre processing data proc is essentially Hadoop and spark but managed or dataflow is using beam in the back end from a machine learning processing perspective machine ml engine or machine learning engine allows you to automatically spin up the infrastructure and we'll get to that in a little bit and then tear it down when you're done so it makes the it takes the infrastructure pain away from the data scientists it supports all the top frameworks and we've got data lab which is a managed notebook which allows you to make the the data exploration easier so first about data lab how many of you out there have actually used Jupiter notebook or know about Jupiter no books so probably about a third of you or half so just for the rest of you so you understand what Jupiter notebook is it's essentially an app where you can supply a you can point it to your data and supply some code to be able to analyze your data visualize the data push return see it immediately get some feedback and then iterate on that and keep it all ready and keep adding it to it you can replay the entire notebook you can just play certain snippets of that you can share it with your coworker so it's a really great way to explore visualizing prototype so it's a fantastic tool the nice thing about data lab is it's pre-configured to connect to all the different cloud services like bigquery ml engine etc so it's really easy to just work off of the cloud you can also use it locally on your laptop machine learning engine is really a great way to do distributed learning on any arbitrary data side for your data using all the top frameworks and again it's it's a managed service so you just point it at your model and your data and you just spin it up it takes care of all the distributed training for you don't worry about it terminate stairs everything down is you only pay for what you use so it's a really efficient way to do this you don't have to worry about accidentally leaving that VM on and you're getting charged four months worth doesn't notice when you get the bill the other nice thing about this is it also does batch prediction and online prediction so basically you can spin up these these batch prediction jobs really efficiently or for online prediction it will create that REST API endpoint for you for your model and serve to whatever volumes you need for any set of any number of apps that you've got so it's a great way to manage your apps in a really easy way the other thing is we found that data scientists often don't do optimization of their models because it's kind of a pain you have to you know vary all the different parameters and find the right configuration for your data set well we've built that into ml engine so it actually makes it really simple for you you just give the parameters and it will then go find the optimal model so instead of finding just a good enough model you're actually finding the best one for your for your data set so it really improves your performance of your models so putting it all together from a managed perspective we've got different services - for every step of the entire ml lifecycle that you might have to deal with for an application we've got the ingestion side the pre-processing side storage in the exploring and experimentation the visualization side training and serving your models or to be able to create reports using data studio all of it on our manage services you don't have to deal with the infrastructure you don't have to have an SRE managing all of those pagers the other way to do this is doing it all yourself and rolling your own solution there's actually some very valid reasons why some customers would want to do this you might be a researcher and you want to be able to make changes to any part of the stack you want it might be that you've got a very custom pipeline or it could be that you want cutting-edge open source software to plunk in at any point you want there's lots of different reasons you might want to do that that's completely okay we love users like that you might also have a hybrid implementation where some stuff is on the cloud and some stuff is on Prem that's a very common use case we want to support that so doing it yourself and having a way to deploy that is really important so the exact same infrastructure that we had before which is managed the same kinds of open-source platforms are available it's for you to roll automatically on your own infrastructure you manage it and you get the exact same hardware that's powering the other solutions so we also make it really easy to get started with deep learning you know as deep learning has really been taking off as a really great way to find the insights and complex datasets and we provide a VM image that's been certified and optimized to work on GCE so out of the box you get a jupiter notebook you get access to all the hardware that chris is going to talk about in a moment and it's configured to get you the best results possible so with one click you can deploy this onto the machine of your choice getting access to any accelerators that you want and off you go it's instant ready to go you know we mentioned about the commitment that Google has to the open source community Kubb flow is a open source project that I love it started last fall as a way to on kubernetes be able to create micro services for specific emiltt jobs like distributed training or distributed serving of different kinds of models anywhere you want whether it's on GCP or on Prem so this is a highly portable way to deploy these containers everywhere you want and that way your deployments are consistent from GCP or run from and you don't have to worry about the resource matching because kubernetes takes care of that it's a kubernetes native way of handling all of that and again it's configured to work on CPU GPU and CPU on on GCE on Prem you get access to whatever you have internally so how that might look if you deploy that on GCE would be you would you would create your GE gke cluster which is a managed kubernetes cluster on G on GCP you would then be able to spin up your Jupiter hub notebooks spin up your tensor flow training service or you know any other framework that you wanted to put and then do the same thing for your tensor flow serving it would all have access to your shared storage on GCP natural to kubernetes so it's a great way to actually do this very portable manner that entire container and can then be deployed anywhere you want and it's a it's a fantastic solution so now I'm gonna pass the time on to Chris he's gonna talk about hardware Thank You Justin so going back to the takeaways being excited about ml feeling confident that you could implement ML Google Cloud and google's AI focus makes us the right partner for your ml workloads let's talk about that really quickly just to reiterate some of these things right if you're a developer and you want to implement ml you don't need to be an ml expert use our API models get started right away low risk if those pre trained ml models aren't to your liking or you need to do something custom use a web browser with Auto ml to create custom ml models amazing super simple and if you are a data expert or machine learning scientist or domain expert we have the great tools for your workloads as well you can successfully implement ml on Google cloud but let's talk about compute and Infrastructure briefly and how it relates to ml 80% of the recent AI improvements and advances have been attributed to more available compute power but at a recent tensorflow event a survey is found that people admit not having access to enough compute for their ml research that's a clear problem so let's go back a few decades because all of us in this room working on ml we're standing on the shoulders of giants neural networks and this concept of how ml works it's decades old taking a look at the human brain and how neurons are connected to each other and how I passing one information from one neuron to another it's an old concept but it's the recent implementation of large-scale data centers and hardware accelerators that have been able to enable the us to make these big neural networks and advances M L so the infrastructure matters and why it matters is no matter which path you take building custom models using Google mo models it's that infrastructure that's holding it up in our models we've already taken the data pass it through a great algorithms and pass it through this infrastructure large scale football sized field data centers over and over again to make these models better and better we're going to keep doing that and we with the Google Cloud we're giving you access to that same scale that same power to do it yourself and do it affordably one of our new ml customers on GCP is open ai and talk about large scale they went the unmanaged route they're a domain expert they're an AI thought leader and they're a nonprofit organization working on innovating with AI and making it open and safe they use a hundred thousand and more processors to do reinforcement learning they're using thousands of GPUs to do machine learning it's that access to scale that it's enabling enabling them to innovate and it's Google cloud that's providing it for hardware accelerators are so important and just hardware innovation with CPUs we have skylake but for ML workloads we also need for distributed training and large training jobs we need paralyzed compute power so we have historically since February 2017 we've launched three NVIDIA GPU models the K ATP 100 V 100 its high-performance passed through PCI with and with the V 100 we have n V link interconnections right super gray from L workloads the one thing that we make it a little different than some of our competitors is how we offer custom VMs take any amount of CPU any amount of memory whatever GPU type you have any number of GPUs create a VM use network attached storage or if you want fast disk i/o for a certain workload attempted in server SSD and just pay for what you want or if you have a bottleneck a just one of those some of our other competitors don't offer that flexibility so you save money and your animal jobs gonna go faster actually going back one this week we also launched the P for GPU brand-new it's coming out in a week it's great for ml inference workloads so we're gonna keep working with our partner Nvidia to launch new GPUs so we don't just stop there right I focus on Google we have the TPU line right we made cloud v2 TPU available last year it's an ASIC purposely built for machine learning and today we've made some new amount announcements v3 coming out faster cheaper ml workloads there's the TPU pod which is a series of TPU is connected with a fast network so again google's AI focus is building infrastructure we're training these ml models quicker and we're also offering it to you you should trust that we're the right partner for you ml workloads savings is a lot of money a big big deal for a lot of companies there's an assistant professor in Stanford who has a budget does some research and ml and he has a fixed you know only so much you could do so there's a win-win product of the unknown manager out preemptable VMS and printable GPUs and CPUs sometimes we have some spare capacity and ml batch workloads like training and inference it's we offer 70% off GPUs and TP use and announced this morning we lower the prices of TP use so now this researcher could use our spare capacity get some savings we run a batch workload it's not for all use cases because the capacity isn't guaranteed it's not always there but if you're a research and you need to do some work or a big organization that just needs batch workloads once in a while that's a great way to do more innovation with less money data is really important with ml Google has a great fiber network great internet connections so if you're moving your data large chunks in we have it handled if you have a large real-time incoming flow of data through various sources right we have cloud locations all over the world if you need to ship us some data we have an appliance we can get you to ship large amount it's not just compute it's not just the great AI services it's the network it's the security it's everything built in there so we talked about a lot of a s services giving you an overview and an intro we talked about how ml is not about inventing the impossible it's about reimagining and reinventing what you're doing today there's over 14,000 customers doing ml on GCP today so with our focus on open and hybrid and multi-cloud workloads our focus on hardware our new services that we're announcing and the keynotes you mentioned new auto ml services high quality KPIs doesn't matter how you want to do it should feel excited that you could do it you feel confident that you can successively do it and Google is the right partner for you there's a bunch of ways you can learn more get started get built one I'll call out specifically that I personally used was cattle cattle is an m/l competition service and community when I was learning ml I joined didn't know what I was doing right there was an image recognition competition where drivers were either paying attention to the road or feeling distracted so I joined the community I joined the ml challenge they had a lot of resources about how to use 10 to flow and how to pre-process the data and Google is using Kaggle to help the people in the world learn ml and you too could use it or if you're an organization there's a bunch of data set you can start a competition and have the world ml experts - ml for you there's a bunch of resources on how to learn about these services there's free credits if you're not a Google cloud customer already so with that we wanted to thank you our time is almost up we're going to do some Q&A so there's two mics on the other side and just ask some questions thank you [Applause] [Music]
