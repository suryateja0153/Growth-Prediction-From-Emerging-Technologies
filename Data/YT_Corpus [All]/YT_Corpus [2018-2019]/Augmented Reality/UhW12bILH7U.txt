 Digitalization is one of the most important driving forces for technological trends and new developments. The networking of machines and systems as well as gathering information on basic and status data of devices forms the basis for that. The added value this data provides is demonstrated in Phoenix Contact's in-house tool shop. Thanks to the comprehensive networking of all machines and tools in production, setup times of injection molding systems can be reduced significantly. Every workspace offers access to tool data and databases with animations and 3D models on every tool. In addition, toolmakers can also use augmented reality systems that facilitate processes and reduce the error rate. That's how the complex injection molding tools can be classified immediately. Sprue runners, heating and cooling circuits, as well as the optimum tool temperature are indicated. Precisely where they are located. The facility management in Bad Pyrmont also uses AR technology today. The required data is provided by “Emalytics”, the Phoenix Contact building management system. Thanks to the intelligent networking of the entire building technology, every user has access to the right information at the right time. External maintenance personnel is lead independently and informed about everything that is important in the event of a maintenance work. Controlled safety instructions are given directly on the spot, immediately before use. With the high level of data depth, Emalytics creates transparency. Augmented reality technology makes it possible to experience this transparency. If you are also interested in experiencing augmented reality with regard to Industrie 4.0 and building technology, come and visit us at one of our sites. Together with you, we develop your own digitalization strategy. From production to the intelligent building.
