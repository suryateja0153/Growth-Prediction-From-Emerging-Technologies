 How do you show the idea six million people who were murdered as individuals, not as numbers? So when we talk about augmented reality, what we're talking about is usually a computer generates an image that it projects somehow into the world around you. Usually people are talking about this to distinguish it from virtual reality, which is when you put on something like a big headset, and you're stuck in a computer-generated world, right? So it's like flipped? It's like flipped, exactly. So in this case we're using phones to allow the computer to know where you are and to give you additional information. So it's very simple. If you hold it up to some of the images on the wall, you will get some additional layers of content. The augmented reality was really cool because you could see how all their lives were normal and they were just doing normal activities like going canoeing or in a boat or they were in medical school. The pictures were just of every day life, and how much their lives were just normal and then it flipped and went upside down. The augmented reality definitely helped because a picture says a lot of things, but having the words to go with the picture just made the experience ten times better than it would be just looking at pictures. You take in a lot more information when you get to see the augmented reality. And it really gets to you more. It kind of gave pictures a sense of life. Like I was going deeper into just what they were doing. It helps you understand more. So it's not just looking at pictures. It's more of experiencing it better.
