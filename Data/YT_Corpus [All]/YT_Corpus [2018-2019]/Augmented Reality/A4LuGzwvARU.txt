 - Hi this is Dan, co-founder of Realar. We've got something really exciting which is our brand new app using the very latest augmented reality technology. Inside the app, we are using a camera to scan and find a place, select, tap, amazing, there's a house. You can place it where you want, but it's not a picture. It's actually a 3D model of a house, which means you can twist it around, move around it, absolutely incredible. Now let's go to where the magic happens. We are outside this time with an iPhone. It's the same house. We are switching to the direct feed from our app. Now we are full size, which means that as well as being able to simply move around it, you can actually walk through spaces and get a real feel for them, but the magic is actually being able to see outside and see things like real trees. Imagine now being limited to 2D plans, brochures, and websites. Now you can see kitchens for real. It's absolutely stunning. I just can't tell you how groundbreaking this is. We've specifically designed Realar so people like real estate agents, home buyers, home builders, really wanting to connect the home and land can visualize it. It's incredible.
