 [Music] m-city is unique designed to test connected and automated vehicles it's the only facility of its kind in the world it almost looks like a scene out of a movie and that's exactly what it's supposed to look like it's supposed to replicate a real City complete with traffic lights and street signs it's tucked away on the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor behind its charming look serious testing and research Kari Morton is the deputy director of M city looking at legal liability and insurance questions privacy cybersecurity understanding how to test and make sure these technologies are safe not many people get to visit this facility so we're glad we have the chance the future of level-4 autonomous driving is pretty amazing we're going to take you through m city and show you a test scenario our vehicle shows up as this green square on this iPad the yellow squares all around us our virtual vehicles essentially the cars are connected and actually talking to one another about the environment around them and you mentioned there's 300 thousand dollars worth of sensors on this car that's right yeah these sensors aren't cheap but that's because they're they're really a state of the art they're not made in high volume yeah you know just like our DVD players used to cost $1,000 you know you can get them for 10 bucks autonomous vehicles have certainly come a long way since they first burst onto the scene in 2013 so now we're gonna take a left and go down to our rail crossing we should have a commuter train that's scheduled to come through right about now here it comes we're gonna stop for that and you notice we're stopped back a little bit that's because there's a vehicle in front of us a virtual vehicle in reality transportation that looks like this is still a long way off however self-driving shuttles like this one could be on our streets in the next couple of years this one and others are already moving students around campus we stepped on to try it out it operates similar to the level 4 autonomous car we tested out earlier when we first see these shared level 4 vehicles likely they may be operating in a small urban environment or even as first mile what we call first mile last mile transportation so moving me from a commuter lot to my home at the end of my bus ride home from work for example or train ride so providing a connection into a more established transit system the big question will we ever be able to trust these self-driving vehicles recent studies show 70% of Americans are scared to share the road with an autonomous vehicle and only 21% say they'd ride in one not surprising considering there have been at least four deaths blamed on driverless vehicles that's why testing and research going on at M city is vital as engineers all over the world continue to tweet technology the industry is is moving all in this same direction which is providing a failsafe path whether it's pulling the vehicle to the side of the road putting the hazards on for example but making sure that when the vehicle is in a situation I can't control if there were no human to take over that it moves to a failsafe position automatically so when the vehicles are communicating with each other and also with the traffic infrastructure they can act as a collaborative ecosystem and operate on the whole much more efficiently reducing emissions fuel consumption as well as congestion
