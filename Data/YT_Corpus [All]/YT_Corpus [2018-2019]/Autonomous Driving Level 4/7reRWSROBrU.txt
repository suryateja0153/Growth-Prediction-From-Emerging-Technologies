 technology advances the road to self-driving cars as becoming well-traveled the quest usually brings to mind a sedan or something for personal transportation but the Southwest Research Institute has been working with something a little bit bigger Garrett Berger takes this to the track to see the possibility of future trucking this is big red and it doesn't need you it drives itself around corners and potholes the self-driving truck was developed by the Southwest Research Institute big red navigates based on previously taking pictures of the basement so after one pass to create a map we can go back and we can recognize those spots and when we recognize those we can know where we are to better than an inch of accuracy at speeds over 80 miles per hour well much of the hype about self-driving cars revolves around passenger vehicles münster says there's a lot of money to save and trucking besides possible safety benefits he says automated trucks could drive in convoys much closer together than humans then you can actually get a much better fuel economy like over a 10 percent savings in fuel economy which doesn't sound like a lot but when you're spending hundreds of millions of dollars in diesel fuel you know you're saving a few million dollars and it's backing up abilities could be used as a sort of trucker training wheels for new drivers big red doesn't have any experience on the highway it lives mostly on this loop here but it's not meant to be the road ready product big red is just a way for s WRI to showcase their developments and entice companies to hire them we need to come up with good ideas stuff that people might be interested in we do internal research projects and we need to put them on platforms but if this tech gets widespread on the road does that mean the end of truckers monster says time to tell I mean it's kind of a cliche but every time a door closes another one opens and so you know we create these capabilities that might eliminate one type of job but it's gonna create a lot of other different types of jobs for now s WRI is going to keep on trucking Garret furniture case at 12news big red isn't the only vehicle in SW our eyes fleet tomorrow on the six o'clock news see what else they're working with and what the future of autonomous vehicles could look like
