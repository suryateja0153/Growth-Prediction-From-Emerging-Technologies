 [Music] all right thanks for coming everyone we're gonna go ahead and get started today on behalf of the Center for digital strategies we are excited today to welcome will Collins back to tuck from drift so will will has been a trip for the last couple years prior to coming to talk he is a t16 provider coming to tuck he had a few different roles in venture capital and introduced himself more fully and I guess we met yak when in California put on a pre term trip maybe four or five years ago so so had a good kind of working relationship with will over the years and we're really excited for all the work that's happening at drift with chatbots and AI and what's happening in a conversational marketing and conversational commerce wherever your term of choice is as part of the bridge series as you know we're exploring emerging technologies this year for our 10th anniversary here with Britt and chatbox are squarely in that space and really exciting things going on that will it's gonna so please join me in giving a warm welcome back to top to welcome thank you very much I will try to be loud for those of you in the back it's good to be back yeah so so the the the two seconds of context on me and then I want to jump in right to the content and give you guys what you're hoping for I did finance and venture before tuck I thought long term I wanted to be an operator rather than an investor and so I landed adrift I graduated without a job so for all of you people you can do it don't be afraid take your time find what's right and I landed adrift August of 2016 to give you a sense of the pace I was the thirteenth full-time employee there we are now about 210 and so in about two years things have changed a lot we have progressed a lot in this area but excited to be here and share a little bit about how we view the world and what we're building and what we're focused on so I'm gonna start by just talking about who we are why we exist I think that context in the market is just as important as what we're building so I want to give you that text this is our mission we say we're the new new way for businesses to buy from businesses you know it'll be a little bit different if you were selling to a consumer so we kind of call that out here but keep this in the back of your mind this is the mission this is what we're building long term for those of you who have followed the live-chat market it largely started as a support tool you probably have been on Comcast web site 15 years ago you could chat in and say hey I need to change my credit card number or you overcharged me or I've got to return my box whatever the case may be and and chat was it was simply a portal it was a way to talk to somebody one-to-one and and why companies bought it ten years ago was hey if if you you know instead of having somebody to call center on one telephone call you can have somebody in a call center on three chats it was a simple like cost ROI there was no intelligence there was no routing there was no AI chat BOTS didn't exist but it's been around a long long time we're not the first to do we don't claim to be but I think it's an important distinction it started as a support tool and and what we started to focus on was we said no no no you're missing the boat this is this is messaging should be used to drive revenue it's actually a sales tool it's brand building it should be a way to interact with your customers in a more meaningful way and so that's how we're a little bit different than a lot of people out there these are some of the brands that we work with today not all this is public but folks you're gonna recognize peloton we work toast Eventbrite GE octo Marketo slack LM a right these are probably but brands you've interacted with in some for another even McKinsey but the reason we exist and and the reason we started this business a few years ago I'm using the collective we I wasn't there but we saw this massive shift in buyer behavior so we use this slide a lot and we we share just a penetration of messaging as a whole if you look back at the far left in the early 90s how many people were on am okay I'm not not that old that's good I was as well your away message right messaging isn't new it's been around for a long long time and and those tools you know back when you were dialing in on your phone line probably got to like 50 or 100 million users we had sort of a second wave of messaging in the early 2000 Skype blackberry messenger how many people use blackberry messenger okay yeah a lot of us right I probably got to two hundred three hundred million users if you look at 2010 on that group of providers Facebook whatsapp WeChat line they go from about zero to a billion users under five years and so what we looked at in 2014 was okay that's less time than most companies have to replace their crm let alone figure out how to deal with a new channel yet this is what our buyers are signaling how they want to interact how they wanted a cave and and we saw this paradigm shift happening and we wanted to work with companies you know to deal with it another thing that's happening is is the power is shifting from sorry from sellers to buyers that's backwards and what I mean by that is like why did Amazon V borders why did Netflix beat blockbuster yes they had some technology in the background but they offered a better experience right they were able to capture demand the movies on Netflix are no different than the movies that were at Blockbuster right it's a more convenient way for you to ingest the books on Amazon are no different than the books you got in the store and blockbuster right why do Airbnb beat hotels actually even most of Airbnb inventory already existed before Airbnb did it's because they were able to capture the man provide a better user experience on the front end and it was a buyer focused experience right same thing with uber why they beat caps who loves to take a cab in Boston it's miserable you get yelled at if you don't pay cash they go the wrong way it's like you're riding in a jet not a fun experience oh and by the way here's what the marketing and sales landscape looks like if you think there isn't a replacement to your tool today I would love to argue with you this is what it looks like thousands of companies five six years ago this slide was maybe 50 people and so the point being user experience buying experience they all matter and if you're not providing that kind of experience your customer is gonna go somewhere else right and and at the same time a lot of the tools that you see in that last side are actually focused on a company problem not a customer problem they're focused on you know like Salesforce everybody knows Salesforce it's a database it's used so a company can project their revenue it provides absolutely no value to a customer right and and we're all used to this at the same time right like look at Amazon one-click this is what you're used to in your in your consumer life go to a business so this is best-in-class the consumer world this is what b2b looks like you go to a website they ask you to fill out a form you become a lead in their CRM you get like 50 nurturing emails then someone decides you're qualified maybe you came to the website maybe you opened six emails maybe they finally looked at those emails and said hey this person is actually somebody that's a good fit for us then someone called you then maybe you talked to somebody right this I've got a good story I tried to buy Salesforce 100 billion dollar SAS company today the largest out there it took me a month to do it I showed up credit card in hand fifty thousand dollars ready to buy I've implemented a few times fill out the form twice no one got back to me I actually had to chat in they routed me to someone in Toronto Toronto said I'm not your rep I'm gonna push you to New York I got to New York and then they wanted to have a qualifying called and they wanted to have a technical call then I bought a month fifty thousand dollars right that's crazy and we spent about forty five billion dollars in b2b just to get people to a forum the best analogy I have for this I'm gonna come back to that is this so imagine you are in Boston on Boylston Street whether you're Microsoft or Apple you just spent like ten million dollars building a store you've got all your products in there they look pretty there's descriptions people can come in and try them and literally no one is in there there's no cash register there's no people to help you that is the equivalent of what we do in b2b today this is what we expect though right we walk into Apple somebody helps us oh you're looking for a watch come over here can I you buy that let me show you how to use the product let me sell you the new MacBook Pro let me teach you a course on how to use your iMac right that's the experience we all know and love but this is the experience we're getting and so we spend about forty five billion dollars to get people to our forums in b2b average conversion rates 0.7% which means that 99% of that traffic that we just paid for is wasted right out of a hundred people that walked in ninety nine walked out of your your store right and so that's the problem ultimately that we're trying to solve adrift and and we tested this so this is these are results from a study we ran using Mechanical Turk we became leads in about a thousand b2b company funnels so we had people go out and fill out these forms and we timed how fast people got back to us and literally nine percent were able to get back to us within an hour twenty seven percent within a day fifty five percent never even got back to us which is pretty insane right these are companies that are paying lots of money to get impressions to get you know your your thought your time to get you into their store and they won't even respond when you choose to engage right I use this because this is neutral third-party research this is a company called data box they actually benchmark a lot of our customers and look at what the response rates are using chat BOTS you can see about 59 percent talk to 10 percent or more of the people that walk into their store right whereas the average for a forum is one you know a 10x increases is pretty meaningful we as a company so we run a drift we call them chat Duty shifts we all have a couple hours a week now we probably talked to 25 percent of the people that come to our website that could be current customers new customers and nonnamous visitors whatever the case may be meaningful difference than the one percent that you see from from most people out there right so reason this has not happened in the past is that scaling this is really really hard right scaling conversations is hard how many people have called their bank recently anyway okay I just did the other day it was terrible this is how I felt IVR was supposed to kind of do this you know when you call your bank and they're like okay what's your account number you type it in like they do a couple things where you can get your bank balance or whatever but if you actually want to talk to somebody then you have to repeat your account number again and again and again and then they transfer you and again and it's miserable the whole time and none of that actually flows through in a conversation right and they're probably understaffed so you're waiting like 15 20 minutes to get to somebody right because it's a cost for their business and they're trying to reduce it every year oh and by the way you know this is probably what you know and b2b like lots of our calendars look like we don't have time to sit there all day and just respond to people right we've got meetings we've got I don't know visits we've got recruiting to do we've got interviews we got demos you know it's hard to get people to sit on the back end especially in a b2b company and field all these questions that's why people have been pretty slow to adopt historically so what we do adrift so we use conversation conversations in AI to engage with customers you can see that 24/7 365 in real-time when they're on our site when their intent when they walk into our store and and the results are real we're using it to drive revenue so this is just I'm gonna get into bots and AI and a little bit more depth here but this is how people talk about it and and and how we're specifically focused on revenue these are like random tweets so that coming in the that tweed in the top left that's the CMO at a company called rapid miner in Boston they're probably a hundred and twenty people chat is now their number one source of leads in the middle you can see like millions of dollars every time you log into our platform you're gonna see how many conversations how many sales leads how much revenue are we driving for you on the right this is a company called apes which I think we generated about two million dollars for the pipeline for them in a couple months so you or conversations talking to your customers talking to those people that walk into your store means more revenue and that's the line that we're trying to drive but and we do it with bots so bots can do three things well or I'm gonna talk about three things so the first thing is complete tasks for you and you guys are probably all used to this kind of view right I have to Alexa's I'm sure you all have at least one or having interacted with one before you wanted to play your favorite music right you want to order pizza from dominos you want to turn on your lights at your home you want to request an uber or you want to find a local business whatever the case may be it's very good at you telling it to do something and it will go out and do it right it's convenient it saves you time how do we do something similar so you probably land on one of our sites or you go to drift calm you'll see this happen there's a lot of stuff that happens in the background I can talk about that but there's probably some message that pops up hey welcome can we help you what are you looking for maybe a bod pops up and asks you what company you with oh what's your role are you looking for X Y or Z and then if you're like the right fit and you're looking for a sales person for example we'll even go into you know the calendar of one of our sales reps and say oh this person is open at these three times do you want to book a meeting right right away a similar analogy this would be like you you want to book an appointment at the Apple Genius Bar right you don't want to just show up and wait in line or whatever the case may be you want to get to an answer and book a meeting quickly so this is an example of our bot that has enough intelligence to you know figure out who you are look in our system see if you exist if you already do it's gonna know who you are and probably route you to the right person but if it doesn't it'll ask a couple of clarifying questions and figure out who the right person is for you to meet that could be in sales that could be in customer support that could be you know based on where you're coming from in the site or the keywords that you're using whatever the case may be it's got an intelligence layer to help you complete that task right and this is predominantly when we look out at chat BOTS and AI what most what most people are doing today it's interesting it's helpful it's convenient it's more difficult than you would think but it's not that hard but we all love it because it's getting something done for us in real time and it's and it's quick and you get some pretty funny messages actually from customers like even so this is this is somebody that part of our capability is for us to tell if we're reaching out to you in multiple channels we can marry those and say oh Jeff is actually the one reaching out to you he's your account rep oh he's already emailed you we should like fire a personalized message that says I know we're talking over email but if you want to book a meeting like I'm here available go ahead and do it and this was this is somebody from Glassdoor actually that that company if you use them she's her mind's blown just because she all the context is there she's quickly routed to to the right person she can book a meeting in real time without interacting with anybody and she's in and out within 20 seconds of what she was trying to accomplish right so i bleeped out some of the expletives that's an example another thing that chat bots do today that i think is like evolution number two is is find an answer an answer for you by the way if people have questions while I'm going interrupts please so here's Siri what song is playing right now we've probably all done this at some point and Siri knows okay it's got to go find Shazam it's got to figure out it's got to like pass your data to Shazam and say what song is this it's got to send data back and pretty quickly it finds you know it finds you an answer it helps you navigate to an answer it find you the cons you're looking you're looking for or whatever the case may be we we have a similar product so what we do at rift is think about your website as a whole trove of content right and if you've spent any time in b2b websites they're not that intuitive it's not like you go there and you just search for one product you know what you're looking for and you transact right you're probably going there to learn about the company learn about the product learn about a specific integration does it fit into your company or not etc and it can be pretty daunting to find your way around and so part of what the bot will do and we call these skills similar to like an Amazon would if you write in and say how do Play Books work instead of waiting for somebody on our support team to come in and say oh they work this way and here's what you got to do and point you to a help dock or whatever the case may be the bot has actually ingested all the content of our website and uses like fuzzy matching logic to ingest what you've asked and find what the most relevant articles are for you and here's an example of where it's sent for and you know frankly once we send for like 90 plus percent of the time the person says great this is really helpful I got my answer I can move on and and they've got their answer either they've navigated to the right place they've got the right content or you know if if we don't they can say I know this doesn't really work and we'll route it to a human - to actually intervene in that case so automating whether it's a navigation issue or a Content issue or getting you an answer pretty you know it's more difficult than task-based but still you know not not not too bad and the third of the hardest and where the world is going I think this will be useful for everybody to know is to automate the whole conversation right and not have buttons and not have specific tasks and be able to ingest what you've said in a way and and figure out what your intent is what the entities of the conversation are how you want to be responded to what what kind of response are looking for and actually have multiple questions multiple asks multiple interactions with you in the single conversation and know when it's over intelligently right anyone seen this movie yeah it wasn't bad a little weird the the premise is he this is Joaquin Phoenix right he falls in love with Siri basically because series like this personality in his ear and she can interact with him all day all night and becomes his best friend and it's a little weird but that's like the holy grail of AI and chatbots the ability to have multiple interactions have a full thread no when a conversation is you know going well not going well and and how to finish it so this is an example someone will come to one of our pages and say like what's the price of your standard plan very simple question and how the model works just so you guys have a sense is it has to go through like these five things key words what are the key words in the sentence it has to identify those like what's the filler language what isn't and why it has to do fuzzy matching we are all very bad typers very bad and you're gonna miss a keystroke you're going to use slang you're going to forget a question mark you're going to you know miss a space or whatever the case may be it's got to use a bunch of matching logic to actually parse out what the words are that you're using in the event it doesn't know it's got to figure out your intent what kind of output are you looking for do you want an article do you want a response do you want a number do you want a price do you want like whatever the case that may be entities it's got to figure out who is you who is me who is we who is he who is she write all of that that can be confusing and then dialogues is just a fancy way of saying like all of these things fit together in one way and they have to be in a certain order and you've got to be able to like if I wrote back to that $50 plan you standard or something you'd be like okay this doesn't make much sense you maybe piece it together but it would be confusing so it's got to run all these micro little tasks to figure out where things fit together so that's what happens and so it identifies price okay that's important standard plan is is like an entity that you're looking for standard is the type of plan that you're looking for it's a question you're you're expecting a response there and then the order of all these words and effectively what ends up happening is these models and I am NOT a machine learning expert by any stretch of the imagination but I've been involved in some of these effectively what they do is they build these really really really really really big trees decision trees and each of these have weights and they decide based on what you've said where you should go down the tree and they are more dynamic than this but this is an example you can read it it's kind of weird I googled it but the point is it's a tree it's a decision tree and at each point there's you know probably for that given sentence in and of itself like there could be hundreds of these happening at the same time trying to figure out you know standard and plan what does that mean the price trying to figure out where the words go together trying to figure out you know what how to respond all of those things are kind of happening in parallel in the background and it'll come up with like a few options and I just used these confidence intervals to keep it simple but you know the price of our standard plan is fifty dollars maybe it's option a and option B says you know the price of our our Pro Plan is five hundred dollars and maybe an option a with only a little bit of data they're like okay I'm forty-nine percent confident that that's the right answer and an option B they're like well I'm 51% confident right answer and in this case it's going to be horribly wrong right it's going to pick option B and say I'm the most confident in that and I think that that's going to be the right response and at the bottom of the conversation you're gonna click that usually you'll see especially when it comes to chat bots on any of these sites some sort of customer satisfaction sort of rating at the end of it they're asking you to indicate did it work or did it not work and there is still yeah I mean we've even used IBM Watson like there is still a human element into all of these things and frankly gathering data is a really critical component of this so when you click this you're helping train the model you're helping go back into their archive of data and say this was wrong we shouldn't have been this confident we should not have picked this response and then they'll go back and actually if the model is smart it will actually learn why so if that same question came a second time and or maybe let's say you've had five million of these right you get pretty good at figuring out after five million times what the right response is to something like this and and maybe in the future it says okay I'm 90% confident that option a is the right one and only 80 percent confident and B and over time given enough responses and given enough training and enough sample data it gets pretty good now it probably wouldn't be 90 80 it'd be like 92 - but you get the point and then it's gonna choose option a and you're gonna say yep got it that was perfect right more feedback for the model yep that was right just like the regression analysis you guys all do in in in stats right like you run one model you figure it out like the p-value T stats all that kind of stuff yes I still have PTSD but then you run it again okay I got a little bit better my adjusted r-square went up you know what this does in real time in the background is it is a lit built to make those adjustments on the fly and so that's the model that powers it and this is what it looks like from a process perspective so usually you start with a bunch of raw data a bunch of conversations and the hard part about chat BOTS in particular is the basically they're they're exponentially difficult because every word that you add is another part of an interaction and so each sentence has ten words but then there's ten sentences and then there's paragraphs and then they're starting to stop and so they become really really hairy models but basically you add in raw data you come up with like your first confidence intervals then you start to introduce new data to the set and continue to test and then you get feedback you deploy it you continue to get feedback and you just circle back and back and back and back and back and as you can imagine over time you get much much better at it right so this is how many messages go over our platform today about ten million messages per day and so most of what you'll see from our bots at this point on on our pages if you go to Jeff comm or you go to a customer that's using us usually see like powered by drift in the bottom right so you can tell it's us most what we've spent most of our time doing is keeping you to a track for the most part we don't want you to get too far off the track maybe that's with buttons like you know when we ask you a question we'll give you four buttons you choose one maybe that's pre-canned responses or we know enough or we've had enough conversations to say okay if you respond with some of these words like I know enough to keep you going down the track or I know the context of the page well enough to guide you down but this is what's informing our models everyday and more and more what what you'll see us do and what we've already been doing is transitioning off of those guardrails onto something like this and so every single day we've got ten million more data points coming into this this worked this didn't work etc and and nowadays as you think about live chat and where it's going roughly 90% of all of our conversations are you know involves some kind of bot that could be a bot comes in in the middle of a conversation to do a task because that makes the most sense in that case that could be because you know it started the conversation because we weren't around at the given time you know it's midnight and somebody from you know Europe chatted in and wanted an answer to something or a prospect came in and wanted to book a meeting now and we you know just weren't there for whatever reason so about 90% of conversations there's still a small percentage where it's just gonna be human to human one-to-one again hard to scale but that still does exist and actually about 30% of our conversations are handled solely by the bot so this number we've seen as high as 40 to 50 percent in some scenarios and we'll get better as we transition from you know guardrails to that sort of more automated conversation but these are the numbers we track how that we track how often is about involved how how many times can we get you to an answer and a positive interaction without anybody being involved right and that number is about 30% today it fluctuates but I'd say that's the state of the market probably as a whole if you look at Amazon half the time you ask it something and it's still like I don't know what to do right it's training and they have I mean forget 10 million messages a day I can only imagine how many they have but I think that's par for the course very good at automating tasks very good at helping you find an answer can be super convenient for buyers customers prospects etc but we still have a ways to go and these models are still in their infancy and it it is always fascinating to me there are only a not necessarily a handful but a small number of people in this world that can build these models and have these libraries and have built out this kind of capability because it's pretty difficult and we have things go wrong anyone know who this is yeah who is it yeah it was a disaster so and I love Microsoft but basically what they were trying to do was get a bot on Twitter to interact with people and it became like racist in like 20 minutes like it was bad so it makes me feel better that we're we haven't solved the problem neither have they you know it's you know think look at look at slang see you soon right it's it's a it's a challenging problem and not everybody has figured it out yet I would say the other interesting piece of chat bots is because everything is actually in text it gives you a lot more capability than voice and so what Amazon and Google are trying to do and that's actually my next slide I think I don't know if that anybody has heard this or watched it has anyone seen this demonstration okay it's like a minute should I play it okay this is hard but I'll give you a sense of some of the not happening out here hi I'm calling to book a woman's haircut for our clients I'm looking at opening on May 3rd so I give me one mm-hmm or what time are you looking for well at 12:00 p.m. we do not have a false p.m. available but closest we have to that is a 1:15 do you have anything between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. depending on what service she would like what service is she looking for just a woman's haircut for now ok we have a 10 o'clock 10:00 a.m. is fine ok what's her first name the first name is Lisa I'll say perfect so I will see you leave by 10 o'clock on May 3rd ok 3 Thanks great have a great day so voice is a whole nother a whole other challenge but Google is probably the closest on that front I would assume Amazon is is not too far behind the reason you're seeing chat bots more the reason you will probably continue to see them more is because text is more controllable the input is more controllable building it into a model the data already exists in the same form that you're gonna be analyzing it all of that and and let's face it like Patrick and I were talking about this today a lot of companies are still trying to get into the cloud okay let alone like figure out some of this stuff and so I think voice will be kind of the next frontier for for for BOTS and the like but as far as today is concerned I think you're gonna see more and more chat BOTS you're gonna be interacting with them more they're gonna be there to serve as your concierge to a brand to get an answer to to find what you're looking for and slowly over time we're gonna continue to see this proliferation in - they're gonna actually handle the whole conversation and they're gonna have multiple interactions with you in the same sitting and they're gonna be following up with you one of the things that we've been baking in in the backend and our product as well is ok after this conversation what next right you left but you probably expected something maybe you got an answer there maybe you booked a meeting with somebody maybe we should follow up beforehand to make sure you get that email that we have a meeting in an hour or we should follow up with a personalized email from a sales rep and say I'm really excited here's what I know about your company here a couple quick questions just to make sure I'm prepared those are the kinds of things that we've already built into the product and we're continuing to to think through but still still a long way to go so quickly what are the challenges we get we have to build our libraries like we have to know what price means we have to know what standard means we have to build these really really big libraries on the back end to classify words we're still building those tracking and piping data this is you know the infrastructure and the demand from a data perspective is real here and a lot of systems even like Amazon Web Services is amazing but when you start to talk about Facebook ingesting every single post I mean those are billions and billions and billions of lines of text that have to be analyzed and coded and interpreted still something that we're working on from an infrastructure perspective failing gracefully that's a big one if we're gonna put this out and and this is something that we we work with customers all the time if we're gonna put a bot out on your site how do we make sure it's the right experience for your customer how do we make sure if something goes wrong the bot sort of politely steps aside and the human can intervene so that it's not a bad interaction that's actually the number-one pushback we get from brands what if something goes wrong what if you don't have the perfect model we have some fail-safes built in our product a lot of people do oh I'm sorry I don't understand let me get get somebody for you that's that's an ongoing challenge model training you need more data you got to continue B you got to continually be fixing your confidence intervals and how the model works and how it ingested and and and what it spits out and then visibility because some of these models are like a black box on the back end how do we know why it shows something I think we've got a long way to go on the machine learning side in terms of okay we chose this for these couple reasons or these are the main reasons we chose it and then when we go to debug we actually have a very good sense of what we're fixing and why we're fixing it because some of these models neural networks k nearest neighbor is anyone taken Powell's data mining class yeah right sometimes you put in data and you get out something and you have no idea why that's really hard for a business especially if you're going to be trusting your brand with with with one of these BOTS and so something that everybody in the industry when you go to a conference or you talk about AI or machine learning or whatever the case may be it's struggling with how do we give people the visibility into seeing when something works and why and when something goes wrong also why and how do we fix it so that's where we're spending a lot of our cycles today my final thought and then I hope people have questions because it's been a lot of me talking this is Molly Graham Molly Graham's adviser to us she was a very early investor at Facebook and I am no machine learning or AI expert but I think this is fitting which is she basically said you can learn anything if you're willing to sound like a complete ask the dumb questions don't be afraid if you're not you know super well-versed in you know whatever the backend technical piece is you can figure out chatbots they're not that complicated you can figure out AI or machine learning you may not be the person you know with a PhD in statistics building the model but you can still interact with it and leverage it so don't be afraid to ask questions thank you yes yeah honestly the the the biggest I think everybody is a fit we have chosen to focus on b2b customers first because the experience is so bad right Amazon is pretty good you go you can buy something relatively quickly they still put it in their checkout as well LinkedIn does there's a bunch of consumer brands that do as well but we chose b2b because you know like for some of these companies if they book a single meeting it can be worth millions of dollars and by the way like best-in-class is a forum actually best-in-class is like a forum to places so the bar is just so low and they've got a lot of traffic like they have a lot of high-value traffic they're paying for traffic they want people to come in to their site to learn more about their brand and they've never invested in brand and so giving them the ability to have these conversations and have them at scale means almost immediate ROI and an ROI on a tool like this can be thousands of times really really fast versus if you're trying to you know work in a in a shopping cart basket where you're gonna get it somebody to spend five more dollars thousands of times it's just a longer a longer tail and the volume will be higher in b2c so we do have you know peloton here's an example we do have higher we say is people priced goods that are on the consumer spectrum don't use us but that's why we've prioritized yeah so if you are gonna be a player of volume in the space today you have to be encrypted all the way in transit to at rest so like our company is anything you send from one place to another is encrypted and anything that's stored in any of our databases has to be encrypted and so that part of that is like if you're a big enough company and serving some of the brands that we do like fortune 500 companies they they can't have their conversations with our customers leaked and so that's kind of a security requirement on the other hand from an information security perspective we talked a lot about gdpr in Europe and and beyond right and that is we are technically capturing your email address your IP address we're looking up what company you're coming from before we even talk to you and we need to get consent for that so actually we've built in our product a way to do that so you have to opt in and say yes I want to have this conversation I want to give you this information you do have the right to store this transcript as I interact with you and we have to enable our customers to do the same thing now on the other hand if you looked at the different channels email voice chat chat is by far the highest in terms of customer satisfaction so that's like a 72% CSAT rate versus voices like 20 so it's it's how people want to communicate it they want to do it asynchronously they want to do it on their time and it's a lot more convenient than hanging on the phone so it's a balance right we want to make it easy for people to interact but we also have to make sure we're clear on what data we're tracking and storing and why yeah yeah good sorry my name is come into so one of the good things one of the characteristics of a good salesman was finding information of the customer and empathize with the customer so I'm curious to know do you see this problem of empathy with chatbots and if yes how are you solving that problem yeah it's it's a debate we have a lot which is like where should a chatbot be involved in where shouldn't it I think it's and and historically how we've sort of settled that debate is it should be additive to the experience experience it shouldn't detract from the customer experience so in the event you saw Lauren from from Glassdoor on their writing in she wanted to talk to somebody she and that was her rep and she wanted to talk to him and the fact that we had done all the work on the back end to figure out who that was and actually routed her directly to him was a very good thing and that's not necessarily a bot doing it it's some automation on the backend but when in doubt when there's a meaningful discussion to have like we would much rather have that be human to human but if you want to accomplish something quickly you want to get information or an answer quickly we optimize it for the experience and so there will be cases where we shouldn't have had a bot in there I'm actually in our product you can set different play books for different pages based on who's coming where and all that kind of stuff but it's to solve that exact problem we don't want a bot in every single conversation what we care about is the intent and is a customer getting to their answer quickly and that's what we try to optimize for yeah you talk a little bit about how you offer sort of personalized products on a per customer basis if I'm McKinsey the tone of my chat bot is going to be completely different if I'm like GrubHub where their website is a little bit snarky yeah absolutely work through that with such a wide variety of models yeah so it's going to do so basically the way our platform is built like you turn on the widget and then there's a bunch of stuff that has to happen on the back end what do you do with anonymous visitors what do you do with known visitors what messaging do you put on what pages when do you want the widget to show up when do not want it to show up and that's really where the hard work is done and so somebody like a McKinsey might say okay I only want to talk to fortune 500 brands that come to my site and are on this specific page and I want to tailor a specific response on that page maybe it's a white paper on chatbots right they're saying hey are you interested in this we have a partner that specializes in X Y or Z they can customize all that and so that's the that's the key to it it has to be hyper contextual and it has to be on brand and we give them the ability to set all of those parameters and what we do on our end from a company perspective is we have a team of customer success managers that literally make a custom the logo the look and feel when it shows up who's on the back end who gets routed who doesn't what playbook shows up on what page it's all customized depending on your needs and so that's like really the flexibility yeah we don't international we I think we have 15 languages yeah there is a fair amount of demand I mean if you looked at messaging as a whole it's actually more popular overseas even than it is in the US we we have about 15 languages there are some open source like translation tools through Google for example that we use that we can automatically pour it in so on one hand you can be English and on the other end you could be a bunch of different languages so we do have that ability now the challenge we have with it is you know so like sometimes the tone is super formal and it's awkward and people are like why are you using this terminology when it makes no sense when I'm having like a friendly conversation so we definitely deal with that it's it's one of the few tools that has the ability to go in that many languages but hasn't been a core focus for us but about you know 30 to 40 percent of our customers are international and probably half of those are english-speaking and the other half aren't so we definitely deal with a day-to-day yeah that's the yeah it's it's it's more to explain than it is to be perfectly instructive like we have a bunch of different models a tree is one of them there's cagey classifiers there's like neural networks there we run actually multiple models on the same data and we track who gets the best response over time and why the absolute that's what I mean by libraries you start with words and then they become phrases and then they become sentences and and you can actually relate to how close they are to one another and that can inform the model as well yeah yeah it's all even down to the database level segregated into their own and the second question is do you offer your clients some kind of interface for them to understand the appliance because by directing we didn't check off you definitely you have some pretty important yeah absolutely I would say we've done less on the like survey npf side of the world but we will don't we give them when you log into our dashboard the first thing you see how many conversations you're having how that's trending over time how many meetings you book how many qualified leads you've captured because we are more focused on revenue than we are support so that is definitely there then you also see here's how much pipeline we've generated here's how much business we closed etc and if you want to dig a layer deeper you can see ok my traffic is coming in at this time of the day here are the countries it's coming from here are the typical questions that are being asked asked here's how fast I am to respond to them here's who's responding to them and will drive specific insights as well as to what's coming up versus what isn't we're not as detailed as like a company like a Clara bridge that's gonna ingest all the text in your company and say like Red Roof Inn has thin walls relative to Marriott and I can tell that by all the tweets out in the world but we do give insights in the platform themselves exactly yeah and then whenever you write in as a company we've automatically like enriched with a bunch of different data sources to figure out who you are where you're coming from if we know who you are already like what kind of company it is what industry you're in how big you are how many employees all that what your tech stack looks like all that context so that you can have a meaningful conversation quickly yeah yeah so it can be set by admins we usually default to like a CRM to look at who owns an account first and we do some matching there that's unique and then either a company can set their own criteria so I only want b2b software companies that are over 200 employees that are in the u.s. that whatever and in some cases we can only show the widget to those people as well and we can pull in like hey I see you're coming from this company and yours in this technology have you thought about using drift or something right we can do that sort of level of personalization but the company can set what they want to be able to we call it a goal like when something happens you want to be able to book or you you know push them to a maybe it's a PDR or whatever the case may be you can do that routing sort of as you wish and we plug into other scores as well mad kudu is a company that does like machine learning lead scoring that plugs into our platform for example yeah like what's the biggest obstacle to like hitting that inflection point it's probably a combination of both and and every company is going to require some of their own context so it's it's probably both it's the infrastructure building the models tuning them writing the code to make sure they retune themselves that's that's a lot of work it's a full-fledged product on the back end and too you need enough data think of how many variations of a conversation there could be billions and so you you really need a lot of data to have and libraries mapped to really feel confident in the outcome I think the you know candidly I think the adoption rate of chat BOTS has a lot less to do with that than it does of the consumer experience like when I go to a site now we have we have people tweeted us or tell us this all the time like when I don't see that in the bottom right hand corner I'm worried because I know if I have to fill out a form or get in touch with a company it's never gonna happen and so I think what what we see is the primary driver short term are actually companies trying to be more customer centric they're trying to give a brand experience that they that they're proud of and they want people to be able to interact with them and they know if they don't do that that customer is gonna go somewhere else so that that's more of the driver and the chatbots tends to be the reflection of okay now I've got all these people that want to have conversations how do I do this in an efficient way and in the right way so a little bit of both yeah yeah it's so I'd be curious if someone's popping to your mind on the consumer side that does it really well like there's certainly whatsapp there's messaging companies right that have sort of the infrastructure layer in between Facebook sort of has a messenger bot but it tends to be more ad driven than anything else it's it's not so much like have a conversation so and we know those guys very well so I think it's possible it's definitely possible the hard part about b2b is all of the routing that has to happen on the back end you have to like there isn't usually a check out on a b2b site if you don't get an answer you don't get an answer in consumer if you don't get an answer like you probably go to a review or you ask a friend or something like that and b2b like the drop is just much much larger and you have you know like a drift for example you have 60 salespeople how do I know which one to send it to how do I know that everybody's getting their fair share how do I know if someone's already talking to somebody at another channel they're getting routed into that conversation those kind of challenges don't exist in b2c and so the use cases is different and you have to integrate with Salesforce from Marketo and part out and alcohol and all these other tools to really work for a company whereas you know if if you're a b2c company like it's probably just a volume thing like I just need a person and it doesn't matter who on the back end is to respond to these things or a chatbot so it's a slightly different use case and I think there are very different needs from a company perspective yeah technology people do you think that they're supposed to really need that chat box become a commodity yeah well I think they're going to be maybe not ten years I think they're gonna become like a level playing field I think they'll become par for the course if you don't have one you will be sacrificing your user experience and so I think the motivation for a company to have one is very very high and and it's also something you know as you think about call centers or the experience and how you're interacting with people that has never really been figured out not in a good way even calling a call center today I mean outside of Zappos why does Zappos exist like that was their whole thing they were good at customer success that was it and now they're a multi-billion dollar company right so plenty of companies will struggle with it and I think for people who want to compete and be brand centric and customer first they're gonna have to have something like it so that's really going to be the the commoditization of it how you solved the problem what model is the most accurate you know how it plugs into other sources I think that's gonna take longer to figure out yeah yeah I knew you find on the data input side when people know they're interacting with the five-person division exchange so we always do and it's its guidance we give our customers as well if you have a bot it should be a bot there are companies that send out automated emails that don't tell you it's bot there are companies that will have chat BOTS that they don't indicate we found people want to know and they appreciate when they do know and actually from a satisfaction perspective it doesn't make a difference in fact if they're getting their answer that's really what they care about and so will correlate like one about was involved what the satisfaction of that conversation was when it wasn't when it was partially involved etc we're looking at all those metrics and it doesn't really make a difference so I don't think people mind when they are talking to a bot as long as there's a way to get out quickly and they know it if those two things are true then you're probably fine if not we've seen people get frustrated yeah when you have this feedback system from the clients and if they're poles make a mistake at the client like the answer but a sexual yeah so I sort of alluded to this before but that's that's we call it like human in line you have to have a human element in all of these like Watson included right no system is perfect yet and no system will clarify something like that so if your confidence interval is high and the satisfaction is low we can actually look in the data and flag those kind of responses and and dig into them and figure out what was going on and actually give the model like the right output but there's absolutely still a human element to it and we have to you know look at a bunch of conversations and give them the yes or no or right or wrong to sort of indicate to the model [Applause]
