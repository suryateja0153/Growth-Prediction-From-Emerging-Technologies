 hi I'm Peter Hodgson I'm an interaction designer working on conversations with the Google assistant and over the next few minutes I'll be describing the core pillars to be conscious of when you're designing conversational experiences and some hard learned design lessons but first let's talk about conversation itself for many people who are new to designing and building conversational experiences this is the big question in their mind I mean you can talk I can talk how hard can it be well it turns out that we humans have had a lot of practice with conversation recent evidence suggests that humans have been conversing for up to half a million years researchers have discovered that the common ancestor of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens had the hyoid bone in their throat which controls the tongue and conversation is inherently social and contextual every one of us here has been practicing speaking since before we could walk so it's literally instinctive to us which makes it extremely complex and subtle and hard to codify as a colleague of ours likes to say we don't have to think about conversation in the same way that fish don't have to think about the water the key point for us all is that people aren't going to change how they converse anytime soon so we need to design conversational interfaces to match people's expectations we're teaching computers to speak human not the other way around the good news is that people have been studying and researching language for a long time and we can leverage that knowledge when designing conversational interfaces and when you're starting to design conversations there are three ideas or pillars that I think you should pin on the wall the first pillar is the co-operative principle identified by the philosopher of language all Grice it describes the rules and assumptions we all abide by in our conversations and we do so entirely subconsciously his Maxim's of quality quantity relevance and manner can be used as reliable guidelines when you're creating conversations for example the maximum of quantity says that we expect participants in a conversation - and I quote not make their contributions more or less informative than is required to advance the conversation and I'll bet you can all recall conversations you've had with people who are not abiding by this Maxim that's the person who talks too much or the person who doesn't say enough so I encourage you all to study the co-operative principle in detail if the co-operative principle deals with the content or the fuel of a conversation then turn-taking is the engine and the gearbox and it's the second pillar to bear in mind turn-taking is the mechanism by which we resolve ambiguity and repair conversations in order to progress to a final resolution linguists will refer to people handing the turn or taking the turn in a conversation and in the real world we use linguistic prompts questions or just body language to signify when the turn should be taken for the moment virtual assistant understand none of these subtle social cues so turn-taking for conversational assistants has to be more explicit and we have to manage this when writing dialogue so it doesn't become unnatural or robotic the third pillar is to design conversations that work for the users context talking to machines is still in its infancy and people still find it socially awkward so you should actively focus on the user's physical context and the kinds of conversations are open to in that context and look to design for simple intuitive high-value conversations while people are in socially safe environments and where voice interactions have less friction than touch so the three pillars are the co-operative principle turn-taking and the user context and here are my five top lessons learned first persona designing or assistance persona is not a nice-to-have it's a must-have there's another video in this series and it's a detailed talk about this topic which I encourage you to watch but it's worth highlighting here a persona is a style template for your brand you should design it and use it to provide a common understanding and a reference for consistency during every step of your conversational design develop as another colleague puts it if you don't clearly define your brand personas then your users will second and another must do start with the sample dialogue whatever the platform you'll be deploying on create end to end sample dialogues for the most likely cases writing the dialogue will help to discover more cases and the conversational logic you'll need to build don't just write the dialogue speak it out loud with someone else it'll change what you've written and present dialogue to stakeholders in the audio channel not as written text you can record it using a TTS engine and listen to the playback after you've nailed the most likely cases in the sample dialogues then design all the repair cases designing for conversational repair is the topic of another video but bear these things in mind we need to make conversations work well when it goes off track these can be points of great user frustration and so if handled well they're great opportunities to rebuild user trust and confidence your assistance should be forgiving remember people are instinctively trying to be cooperative but we're human and we make mistakes so we need to be highly focused on helping them get back on track as naturally as possible and here's a top tip a key approach for identifying repair cases is to prototype the conversation as early as you can in the process write and perform the conversations with real users and use Wizard of Oz techniques with audio recordings to test your conversational structure and dialogue next we're building a system for users to access their assistant anywhere so you must consider your conversational experiences across modalities and surfaces in some cases the conversational logic might have to change depending on the surface for example presenting choices to users on an ice free device such as a Google home requires different dialogue strategies than when the user can pick from a list of choices on a screen and designing for multimodal conversations with the screen is hard the important thing to remember is that in multimodal conversations the screen is only one output of the conversational state there's both audio and visual channels to be quarry so think hard about the best channels for information transfer what's best on screen what's best in audio where's the right balance for your conversation in a multimodal experience screens are really great for presenting large amounts of information they're great for displaying touch affordances to repair or to progress a conversation more quickly than with another spoken turn and the screens are useful for orienting user and wayfinding in a multi-step tasks finally with the assistant you're designing for use over time the second conversation with the user will always be different from the first and the third may be different from the second we expect a conversational assistant to understand and remember us so the conversations should reflect map memory just keeping track of previous conversations and uses context and adjusting the conversation based on these cues will increase the perception of an intelligent agent significantly so design your persona always start with the sample dialogues repair with context sensitivity design cross-platform from eyes-free to multimodal and design for frequency and never forget the co-operative principle good luck with your conversation design and thanks for listening
