 cap of what's going on you just saw the Kino people are headed off to the lunch area right now but we wanted to keep the content flowing for you so that you can actually hear from the people that are innovating here at Microsoft today we're gonna talk about AI I have the corporate vice president of AI platform Eric Boyd how are you doing my friend I'm doing well thank you for having me and we have Chris Lauren as well principal program manager on the AI platform how are you doing my friend fantastic thanks well it's so good to have you because first of all I'm all about AI you probably know that I love AI and I think it's great but I feel like for some reason it's a little mysterious so why don't you give Deb's a sense for what AI actually is and how we're helping them as a company absolutely you know we've sort of AI does get built up as this magical box where you someone some scientists and research into some incredible thing that makes this incredible technology work and in reality it's a much simpler process it's you need to figure out how do you take a large amount of data with some examples of hey this is a good example or bad example and then train a model and train a model also sounds really hard and like do I need to have a PhD and in calculus or something it's really pretty straightforward with the tools that we have now you can basically train this model just straight away using the tools that you had the visual studio tools for AI as UML lots of the things that we provide make it really straightforward and so you know what is AI it's I want to predict anything I want to predict housing prices I want to predict how much water is left in this cup anything that I might want to predict if I can find some samples and I can train a model it's gonna go so much better than trying to come up with a heuristic or doing it that way yourself awesome so Chris what are some of the tools that we're building to help developers developers do this and me and Chris work together a lot in fact I think we have a session on Wednesday I keep saying Thursday for some reasons making you nervous right I'm gonna write a classifier to determine whether this set shows up on time good luck okay so tell us about the tools that we're building to help developers make these kinds of models sure absolutely so we've invested heavily in making sure that both we've got a great Python SDK using Azure machine learning to train models in the cloud that's for data scientists for developers we're also making its ooh four easy to grab these train models whether they're pre train models that are available on github downloaded from the azure ml model gallery and add those models whether they're tensorflow models or onyx models into their applications super easily generating c-sharp code and building their apps just like they would any other kind of apps but now they're infused without intelligence that makes them the next generation of applications that are really fun and enjoyable to work with and do things that you never could write the code to do with without those models so we keep saying the word models a lot but what exactly is a model and how are they built sure so a model is is basically just the description of how you're gonna make your prediction so if I want to predict a housing price I have a whole bunch of inputs like the square footage or the number of bedrooms and then I feed that through the model and so the model is just sort of saying how do I multiply this what functions do I apply to this what different weights does it learn and then that outputs a prediction of this is what the house ought to be worth and so that's what the model is it's it's effectively the software that you just produced that will create a prediction for you and the magic of AI is that you can come up with this really you know an incredibly large model that you don't really understand how it works but because you can train it and because you can use the AI training algorithms and it does the back propagation for you it actually learns what are the best weights to provide predictions that are way better than you could possibly do on your own so that's what a model is it's just the output of what you've just trained it's your your AI predictor so as a programmer when you're thinking of a model should you think of it as an asset or a unit of execution I mean what what are we thinking about so you should think of a model as essentially a intelligent library or like a function that you can add that does something like a skill it's the library like creating PDFs or anything else you simply add to your application and then call it and pass in some input and you get some output in this case it might be the prediction of the house price or something like that and so that that asset is something that you would treat with something you would want to update over time just like any other asset that you would use we've got a version it you've got to deploy it you got to run it somewhere whether in the cloud or on the edge in your app on your device so as we're talking by the way please we have the questions open so please ask us any questions you want well they will answer them graciously so let's talk about the training process because now the way I'm understanding it is we have this process where you build a model and that takes some time and then we have the process of using a model which should be faster so we should separate the two right and so let's talk about the training process and what are some tools in Azure that actually help us with training sure so you know when you're training a model that's can be one of the most expensive steps in terms of how long it takes and how much computing power it takes and one of the real advances in the last you know few years in machine learning is all around how GPUs have been able to dramatically accelerate this training time and so things that would take hours and hours and hours of train on a CPU now you can use a GPU and it'll go much much faster and so on as you're using Azure batch AI you can get access to lots of GPUs that we have available and you can use some of these algorithms will help you distribute the training to even more GPUs so if you have a particular algorithm that or a particular data set that's even larger than that then you can use distributed training to go and train them on there so that simplifies things dramatically other things that will help you with the training process a lot of times you want a model that does something that's similar to what other people have already done and so we just announced today the a juror machine learning packages which are there's a vision package a language package and forecasting package and so you know those will sort of help you with here's the framework and the scaffolding that you need for training your model for something you can kind of take something that already exists and go and iterate from there so those are just a couple of the things that we've offered and really we have a complete platform to really dramatically simplify all the things that you might need to do in the training process everything from how do you prepare your data Scott walk through a lot of the data bricks things that you can do to then how do you train your model and how to use Azure ml to sort of manage the training and there are a lot of steps in it that can get really quite complicated you'll hear people talk about hi for parameter sweeps and things like that and man that sounds pretty hard we have you nose tools that will manage all of the hyper parameter sweeps for you and and you don't even have to think about it you just sort of say yes I want the best model I can get please go and do that for me so really you don't even have to like it's good to know this stuff cuz I I love it I think it's great you know that the man I am in fascinated by the math I'm passing by the models but if you're not we have tooling that will help you take care of that for you absolutely I think about it machine learning is gonna turn into the thing that you take a class in college when I was in college I took a class on compilers I wrote a compiler it was the hardest class I think I took in college and I've never written a compiler since but I use them all the time and so the understanding of how does it work and this having that background is pretty helpful and I think that's what AI is gonna turn into is you got to understand well how does backpropagation work and what are you doing with the model and when you're training what are the different things how does regularization help you all the different things that's important to know but as you use it every day the tools are gonna abstract all that away from you so it's good to know it'll make you a better developer the more you know but it's gonna get much much simpler it's gonna become ubiquitous hey I everyone needs to be developing it if you haven't started on it go get started maybe it might be a little too late but you could we have all the tools to help you I don't think it's too late I think this is where day one of a giant industry and but I think everyone needs to be jumping on it awesome so what tips do you have for devs that want to get into this space you know the easiest way to get started is to use pre-built capabilities like our cognitive services in Azure you can build amazing image classifier so if you have some sample images or you download some sample images off the web let's say classify the difference between is this soda or is this beer for example you can just grab a bunch of images put them into little folders on your on your machine and use Visual Studio tools for AI that even generates code for you that'll upload that data to the custom vision cognitive service train a tensorflow model and even download that models to include in your application or don't even worry about that and just call the model directly in the cloud so you don't even have to write code you just have to have samples of data and an idea as to what you want to predict and you can let the azure AI platform take care of the rest for you and that's kind of cool because that now that I'm thinking about what you're saying you're talking about models we have models that have already been trained that you can just call right now cognitive services absolutely we have models that you can customize a little bit with things that we understand like for example custom vision or Lewis or whatever you should just start with those first I got absolutely I mean as a developer you know I always focus on productivity and if I just want to sprinkle some AI on my app and it does the job for me that's fantastic but sometimes I need to go a little bit further say okay I want to tweak the model a little bit to do something that it didn't previously do then I want to take the next step and customize that model and then if I am super interested in learning on how it works then I can absolutely use some of the samples that are online through the azure ml samples gallery download some sample code and train my own model from scratch and really get a feel for how the code actually works awesome and there I was gonna say there are lots of examples where if you're trying to learn this stuff you can go to Azure notebooks and there are within as your notebooks there Jupiter notebooks that are run hosted in the cloud for you and Jupiter notebooks for those who haven't seen them our great ways of sort of walking through and learning something it mixes the code with sort of the text explaining and sort of the output graphs on there and so they're great tutorials I took a bunch of them just really get ramped up on how do you do some of this like if I want to do to transfer learning well let me go look at the Jupiter notebook that explains this little transfer learning is this is how you do it this is why you do it there's a lot of great resources that you can use there that's amazing so for those that are getting started you're saying take a look at cognitive services take a look at notebooks for those who want to get more involved in AI and want to get into maybe the fundamentals or want to start working on something what's a good way to get started I mean you know if you're talking about sort of becoming the AI expert which is you know where people need to be heading you know you need to learn sort of what are the basic things that people are gonna try and do with machine learning and so build those you know the image recognition build your own face recognition just sort of playing with those types of examples it'll get you familiar with all right I have data I have a problem I want to predict and now I'm going to train a model and I'm going to execute and use that model you'll need to learn a framework you know you learn PI torches came out with 1.0 and we partnered with Facebook on making that you know really simple and easy to use and so learn that is a really great easy to start with framework that then will give you the tools to sort of put the layers into your model and build it together so that's if you're looking to get deeper those are the areas that I would look to dig in more into awesome well let's dive into a question that just came in from Lyon McDonald when you're referring to these predictive models how accurate in terms of percentage of ratios have the results been from these models so how good are these models that we're asking people to just use you know it's that's a hard question to answer just sort of in a straightforward manner some models are remarkably accurate there's a model that we'll talk about later today we're a team of researchers at Stanford took a bunch of you know chest x-rays and labeled them with doctors predictions of diseases and trained a model based on that and now we have a very accurate model that given a chest x-ray can predict how well that's done there are some things that turn out to be pretty hard to train models against entirely and so that's part of the model building process is to try here the features that I have and train my model and see how well it does I mean you know we talked about housing prices you can go to Zillow and everybody does and looks at how much their house is worth and how accurate is that model it's pretty good yeah I'm not gonna set a price based on it but it's pretty good and so but it's the kid at critical things to it are having the right inputs into it the first time I tried to build a housing price model if all you have is square footage and number of bedrooms you're gonna do two pretty terribly yeah so you know it's all about having the right inputs into it the right features and then making sure that the model can learn so on some tasks it's fantastic you saw us talk about you know the Stanford Q&A today where we set the record with a machine translation where we're a human parody there are a lot of things where it's it's just fantastic some areas where there's still more to come so what I'm hearing is that a is not magic because it's only as good as the data you give it absolutely that's one of the big challenges is finding the right sets of training data and almost every you know important AI model needs labeled data and so labeled means some person went in and said this is a good answer this is the price of this house this is you know and so given all the features here's your label coming up with labels is one of the hardest parts of machine learning if you have a great set of labels you've got a great model that you can go build so a lot of the work in AI really has to do with looking at what data you have knowing what kind of questions you want to ask and then building great models or using models that are already built absolutely yeah so there's another question coming from Jonathan from Ottawa all I hear about is tensorflow can that run on Azure Chris I'll let you take that one that's a fantastic question I run tensorflow on a shirt just about every day that in Microsoft we absolutely have invested in tools and frameworks are alike we use C NT K extensively inside Microsoft we use tensorflow inside Microsoft and a lot of us use pi torch and other frameworks as well there's absolutely nothing specific about our tools or platform that preclude using any particular framework we're all about productivity and empowering you know every developer out there to infuse AI into their apps and let absolutely love tensorflow and i'll just add on with that you know as we think about AI we really want to see AIB open and open for everyone and so you know with that we've really embraced all of the different frameworks that are out there that also drove we did a partnership with Facebook and Amazon and a whole host of people Sachi mentioned it called onyx which is an exchange format so that a model and tensorflow can be converted into any other framework and then can run on any hardware layer and so we think the acceleration that the industry is seen from being open and sort of embracing all the different technologies and making tools that work together is really important for the industry and we're very committed to it as a company and as your support all of that I think it's cool because I feel like in AI we're moving from the assembly language now we're getting into languages and even we're getting into tooling around that that actually makes any eye a lot more accessible it feels like to me that's right I mean if you look at anything that's hard and complicated what do we do as computer scientists we wrap some abstraction layer on top of it and so you know at first people hand wrote their models and then they added these these frameworks which are making that simpler and now the frameworks themselves are getting simpler and more interoperable and the hardware's getting abstracted so this is what we do it's that's what we do for a living is we make things that are really complicated really quite simple and and easy to use and to give an example of that we've included in Visual Studio tools for AI a simple UI where you can grab a tensor flow model that's been trained convert that into an onyx model and then even generate the c-sharp code automatically that then say you use in an azure function project and deploy that and do serverless scoring and in the cloud so we could just continue to make this easier and easier you may actually see some of that in Harry Shum stock not spoiling anything stay tuned alright another question just so from a Richard Freitag is there a dotnet solution where the data used to learn an AI model never leaves our local premises sure so a lot of our tools you can train locally we actually think the surface book is one of the best AI tools out there because you can take a service book which has a GPU processor built into it you can load your data onto your surface book you can you know run Visual Studio tools for AI a plugin that you can go and add to your existing Visual Studio Tools you can run all of these different frameworks and you can train it locally right there if you if differently if you're in a corporation that has a firewall and you need things to say local all this stuff again will work locally inside of your existing environment the challenge that people run into is that often they want more compute and so if they want that they often want to send it to the cloud which helps you scale up but there's nothing limiting you this is you can run all of this stuff locally in your environment if you like awesome so we're not like like hampering anything it's just literally this is just code just run it exactly I mean if you run Visual Studio tool if you run Visual Studio for your you know any compilation that you're doing you can do that locally you can use cloud resources to do that it's the same thing with the machine learning you can do it locally on your device and train right there but then you got to provide all the hardware and and you know buying a thousand GPUs I can tell you I send the checks they're pretty expensive yeah I asked my boss to buy me a thousand GP a little bitter the kid gisela from germany takeno showed a bunch of AI stuff on devices how do I get my just a model on a device does it work on all devices sure so that's what Sachi was showing in that keynote was showing the IOT edge packages that we're releasing and so with that what you do is you take your model and you train it as an AI model and then you deploy it in a container and so we have the IOT edge support has Windows and Linux device support so you need a device it has to run an operating system Windows and Linux both and has to run containers on it which virtually all of them do and then you can deploy it and run it right there so it's really very simple to do I'll also point out that you can build xamarin apps to deploy models to ios and android included in your app just like you would include any other resource right click add existing item and include your train model using the power of Windows ml also we've added capabilities in visual studio where you can simply add your onyx model and it generates your c-sharp app code for your application as well that then deploys onto the windows as a device as well so there's devices have a lot of different form factors and depending on what you're shooting for sometimes containerization is really awesome and sometimes it may not make sense and so within visual studio we've got a whole bunch of different tooling options to help you get done what you need to do I know it's containerization for me was when I understood and actually use an example someone wrote a PI torch model that I was supposed to operationalize and it was a version of Pi torch that didn't work on Windows and I have Windows so what do I do well I just put it in a container it's ran it everything worked perfectly I'm like oh okay now I want to put this on on Linux box but I want to have GPU support oh I just say inherit from a different container or a different operating system and then it worked on GPU it's pretty amazing how you can do this stuff it's really simplifying you know it's one another one of those abstractions that we build and so simplifies the management and deployment of all of your different models and so you can run them and IKS ab azure kubernetes service and run them in the cloud or you can run it on a device that you deploy to you know thousands of users all across the world awesome so we only about eight more minutes left roughly there's tons of questions Robert poplin for us newbies does the Azure platform support scikit-learn absolutely we definitely as we say we embrace all of the were scikit-learn is one of the most popular what you would think of as classical ml frameworks and so you can definitely use as I could learn we use it all the time here well say one of the easiest way to think of like the azure deep learning VMs or the azure VM is generally it's just a remote development environment and so you can login to in a bun - or Windows machine and do any kind of development you want there and the deep learning VMs in particular come pre-installed with tensorflow ce NT k and more jupiter notebooks and everything ready to go you gonna have this bun up in a couple of minutes with a really powerful as your GPU vm that you login to and do any kind of machine learning or deep learning you want there and then spin it down when you're done I seen that I think it goes to the heart of the questions we've got a lot hey can I do this can I do that you're literally renting a machine that's very big and then you're running your things and then you're turning it off when you're done and you're not paying for it and all configured and set up with all of the frameworks and libraries that you would want you don't have to go and install them and pip install this and that it's all ready to go right out of the bottle if there's a framework that maybe someone's working on they can just install it because it's their machine they're running or absolutely okay so you can run almost anything all right next question Jesse what sort of investments are you making in cognitive toolkit sure so economy's toolkit which we often internally still call CNT K is a framework that was developed internally at Microsoft by the speech team and is just fantastic for RNN recursive neural networks and recurrent neural networks and and things like speech work tremendously well with CNT K and so it's an important framework that you know we continue to support and invest in there a bunch of you know we release it basically every month there are new features that are coming out all the time on it awesome awesome all right next question how many annotated image samples would you need in order to be able to identify food such as hot dogs or not I added or not the classic that was a Silicon Valley's a fantastic show you know the number of images often depends there are a lot of tricks that you do where you take an image and you scale it to different sizes and you rotate it and so you can take a single image and actually turn it into probably 20 or 30 so different images you know I've of course everyone tries their own after that show came on I tried to train my own hot dog or not hot dog the nice thing about that is you can just go to being image search and search for hot dogs and I think I grabbed a hundred two hundred images and sort of grabbed those down it's really pretty easy to find images of a hot dog and and then just trained a model on it and mine wasn't great it worked okay but uh but no he's as good as your data right you know and even with a small data size like that you can absolutely use the pre trained custom vision cognitive service upload a bunch of images of hot dogs ten or twenty upload ten or twenty cupcakes ten or twenty you know hamburgers and it's gonna do a pretty good job because it's already learned on another model in the cloud and so the high level features in the understanding of the objects around it is already there so it just actually takes a couple seconds - sometimes a couple minutes to customize it to then produce that classification hot dog or no hot dog yes awesome okay so we only have about five and or so minutes there is this like a lot of people ask me questions like I want to put AI in my application and I don't even know what that means right what does that mean there's an interesting boundary between writing regular software and doing AI software can you try to describe where that it so people might get a feeling for like oh maybe I should use AI for this or maybe I've been doing it wrong what is your sense for that I mean is your question where should you use it yeah yeah like how do you know like hey this problem is good for AI I mean in general you know what AI generally does is it makes a prediction and any place where you're making a prediction you probably should be using machine learning and so that sounds pretty vague or it helped me out with that a little bit anytime that you're trying to decide alright I need to like we do this in a sure I need to allocate some resource to which which VM should this particular job run on we have some heuristic we round robin through them or something like that ai is gonna do a much better job at things like that images is a fantastic place for AI if I want to do any sort of image classification is this a hot dog or not a hot dog is this a face anything like that that is a great problem for doing machine learning on but the thing I'm really encouraging people is every part of their application just look for the place where were you're doing prediction you we work on a lot of platform things so a lot of the things that we end up doing are you know how are we gonna make this resource really efficient and fully utilize it and so placement policies and allocation and things like that quota policies all of those things are often done just with a rule and a rule is not it's never going to perform as well if you can train a model on top of it and so that's my encouragement any place where you're predicting anything is a good opportunity for that I see so if you have like a heuristic that you wrote and you keep having to fix it every week maybe you should look to data and have that actually do that and one of the things that's really interesting about AI is it's really making prediction cheap and easy and so what people are doing are taking problems that don't look like a prediction problem and turning them into it so if you're talking about I have my self-driving car that's a prediction problem what should i do should I turn left should I turn right should I go straight because we can make predictions so cheap with AI and so any place where you can think about hey I can change what I'm saying in terms of prediction problem that's gonna be a better outcome awesome all right some questions here what about the shift away from data sets post gdpr to model-based AI I guess GDP are a problem when it comes to a I don't understand GDP are that I think I know way more about GDP r than I ever care to know so GDP r is a set of regulations in Europe that regulate permissions that users have on top of their data and so how is that going to impact ai ai works best when you have a lot of data the main things with GDP are though are you need to be open and transparent with your users how am i collecting this data how am I using it and get their permission to do that if you do those things you're not particularly limited in terms of how you use their data but the other thing that comes up is often times you'll you use a lot of data to build a model and so that model now sort of has aggregated information about really the entire world's information and so there that model doesn't actually know anything about your actions it knows about users in General's actions and so you can use that as a good way to make sure that I've learned and abstracted the details from something without actually having any personal information about the user and so there is a lot of that going on cool all right a couple of our questions in the last two minutes what about the data all my organization's data is hosted in legacy systems and we're housed on premises can i leverage her ml without migrating all the data that's a non straightforward question very hard to manage data that's one of the you know when you think about all the work than machine learning scientists data scientist does you know there have been lots of charts drawn where they'll say this is all the work and this is the training part right in here and most of it is managing and wrangling the data you absolutely can use Azure ml and and Visual Studio tools for air and other tools with your existing data wherever it is that said you know just because you have data will you be able to use it effectively you probably are gonna need to do some work on it awesome so another question could developers sell trained models on the Azure store I'll confess I'm not really sure I don't think so currently no however we have just launched the azure ml model gallery okay it's the first start in that sort of direction we haven't talked about the monetization aspect but AI is this super interesting time where people are sharing code they're sharing models on on github and other places and we do have an azure ml model gallery that you can download onyx models they're even annotated as to which are compatible with Wynn ml and which aren't and we will work towards opening that up so that people can publish their models and then the monetization aspect is something that we'll discuss in the future we're engineers right now absolutely we're just helping people get stuff done awesome well thanks so much for spending some time with us we got about 35 30 seconds coming up next we have IOT with Sam George I believe you saw him in the keynote I'm pretty excited about that I'm gonna my manager Tim's to be taking over thanks so much anything you want to say just to finish up what you people go look at right away I mean I think we announced a whole bunch of great things today that people should go check out you can go to Asher dot a eye and see a whole host of things about the cognitive services that we've got about the visual studio tools pray all the sorts of things you can go and use I think a is super exciting go check it out awesome five seconds what do you got go becoming the eye developer today well I mean it's super exciting love it thanks so much we will be back after a short break while we reset our stage with our new guests we'll see it after this break
