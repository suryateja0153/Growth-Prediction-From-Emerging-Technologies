 so I'm a Gingka I work as a research lead for knowledge graphs at eBay's new product development group I have been in the research field for almost like five years now so I have used neo4j since my Master's it's there's a funny story which are selling a meal yesterday where one of my Master's project I was stuck in some issues and at that time Peter knauber was I think one of the founders so I'm posting on the forum and he just jumped on a Skype call and is layin it's called let's do a Skype call and like okay and then yeah we just shared screens and he fixed up for me which was pretty cool as a founder getting on a call so we were looking at bunch of rough technologies and the track record and my experience with neo4j was really the the key that we went with neo4j the ease of use as a new developer who's coming newly to new project as well as the the ease of how you can visualize the data and play with it at the same time and the fact that from the experimentation phase to the production is pretty like it's super super easy so i think the the key factors that's missing right now is the fact that people are not looking at a graph database from the machine learning point of things or from the air and the fact that you have you can import the inherent knowledge that we as like humans have since our childhood that we use to make decisions can be imported in now in a graph structure and that's going to be a big thing going
