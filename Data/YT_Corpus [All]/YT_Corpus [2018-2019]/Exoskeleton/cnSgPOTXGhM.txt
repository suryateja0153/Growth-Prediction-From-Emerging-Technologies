 THIS IS MILITARY TIMES MINUTE. I'M ANDREA SCOTT. ONE ARMY WAR WIDOW HAS A REQUEST FOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD: PLEASE STOP TURNING A PHOTO OF HER AND HER DECEASED HUSBAND INTO A MEME. SHAWNA ARRECHAGA LOST HER HUSBAND IN 2011, AND SAYS SINCE THEN SHE HAS BEEN FIGHTING CONSTANTLY TO STOP AN IMAGE OF HER BY HIS CASKET FROM BEING USED POLITICALLY ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA, MOST RECENTLY, IN THE DEBATE CONCERNING NFL PLAYERS KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. SOLDIERS WITH THE 10TH MOUNTAIN DIVISION WILL BE THE FIRST TO TEST A LONG-AWAITED EXOSKELETON THAT DEVELOPERS SAY CAN REDUCE INJURIES, AND HELP TROOPS CARRY HEAVY LOADS AND MOVE AROUND THE BATTLEFIELD WITH EASE. PRIORITIES INCLUDE MAKING SURE THE EXOSKELETON IS RESISTANT TO WATER AND RUGGED TERRAIN -- AND IT COULD BE READY FOR FIELDING AS EARLY AS 2021. THE AIR FORCE INTENDS TO NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF AIRMEN SERVING AS COMBAT AVIATION ADVISERS UNDER AIR FORCE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND. THE ADVISERS ARE SENT ABROAD TO MENTOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS AIR CREWS IN ALLIED NATIONS. NUMBERS CURRENTLY FALL SHORT, BUT THE GOAL IS TO BUILD 5 YEARROUND ADVISORY SITES AT PARTNER NATIONS.
