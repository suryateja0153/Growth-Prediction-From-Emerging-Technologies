 welcome back to living Vogel we're here at the Genesis spine and joint health center in Bettendorf where doctors are on a mission to gain a piece of technology that would be a first in our region the exoskeleton I'm joined by dr. Ryan Taylor thank you so much for joining us dr. Taylor so what is an exoskeleton good question so an exoskeleton is really a machine that we can put on somebody that's had AIDS or a brain injury like a stroke or a spinal cord injury and what it can do it can help them move their legs earlier and safer than anything we could previously have done and so it's a new technology coming in the last five years if you think of a bug a bug kind of has an exoskeleton ezreal it goes around the outside of a patient and a lived-in enables them to move their legs quicker and sooner and how many patients could this potentially benefit here it could be a lot we looked at the data of our rehab unit and about 60 to 70 percent of our patients that are in hospital could benefit from this and so as far as numbers go depends on your census but there's at least 70% of our patients that could benefit from this from this technology and dr. Taylor what population would probably benefit the most from this piece of technology I will lead a stroke patients and spinal cord injury patients and so it allows them to be able to move quicker faster and safer which is really the goal of neurologic rehabilitation and you mentioned insects having the exoskeleton so walk us through what this piece of technology looks like and how it functions sure so basically at the top end it has a backpack that you put on the back and that's the motor in the control system on the back the braces come down the backside of the legs and under the feet and what it does is it has joints at the knees and at the hips and it will move the legs forward and clear the toes and make sure somebody's able to walk with this device the therapists can control that from back behind the pack to minimum assist to toll assist so it depends on what the patient needs as far as assist but you can change how much they need and if the machine can recognize how much the patient is generating and adapt to that so if a patient's recovering and they can start doing more the machine will allow them to do more Wow so it is very adaptable and very strategic in that way you can really work with the patient and their needs a different varying levels absolutely now patients able to take this home or do they need to come to the center - correct no not yet eventually in the next 10 years people might get to that technology right now it's quite pricey and so a lot of them right now or our medical grade meaning that they're in our goal is to have it at that our rehabilitation center and eventually hopefully have another one at the outpatient rehabilitation center but correct at this point it's used in a facility in the future though five to ten years people may start having these that they pull out of the trunk of their car the technology is not there yet sure baby steps of course so will people using this ever be able to regain full function of their limbs maybe the the thing with neurologic rehabilitation is the answer is the true answers I don't know right and so it definitely helps them with neurologic recovery with plasticity meaning the brain rewiring itself or the spinal cord rewiring itself it's safer activity meaning that for the therapists who's doing it and the patient there's less risk of fall and it's you get repetitive motion which is important for neurologic recovery so patients will gain improvement from that now whether it self actually does that or not it's remains that they seen evidence on this is very early but it's clear that it's safe and it helps in addition to other real thought rehabilitation things that we do currently Wow so definitely a lot to look forward to there and to keep people hopeful for the future of technology and how it can help and speaking of hope you were referred to as the hope coach tell us a little bit that it was kind of point pan by Missy Joey our foundation leader and so she part of what my job is is really to take patients kind of at their lowest level right they've survived a traumatic injury whether it be a stroke or brain injury or spinal cord injury and it's a difficult time for patients and I have to be that one to try to lift them up and say okay look we're gonna try to make this work I mean I know this is not ideal with what you have but we're gonna try to make the best out of what we have and help them focus on the progress that they're making for the rehabilitation so I mean the patients look to the physician especially as a rehabilitation physician or optimism and that's part of my job is to tell them realistic expectations but to be an optimist and encourage them on their journey absolutely dr. Taylor when will our community be able to have an exoskeleton hopefully sooner rather than later so that's we're currently fundraising for I think I think for our standpoint we'd like to have it as soon as possible I think hopefully with the fundraising hopefully we get it in the next couple months I think it would be awesome it would be there's not currently one operating in the state of Iowa at this point Des Moines has a couple systems but they haven't different locations but they haven't had them up and running to what I'm understanding and so hopefully very soon though I'm hoping to keep my fingers crossed that because this is an expensive piece of equipment how expensive is this piece of equipment two hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars Wow and so that's probably why not a lot of facilities are able to utilize it because it is so such an investment yes exactly 225 to 235 thousand dollars and so it takes a lot of engineering to be able to get to this and it's an early product and we all know as technology becomes more efficient then it becomes cheaper but at this point it's it's new enough that it's still costly because they have to do research and development but a lot of institutions are starting to do this I had experience with it at Mayo Clinic and I did my training in other places that it's becoming not standard of care but it's becoming pretty common in the rehabilitation setting we want to be able to be a part of that and how close are we to getting that fund reach to be able to have it we're pretty close as far as two days ago I think we're a hundred and thirty thousand dollars of the two hundred and twenty-five issues that we need to raise so the community's been great we've had some great big donors step up you know every every donation counts whether it's ten dollars or twenty thousand dollars we appreciate it all but we're really hopefully get to that goal you know sooner rather than later so we can bring this technologists area which we currently don't have definitely and if people are feel inspired to donate to this what would you say like how their money would be impacting people the patients that you see and you work with every day you're trying to provide hope with what kind of impact will it have on them yeah that's huge I mean these patients are at kind of their lowest area at times and a lot of times their life and so you provide hope it provides a sense of personality back to the patient cuz they can stand and they can walk and participate in the conversations machine and it's really just rewarding to see that hope that comes to people when it can first stand up and walk and I think that for donors having that feeling that you could donate into a cause that's gonna significantly impact somebody's sense of well-being and and their optimism to recovery after a big injury or stroke have you ever been around someone who's been using the technology before okay so what's the reaction it's always it's always fun to see yeah that like a lot of times you know sometimes they'll cry or sometimes it's just really emotional because they maybe they haven't Stansted for months or something like this and to see them be able to stand up for the first time a lot of times you know just big smiles or you know it's really rewarding Wow and so why did you want to be a part of bringing this to the Quad Cities because as you mentioned this doesn't exist in the state of Iowa right exactly so I had experienced it with a Mayo Clinic night where I did my training I saw its uses there and I thought when I came here that thought it'd be a great thing to be able to bring in the area and so I was inspired to and Genesis has been very supportive of this and very invested in this and so hopefully we continue what the community's help to continue to work towards this and bring it to our area and dr. Taylor how can people help and donate so a couple different options one is to go to the Genesis foundation website and donate for the Genesis foundation it short of everything I mean basically you're just gonna contact us anyway and we'll figure out how to get to you in their height spot whether it's through my office at this final joint health center or through the foundation or the website or there are some online on Facebook and some other donating options that you can do through that as well some dr. Taylor thank you so very much for your time of course and have you mentioned if you'd like some more information about how you can donate you can contact foundation at Genesis health comm or visit Genesis help calm / Gibbs more living locals is next [Music]
