 we have developed a novel exoskeleton for the hunt that people with physical disabilities can operate via a brain machine interface the novel aspects of this hand exoskeleton consists of on the one side the design that is very light and wearable and on the other hand the fact that this hand exoskeleton not only induces the same range of motions as the natural hand but also induces brain patterns of activity that are similar to when a healthy person operates the hand the main idea behind the device was to develop an exhaust kilotonnes lightweight and portable as possible so that it can be used directly at home and during activities of daily living this device there is based on artificial tendons so the actuation itself has been just put on the dorsal side of the hand so that the palm is left free and the somato sensation is preserved when grasping and manipulating objects these artificial tendons are based on a soft components here at the finger level that can elongate and retract and they go all the way down to this chest back where we placed the actuators the control unit and the energy storage unit we exemplified the control of the device by means of a brain-computer interface the device itself can be controlled by means of different signals for example electromyography or voice control or gaze the control itself can be adapted to the residual capabilities of the user we are working with now that we have verified the exoskeleton with people suffering from different kind of disabilities due to a spinal cord injury or a stroke the next step is to develop complete systems that will allow them to operate these exoskeletons via the premature interface either as an assistive tool or even as a rehabilitation
