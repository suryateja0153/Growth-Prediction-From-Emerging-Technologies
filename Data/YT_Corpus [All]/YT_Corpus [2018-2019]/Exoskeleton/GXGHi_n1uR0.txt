 My name is Aditi Gupta I am a fourth year PhD student in the Health Sciences and Technology program at MIT and I work with Leia Stirling on human-exosystem adaptation I'm professor Leia Stirling and I look at how wearable technology affects human performance both physical and cognitive A lot of my research is done in the Strive Center because they have this really cool 360-degree immersive virtual-reality dome that is highly instrumented you can get a lot of biomechanical data from it and there's also a system that allows you to recreate motions that happened inside the system after the fact in a computer setting what you're trying to assess is how much attention or how much unconscious focus does it take for them to actually wear the exo-skeletons and ultimately the goal of that is to understand how we can make them more intuitive and more human-centered and focused how quickly do they respond to stimuli when they're wearing the exo-skeleton and then when they're not wearing the exo-skeleton by looking at those differences in response times we can see an estimate of how much attention is on using the exo-skeleton We need to be able to have it be useful in a real-world setting whether that's medicine or military or rehabilitation or whatever it is, we really have to focus on humans as well as the technology For these wearable systems that we're trying to make, how can we make any system that's supposed to help you on the physical side also not affect your cognitive performance I thought I wanted to be a doctor then I took a physics class and it was a blast I decided I wanted to do something that had a mix of both medicine and physics and that's kind of how I ended up in bioengineering, which was perfect because it gave me that opportunity to both learn about the human body and biology and how it works, but also apply that knowledge in a very creative and practical way
