 [Music] hi there Jenny here I'm a sales trainer for Google cloud and I'm Heather good to have you back Jenny so today we're gonna be talking about the Internet of Things or IOT it sounds pretty generic if you're unfamiliar with this term but we're surrounded by this technology every day that's right so on this episode we look at Google cloud IOT core a managed service to help securely connect and manage IOT devices at scale make sure to stick around for our quick demo of the self-paced lab on cloud IOT core put simply IOT is taking devices that were not traditionally connected to the Internet and then adding Internet connectivity to them why because data is being created all the time from devices applications and their users by adding connectivity a wealth of data that was traditionally offline becomes actionable cloud IOT core is a fully managed service that allows you to easily and securely connect manage and ingest data from up to millions of globally dispersed IOT devices the services serverless and it doesn't require any upfront software installation it also scales instantly with the horizontal scaling of Google cloud platform cloud IOT core provides a way of creating a registry where you can define where devices are and then connect them device telemetry data is forwarded to a cloud pub/sub topic you can then use cloud functions to trigger API calls or you can use dataflow to extract that data from pub/sub and put it into a data warehouse such as big table or bigquery this will allow you to analyze and react to that data in real time so let's jump in a quick laps you can check out the link to start the quick lab here you'll need to set aside about 40 minutes to complete it this hands-on lab will show you how to use Google cloud platform console to create a cloud IOT core device registry connect a device and publish device telemetry events so far in the lab we've created a device registry with a cloud pub/sub topic for publishing device telemetry events we then added a device to the registry and added a public key to the device so that it can connect to GCP we did some setup to run a node.js sample to connect a virtual device and view telemetry once at this stage we'll run this command in cloud shell to create a subscription to the registries pub subtopic then we run this command to connect a virtual device to cloud IOT core using the MQTT bridge the output shows that the sample device is publishing messages to the telemetry topic 25 messages are published finally we run this command to read the messages publish to the telemetry topic we created a cloud IOT core device registry connected to device and publish device telemetry events we hope you enjoyed this episode as much as we did and don't forget GCP offers a 12 month free trial with $300 in credits so you can apply what you've learned today and start using it with your data in addition there are resources for you to take advantage of to learn even more about cloud technology and GCP check out all the links in the description below thanks again for watching and we'll see you soon
