 IOT powering the digital economy brought to you by Schneider Electric [Music] [Music] [Music] farming is the hand that feeds us but as an industry agriculture is something we often take for granted the land is plowed the crops are grown in the livestock raised put pressures on farmers to feed our booming population are increasing by 2050 it's estimated they'll be over nine and a half billion of us and that's a lot of mouths to feed farming has long been considered a risky investment with tight profit margins and often unpredictable yields but it's a sector with enormous potential according to the World Bank Group it accounts for about a third of global GDP and by 2050 it's thought that productivity and agriculture will need to rise by 70% just to keep up with demand in their efforts to meet rising demand food producers are now turning to digital innovations to increase their yield and farming efficiency agricultural technology or Agrotech is thriving and attracting investment like never before digitization along the entire value chain is seeing tech companies forge new relationships with agricultural business with even digital heavyweights like Google and Amazon starting to begin so how is farming changing in the face of the digital revolution and what business opportunities and challenges lie in this program I'll be looking at the companies that are tackling the problems of 21st century farming head-on with the use of new digital tools and innovations I'll be finding out how one of our oldest industries is overcoming its newest challenges and asking experts in agricultural technology about the obstacles we face on the road to the farms of the future it's hard to talk about the agriculture business without mentioning Monsanto the notorious farming giant and the world's biggest supplier of seeds with around a quarter of global sales however as the use of Agrotech grows traditional farming companies like Monsanto are vying for a share in the market in 2013 Monsanto acquired the climate corporation a company specializing in digital farming the cost of the takeover close to a billion dollars I've come to the head offices of climate Corp in San Francisco to find out why the company is proving such a front-runner in the race to digitize farming Mike Stern a CEO of climate and vice-president of America's row crops at Monsanto he's also the man behind more than 50 scientific publications and US patents related to agriculture technology one of climates key products is field view an online platform that gathers and analyzes data to predict weather and field health providing farmers with a wide range of digital tools to help maximize their yields here are all my fields they're all organized it's a digital notebook and it's telling us about ok how much rain fell on my farm in the last 24 hours season to date and how does that compare to the 10 year average and then if they want to dig into more detail on a field by field basis they can go specifically to a field this look like a satellite map of the field this is actually a yield map this is called split view and they can begin to see that that this is a soil map that actually is talk is helping understand what this variability is red our areas of the field that are not doing too well and green are areas of the field where the yields were much higher and so within the app now for the first time a grower can begin to understand well what might be causing this variability field view is a digital AG platform that really provides three benefits to growers one it helps them digitize their fields and allows them to organize their data around their fields and begin to do analytics and cause and effect analysis it's a conduit for us to be able to give recommendations based on our investment in data science to help growers making more informed decisions about how to manage their crops and it's also a conduit for growers to go and connect with other innovators on our platform that allows them to access other digital AG tools to bring innovation to their farm what about any b2b collaborations and benefits to other businesses or other companies getting on board with the system and are there any examples you can share absolutely you know we have established field view as a platform so we've opened up our infrastructure to allow other companies to develop technology and bring technology to growers through field view and we have about 30 partners right now so let me give you an example one of our first platform partners is a company called varus and varus makes very sophisticated soil sampling in equipment that gets taken across the field and it does a meter by meter assessment of some critical soil components now by itself that's important for a grower but what a grower really wants is to have that soil layer in the context of everything else that they're doing on their field so it's not so now we have a soil layer that's in context of hey this is the corn hybrid that I might have planted this is the density I planted this is the weather on the field this is how nutrients have been applied to that field it's a very symbiotic relationship and with population growing so rapidly and the world's agriculture needs growing how does this help how is efficiency important well if you project out into the future in 2050 there's going to be 10 billion folks on the planet so another 3 billion then from where we are today and we're gonna have to figure out how to produce more food on less land with fewer Natural Resources with a changing climate and that's a challenge and we're going to need all sorts of technology it's not going to be one technology that's going to help us solve these problems we've seen these types of step changes in technology before whether it was the mechanization of the farm in the late 1800s or the Green Revolution where breeding and understanding about fertility helped improve yields and wheat and I think digital agriculture is going to be this next wave of innovation that will be able to apply to these problems helping farmers adapt to the changing climate will surely have a positive impact on global productivity however another major problem facing today's farmer is the shortage of seasonal labor many farms are losing money because they simply can't find the workers to pick their produce [Music] the Oxford plan in Southern California is famous for strawberry production about 1/3 of the state strawberries are grown and picked here the harvesting of soft fruits has always been a delicate time-consuming operation traditionally farmers have relied on hand picking by migrant workers but times are changing and as worker numbers fall fruit growers in particular are searching for new methods to gather their precious crops say hello to the AG robot one of the world's first strawberry picking robots designed from the ground up to gather this especially fragile fruit it uses a sophisticated set of sensors to scan and delicately harvest the strawberries and it's the brainchild of a grobotz founder and CEO one problem Juan was previously head of production at Spanish engineering and construction company hook-up but has been refining and developing the AG robot since 2010 so Juan you've developed this AG robot to pick strawberries tell us a little bit about how it works and what it does we have 24-hour body cams each one is fully independent from the other each one have a camera this assistant but this is Connie for registration when we find a ripe is already we grab by the stem and we live in a container if we compare the the peak inside of the harvester we need about 1.2 human harvesters for cleaning one acre with one harvester we can harvest about 20 acres three days so how how is the Machine controlled do you ride on it or is it just a screen to push buttons on so everything is fully autonomous we just select and press the star button the harvester owner about the camera starves the height cell guidance system will guide the harvester when the harvester are run and reach the end of the other rows it will stop by itself and will send the information to the human we can control with a screen on the harvest day we can control with our phone or with her remote controller so what kind of interest have you seen in the product who's investing well rayna's Menma star growing companies they need a solution because in the next following years the shortage of labour for this kind of jobs is gonna get harder and harder even the people that currently is harvesting the strawberries are getting older so they they are investing in this kind of technology because they need a solution to keep growing strawberries the main business investor in the Agrabah is the International berry growing company Driscoll's I asked John Arab their VP of social and environmental impact about the benefits of Agrotech investment and what kind of problems that can solve what it solves is really trying to take some of the kind of non-value-added type movements that are difficult and things that people really don't want to do and automating those aspects we really want to try to create you know the type of opportunities for the workforce to focus on you know the things that require higher intelligence and things that's you know aren't necessarily just repetitive in nature and that really kind of where people out and that type of thing and what do you say to farmers or people who might be concerned that technology and robots are taking jobs away well really it's creating job opportunities one of the biggest challenges that we have is that there's really not youth coming into the farming industry and so with the technological advancements there's a lot of opportunities that really are attracted to the youth and can also kind of tap just the acumen that the kids have today they grow up with the technology etc and so it's it's exciting to create those type of opportunities how important is increasing the use of digital technology to driscoll's and to the agriculture industry well increasing the use of digital technologies is super important not just in terms of automating the harvest but there's other applications as well for example using visual technology to assess how much of the crop is coming in as well as what's the state of the crop and so you can detect where there's hot spots in the field where there may be some insect pressure or the plants aren't as vigorous and those types of things and so the visual technology can unlock all kinds of opportunities developments in Agrotech are gathering pace and farmers are already reaping the benefits but with mounting pressures on food production what other innovations are needed join me after the break when I'll be asking an expert in Agrotech about the cutting edge developments in the industry modern farming is more and more reliant on digital technology to keep up with global demand disruptors and adapters alike are staking their claim in the farms of the future and in the process pushing forward the frontiers of new technology Harper Adams University in Shropshire UK is a world leader in agricultural technology and digital research part think-tank part farm part laboratory it's a center of excellence in the sector one of its recent flagship projects is a hands-free hectare a field of barley plant intended and harvested entirely by unmanned machinery Simon Blackmore is professor of robotic agriculture at Harper Adams University a member of the American Society of agricultural and biological engineers and a fellow of the institution of agricultural engineers his research has been breaking new ground in digital farming Simon believes we need to entirely rethink our approach to farming in the 21st century there's a lot of pressures on crop production around the world at the moment obviously we've got a an increasing population that we need to feed but there's also environmental pressures and the current system that we've got for crop production uses a lot more energy than we need and that energy comes in all different forms from fertiliser pesticide tractors diesel and so on so be able to meet society's requirements for these things we need a new production system and that new production system needs to have new set of tools to allow us to do what we want the farmers to do the opportunity that I see is to come up with a complete new mechanization system that moves away from an industrial type model which is where we are at the moment which is like a big production line doing the same thing everywhere trying to increase just increase the yields the whole time into a much more flexible there I say manufacturing system my industry has done but the farmers don't have currently have the tools to do it our industry has moved over to flexible manufacturing I think farmers should move over to flexible manufacturing but we need the small smart machines to be able to do that one of Harper Adams latest experiments a new smart machinery is project Morman a remotely controlled tractor designed for precision crop spraying this type of machine is what I think to be about the right size for agricultural robots when we get to the tractor big tractors they are too heavy they sink into the ground if we make them much smaller we have a problem with what's called the energy density problem how much power can you get into a battery or a small engine but this is about the right size to deal with agricultural conditions when a normal tractor would sync up to its axles this machine can go out and not do any damage to the soil it's better to carry out the operations and not to compact the soil in any way agriculture is an ancient industry and the backbone of our society but if it's to withstand the pressures of the 21st century then investment in digital technology is key in recent years capital has started flowing to the sector well where is a river of investment going there is a lot of interest from the commercial sector now and the investment and governments around the world to make use of these technologies the interesting thing really is that it's very disruptive and a lot of the big machinery manufacturers are not investing in this area because it's too disruptive to their very linear business model that they've had for the last 50 60 years so the opportunity is really coming through startup companies so we're working with a number of startup companies now who have no legacy in terms of what has gone on before but we're only interested in coming up with the right machines to meet today's requirements so the stage really is where we've got a lot of in some respects crazy ideas new ideas new ways of thinking we're not totally sure which ones are going to pan out which ones are going to be the most successful but we're evaluating those ones and we're seeing a lot more private investment coming into this area now to bridge the gap era gloomier is the food and beverage solution Marketing Director at Schneider Electric Schneider are one of the more established players who are partnering with other businesses to explore the potential of digital farming I think the main word that he's done at the present time in Agrotech is developing new capabilities to to get information about the field about the culture and about the environment of the fields max Ehrmann is now something which is really efficient and we can control the different equipment in the field based on the productivity the yield of each part of the process I see new opportunities with the usage for example of artificial intelligence we are working with P digital a small company in Italy they have applied the artificial intelligence on the agricultural data so they use drones with high-resolution camera in order to add a map of the fields and with artificial intelligence they are able to detect the presence of bugs in the field and from this the farmer can have manual removal of the other perks of a local treatment of the parcel which is contaminated heavy investment in automation robotics and new sources of data are all helping to make farms more productive and less harmful to the environment than ever before but is it enough for farming to meet the needs of our growing population join me after the break when I'll be finding out what new innovations are in store agriculture is in the throes of a digital revolution helping millions of the world's farmers reduce their environmental impact improve efficiency and drive up yields but this revolution is only just beginning so what does the future hold when you visualize the farm of the future what are some of the things you see how is it different well for one it's it's optimizing air and lights how do we make the plants as happy as they can be basically and they're going to give you the best result possible but also make it accessible for people to harvest big juicy fruit that's easily accessible it's not hidden under the leaves we want to be able to harvest you know every berry and not leave anything behind which in today's environment that's not possible there's probably about 30 percent you know waste in the system today that's not all happening on farm that's also within the supply chain but basically it's maximizing errant light harvesting 100% of the berries and really setting up the plants to be as happy as possible so that they produce the best crop but how does that change what needs to be done for that to happen for example on watering let's just take that for example well natural resources are obviously scarce and often times finite one of the exciting things that more precise farming practices and innovation unlocks is the better stewardship of water and so we're seeing that in some of these advanced production techniques that we're implementing that we're using up to you know half the water that we have otherwise because we're giving little small shots of water exactly when the plants need it we actually have scales in the field in in these in the container production in the tabletop production that you see here will have scales in the field that are weighing the plants and they can tell you know how much water or evapotranspiration is happening how much water needs to be put back to the plant and then that automatically triggers the irrigation and so we might have 30 to 40 irrigations in one day but it's it's only very very small amounts and exactly what the plant needs for professor Simon Blackmore of Harper Adams University the future lies in our mastery of new smart machinery as an agriculture engineer I'm looking at agriculture from the machinery point of view and I believe with the opportunities that we got in this new technology we're going to get a new revolution in agriculture in crop production that is going to take advantage of these technologies we will need new skills to do it we'll have to have better understanding of the technologies I still think it's going to be people making decisions but it will certainly be supported by information intensive data by artificial intelligence by decision support systems but effectively it comes down to people in the end but we will have a new set of tools that farmers have never had before to allow those decisions to be implemented in the field there's still a person in control of it in charge of it out behind me I could have a tractor that is then running but I am in control of it because I've got a smartphone now and there is a heartbeat going backwards and forwards between my smartphone and the tractor but it may not be sitting on the tractor anymore but 10d within close proximity to the tractor for Mike's turn of climate Corp it's the gathering and interpreting of data on farms that could bring the biggest change farm of the future I think could be very very different than the farm of today so there's no doubt that there will be more automation on the farm there will be many many more sensors measuring all sorts of different elements of how to manage a crop on a farm there'll be integrated solutions where all sorts of different inputs will be brought together in an operating plan to optimize productivity around the field we think there's tremendous opportunity to bring value to growers with the digital tools so we're in heaven we're investing heavily in in fundamental science here I have no doubt that these technologies are fundamentally going to change the way that we use our natural resources to produce food and even today I am sure we can't even articulate where these technologies will end up 10 years from now what would you say to the farmer who hears this and then is concerned that there will be no more room in the farm of the future for for the human worker I think I think local knowledge and in the historic knowledge that farmers have around their field is always going to be important and these are very very complicated problems and even today we see as we're rolling out our digital tools our farmer customers are typically working with their trusted adviser with this information whether that be an Ag retailer or a seed seller an agronomist a consultant on their farm so I think that local knowledge and the knowledge and the passion that the farmer has about their land and their field is always going to be an important component in the development of new technology including these digital tools for centuries agriculture has been the dependable friend of progress supplying our growing population with food and drink but as environmental and economic pressures on farming mount the time is ripe for progress to give something back global investment in Agra Tech is having a massive impact on the secretary automation and data-driven farming are helping food producers increase their yields and efficiencies farming methods as we know them are fundamentally changing promising a healthier more sustainable future for us all [Music] [Music] IOT
