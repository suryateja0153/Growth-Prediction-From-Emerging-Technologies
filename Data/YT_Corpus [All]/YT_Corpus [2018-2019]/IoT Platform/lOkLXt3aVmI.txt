 Hi, this is Christian again In my last video I talked about how damn complex IOT is In this video, I will talk about - What is an IOT platform And what kind of tools are included in this platform So number one: Your IOT platform will consist of several Lego blocks Today, typically you have ... Different systems already in place. You have your CRM systems You have your ERP system, a building automation system and you have a CTS system So you have many different systems, where you collect data in different ways So in my view: An IOT platform is a place where you collect all that data So you kind of have a central database That can collect that data And that is around this center you have your different Lego blocks And that can be that you have a control signal so through the platform You can send the control signals to a heat pump or to the CTS system Or to any of the different system that is interconnected to the platform The important thing is, that you have many Lego blocks that can connect to multiple systems And that means that on the platform side, you can connect to a business intelligence tool It can be like PowerBI, Tableau or QlikView But you have the possibility to pull out all your data from that platform And put it into the different other visualization tools or business intelligence tools So you can start to visualize your data and start to understand What can I do with these data, and see some patterns Because once you start watching and you're seeing it visualized, you start to get ideas So now I'm curious to know What kind of business intelligence tools and visualization tools are you using today? What is your interpretation of an IOT platform? So let's have a talk!
