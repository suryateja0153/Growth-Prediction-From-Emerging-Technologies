 [Music] all right good afternoon everybody well I I wasn't supposed to come here and my team asked me to come and you know be a cameo and I tried to be very short and brief about the you know kind of opening up this spot you know life sessions you know Google I mean well this morning I mean you guys were in the keynote and we had a you know kind of three new IOT product announcements and and it's actually shows you know kind of insight on the what Google is really actually doing and and the vision or strategy that that we're taking we you know the the interest we are seeing in in the field that a lot of you know the customer is having the IOT the problems and the applications and we see there are is this is an opportunity because it's actually worded a lot of data being generated and Google is essentially a data company and and we our mission is to organize what you know data and and so and that is the kind of we see as you know this an area where we our core strengths in you know in AI and big data and you know and also a lot of this you know the analytics solutions and those things can actually be a big instrument for our lot of our customers and and also providing the access to organize this data and access to a lot of them our key strategy as you probably actually guessed is really and you know really AI first in you know bringing AI as a really front and center of everything and so the first the announcement that we had was about the HTTP you is a custom hardware you know accelerator for the running tensorflow light model and and then you know that's actually really optimized for the performance support dollar and performance for you know power consumption that actually gives you really it kind of really enables love applications you can imagine it's a you know when this TPU can be combined with you know microcontroller you know that actually make you know doing running some processing and and doing an infrared output and combined with the you know like security chip that actually provide the rule of trust you know for and then of the encryptions and that that actually really can actually be very disruptive and in the market and creating new opportunities like making every things in the world really an intelligent and providing brain you know at a very low cost and with very high power efficiency and without compromising the performance and that's kind of really a small peek into what we're doing but it actually we were building really the whole end-to-end story of the you know the cloud infrastructure for IOT and then also the edge and we're doing this not just by ourselves we're actually with the in partnership with many partners and there are certain areas that Google can do you know a good job and because we know our algorithms and we know how how to optimize for them and then we also make those you know the solutions actually available to our partners for them actually to make the product out of there or so we also recommend our partners to you know to our customers and vice versa so actually you know we drive on this ecosystem with the partners and as as well as our own technology innovations you know and you know really pulling our own weight as a Google so today we have a really beautiful you know session and a lot of good information and about more detailed information about Google's strategy on you know IOT intelligence and security and we have a you know good set of customers going to speak at the panel and so I'm very excited to have all of you and then you know and without much to delay I'm gonna open it up to the next speaker thank you very much thank you in tone so last session of the day so thank you for being here how excited are we about IOT there were 17 sessions yeah 17 sessions on IOT a big keynote announcement a lot of good news I'm really excited to be here and talk about our vision for IOT I'm Anthony password I had the product management team for cloud IOT offering and really excited to be here so you we all know we're living in a connected world there's really no no surprise now that IOT is real what's really changed is that I could talk about the billions of devices that are very going to be connected but the realities we moving from connectivity to intelligence because without real intelligence without real insights or actionable actionable insights on the data that's generated by those devices it's really hard to get a real return on investment so intelligence is key to those investments and the problem is those devices are generating a huge amount of data and when we're looking at how much data that that is an IDC study into said that in 2025 there's going to be about 40 billion zettabyte of data generated by IOT devices and most of it is actually a real-time and 40 zettabyte of data is about what 40 billion petabyte of data if i'm not mistaken that's fairly sizable amount of data but the problem is that with that much data how do you get inside of the data how do you analyze that data to really make meaningful decisions it's really about you know all that data all that insight is really about connecting devices with application and people in a seamless way in a non disruptive way it's really that data that's the glue between all those all those pieces of the puzzle and we're trying to solve here oops going the wrong way so Google has been in the IOT for quite some time especially working with intelligence on devices so intelligence in the thermostat intelligence in the car intelligence in how you interact with your home devices with a home gateway and we've really learned from from all those experiences internal experiences and brought last year a new platform called IOT core cloud IOT core that's ecology core is a managed service it's available in your in your console today if you go to your DCP console it is a managed service you don't have to configure it it scales up and down for you it will allow you to connect millions of devices securely to the cloud very easily from little POC of a few devices to millions of devices with no issues we're really trying to productize IOT core the same way you know bring that innovation to the public to our customers the same way we did with big data tools in the past like you know if syndrome Oh Hadoop HBase came from internal that came out and were delivered to our customers so a little bit about same philosophy here for IOT we've seen great adoption since our launch I mean some great customers will hear about smart parking no a curb EP as well will be will be on stage so we've seen that traction of customer really transforming their business with IOT really finding new business model finding efficiencies finding optimization everywhere they can so it's all about operational insights all about business processes and managing their assets transforming their business with IOT and it's talking to those customers we're really looking at know how we're going forward so talking about customers I would like to bring on stage a Kirby P and Charton from a Kirby rottenness who's been using the platform so a Kirby P is an oil and gas company based around no way and they've been using you know some other platform the GCP platform through a partner called Cod night and they're doing pretty maintenance and all that but Charton tell us more about a Kirby P Thank You Anthony a kbp is a upstream oil and gas company based in Norway we are the fourth biggest company listed on the Norwegian stock exchange so big in a Norwegian scale just short of 2,000 employees and have a daily production of a bit more than 150,000 barrels of oil take a BP as we know we're today is the result of a merger of a small Norwegian company called in Ostia with a very dynamic culture and also the big enterprise the BP side bps asset in Norway it's a pretty impressive growth for a year now what are kind of the key challenges that occur bp's facing and how is IOT helping with those challenges I think I can beep you have the same challenges as a lot of the upstream oil and gas companies on the top like we our industry that's quite heavy and we have the potential to have quite a bit of impact on the environment so I would say HSE or really safety and environment is really always on top so that's something that we really like to use digital for and of course profitability that's driving the own cost increases so yeah so how is that helping like how is IOT helping with those I think there are in several different areas I think they actually one of the things that we see quite good result from it's actually very simple it's just that based on the work that cognate is doing they are extracting a lot of data we are pulling up to a million data point a second into a Google store and based on these data when we get them contextualized in the right way and push it back to the operators out on the platforms that really helps driving better decisions not really being very advanced of course also predictive maintenance kind of predicting events is very important and I think also this data really drives opportunities within kind of moving people out of dangerous sounds and also moving over to a kind of unmanned platform that's something we are kind of leading on also in our way that's great anything else you'd like to add about know your usage of GCP platform anything yeah I think we are really impressed of the speed of the GCP platform and I think also as an industry we are kind of unfortunately a bit slow movers and I think also the work that we are doing with Google really helps us moving faster I think that's really good well Jordan thank you very much thank you for your trust in the platform looking forward to innovate so fantastic use case you know predictive maintenance everything it's it's it's we really love to work with a kirby P so as we're looking now to the future and a little bit of our vision around IOT really looking at IOT through four main pillars one is around intelligence everywhere you've seen this morning we announced our edge strategy this is really about expanding all the AI and email capabilities down closer to where it's needed server lace Calvary I've talked a little bit about clarity core and how technology core server less and scalable we're really trying to make that across the entire value chain of our offering security always number one priority for us and security is actually complicated there's a lot pieces that we have to deal with you know it's from the manufacturing process to the boot of a device to the communication to the back-end services so we'll talk about that and obviously our system of partners IOT is not of a game you play alone you have to play with partners and you have to build an ecosystem in every place of the value chain as well so we really value building a big echo system for our partners and for our customers sorry so it's dive a little bit into intelligence at the intelligence everywhere and particularly where we go with the edge so Google has been known and is known today for a lot of the m/l and AI innovation and the tools that we're providing in this conference you've heard about bigquery ml you've heard about Auto ml coming out you've heard about no probably about cloud ml and gene I mean all those tools that were building to really democratize the AI in democratize ml for our customers really trying to bring all that power to our customers and this is particularly true and image recognition for example with Auto ml vision that's a very impressive tool that you can get you can get to use very quickly without being really a data scientist so we're glad we've been at this too this morning actually to introduce our cloud IOT edge there is actually another session tomorrow morning at 9:30 that drills into IOT edge this is really listening to our customers saying I love you AI but I have some constraints at the edge that I can't really use your cloud platform to do that sometimes my internet my internet connectivity is down in the case of a curve VP sometimes it's no it's boats that are going they can't be connected sometimes it's because the bandwidth constraint you heard about LG this morning they're taking pictures no more hundreds of pictures all the time they can send all those pictures to the cloud to do the inference and come back they have to do it on-site sometimes it's compliance you have to get the data you have to leave the data on site and you can't send it outside of your premise and there's a lot of reasons why edge makes total sense and we're trying to bridge between cloud and edge together so cloud IOT edge is actually two components one is our edge ml component which run time to run tensorflow light model and to get a tensorflow light model you take a tensor flow model that you train maybe we've got em with a male engine or with cloud GPUs in the cloud and you will compile that model for you into a tensor flow light model and send it to the device how do we send it we have a Jo T core which manages the security the connectivity with the cloud or the local processing local storage anything you need you would expect as an edge device that's gonna that's endo by edge IOT core this is in alpha right now there's an early access program that you can sign up for today to get access to this this runtime can run on android things which is a fully secure and manage OS so that's a full OS manage the same way when manage an Android device or phone except it's four things so it's been optimized and we're also going to support Linux OS as well and the big announcement was the hardware accelerator so edge ml will support obviously standard CPU general purpose CPU or GPU or rhtp you so HTTP you was probably the most exciting thing I don't know if you followed the news a little bit there were so many tweets I was like whoa this is actually pretty impressive so people tend to like it so you're seeing a little bit of the size here you can fit four or five of them on a coin very small edge TPU has been really worked in collaboration with the AI research team our software team and the hardware team together to really bring a very purpose-built hardware for inference of machine learning models so it's really that that collaboration between the AI research and the hardware that make it possible with a very big focus on performance per watt and performance per dollars trying to make it cost effective so it can be everywhere and trying to make it very low-power so it doesn't consume a lot of power you can put in on smaller devices you don't have to have you know big big hit sync and things like that so we really believe that those this HTP you will transfer them just dumb data collectors into smart collectors and smart devices and open up a whole range of new user applications so this is really really exciting so the goal of cloud IOT edge if I summarize it's to enhance a personal reliability you know making sure it can work anytime you don't have to worry about loss of connectivity with IOT core you can really deploy those models to the cloud and to the edge sorry and apply them where you need them most in real time very low latency we always focus on security obviously for the secure connectivity with a JIT core and keeping it cost-effective in any scale because the the the more cost-effective the more there's gonna be out there we also thought about how do you marry edge and cloud in a very close loop of learning and that was very important to us we didn't just released an edge product we wanted to make sure that edge product is an extension of your cloud in a closed-loop learning so if this is a kind of a visualization of know the data flowing into IOT edge you can do some learning here you can do some inference here if you want but you can send the data through IOT core to the cloud put it in a database of your choice or data repository choice retrain your model with cloud GPUs potentially then send that model back to the device to edge edge IOT IOT edge to have a local execution so that close do be very important because those devices are not static anymore it's not just you send an email model and let it be you'll improve it over time things can change new new problems can be detected with the images and you need to be able to really effectively move those models update those models through a through this lifecycle so we've seen you know LG this morning and manufacturing very great use case this is a million-dollar saving per line that's pretty impressive just you know by putting that intelligence at the edge in retail you can think about hyper personalization of offers this is a augmented reality view where no discounts could be given to you based on who you are and your purchasing habits you know the motive collision-avoidance you know detecting if somebody's looking at their phone you know that's that's pretty it would be pretty neat I would avoid a lot of accidents I mean there's a lot of notes traffic crowding there's a lot of application for 4ml so those are just a few examples where we've seen traction with some of our customers so if I show you if we showed you the little TPU if I give you that little TPU today you're gonna be a little bit trouble you won't know what to do with it so we created a little some that I have here that some it's a system on modules it's a full module which has a quad-core CPU on it has a Wi-Fi has obviously a route of trust and a crypto from microchip and it has the HTTP you of the C forget this one so this is the this is a some that's production grade so you can actually produce a lot of them this will be available in October so you can buy this in October and start playing with it the other thing that we did because same thing if I give you this you won't be able to do much that we created that development board this is our Y team created the development board so I can just slap this thing on it like this and I clip it I'm not gonna do it I did it I was good and then you have a full system you know with a Gigabit Ethernet and USB C's and all the things HDMI you can connect a camera to it you can GPIO so you can really play with that thing and really get going this also will be available in October for you to play with so we also work with partners on the edge TPU sites are really working with my connector vendors and some of the device analytics vendors to leverage the edge TPU you know in to solutions for our customers so some of those partners who are building either gateways or are really leveraging the the HTTP you for their use cases so we're try to really start kickstart that ecosystem of partners focused on H GPU and application of the HTTP you for for our customers and and for you so let's talk about scalability now that you're all excited about HTTP you you're gonna have a lot of devices with intelligence you're going to need some scalable infrastructure in the backend so IOT core words as I said earlier was really meant to be completely serverless and you can start with one device connected and ramped up to you know millions of devices in production without really having to shard having to plan for memory CPU anything it's just everything is done for you and you're just gonna pay as you go and this allows you to go from POCs to pilot to a small deployment to your production really with no effort and that's really a big big game-changer we think in terms of how it helps you in your digital transformation journey so we innovated in the edge obviously we also kept innovating on the IOT core itself and those are some of the features some are better some are a little more early for example the clarity provisioning service that's that's an early access so this one is about enabling you to onboard and provision literally millions of devices we had to have without having to go one-by-one and provision them so if you're buying a bunch of crypto for example with microchip you buy all the script O's they're gonna give you a real ID and some information you just put that in in the cloud IOT provisioning system and all those IDs will be moved to your accounts so you don't have to do that manually we did things like gateway which is a way to pass through the authentication of IP or non IP devices pass that authentication to the cloud directly so the gateway is not the proxy for all you really authenticate the devices behind the gateway even though they may not be IP devices so that's that's an interesting one we do groups we do high speed messages to the device if you need 100 messages per second down to the device we can do that now and we added some extensive logging capabilities to debug your system so a lot of features we're gonna keep going like that throughout the rest of the year and next year this is kind of the core system being improved now we'd like to welcome another customer that is really changing the game in farming so John Friedman from frayed farm freight farm near and you know all know about Airbnb disrupted hospitality we kind of view frayed farm is disrupting the agriculture so I'm happy to welcome Fred from I think before we start we're gonna see a video that's right so I don't if I click for this or not know [Music] excellent well thanks and welcome to intelidox more about print form yeah sure happy to I did notice a few people kind of look at their their session description I know you're dealing a lot with containers as it relates to the GCP through that's this is a little bit different container so you're gonna be finding out about that today but we use that as a pivotal piece of our infrastructure we feel that shipping containers and IOT are actually great building blocks for the next level of food we're looking to lower the barrier of entry for anybody who's trying to get into farming and make food supply a lot more accessible so getting into this we started looking at the data but we were surprised to find there's not a lot of data in agriculture and one of the biggest industries in the world really hard to find consistent data to build around and the reason for that is there's a few reasons for that actually one there's not a lot of environments that are exactly the same so if you have a farm in one place of the world and another farm halfway across the world the results they're getting and the things that they're doing they're not going to match up so so all that data is very siloed another reason is as farms have been consolidated over the years that generational knowledge hasn't been passed down so we're in a very centralized global food supply system and the things that have been leveraged are the crops the chemical and the genetic attributes of the crops have been really focused on and the ones have been prioritized are the ones that can withstand things like drought are resistant to pests and they can travel really far and hang out on the shelves for a long time so you knows I didn't really say anything about taste or variety or flavor anything like that so if you are a chef and you're looking to get a unique thing on your menu and you want to make a dish that's just very signature to you that's gonna be a really hard task with our current food system yeah if you're in sourcing or you're in any type of food business where you're trying to bring innovation to it it's gonna be very difficult for you to get something that's only grown in a specific part of the world shipped all the way to you in the quantity that you need so it's very familiar to minimum order quantities you see in global manufacturing so what we were inspired by was actually 3d printers and that technology and how that shifted a segment that really couldn't get into the game of prototyping or a small run manufacturing and put that in their hands so a lot more innovation could happen right so that's where we came in and said hey is there a way that we can build a platform that's accessible to everyone uses some infrastructure that or existed in the world that everyone has some logistic support for that's the shipping container and IOT which allows us to get a lot of that transparency and traceability that everyone's looking for you so tell us more about IOT then yeah how is that helping so i io T is what creates those environments in the farm so it's Internet of it the environment for us right when our customers are looking at the farm they're leaning at all the components that make up the perfect scenario inside the unit so let's say you're just getting started I Oh T is going to be what basically sets the environment around a certain crop attribute and heightens that across the way so let me give you an example if you are if you are looking into IOT as a way to Orchestra orchestrate all the different components you can in any environment create an environment that's halfway across the world so we have customers in Puerto Rico to buy Detroit all over the place and inside that farm it's the perfect day of summer every day of the year it's a very unique environment in there we can also create environments that are not of this worlds with IOT so you could take the nutrients composition of Italy and you can match that with the air quality of Salinas Valley pair that with the co2 density that would be next to a active volcano as well as giving a bit plant the light spectrum that it really wants I really wanted to taste that lettuce no don't you so yeah so I use a really essential piece for us to build these environmental recipes to match what's out there in the world but also to create things that aren't of this world so your customers the the chefs are the farmers yeah they use a mobile app to do all that I think that's right can you show us maybe what do you have here yeah give you a little spray the demo good see it looks like it's casting so can we cast the on the screen yeah oh yeah Wow okay so what are we seeing here that's a real farm right that's right so I will keep it upright for this demo so this is what any farmer who's bought a leafy green machine that's what a free farm is called they would see this no matter where they are in the world inside the farm they might use it as their remote control so they wanted to turn something on and off really quickly they're gonna use this same app so let's for instance this is actually a live farm in Boston Massachusetts right now okay this is at our headquarters so let's go ahead and we're gonna turn on the lights so all the devices are connected we're just going to beautiful we just turn that on and now if we do a quick refresh we should see the lights start to turn on in succession you'll also notice that the front lights are linked to the back right lights of the front left lights and the back left lights so that ability to pair linked and create relationships within the farm is all within their fingertips we can also set programs and around that we do call them recipes yeah and I'll talk a little bit more about that no let's say I've turned a few things on and I really like what I got growing there but I want to track kind of what that's doing to the rest of the farm so you can pull up your historical analysis and see what effect maybe one of the things that you've turned on has on another thing in the farm so that's great because you can really start to tune the balance of things based on your needs so you'll be able to look at things like water temperature pH the amount of nutrients that are in the water co2 in the air humidity temperature and there's a whole range of devices that you can pair create dependencies around put on timers things like that so let's say I'm really happy with what I got here well I'm gonna go over to the program section these are all of the things that you can map out different dosing schedules different learning timers set different day and night times and then you can save that recipe you can save that recipe is a unique thing for you or maybe you want to get another farm that's halfway around the world say you're a chain restaurant and you want to have a unique lettuce on your bun that can be something that you save and pour it to all of your farms but you can also pull from a community of recipes that other farmers have created or we have created for you to improve your performance of your farm so actually last year we developed a recipe to improve the efficiency of all models all the way back to 2015 and updated all those farms at once so with this and with cloud IOT we see this is a way that we can continuously improve these farms over time use machine learning tools to basically do this updating for us and always choose the best path excellent well done this is awesome thank you very much addressed thank you thanks let's talk about security you know Security's almost my favorite projects that's where I started my career actually so I've always been keen on having great security for us and know I go we take security obviously very seriously and trying to look at it from the ground of the Google cloud platform itself is built from the ground up with security in mind and IOT core is built on top of that platform so we really try to think about security from an annual and end-to-end standpoint you're going from the devices the connectivity the edge the platform itself and the application but today I really want to focus more on the device side rather than the cloud side by now you probably have seen a lot of session around that and one thing we've done differently when we launched IOT core is the way you offend ticket devices to the cloud we use what we call a token so I mean we don't call it's a standard it's called a JSON web token it's pretty common to authenticate against api's so we use a jot token to do the authentication of the device to the cloud the cloud is authenticated through a standard TLS session but then the device uses a jot that it signs with a private key and authenticate itself with a corresponding public key in IOT core has the same level of security as a TLS mutual authentication but it has a lot of benefits has no dependency on the TLS stack it's very small in footprint it's you can easily upgrade your TLS stack without disrupting your application and it can also a Santa Kate non IP devices because non IP devices can create a jot pass it to our gateway and send it to cloud for authentication so a lot of a lot of really good benefits and actually to demonstrate the power of this we have partnered with microchip to release actually what is fundamental analogy this is the first 8-bit MCU that is securely cloud connected yes this is the first a B MCU that is cloud connected this is really a revolution because a bit it's been there for many years 15 20 years people have been buying a bit people know what they are they're cheap they're really available but until now everybody was saying I know for IOT 32-bit let's go Billy go big well actually you don't need to you can take this 8-bit and because our stack is so small because you use a joking to authenticate devices then entire JA authentication can be handled by a crypto that's on there and the the whole TLS is in the Wi-Fi module itself so because it's so small it fits in there if you use material off you cannot do that so this is only kind of Google specific question if I can so this is really a cool thing this is this is going to come probably around October will be available around October for you to purchase but this will really put IOT everywhere very securely which is super important so finally let's talk about our ecosystem we talked about the ecosystem of each corner that's great but there's really a lot of partners that we we want to work with one one noticeable ecosystem that we like we in May this year we actually announced that we joined the lower Alliance we really like that connectivity layer so we're working with partners like the thing networks or obvious in France or my devices all really good partner in the Laura space that's something we really like and we're going to pursue our effort into we will really look at partners across the entire spectrum from device partners to application partners to service partners you know to really serve and to end solutions to our customers so this is just a sample of some of the incredible partners we have and we're really happy to support our goal is to make our partners successful so our customers are successful and that's really key to our strategy when we partner so now I want to bring Jen Bennett John Bennett is part of our office of the CTO and she's been working with many many customers helping them in their digital transformation and so Jen's going to talk about a few customer use case and how she's trying to create a an ecosystem of businesses actually so Jen thank you right thank you very much it's great thanks to our customer so you know Anthony mentioned that there's a number of industries that are being transformed by IOT and to be honest with you there's not a customer that I've talked to that hasn't been thinking about or embarking on a journey in IOT so it is transforming all industries and across the business from customer engagement to product lifecycle management to risk management and even operational efficiencies and effectiveness so it's really this idea of transformation within within the industry and as we think about that you know this is really a catalyst for new business opportunities Society data and not only that creating ecosystems that can leverage the data in new ways to drive new value so why you embark on an IOT journey maybe for one particular reason but then that data starts to become invaluable in a number of different business cases this idea of democratizing data is really really key to the future of IOT let's look at an example so this is a customer of ours so - out of Europe not too dissimilar to - here in the in in the in North America provides automotive services to their customers and they do this across a number of European countries but with the growth of the connected car they could see that their market was being disrupted and in their words they said we had an opportunity to be daring to disrupt ourselves and become part of this connected ecosystem and so - partnered up with Z who provides an obd to dongle that attaches to the vehicle to provide data from the vehicle and then they partnered up with a DCP or the Google Cloud partner tell me + who specializes in building machine learning models and these machine learning models that they built were all around predicting failures in this particular case they started with battery failures you're in your vehicle you go to start it it doesn't start not a delightful experience so again - partnered up with Z who partnered up oh and created this ecosystem with tell me + to build a machine learning model that could take this data from the I'll predict battery failures of course this is only the start there's many other things that they're going to do but what this enabled them to do was to become a driver companion to their customer so now they've built an app that can provide information about the maintenance schedules that can provide information about predictions on what might be coming and happening it can also provide geolocation information and many many other things in the future they've become the driver companion and part of the ecosystem of course they're looking to roll this out to about a hundred thousand customers but it doesn't stop there this data you can imagine can be leveraged for them to drive down their operational costs managing their inventory having that spare part available before you even get there I don't know how many of you have taken your vehicle in only to find out they didn't have the part you needed it just happened to me recently and so and then not only that but who else could value from the state of the OEM the vehicle manufactures all this plethora of data that they can now leverage to understand their customer better it's an ecosystem it's an ecosystem built on data I'd like to welcome up Jon heard from smart parking a CTO of smart parking maybe you should shut a little bit more insight on another example all related to smart say-so John welcome Thank You Jin maybe give us a brief overview of what you do with smart parking yes thank you everybody for being here and let me just tell you a little bit about smart parking we're a company based out of Melbourne Australia but we have offices in New Zealand where we do our development and we have sites and 17 countries around the world where we are about reinventing the parking experience for you for various customer experiences so there also there are the customer experience for the enforcement officer I know you hate them but making their lives efficient and much much more effective changing the experience of finding a car park that's in a city so that you know that a car park is just around the corner you don't need to keep driving round and round looking for that car spaces they may not be there we also provide payment and and interaction for allowing you to do payment for your parking right there in the seconds from your smartphone or also connecting to your existing infrastructure the payment machines on the streets or and and by the way we do both on the road parking and also off street parking in multi stories and so where you see some car parking spaces where they have the red and green guidance lights that's that's the sort of stuff that we do around the world great maybe tell us a little bit about some of the challenges that led you to partner up with Google good question as we have been starting to talk more and more whether customers we're seeing a change in the conversation that we're having with our customers is no longer just about parking it's actually about how do we change the city experience how do we make our lives within our environments more effective and efficient and parking because it's actually a well understood you know we know about paying for our parking it pays for that initial establishment of the IOT infrastructure for a city and so what we're seeing is that that smart parking is actually deploying and delivering the initial pillar which or tentpole which enables a city to start to broaden their intelligence services within the city so it it reaches out into other things such as public broadband and smart rubbish bins or garbage man's smart street lighting and so on you know it's it's essentially unlimited but that required us to look at the characteristics of what that type of information now requires we need to connect to anything because if that central gateway on this on the street lamppost is doing parking it's also now going to need to connect to other things and so we needed a new class of system that was not just about parking not just about just dealing with those transactions for parking but essentially connecting to anything communicating with anything and then processing their information and smart ways which not just about parking but for smart cities council that we've talked a lot about edge talked to us a little bit about edge and your thoughts on this yeah age is really critical to our real-world you know as we know sometimes when you try to make a phone call you can't connect sometimes when you have really time-dependent things the time it takes to do a communication transaction to a back-end computer you know cloud system may be too long an example is we we process many many many many thousands of images per day and we recognize the number place of cars and that number plate is used to raise a barrier on because you've registered for example to go into that car parking lot now if that barrier arm does not open within about two seconds you're starting to create a queue of vehicles outside that parking space and that really becomes critical especially at you know 10:00 to 9:00 in the morning when you need to get into the office well more importantly it creates congestion also so the edge computing just one example of how the edge computing is really critical is to do that processing in real time right there where you need that information and that edge computing needs to be quite intelligent as well and that's actually what we're so excited about the HTTP you capabilities because we can start to do a whole variety of intelligence right at the edge to guarantee real-time licensing that's just one example fantastic you know I talked it was talking to a retailer and you know they always think about inside the four walls and I said you know one of my biggest frustrations is finding a car spot so when I talk about ecosystems it's like how can we take now that smart parking that navigates you through that the journey that you do in a day you know whether you're parking to go into a building or going to the store right so this ecosystem and you know I know that you you probably face this quite a bit it's it's really about how do we start to enable easy exactly you know it was interesting John just commented about you know the Internet of farm-in and I was just thinking as he was speaking we're creating the Internet of parking for you what we're doing and actually that's the mission that I feel very passionate about we're reinventing that experience and it's it's an experience that we currently live with and it sucks and so the opportunity here of not just the parking and changing that dynamic but making it more cohesive and more personalized to what I'm trying to do is not just about parking usually I'm parking there for some other reason right I'm trying to get to a store I'm trying to get to the office or trying to do something else and it's an inconvenience right now and that's what we're our mission is today you guys have been a tremendous partner and we thank you for your partnership and thank you for joining us today thanks Jim so you know as we think about connected things you know one of the things that's really critical in IOT is this idea of location intelligence and Anthony mentioned Google's you know we've done a lot with connected things but it's no surprise I'm sure that we have a lot of work into location intelligence so if we take you know the very best of maps and routes and places and we start to apply it to things like asset tracking or perhaps efficient routing for some of the most complex fleet itineraries tracking or visualizing your connected assets most importantly no matter where they are all around the world right this is geolocation both inside and outside geocoding distance matrix real time traffic real time Road conditions all at your fingertips such a key asset to the ecosystem of IOT and we're very very proud of of the work that we've done in collaboration with our Maps team as well so no matter what you're tracking you know this solution that's integrated because solution can really help you start to manage your your bottom line grow your top line and manage the risk as well let's look at a few examples so Vagabond is a company that provides technology and operations for the food and beverage service industry so vending machines and they embarked on this journey of an IOT solution where they connected vending machines getting information about stock getting information about the cash and in the vending machine but what they were really looking forward to combined with that was this idea of precise geolocation and you can imagine these vending machines may not always be in the easiest places to locate it could be in the third floor dormitory or it could be in a back alley right so this idea of having world-class geolocation was really really critical and now they can overlay that vending machine information on precise location so that their drivers can be very efficiently routed for restocking activity and they've been able to drive some tremendous improvements in terms of the that both the top-line growth as well as managing their bottom line and theft so theft has been reduced about 15% off the top line so some really great example another example is a company out of Australia called fleet minder and they provide a vehicle and asset tracking solutions in about 12 countries and really what they wanted to do was be able to visualise the location of these vehicles and combine it with some of their GPS technology that they have giving dispatchers not only location information but really optimize routes and so you can actually see now even surrounding the real-time surrounding information and really start to drive a whole lot of use cases for example being able to understand maintenance activity and where the closest maintenance shop would be for that for that driver some really great results from fleet fleet minder about a 50% decrease in overtime which if anybody who's been in the trucking industry this is a huge problem and a huge cause of turnover is their time away from home so some incredible efficiencies that have been gained through doing some of these things not to mention really reducing the incorrect deliveries so this has been really game-changing in terms of their business volume so we talked about IOT delivering new insights Anthony mentioned intelligence we talked about intelligence at the edge we've talked about scalability and really taking the opportunity to drive new business and we talked about how how IOT is enabling an ecosystem I'd really like to pull all those pieces together with you and share a video so can we roll the video please West Oakland is surrounded by three major freeways and it is downwind of the Port of Oakland which is a fifth largest port in the country the community is the real blend of land it's only been recently in the past half century that we realized that this is a bad layout for public health we clusters cancers related to what makes airborne food so dangerous and that they are not always visible to the human eye EDF and Google brought together other partners to collect measure and analyze air pollution data in Oakland Oakland Oakland aah who put a few key parts with their Atlanta environmental intelligence platform which attach the scientific grade air quality measurements what we've done is many tries basically an air quality laboratory into the car so it's able to provide high quality measurement fast high-resolution iya partnered with academic scientists to analyze the data that we received from the Google Street View cars the measurement and analysis have shown elevated levels of black carbon and nitrogen oxide in Oakland these types of air pollutants typically come from the burning of fossil fuels cars trucks and other industrial sources we're really beginning to see in much higher detail but the air we breathe on the ground looks like we hope this new data can empower local communities and community groups to advocate for cleaner air [Music] so you can see quite an ecosystem already being formed around collection of data from vehicles in Eric pollution but this ecosystem is growing even more in May of this year Kaiser joined into the ecosystem and now what they've done is take that data and combined it with electronic medical records from residents who live in this area and did a study around how that is impacting a block by bike analysis of the health risks from air pollution the most detailed analysis of its kind so we're really really proud of this partnership this ecosystem that's forming to solve new problems to solve old problems with new approaches really really thrilled about this so you know if you want to learn more about IOT we have a breakout session tomorrow in the morning Anthony mentioned this about the IOT edge we have a showcase on the at the I'm sorry we have an IOT area in the showcase in Moscone South but we also have a lot of information online and I encourage you to go there and check it out with that our session will will be completed I'd ask for you to provide any feedback in the mobile app and I hope and thank you for joining us once again I'd like to thank John from freight farms I'd like to thank John from smart parking and I'd like to thank jarton from acre BP tremendous customers tremendous partners and I hope you guys have a rest of the great rest of the next event thanks so much for coming [Music]
