 my name's Aaron Massey for mr. Fixit diy.com and today I'm here to share with you my top ten ways to keep dust down during a remodel this video is brought to you by try Mako makers of an extensive line of surface and jobsite protection products since 1906 for a complete list of their products and where you can purchase them check out their catalog at Tri Mako comm one of the fastest ways to drive yourself or your spouse crazy during a DIY remodel project is to have the dust to carry over into the rest of the house dust can seemingly travel to the part of this corners of the house coating furniture flooring windows and electronics now I can't sit here and lie to you and tell you that it's possible to keep remodel dust 100% contained but with a little bit of prep work on the front end and some maintenance throughout the project it is possible to keep it under control and limited to the areas that your remodel number one is budget for dust containment now this seems like a no-brainer but most people I've talked to about this fail to consider dust containment as part of their estimated remodel cost and in my opinion it's one of the biggest mistakes πο wires make and we're not talking a ton of money here but plan to budget around a hundred to two hundred dollars depending on the size of your project on the front end to dedicate towards dust containment if you don't budget for it you will have spent at least that amount by the end of the project anyway in time cleaning products or cleaning services to clean up after you number two plastic is your best friend before I get started on demo for any remodel I always try to contain the project and as much as possible in its own little bubble I recommend stapling it in place wherever possible for added strength and then sealing the edges with tape you can use duct tape or a more friendly wall painters tape depending on if you're keeping the wall or not I recommend at least a four millimeter to six millimeter plastic because it's thin enough to be manageable but thick enough to withstand the duration of your project without getting destroyed if you poke a hole in it or tear it during your project fix it right away this is the maintenance part I was talking about throughout your project you'll have to continuously check and make sure your enclosure is staying dust proof number three is to do your demo strategically if you're doing a bunch of demo as part of your project or maybe removing a wall to open up a space focus on the areas away from the rest of the house first before moving towards the separating wall the longer you can keep a permanent barrier between rooms better before you take out that final wall build a temporary plastic wall on the other side using some thick plastic and some dust containment poles or a basic wood frame this temporary wall will serve as your main protective barrier for the rest of your project so make sure you're checking it regularly to make sure it's staying dust proof number four utilize your windows if you're lucky enough to have a window in your project area they can be really helpful as a place to remove demo materials in addition to that they can be used to create a positive pressure room by building a box fan enclosure to have the dust blow outside while you're working thick cardboard scrap plywood or thick plastic and some tape work great for this crack one window open opposite your fan to keep air flowing throughout keep in mind that if the windows are open there's likely to be a breeze blowing in if the fan is not running so make sure everything else in the room is sealed up tight and also remember to remove your screen so you don't end up with them caked in dust number five is to cover your vents not only will dust get in there and get blown around the rest of your house covering every inch of your belongings but it'll also clog up your air filters seal around all your registers in your work area to make sure it doesn't become an issue I still recommend replacing your air filter on your system after any remodel it's something you should do to maintain your system every few months anyway so you might as well do it after a rim off number six is to create single entry and exit points for your work area there is no faster way to have dust travel throughout your house than to have a bunch of places where you or your crew can go in and out of your project area limit it to one doorway or entry point and thoroughly seal all the other access points use the windows as places to remove materials if you can so you don't have to go in and out a lot at your access point install a solid dust containment door kit with a zipper like this easy up dust containment door kit from Tri Mako make sure you keep it closed up at all times even leaving it open for just a few minutes while creating a lot of dust can be enough to have it flow into the rest of your house and make a mess if you have help on your project make sure your crew is as diligent about containing the dust as you are number seven is to protect your floor's taking a little bit of time upfront to protect your floors both inside and outside your project area can save you a huge headache on the road create singular pathways to and from your project site and to the restroom you're using throughout the project to protect your floors and make sure you and your crew are using only those pathways when it comes to carpeting you may not realize how dirty it has become because your carpet will suck up the jobsite dust if you have kids or pets crawling around on it it can be dangerous protect it with some cling wrap like the easy mask protective carpet film it's easy to install and keep your carpet protected from tracking and absorbing dust keeping the dust off a harder surface floors like hardwoods linoleum or tile is pretty simple by using some thick cardboard floor protectant like tri Mako's x board it'll keep your floors from getting dirty scratched or damaged and your boots from tracking dust through other areas of your house number eight might seem a little counterintuitive but I encourage you to keep your boots on one of the biggest culprits of spreading dust is the bottoms of your boots or shoes and it just doesn't make a lot of sense to try and take them on and off as you go in and out of your work area hold it it might work for the first few hours but eventually you'll get sick of taking your shoes off and on utilize shoe guards as much as possible or if you want to splurge and try out an awesome new product check out the easy guard floor system from tri make oh this thing allows you to step in slide back and tear off a sticky protective plastic membrane for the bottom of your boots think of it like a box of cling wrap in your kitchen it's super easy to use and you can just stash it next to your door to make sure you can always walk through the house without fear of tracking dust the dust is trapped to the bottom of your shoes by the plastic wrap so you have nice clean feet when going through the house number nine is take your cuts outside as much as possible many people think that dust containment stops with the demo portion of the remodel so they take down any dust containment they've put up and throw it away but few things generate more dust than cutting and sanding drywall keep your dust containment up for the duration of the project or be prepared to rehang it once you get to drywall I recommend doing as much of the cutting of your drywall and building materials outside and then bringing the pieces in and hanging them keep as much dust outside initially as you possibly can and lastly I encourage you to keep a shopback handy at all times drywall dust is prolific and one of the reasons why I absolutely despise doing drywall I recommend doing everything you can to minimize your dust while you're sanding the don't generate a lot of dust doing drywall but if you're an amateur like me consider investing in a drywall sanding dust attachment for your shopback keep that shot back on hit and suck up any dust that starts to accumulate throughout the project at least at the end of every work day you'll be extremely glad that you did and of course if you're generating a lot of dust make sure that you wear a respirator or a dust mask to protect yourself let sit for this video
