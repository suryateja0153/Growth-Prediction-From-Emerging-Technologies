 Electronics Project Details & Customized Development Call/Watsapp +917738796642 This is an innovative system that operates automatically to help solve the garbage disposal problems using IOT and clap sensor circuit Normal dust bins need to be opened before disposing the garbage One needs to manually keep a track of whether the dustbin is full or not in such a case Our system comes to the rescue It consists of a sensor which can detect the sound of a clap or the tap of a foot and it opens Automatically without having to press the foot Reba this system also has an ultrasonic level sensor indicating The bin is empty or not. It continuously keeps track of the garbage level and updates the status using I would When the bin is full the system releases an alarm to alert the authorities so that the pin can be emptied and reused So, let's see how the product works Let's turn on the circuit The system is getting connected the LD website using Wi-Fi Okay, so our system is now online it's demonstrated by clapping As You can see the system detects the plaque and opens the lid after a few seconds. It. Shuts does it automatically Now we shall fill the been to its limit As you can see the system receives an alarm using a buzzer Simultaneously the status of the pin has changed from empty to full on the website So now the main garbage collector is alerted using IOT and the authorities will come and empty the bin So, this is how the project works. Thank you You
