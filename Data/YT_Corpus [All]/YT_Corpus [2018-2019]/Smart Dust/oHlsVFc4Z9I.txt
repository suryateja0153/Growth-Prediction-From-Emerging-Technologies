 that voice is just it's killing you it's crazy and it's funny we dealt with this when I lived in Miami before I came here for a little bit we had saharan does come over and I was like man I'm sick I'm getting a cold allergies and yep that's what it was there you go well welcome back but thank you to see you again yeah glad to be inside and inside the air-conditioning as well and you needed to cool off as well today because man is it bit hot for you as you take a look at the Dallas Skycam time lapse this is the sucker right there I'll be able to put this in motion you can see that dust just hanging out in the sky so if you're having some trouble speaking as well or you're just dealing with kind of some allergies that is the reason why for us how's it going through the evening there's the Saharan dust that we were talking about kind of hanging out right now and we will continue to see this hang out as we go through the remainder of the night tonight but I'll let me put this in motion as we go into Tuesday here we are into Tuesday night as we get a little bit closer towards the fourth of July you notice that we start to see some of this fade off just a little bit more as we have an area of low pressure starting to push its way closer towards the Lone Star State so what that means for you is some relief is in sight DFW Airport right now we're 91 degrees with a southeast wind at 10 miles per hour we were at 101 officially for this afternoon so very hot conditions the average high this time of year should be 94 is 94 we should be 94 we were well above that so total days this year six last year we had 10 a 100 degree days at DFW year the average is 18 and the record was 71 back in 2011 we don't want to get close to that or even close to tying that as you take a look we had 102 in Shreveport - 100 in San Antonio so we weren't the only ones really hot sweating for the day today we're sitting in the low 90s to the mid to the upper 80s across parts of the Metroplex and still across parts of North Texas were sitting at 88 Milne olla to 82 in Bowie so overnight tonight into tomorrow morning we cool down to about 80 degrees so it's going to be another warm start to your day temperatures then warm their way back up to 101 for tomorrow afternoon with our south southeast winds at 5 to 10 here's that future sky forecast you see for tomorrow it's another hot one but you notice a little bit of cloud cover that kind of counterclockwise turn with this low pressure as that pushes in small rain chances on the fourth of July here's that breakdown for the fourth of July in the Metroplex attended to 20% chance better rain chances well down towards us and the East and here is that fourth of July forecast for you as we're going into it we're gonna be seeing at temperatures in the low 90s by midnight then by 2:00 o'clock about 87 degrees you should be home and no more fireworks than two o'clock in the morning fYI as you take a look about seven-day forecast then our rain chance to sit at 20% Friday our best rain chance dug comes this weekend at a 40% chance on Saturday we'll take any we can get but look at that our temperature
