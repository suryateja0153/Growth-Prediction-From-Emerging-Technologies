 In this video, I'm going to show you how to leave a car as best as possible spending the minimum, specifically mine, which I've just bought It's a smart and even if it doesn't look like it, it's a real car, small, but it has the same problems as a big one. To begin with, the headlights were crusty, and that is solved by polishing them with a strong polish first It can even be done with the hand however, it’ll take a long time I'm not going to say much about this because there are many things to fix in this car and if not the video would be endless The good thing is that this car's panels are all plastic and can be removed easily, so you work much more comfortably. Pouring water is because the polish dries and this way you don’t have to be applying more all the time With this, the headlights look great in about half an hour, if you do it with a polisher it takes 5 minutes but I actually polished the whole car by hand, so you can do it, but it takes hours and hours, all night directly I was painting some things and while they dried, I polished The bumper was also quite loose, besides the scratches, it would have taken some blows but well, it is solved with a rivet and it remains fixed The rest of the body panels, apart from being full of scratches, had as marks of having had stickers, and that's because this car is used a lot in the city center, where there are many people as an advertisement-car, they put a lot of vinyl and fill it with advertising Specifically, who sold it to me had a law firm and had put the address of their website, legal help and so on, the whole car full of stickers or rests of them. To polish it is better to do it in 2 phases First, with strong polish until the marks left these micro grooves and then a fine polish to remove them As I say, with a polishing machine it takes much less time, but you don’t need to buy it because it costs around 50/100€, dirties the whole garage and makes a lot of noise Besides, with the rag you can focus directly on the scratch. Another more worrying problem was that the driver's window didn’t work and it was hot plus they could steal you much easily. The solution is usually simple and cheap, a button that you can take in the junkyard and change it because sometimes they melt, the current passes through it, makes bad contact or whatever, and it breaks. But of course, who doesn't know might think you've to change the whole door, the engine, the window lifts, electric things that scare you. Just like seeing that the air conditioning isn’t cold, but rather comes out hot and seems not to work When I bought it, I thought it would be the compressor or a leak, I expected an expensive reparation but in the end with changing the air filter, which is right here underneath this cover, it was enough This filter lets the air pass from outside to inside but if it has so much dirt instead of acting as a filter, it doesn’t air enter so it doesn’t expel cold air. Just as if you cover the air conditioning in your house with a fat blanket I put a new one that had active carbon or something nonsense so it’s more expensive, but especially thought so you don’t smell the smoke of diesel and so that bacteria doesn’t pass. With that, at minimum it marked 13 degrees, quite cool and if I put level 2, it went down to 9/8 or even less over time. Another problem that seems little but always bothered when someone went up as a copilot was that door didn’t close, it stayed like half closed. This is because the grease it has sometimes becomes so dirty that in the end it is like sand and acts as sandpaper The best is to clean everything thoroughly and re-grease If you dismantle it you will clean it better but it isn’t necessary, with a little touch the door already closed perfectly Another typical problem is that the outside pieces those that are unpainted and are made of plastic, become whitish looking as if they are going to split Well, you only have to hydrate them, I applied a matte hydrator and it was great Don’t forget to clean them before The antenna wasn’t of this car besides it was a bit cracked but the worst thing is that when I went at 120km/h, it hit against the plate of the car I suppose if it was on the roof it wouldn't bother, but here it did. What I did was to put one as small as possible and rigid, carbon fiber-like, well from the pound shop, the cheapest it looked pretty good and sounded exactly the same, so no problem. The battery worked well, the car started, but it had a lot of dust from having been sulfated I removed most of it before recording this, but it was still below the iron and that eats the metal in fact, you can see the battery support of your car that is completely eaten This is a fairly cheap piece that you can usually buy over the Internet, with colors and decorations but I preferred to keep the original When there is so much rust, the metal brush doesn’t do too much, it is best to immerse the piece in vinegar A commercial product works better because it directly eats the rust, but the vinegar softens it and then with the brush it is removed more easily so you can use it for battery connectors, screws and any piece of metal Remove the dust from the sulfated battery with gloves because it is bad for the skin and eats the metal, it doesn’t affect much the plastic The battery must be filled with distilled water so that the cells inside don’t rust, or get spoiled This way it’ll last many years, if it has 10 years now, maybe another 10 but try to never lower the battery too low charge, the more you discharge it the less it lasts. Now we begin with the interior, which was dirtier than a pigsty, it was quite disgusting All the doors and plastics full of dirt, there were even missing parts such as the one under the steering wheel which didn’t cost me too much to find and put, because it went with some clips but it did take me many hours to clean all this and leave it decent, because it was yellowish due to the dirt The dashboard, which was lined with fabric, complicated things because if you wet it too much it could leave marks or furrows, and then it looks bad forever The cheapest solution is to use wipes and be continually changing them so that they absorb the dirt but not too much to avoid rubbing it later Also there are times that the plastics of some buttons are peeled and this is complicated to solve You can change the button, or peel all the plastic and leave the button white that doesn’t look bad The rest is a matter of patience and everything is cleaned the same, except the steering wheel A trick is to look at it with a magnifying glass almost literally. You have to approach and look at the pores and where the cracks are, to clean until they are not seen because if you see them it means they’re dirty because when they are clean, it looks black uniformly This sounds like nonsense but it makes the steering wheel change color, looking much cleaner and with a better touch a much better feel. If you have any piece of the seam raised and want to leave it well, pass a lighter without getting to burn it only heat it so that the plastic retracts, with that they look good You have to do it with care not to burn the thread because otherwise you’ll have to give a couple of stitches This can also be done on clothing or acrylic things, because at the end is plastic like the entire dashboard After cleaning to the last corner, even where you cannot see, but I like to have it clean, I began with the seats that were very bad and is very difficult to clean when it comes to a clear fabric because they don’t hide the errors, so I had to leave them well The backrest looked like a cheese grater full of dead cells, it was very disgusting. But with a liquids-vacuum cleaner and a lot of patience, I let them the best possible If they didn't look like new, I give them a 9.5. They recovered the clear color, there were no stains even though you could see some small wear but the fabric was clean and you could sit comfortably Another option would be to upholster them, change them or dye them, but for me they were fine The carpets, although at first were very bad, whitish, full of stains and practically to throw away I did as in the steering wheel: I applied a little heat through the seams until they were recovering Even so, after cleaning them, they maintained that color and stains which damaged the whole view so I dyed them As I said that can be done with a spray that isn’t the same as to paint, but a special one to dye They were getting more and more black well if you have bought black, if not it can be red or brown or the color you want Look at the difference from where I've painted to where I haven't, the change is quite noticeable and finally they are very black Maybe in another car with normal measures, it is better to buy new ones but in this one as they were expensive and I wanted to maintain the originals, I did it this way. With the trunk I had 2 problems, the first was that it opened with the key, but well that didn’t bother me The second was that it was full of hair and dirt but animal hair and for someone who is allergic, not me, but going in my car, it was a problem Every time she was in the car it was like she was dying, so it was very important to clean it I began to remove them with the vacuum cleaner but those hairs were like embedded and no one could remove them so I had to remove hundreds of hairs by hand, yes, a very fun task. I took out the load separator to clean better, but it was also very fuzzy, like the carpets The solution was the same, with fire and in the end it seems that everything is solved with fire, but it looks very good The rest of the plastics, as those inside, the doors and all that I cleaned them with water and ammonia in equal parts, is the cheapest and best result What could not simply be cleaned were the rims, which by the way, in my country the rims are the metal they always tell me that in the other countries they call rins to the tire, here ‘rines’ doesn’t exist They were painted with spray in a bad way and I thought that this paint was going to jump right away so I went to the car wash and I hit them with the pressure-gun as close as possible to remove all the paint And so it was, the paint went as if it was paper. This is what happens when you paint badly, applying only spray, without primer nor lacquer nor anything So I'm going to teach you how to do it with spray but well, that it is was brand-new with the paint not skipping nor falling, lasting forever (until you scratch them) and with mirror finish The first thing is to remove all the old paint, leaving the metal as exposed as possible There are people who use sandblasting, etc but well, if it doesn’t fall when you pass the hand and it resist passing the nail or sandpaper, it is enough. I didn’t decide which color to use. I bought aluminum, anthracite, and I had a lot of black Normally I don’t like black tires or dark color, but when they aren’t pretty, as is the case and are quite ugly the best is that they are seen as little as possible, so gives you an all-black aesthetics and looks pretty good After removing the center lids that are plastic, you must pass a fine sandpaper, 400 grain to remove imperfections and jumps in the paint Then if you don’t want to dismantle the tire, you can put papers inside to cover the brake disc or drum because if you're going to paint the tire red, it's bad to see behind red too To paint well with sprays there is only one trick, to do it very slowly Give the first layer very thin leaving it as a powder for the second layer to grip better This works the same with the primer, the color, now in black, and the lacquer which by the way is the most important thing This one in particular is bi-component for that reason it has like a button at the back that we have to press so it mixes thus you obtain a lacquer much harder and resistant enduring the scratches and the blows like the one that comes from factory and as I said, it is necessary to apply many layers, each one takes about 10/20 minutes to dry We should apply 2 of primer 3/4 of colour, here we should turn the wheel, removing the hand brake and moving the car so that we paint where we couldn’t because we can’t paint upwards since the spray doesn’t work This is important especially when applying the color, so that you don’t see areas with less paint but the lacquer is equal or more important. You have to give first a very thin layer, and then the second and third quite fat they grab well thanks to the thing first layer you applied before and it will be dry and you've to apply until you see it as wet, reflecting you If you see it as granulated, is that you have to continue applying more Put mask on, because the sprays have a lot of gas When you finish painting and remove the papers inside the tire, if you have fallen some paint on the disc brake which is normal, with a couple of breaks it goes away The embedded cars in the edge of the tire are the best way to separate the tire and not paint it but it can be covered with tape. The lacquer spray says it's only for professional use I'm not a professional, but I like the result a lot, so I recommend it I have kept the plastic covers of the center, but I'm not going to put them because I like how it is without them That's the way it is finally. Now, all that’s left is a small mechanical revision With the car raised like that, it seems a puppy peeing. I lift the back part because the engine is there and it is a bit more difficult to have access from above but below everything is easy I also bought oil for the gearbox, which was a bit expensive for just 2L, around 30€ but it had already passed the 80,000km that is when they recommend it and I imagined the previous owner had passed, as with the spark plugs, that’s why I also bought them There was no way to remove the oil drainage screw; I recommend you use a fixed key otherwise, apart from flaring it, you can break the ratchet. The filter on the other hand goes by hand sometimes you have to use a tool to grasp it better when it is in inaccessible places I tell you about the fixed key because I broke one of the pieces of my tool box trying to remove the drain screw from the gearbox Maybe because the tool box was 20€, but better to use a fixed key. By the way, before removing the screw through which the oil comes out, loosen the one that is to put the oil to prevent that you can’t fill it later, besides, this way air enters and it is emptied faster In 5 minutes you have it, but it is best to do it slowly In fact, when it was completely empty, I poured a little more, because according to the manual needed 1.4l so I had enough left with 2l. I always do this, to rinse off and so that all the dirt comes out, only leaving clean oil inside Then we close the screw below and fill from above, there is not much mystery Even if it's easy, just for removing two screws, if you go to a workshop you are charged from 60 € to 200 € and I won't even tell you if they had to do all I’ve done before So just for the price of materials, which would be less than 100 €, I have the car practically perfect with few kilometers and to my taste By the way, I found it at a good price thanks to having all these things. So I hope you liked it, that it is useful and helps you to get a cheap car that you can fix yourselves
