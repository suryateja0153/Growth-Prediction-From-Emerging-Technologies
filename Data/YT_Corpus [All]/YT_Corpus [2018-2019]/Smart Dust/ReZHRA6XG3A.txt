 geoffery infra scott-padget today this is the the same situation we have what 1012 days yeah the start of July and those p.m. counts the particulate matter 2.5 microns are smaller which are dangerous those counts got the highest they've been in 20 years Wow so we're gonna have even thicker dust I believe tomorrow I'll show you that coming up but this is how time lapse look this evening it was a weird sunset in fact because of all the dust we'll put it in motion and it was just so hazy could barely make out the actual Sun there it was at the horizon and then it got a little bit closer risin and all but disappeared and flashed out a few bright flares overhead because of the dust lighting up but we've fallen to evening now we do have an air quality update here and that there was issued a particulate matter band or a warning because of the high particulate matter at 1:17 reported Dallas and Fort Worth that's unhealthy for sensitive groups I think this number gets higher tomorrow let me show you why there it is 5,000 miles away it's its original origin comes out of Africa crosses on the trade winds and then every now and then the buna high will get a batch of this into North Texas the worst of it right now is into the hill country let me show you our exclusive forecast model that models this dust showing that yea it's inside North Texas now but the worst of it comes in tomorrow for Tuesday and Wednesday as well now as we get into Thursday things do start getting a little bit better than on Friday better still so we do have some relief on the way we believe with this dust it's just going to take a couple of days for it to work through the atmosphere and get out of our way so it only gets hotter from here we had a hundred and one degree today we think 102 tomorrow look at the numbers climbing as we get to Friday 106 the reason for that is high pressure is just building in and as it does so the storm track stays well up to the north we don't talk about any rain chances we just talk about these really hot temperatures the hottest it's been really since well August of two years ago 2016 looking for a little bit of rain maybe up here into our Northeast we might see a little shower activity as we cross the afternoon but otherwise we got really dry conditions in store for us we only put a 10% chance tomorrow then we don't even bother from Wednesday on into the weekend instead triple digit highs continue to run all the way across of the weekend stay with us we'll be right back
