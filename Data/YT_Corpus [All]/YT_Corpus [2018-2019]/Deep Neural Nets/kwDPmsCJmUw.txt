 [Woman singing]  Sadly one Sunday, I waited and waited with flowers in my arms, for the grief I'd created I waited 'til dreams like my heart were all broken The flowers were all dead and the words were unspoken The grief that I knew was beyond all consoling The beat of my heart was a bell that was tolling Saddest of Sundays Then came the Sunday when you came to find me They brought me to church and I left you behind me My eyes would not see what I wanted to love me The earth and the flowers are forever above me The bell tolled for me and the wind whispered 'never' But you I have loved and I bless you forever Last of all Sundays
