 [Music] hello and welcome to this design practice to module 12 we'll be continuing on the topic of micro electromechanical systems or MEMS so we were discussing about bio chips or lab on chip devices and basically if you may recall lab on chip is a term for devices that would integrate multiple laboratory functions on a single chip with extremely small miniscule fluid volumes there are applications in the area of research related to medicines for example pharmaceutical research deploys quite a bit of this lab on chip for studying issues related to protein chemistry or protein fouling or you know associated technology associated technology models a lot of these chips are often often on used in food safety particularly food and water safety which are considered to be the borders which would be agents of Caring infection into the human systems and somehow need to be protected the advantages that lab on chip have to offer and many for example they are away from human intervention fully integrated in nature highly automated highly sensitive very rapid to work in and then you can you talk about the cost performance product of this chip so they are low cost and high performance so they are also one of the object of you know central theme or attention of a lot of companies so some companies which sell these technologies of a noun are for example nanogen caliper Affymetrix klara so on so forth and by and large a major portion of the lab on chips are still dedicated to the area of integrated gene analysis although there are technologies which have evolved which are considered to be munot chips where liza and some other essays are carried out okay when we talk about a step further and hit upon the domain of independent cells and they are behavior so we are all aware that the human cell or let's say any million cell is a fantastic piece of machinery because it does compress information which is stored somewhere in the chromatin region in form of chromosomes or DNA into sequence says which can then mRNA sequences which can then lead to the production of proteins at the the the produce proteins in the otherwise well known protein warehouses which are present in the per nuclear region of a cell and this mRNA molecules typically take the information which you know is generated by your signal which is carried into the the nuclear region you know by a sigma factor okay which typically associates with the the RNA polymerase and otherwise very well known enzyme and tries to compress information from the DNA to the RNA so it's a very complex process of transcript izing the sequence information which is there on the DNA of a cell probably some of you are also aware of the fact that once the mRNA is made and then the mRNA goes into the you know perinuclear region in in those protein warehouses which are floating around otherwise known as in the endoplasmic reticulum there is a you know there is a change of the language from the normal sequences on RNA to sequence of amino acids which are otherwise well known as proteins and these proteins are what determines the functionality and behavior the physiological aspects related to a living cell so proteins control quite a bit of transcription of specific genes and you know such movements of DNA to RNA and then do proteins are being controlled okay in the real time through you know in a very close paced way because whatever expression changes happen in the surface of a cell can be monitored on a real-time basis through again using MEMS platforms okay and so some of these tools may be an array of MOSFET devices which are going to measure the change in current on the basis of surface potential changes across the surface you know of a cell as it expresses proteins etcetera they are all in place to tell about this roadmap and analyze how single cells would behave and understand the various signaling pathways within the cells which would lead to a transcription and translation mechanism okay so it's a woman's utility to cell physiology particularly to understand how they behave with stimuli under different conditions and so this whole area of nano biology in a way uses such micro structures created and printed in a very array like manner to understand more about how much expression is happening on surface of cells etc so this are one of the novel tools for a nano nano technology also better known as nano biology there are dedicated centers to studying of how cells would you know change expressions etc based on either electronic responses or fluorescence responses and it's worthwhile to use MEMS in these kind of sensing mechanisms so today you know talking on the size and scale obviously when we talk about merging these two worlds together there are different biological moieties for example on the left side of this scale here wearing from even the you know atomic level of tens of tens of Armstrong's all the way to one one Armstrong all the way to about plant and animal cells which are quite high in size maybe 20 micron plus and on the left the world that relates to how microstructure can result in some of the features and structures of a size parity with some of these biological features and structures this for example is a double helical structure of a DNA this is a virus molecule a few hundred nanometers in size this right here is an SEM image of an e coli bacteria and so therefore when we talk about such a merger between the you know fabricated structures and the naturally available structures one thing which is very clear is because of the very minuscule contribution of its own mass or weight related to such structures it's always a very nice merger you know and and it's always a very sensitive detection okay so therefore technologies have evolved on 2d CMOS platforms which have all these different devices integrated including microfluidic MEMS molecule specific sensors MEMS and MEMS you know which are the structural nature and then course molecular devices and memory together to give you some idea of how these entities do behave in different environments and what are the kind of stimuli that they are able to generate so these typically form the area of what you know as integrated bio chips okay so both the micro micro and nano area and there is a huge amount of demand of you know such technologies they're rapidly emerging around the world part of it also is reflected under the overall broad stream of bio design and and so therefore it's off quite a bit of significance to a product design engineer as well as bio design engineer okay who can take these technologies further far very simple easy to use you know products which would serve the diagnostic needs you know for the human society so when we look in a nutshell this whole area of micro and nano systems and how it has evolved a lot of to-and-fro inspirational learning has happened in both areas for example there has been devices which are made through biological entities look at DNA based nanowire so molecular nano wires which are inspired for some of the next generation molecular electronic devices they're highly inspired from what happens in biology and biomedicine and it gives something which is off significance to the area of micro and nano systems then we talk about self-assembly is both DNA and protein mediated or self-assembled monolayers or if we talk about inspirational learning borrowed from the skin look at the skin for example it is such a wonderful thing it can sense you know it can respond it can heal and so if you look at the skin from a perspective of an engineering object it is a dense array of sensors integrated together you know into a small area and so therefore it can of course inspire a lot of learning experiences for micro nanotechnology where you can have by inspired materials or skin-like materials okay which can serve the humanity better in general on the on the left side here are some of the tools that we have taken up from the micro nano systems technology and it helps in really the the bio-inspired world and for example we talk about hybrid bio devices we're structuring at the micro nano scale are used heavily for doing the shoe engineering applications there are scaffolds which are grown which are of sexual sacrificial material and they are biocompatible and the cell growth promoted within such calf scaffolds and then later on the scaffolds are etched out or pulled out so that you have a hollow structure in between similarly you know there are the therapeutics associated with drug release targeted delivery today we can actually make a carbon nanotube with functionalization both internally and externally and you know you can flow this through intravenous means to a certain site which is affected with some tumors growth or maybe can serious growth something like this and then this way deliver you can targeted lis happen for therapeutic purposes again borrowed inspiration from the micro of nanotechnology you can you can also borrow a lot of inspiration from bio chips and what quantum dots or silicon nanowires can do in terms of recognition which can directly help the bio world so there is a lot of learning from micro nanotechnology which can even translate into biology and biomedicine so on the right side here which is learning borrowed from biology into micro nanotechnology would produce some novel solutions and some for some frontiers in materials and information processing systems whereas when the learning is reversed that means you're learning from the micro nanotechnology systems and applying to biology and biomedicine there can be some novel solutions and frontiers in medicine in biology so that's how we can actually look at it as a synergistic system and all these are based on or rotating around that fundamental micro and nano systems so there are some other examples I would like to look at very closely which are found abundantly in the you know areas of Microsystems for biology for example look at this neuro probe which has been developed by doctor wisest group at the University of Michigan it is about you know it's a probe which would have a lot of printed electronics and would be able to monitor the electrical activity of the brain tissue particularly in rat brain and for using this probe the incision that is needed to insert this probe into the brain is very very small because the overall dimensions of this probe is also quite small it's again borrowed is an inspiration from the area of micro nano systems but it can do something like painless monetary okay of the electrical activity of brain tissue for example this again is another very nice example this is a neuro probe developed at Stanford which typically was supposed to do deep electrical stimulation which is a you know again a therapeutic strategy given to particularly Parkinson disease patients and the idea is that if you can make this experience painless for them it's going to be of immense value okay to the society these are a set of neuron cells growing on bunch of MOS transistors which are micro patterned on a surface and this is the area of nanobiology I have described in the last step where whatever happens on the surface of the cells and the understanding that you develop here is psychologic or physiologically how the cells would respond in proximity of each other or while they are spread apart on a surface and how the Crofts talk with each other so this is again another beautiful example of how micro nanotechnology can be inspired for something directly translating to the biology or biomedicine this right here is a micro needle it's again another example which can be you know how micro and nano systems go into helping the humanity through interaction with the human side we all know how painful it is to inject something intravenously into babies for example or even into you know old-age people or normal human beings some of the people are very afraid of painful injections so this injection right here is rhythmic very well with the you know with the injector on a mosquito and therefore just as a mosquito bite when the mosquito bites you you don't feel the pain because the needle which cause the mosquito needle which goes into your body typically goes in a region which is just above the vasculature where there are pain receptors and is not able to damage deform those pain receptors which otherwise would be the case when you try a bigger needle so this right here is another example of a silicon bio chip which has been developed at Purdue for detection of food microorganisms there is another example right here about a series of micro cantilevers which have been developed by izm IBM Zurich Research which talks about how cantilevers and bending in cantilevers can be mapped to physical reactions sorry chemical reactions which happen on the surface of these cantilevers so these are various examples of how micro systems can be manifested within the field of biology and biomedicine a small you know take on further applications is this domain of micro fluidics which i have come up because of the advent of the bio chips and the diagnostic assays so if you liquid the area of micro fluidics it is the transport of fluids and the microscopic length scale and there are many properties of such flows for example there are surface effects which become prominent with safe high surface area to volume low thermal mass and high heat transfer capability within these channels low value of Reynolds number okay so these are some of the associated aspects of this field of micro fluidics where laminar flows you know because of the low Reynolds number values lead to mixing which is only diffusional in nature there are hardly any IDs or vortices which are generated within the flows this is a simulation right here is five dyes going into n parallel e in a micro Channel so the Reynolds number which is actually the ratio between the inertial and viscous forces is usually dependent on the average velocity the length scale factor and you know the viscosity of the medium re is usually less than hundred very often it is less than 0.1 when we talk about microfluidic devices and so these colors here as you are seeing yeah although they are flowing past each other they can be extracted asses without much mixing because most of them are having almost you know zero concentration difference so such experiments are even possible at you know the microscopic length scale where we can talk about such you know microfluidic devices with peculiar properties which can be used for many applications so we will now try to look at a slightly different aspect which is about how to design sensors and what really are sensors and so definition wise if we look at sensors it is really a device that detects or measures a physical any chemical or a biological property or entity and records indicates or responds to it sensors can be classified into all different physical chemical and biological sensors depending on the property that is sensed physical sensors for example sense physical properties like temperature distance mass pressure etcetera chemical sensors measure chemical substances by chemical or physical responses biosensors of course measure chemical substances by using a biological sensing elements and so it's all about what exactly is that element and how there is a change in the signal how there is a transduction for the sensor to start detecting various responses so when we talk about a schematic of how a sensor should look like and this is more prominent towards when we talk about chemical and biosensors particularly so there are very many components of such a sensor for example let us say there is an analyte of interest which you want to detect for a certain specific chemical and let us say the sensor which is built here has chem bio detection element which is specific to a certain chemical which it would bind to the analyte and thereby produce a response which converts or transduces into something which is machine readable now chemical signal converting into an electrical or an optical signal is a very commonplace affair which happens in almost all of molecular identifications which are carried out so such a change in response for example let's say we are talking about a gas sensor so if there is an element which takes up a certain gas from a set of gases within the environment and changes some property ok the property could be let's say you know it starts releasing electrons thereby you know making positive ions and changing the conductivity because of such release release of electrons into the environment because of the reducing gas that comes in ok so it can detect a reducing gas gas by change of resistivity so this transduction that is happening at the interface is because of a phenomena of reduction which is happening because of a electron getting donated and change in conductivity owing to this donation of the electron in the presence of a certain gas so the gas creates a physical change which creates a signal further an electrical signal in this particular case which can tell you about how much gas was present okay so they are quantifying the signal the electrical signal in terms of the concentration of the gas that was present so this is the whole modality or scheme of how sensing can be carried out so your transducing from chemical to let's say electrical in that particular case and this signal is now recorded somewhere it could be a computer which signal records the signal or maybe it could be some kind of a storage device which records the signal and it gives you an idea about what is the concentration of the analyte gas which was there in the system because of which this particular signal was generated and there are many examples of this like which are continuously you know seen for example the simplest case could be that of a litmus paper or a pH indicator electrode so here what is happening is there is an analyte which is ocean of which the pH is to be measured there is a detection element it's a chemical dye on the litmus or a set of chemicals in the pH electrodes there is a transduction which is a change of color now because the pH paper changes in red color becomes red color or blue color so change of color because of the change in absorbance of the visible light by the chemical or change in voltage generated by an electrode either way this is caused by the presence of hydrogen ions okay which can detect whether how acidic or how basic a solution is and then the signal processor for example in the case of a color changes your brain which records the color change you are able to see the color change through your eyes okay and if I looked at how my eye functions is also a sensor or how my nose functions that's also a sensor I'm going to come to that level probably in the next lecture not in this lecture but this is how you record the simple litmus paper the die on the litmus paper being the recognition element and the dye changing color which is again made visible to the eyes and I being the recording device makes the whole sensory system sense the hydrogen ion concentration so there are numerous such examples in how a chemical and bio sensor can be defined but what I'm going to do is probably in the next lecture I am going to start giving some description about how our basic senses like the sense of smell or the lens let's say the sense of I you know visualization is basically outlaid as a sensorial model so I will close this particular module here and me too in the next module thank you very much [Music] [Music]
