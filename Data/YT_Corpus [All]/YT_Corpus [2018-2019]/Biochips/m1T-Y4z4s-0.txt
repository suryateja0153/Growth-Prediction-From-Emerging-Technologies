 john craig venter born October 14th 1946 is an American biotechnologist biochemist geneticist and businessman he is known for being involved with the second draft sequence of the human genome and assembled the first team to transfect a cell with a synthetic chromosome vendor founded salera genomics the Institute for genomic research TIGR and the J craig Venter Institute J CVI he was the co-founder of human longevity Inc served as its CEO until 2017 and his executive chairman of the board of directors he was listed on Time magazine's 2007 and 2008 time 100 list of the most influential people in the world in 2010 the British magazine New Statesman listed craig Venter at 14th in the list of the world's 50 most influential figures 2010 he is a member of the USA science and engineering festival z' advisory board topic early life and education Venter was born in Salt Lake City Utah the son of Elizabeth and John bender in his youth he did not take his education seriously preferring to spend his time on the water in boats or surfing according to his biography a life decoded he was said to never be a terribly engaged student having c's and d's on his eighth grade report cards he graduated from Mills High School in Millbrae California although he was against the Vietnam War Venter was drafted and enlisted in the United States Navy where he worked in the intensive care ward of a field hospital while in Vietnam he attempted suicide by swimming out to sea but as he got deeper into the sea and was approaching the circling of a shark he changed his mind more than a mile out being confronted with wounded maimed and dying Marines on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine although he later switched to biomedical research Venter began his college education at a Community College College of San Mateo in California and later transferred to the University of California San Diego where he studied under biochemist Nathan o Kaplan he received a BS in biochemistry in 1972 and a PhD in physiology and pharmacology in 1975 from UCSD topic courier after working as an associate professor and later as full professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo he joined the National Institutes of Health in 1984 topic test controversy while an employee of the NIH vendor learned how to identify mRNA and began to learn more about those expressed in the human brain the short cDNA sequence fragments he was interested in her called expressed sequence tags Oreste the NIH office of technology transfer inventor decided to take the s discovered by others in an attempt to patent the genes identified based on studies of mRNA expression in the human brain when Venter disclosed this strategy during a congressional hearing a firestorm of controversy erupted the NIH later stopped the effort and abandoned the patent applications it had filed following public outcry topic human genome project Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to radically transform healthcare Venter believed that shotgun sequencing was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data the method was rejected by the human genome project however since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans that it would be logistically more difficult and that it would cost significantly more Venter viewed the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome Project as an opportunity to continue his interest in patenting genes so he sought funding from the private sector to birth salera genomics the company planned to profit from their work by creating genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee the goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence Venters effort won him renowned as he and his team at salera corporation shared credit for sequencing the first draft human genome with the publicly funded human genome project in 2000 Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health and US public genome project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome a full three years ahead of the expected end of the public genome program the announcement was made along with US President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair Venter and Collins thus shared an award for biography of the year from A&E Network on the 15th of February 2001 the human genome project consortium published the first human genome in the journal Nature and was followed one day later by a Solera publication in science despite some claims that shotgun sequencing was in some ways less accurate than the clone by clone method chosen by the human genome project the technique became widely accepted by the scientific community Venter was fired by Solara in early 2002 according to his biography Venter was fired due to a conflict with the main investor Tony White specifically barring him from attending the White House ceremony celebrating the achievement of sequencing the human genome topic global ocean sampling expedition the global ocean sampling expedition Goss is an ocean exploration genome project with the goal of assessing the genetic diversity in in microbial communities and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003 Venter announced the full expedition on the 4th of March 2004 the project which used vendors personal yacht sorcerer 2 started in Halifax Canada circumnavigated the globe and returned to the u.s. in January 2006 topic Synthetic Genomics in June 2005 vender co-founded Synthetic Genomics a firm dedicated to using modified microorganisms to produce clean fuels and bio chemicals in July 2009 Exxon Mobil announced a $600,000,000 collaboration with synthetic genomics to research and develop next-generation biofuels Venter continues to work on the creation of engineered diatomic microalgae for the production of biofuels Venter is seeking to patent the first partially synthetic species possibly to be named mycoplasma laboratorium there is speculation that this line of research could lead to producing bacteria that have been engineered to perform specific reactions for example produce fuels make medicines combat global warming and so on in May 2010 a team of scientists led by Venter became the first to successfully create what was described as synthetic life this was done by synthesizing a very long DNA molecule containing an entire bacterium genome and introducing this into another cell analogous to the accomplishment of Eckerd Wimmers group who synthesized and ligated an RNA virus genome and booted it in cell lysate the single-celled organism contains four watermarks written into its DNA to identify it as synthetic and to help trace its descendants the watermarks include code table for entire alphabet with punctuation x' names of 46 contributing scientists three quotations the secret email address for the cell on march 25th 2016 Venter reported the creation of syn 3.0 a synthetic genome having the fewest genes of any freely living organism 473 genes their aim was to strip away all non-essential genes leaving only the minimal set necessary to support life this stripped down fast reproducing cell is expected to be a valuable tool for research in the field in August 2018 Venter retired as chairman of the board saying he wanted to focus on his work at the J craig Venter Institute he will remain as a scientific adviser to the board topic J craig Venter Institute Venter is currently the chief executive officer of the J craig Venter Institute a nonprofit which conducts research in synthetic biology Venter founded the organization in 2006 it has facilities in La Jolla and in Rockville Maryland and employs over 200 people topic individual human genome on September 4th 2007 a team led by Sam levy published the first complete six billion letter genome of an individual human Venters own DNA sequence some of the sequences in Venters genome are associated with wet earwax increased risk of antisocial behavior Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases this publication was especially interesting since it contained a diploid instead of a haploid genome and shows promise for personalized medicine via genotyping this genome dubbed her by Levy and others was a landmark accomplishment the human reference genome browser as a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venters recently published genome the hearth database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using microfluidics Sanger sequencing assembled into 4528 scaffolds and 4.1 million DNA variations identified by genome analysis these variants include single nucleotide polymorphisms snps block substitutions short and large indels and structural variations like insertions deletions inversions and copy number changes the browser enables scientists to navigate the hearth genome assembly and sequence variations and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the NCBI and ensembl annotations the browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and her fin census sequences the sequence multi alignment of the her face my own sambal and dbsnp annotations perf variants and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis the interface also represents the haplotype blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred in the relation of variants to gene annotations the display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including dbsnp ensembl online Mendelian inheritance in man omi m and gene ontology go users can search the her phenome using hugo gene names ensembl and DB SNP identifier z' Cerf contigs or scaffold locations or ncbi chromosome locations users can then easily and quickly browse any gene region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls furthermore data relevant to specific lo site can be exported for further analysis topic human longevity Inc on March 4th 2014 Venter and co-founders Peter Diamandis and Robert Hariri announced the formation of human longevity Inc a company focused on extending the healthy high performance human lifespan at the time of the announcement the company had already raised 70 million dollars in venture financing which was expected to last 18 months Venters served as the chairman and chief executive officer CEO until January 2017 when he stepped aside to become executive chairman of the board of directors the company said that it plans to sequence 40 thousand genomes per year with an initial focus on cancer genomes and the genomes of cancer patients human longevity z' mission is to extend healthy human lifespan by the use of high resolution Big Data Diagnostics from genomics metabolomics microbiom --ax and proteomics and the use of stem cell therapy topic published books Venter is the author of two books the first of which was ostensibly an autobiography titled a life decoded Venters second book was titled life at the speed of light in which he announced his theory that this is the generation in which there appears to be a dovetailing of the two previously diverse fields of science represented by computer programming and the genetic programming of life by DNA sequencing he was applauded for his position on this by futurist Ray Kurzweil topic personal life after a brief marriage to Barbara rave enter with whom he had a son Christopher he married his student Clair M Fraser remaining married to her until 2005 in late 2008 he married Heather Kowalski they live in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego California where Venter gut renovated a six million dollars home Venter as an atheist Venter himself recognized his own ADHD behavior in his adolescence and later found ADHD linked genes in his own DNA topic

magazine cosmos and the Atlantic on may 16 2004 Venter gave the commencement speech at Boston University in a 2007 interview with New Scientist when asked assuming you can make synthetic bacteria what will you do with them Venter replied over the next 20 years synthetic genomics is going to become the standard for making anything the chemical industry will depend on it hopefully a large part of the energy industry will depend on it we really need to find an alternative to taking carbon out of the ground burning it and putting it into the atmosphere that is the single biggest contribution I could
