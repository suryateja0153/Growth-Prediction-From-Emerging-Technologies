 [Music] you [Music] in our earlier lecture we have shown that each and every parts of her body this is that Meccano construction by different mechanical forces in this lecture we shall go through that how that McGraw construction happening in case of cancer and in case of bounties of forming cells why cancer because in the cancer metastasis mechanical force playing the main role for the migration of cancer cell from that source tumor to the distant places through that blood circulation system and bone is am a mechanical sensitive system and it is bone forming ability solely depends upon that Meccano signals without these mechanical signals bone forming cells will not work so that is why we are concentrating on that cancer metastasis and bone forming and osteoblasts mechanical construction in this lecture so take-home lesson of this lecture utility of microfluidic platform for studying mechanobiology particularly concern milieu because we know that that focal addition and lipid rafts and stage activated ion channels are the Macondo sensitive cubes or Meccano sensitive parts of the cells and these are responsible of various biological outcomes of the different types of cells here we are focusing that how that addition complex dissociation and lipid that micro domain internalizes and mammalian cells happening in the microfluidic confinements and how that lipid wrapped micro diamond organisation in stress adoptive Meccano transduction in circulating tumor cells basically what I want to mean that circulating tumor cells when that tumor cells is in the blood stream facing that shear stress of that blood and as already I have mentioned that bone is the mikado sensitive organ and how that shear stress influences osteoblast cells means your bone forming cell to work in terms of that calcium signaling now we are coming that tumor formation but how that cancer cell situation in the tumor so cancer cell starts due to the genetic aberration and due to this lot of signaling pathways are starting and one of the pathways are epidermal growth factor res and Yeerk pathway so this pathway stimulates the proliferation of cancer cell because we know that cancer cells have a uncontrolled growth rate in that sequence this helps that cytoskeleton arrangement and it develops cytoskeleton stressor so which stimulates that that ro rock and myosin light-chain phosphorylation then act on my myosin interactions so these two pathways interact with each other to stimulate that extracellular matrix stiffness as extracellular matrix stiffness is increases that stimulates that focal region which acts as a molecular clutch it influences that intriguing activation focal adhesion kinase then stimulate both proliferation as well as cytoskeleton stem cells so what will happening in that process that EC Ames gets stiffer means rigid in the down here we can see that in the normal cases that is same is soft matrix cells have a normal size when cancer cells start growth uncontrolled growth that matrix becomes rigid and Natta said to a lot of other events happening in that situation because as cancer cell growth it invites that Federalists that lot of immune cell like a t-cell be cells in that micro environment so cell population is very much high within this confinement so this you can compare like say say one argon balloon is attached to a thread and when that argon balloon is expanding that tension in the thread is increasing so this type of mechanism is happening in that cancer to Marcus and at the same time that your blood capillaries becomes necrotic means irregular your accessible aromatic stiffness are not regular means different places special temporal is here matrix density is different places is different so this is that multi caskets of how that cancer cell metastasize or migrated from that source place to the distant place at the source place means heard that tumor develops that metastatic cascades cancer cells within a primary tumor accord that invasive what invasive phenotype means that initial positions that initial positions cancer cells are encouraged dependent means they are more or less studied during the high population of the cancers and other cells and due to oxygen limitation and so many other factors that cancer cells some cans also want to escape from that site so for that escape mechanism they have to developed some non encourage dependent system by which will be changing to metastatic cells means from that primary site they will be investing that nearby blood vessel or lymphatic vessels so as it enters the blood vessel it occurs the property of non Anchorage dependent property means they need not any Anchorage for their survival they will survive in the blood flow and faces that shear stress of the Bloods so in that shear stress majority of the your tumor cells will die some will survive which can withstand this shear strain you know in that way migrated to a distant place that is a distant organ CTC exists in the circulation and invade that micro environment of the foreign tissue means the distance tissue and their cancer cell must be able to evade the inert immune system and also survive as a single cell or as a cluster of cells then again that tumor starts basically starting from that source tumor two blood vessels this is totally Devine by that mechanical force so Meccano transduction is playing very vital role in that migration process and interstitial flow is playing major role when that metastatic cell migrates from their source and in head that near about or near larger cell so interstitial flow depends upon that pressure gradient develops between arteriole interstitial space that near about lymphatic vessel and that venules and as that tumor is very much heterogenic with respect of ECM the interstitial pressure difference is also different in different places so microfluidic platforms are used extensively to study the micro migration of the cancer cell in that interstitial so system so what literature is saying that in the interstitial flow in fact cell migration in different ways local strength gradient induction flow upregulated proteolysis by migrating cells stress mediated cytokine activation autologous chemotaxis main findings are that downstream migration means that in the direction of the interstitial flow that is your cells are migrating according to the chemotaxis means your growth factor or cytokine gradient her as lot of cells also migrated upstream of that interstitial flow and that is driven by stress activated things and that is focal addition is involved for your upstream movement means both type of movements are available in that year from tumour primary site to migration to nearer nearest blood vessel and as that tumor is heterogenic population of cells and cancer cells itself are heterogeneous so obviously their migration will be of heterogeneous to understand that system Hessler has developed utilized a new platform for micro fluidic system where that two types of interstitial gradients are exploited to know the heterogeneity of that cancer cell migration so heterogeneity means some response to flow by moving faster but randomly some cells migrate in the flow direction in two autologous chemotaxis and others may move in the opposite direction due to the local stress gradients which means there are different types of cellular migration in industrial flow so what his finds that cell migration within a population is heterogeneous that is some cells migrate upstream and other downstream of the flow and minority of the cell populations are more random there may be more directed more randomness more faster means these are the around five to ten percent of the cancer cell populations are very much heterogeneous with respect of the earth - indeed so these cells might be the important for the metastatic survival or metastatic potential so with this study they have identified that migrating potential or different cells with respect to other majority cells which have a different migration potential so with this background or collaborative works professor Simon Chakraborty has revealed some unique findings when that CTC means here at that encourage independent stage cancer cells migrating from that source to that blood stream likes a focal addition and that lipid wrapped how they are behaving and related processes so challenging that system is that it is to be addressed whether environment of surrounding the micro confinement plays a vital role in the cell survival within the passage of vasculature or TC matrixes so how they address this problem in our earlier lectures we have described that how to measure the traction force by using traction force microscopy system and membrane fluidity and other microfluidic platforms to reveal that augmented stresses concieved rates of cell lines in a micro confinement so in that process we found a new parameter like say we are telling that sell response time TR is induced to analyze the stress adaptive properties of the mammalian cells what is tear so it is a time lag between focal addition disassembly and lipid wrapped appearance in the same positions of the cell so now we are going to details how that phenomenon is happening so here is the image of one mammalian cell then this is the image of lipid wrapped in the cellular membrane as well in the cellular in inside of that and these are the images of that focal addition points and we concentrated on one of the focal addition points that how it is dissociated when you are giving shear stress that focal addition points in that heard that shear stress is given that focal addition points dissociates you see that here this focal adhesion slowly dissociates and and that dissociation for the full dissociation it takes around 20 minute it is represented by this curve at the same time we are looking for that how lipid rafts behavior in that situation here we see that in the same confer call plane that lipid rafts internalization it takes around around say 20 minutes or 18 minutes time so this is that time lag between the two events and this is a characteristic property of that mammalian cells when you are giving a some stress means in the condition of free flow so now you want to know so how that fokin addition is involved in this process and this is that representation where you are showing that 50% of the lipid raft internalization events happening at any given period of time under that some sheer stress when we innovate the focal addition by using focal addition kinase inhibitor in SI 2 3 7-6 6 we are finding that that red fillers basically they are indicating that that lipid rat internalization event are not happening so we can correlate that focal adhesion dissociation and that lipid rat internalization this is a characteristics phenomenon in that confinement and if this shear stress and that response time T are dependent upon that two variables one is your confinement confinement what I want to mean here that height of the channel is two height of the cell height of the cell is constant we can vary the height of the channel so confinement one parameter and that is shear stress developed by the different rates of troop flow so there are the critical conditions like say when that channel height is 70 micrometer and that shear stress is more than ten lines per square centimeter then we are finding that Sigma del decline of that tier but in other cases this is not waving or open system this is not behaving Sigma del so you are taking this critical conditions and we measured that tier for that varieties of cells starting from that normal cell lines like say n is 3 T 3 l 9 to 9 and most evasive cancer cell line like CMC f7v 16f callosum and lot of other cells and if you see that what we are seeing in that micro confinement situation the shear stress 10 times per square centimeter and TR is around 10 minutes for these cancer cells and whereas it is more than 20 to 30 minutes for the normal cells and that indicates that we have find a unique parameter response time to differentiate between that normal cells and cancer cells particularly in their micro confinement where that is critical Micro confinement and that critical shear stress so cosine arises how this factor is happening in the molecular level so we know that epidermal growth factor is a growth promoting one of the growth factors and it binds with that epidermal growth factor receptors and pass the signal means food factor receptor is phosphorylated then signal is passing and that lipid wrapped is very much connected with this membrane wrong receptors and on shear that lipid rafts get rearranged and and undergoes internalization so what we find it here that autocrine growth factors that EGF works nicely in that confinement with this western blot and the de magic techniques we saw that that in absence of EGF only short stages suffice to activate that EGFR and which helps the internalization of the lipid raft and at the same time that is a focal addition dissociation so we connect these whole these things that in the micro confinement autocrine effect of that EGF stimulates that chemical signal transduction which is influenced by that mechanical signals of shear stress so what we infer from these studies Sigma danceable decline of TR depends on confinement and sheer stress that same TR occurs when that channel height decreased below threshold value of 70 micrometer and stress is elevated beyond 10 lines per square centimeter and this TR is due to augmentation of secreted autocrine growth factor epidermal growth factor that in EGF concentration and amplification of the fluid shear stress the microfluidic environment and TR is less for invasive cancer cells means cancer cells are stress adoptive they can adopt which cells add of this shear during their blood flow they can survive otherwise they will die so these things indicating that cancer cells are more adaptive to stressful situation in the micro confinement of blood vessel by arranging their cytoskeleton during migration and extradition with this context we are following that another set of experiments higher involvement of lipid wrapped in Meccano transduction is explored in details because lipid wrapped is that place where it can give the shelter of your membrane bound enzymes growth factor receptors stretch activated ion channels and it also activates the downstream of Mackinaw single-ended zone that is a MMP pathways so here we are exploring that auto peggy another biological out means vulajin readouts or it is a phenomenon of housekeeping mechanism forever by the cell degrades damaged unnecessarily dysfunctional cellular components through the axon of lysosome what is lysosome already we have discussed this is a means your garbage bag it recirculate or digest that unwanted material and do its job so autophagy phenomenon had that unutilized organelles or molecules so and so forth they are digested in the lysosomes and gives the energy to the cells when the cells are in stress and different types of water packages are there's like say my of Hagee Nick lot of very macro value etc Normandy Jesus coming so Otto is a double-edged sword means when their cells are in stress condition like say when that metastatic cells are filling the stress in the bloodstream or cells are in starvation they utilize its own energy sources and metabolize it or digested denim ontology to get the energies but that is your pro survival mechanism on the contrary when that Otto is our uncontrolled means self between things going unrestricted then it kills itself it triggers that apoptosis that is program cell cell death that enjoy that ought of Haga is a double-edged sword it acts as a pro survival or death inducing mechanism according to the need of the cell so now you are looking for that how that Meccano two instructions or seer is involved to stimulate that ought of Hagee either pro survival or death inducing so that is how you erase the questions whether physiological shear stress elicits out of again cervical cancer cells as immediate adaptive response whether this response is protective towards the cells or do membrane cycle skeleton components like say lipid rafts participate in the process of shear mediated Meccano transaxle so in that experiments we have two parts means one chip part another of Japan on cheap art we are giving that sells with sheer stress and with that measuring out of Hawaii by repoed our plasmid PTL lc3 exposed to pulses of steady flow an off cheap part we are using that syringe path model for the application of shear stress to cells and collection of cells then after that assess the viability and protein expression and etc so what we are finding it here so in the control set means when you are giving nose here we are measuring that what a in terms of Ponte Ponte means you can see that dots actually say green dots and usual or dots and a red dots the auto-5 flux is the ratio of that red and green dots with respect of your total number of dots present in that in one cell because we are measuring that out of a great class of single cells taking say 100 cell or thousand cells together and we are managing their data so these data reveals that when you are giving to pascals here that you know dots means is a mixture of your green and red dots and only red dots are increasing with respect of your total Lots with green dots and when you are giving em BCD which disrupt that your lipid rafts that with this 2 plus Pascal's here soft wearing Li we are saying that the decrease of significant decrease of your RFP and GFP means yo dots so this indicates that M BCD which disturbed that lipid rafts definitely involved in Auto foggy flask the next question we are arising how that sheer stress induces the auto forgiveness whether it is a raw death or pro-survival here what we find in a not cell from that slide when you are giving here that aught of Hawaii is sir survival inducing means that it induces cell to survive in that stress doesn't mean stress adaptive and when you're disrupting that lipid rafts your it is inducing more apoptosis more cell death means that with this findings that lipid rafts has a interesting role to withstand the sheer and give the particular biological outcome with respect to ought of Hagee whether it is a pro survival or death inducing things so all these things is model in that way inhibition of protective auto forgiving lipid wrapped disruptions an invasion of p38 MAP kinase phosphorus and is the intermediate of that you're signaling chemical signal processing what applies fend off tumor cells in circulation and lacked the metastatic ability next we are coming in that bone system it is a mechanosensitive system heard that mechanical signal is necessary for that activity of bone cell osteoblast so here we are saying that this is the blood vessels surrounding cells at osteoblast cells then that bone formation is going on when in the osteoclast is confirming or converted to osteocytes during this whole the process that is mechanical stimuli influences lot means when normal state mechanical stimuli is there there is a equilibrium between bond dissociation and bond formation that is I used it when overused means when are using working or more load in the bond indicated by these arrows then osteoblasts recruited and it induces one growth then it is coming to a steady state then who enrich underused means not much mechanical signal is going on then osteoclast bond degrading cells are activating then bond start degrade and then is some steady state reaches so this indicates that mechanical signal is very much responsible for osteoblasts function that is one forming function and it produces lot of the extracellular matrix that is your calcium Rattata calcium hydroxyapatite and etc so whole literature is saying that when you are giving shear stress or nastya gloss in parallel channel Nunchuk intensity of the intercellular calcium intensity P cause proportional to intensity of the shear stress between point 0 3 Pascal to 0.244 scale and this here intercellular calcium concentration such peak at the beginning and influence a mechanical transduction and when he removed us here then again calcium concentration decreases and that calcium intensity peak it depends upon the shear stress so it was reported by that cow then after that our group with collaboration professor Chakravarthy we are utilizing that predict platform to explore that differ how the different types of fluid flow influence that the osteoblast function in terms of calcium trigger journalism so here in the fluidic channel we are using different types of thread flow like steady state pulsatile flow and oscillatory flow in the osteoblast cells what you are finding that oscillatory fluid flow that is oscillated your fluid flow so that maximum calcium liquor concentration as units calcium amplitude and this is measured by your calcium cytoplasmic calcium liquor concentration and calcium theory is due to that you have calcium transporter channels which are present in the membrane plasma membrane and the plasmic reticulum so now question arises what type of that is stress responsive channels or what type of calcium channels are involved in that situation of shear stress so you are using so here we are assuming that that mechanic year oscillatory shear stress is involved in the process and what hot frequency here that point to hot frequency that oscillated shear stress is a maximum so in that calcium liquor concentration in that the osteoblast cells so to explore that what type of calcium channels are involved in the shear situation because varieties of calcium channels are involved in that process so we use different types of inhibitors for a particular group of your calcium activated channels like say voltage-gated calcium channel store operated calcium channel stage activated calcium channel tell semi ATP's and phospholipids and there are specific inhibitors for these type of channels and what our findings is that when you are using gallium chloride which is inhibiting the stress activated calcium channels that calcium liquor concentration decreases drastically around say 80 percent so we are telling that that stage activated calcium channels are involved in this process and we also know that calcium oxalate in that stage activated calcium channels are harboring in that liquid raft so definitely lipid wrapped irresponsible or activated or organized in that when you are giving that oscillatory shear stress so to none of them to identify that which type of stress activated I calcium terms unresponsive so these group of calcium channels are termed as transient receptor potential super family member so there are different members like say V 2 P 2 m 7 m6 etcetera so what we did we knock down the osteoblast cells by si RNA technology then we are looking for that or we are confirming there whether cells are nam down or not by western blot and we are saying that TR p m7 all these things which are successful knockdown for the cells and in the knockdown cells we measured that calcium flasks in that oscillator shear stress and we find that the TR p m7 long down cells there is no calcium freaker's this clearly indicates that TR p m7 is really responsible for that calcium freaka generation due to oscillator shear stress so a dimension that leafy draft is the position or lipid trapped is that means domain where that the stress type of stress activator and channels are present so you are looking for that how that space so temporally in the membrane lipid rafts and that calcium recursion arson is occurring so what we are saying it here at that same time point that same time point and that same places calcium flicker journalism I jewel as liquid ref organization is happening so obviously cosine is arises so what's the role of your lipid erupt for calcium flick our generation so if we disrupt that liquid wrapped by using your methanol cyclodextrin what will happen so if our hypothesis is correct then if we do stop that calcium trigger generation will not be there for that is demonstrated here so if we use a Missa tee and do that sense here and calcium clica generation is almost the control area so this indicates that that C are oscillatory fluid flow induces that lipid of rearrangement which induces PR pm7 organization and when that TR p.m. seven sir come closer together that induces calcium clicker generation inside that side of logic so all these things are possible using that micro fluidics to understand that mecha not a signal transduction during cancer metastasis and osteoblasts in function so what we are exploited here hydrogenation imaging at single-cell level so study that spatio temporal dynamics of integrate membrane related cellular events so what we find is here that disassembly of focal adhesion points due to CRT guts localized lipid wrap internalization and CR stress triggers calcium clicker since your exposed bone cells simulation of physical flow conditions mimicking in v1 is physiologically amoled shear stress induces eg for activation making cancer cell invasive induces protective auto foggy adding cancer cell survival and oscillatory shear stress of frequency for endpoint 2hearts induces optimal bone growth means your calcium picker generation it will go and mimicking in vivo confinements possibly replicate the natural cells confinement aspect ratio and our finding is that cancer cells are more active have lesser response time means they're more adaptive than non cancerous cells in that confinement so such studies in that importance of lipids of mediated Meccano biological signaling Cascades as a candidate drug targets in various physiological elements
