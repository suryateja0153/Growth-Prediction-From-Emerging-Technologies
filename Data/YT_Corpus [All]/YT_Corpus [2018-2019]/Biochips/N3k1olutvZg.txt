 When I was a graduate student, by accident, when I irradiated this compound with very high intensity lasers, it turned from purple to blue. And I remember at the time it made me mad because I knew it screwed up my sample and I was going to have to redo it, but I tucked it away as an interesting piece of information. The thing that's novel that we're doing now is that we have an organic chemist who's capable of making a subportion of this molecule that is unable to undergo shape changes upon absorbing light. And so we're interested in figuring out whether this subportion of the molecule, which we call the chromophore, has to change shape in order for this purple to blue color change to occur. And if it does, that has some important implications for the whole theory about how visual pigments work. They have noticed a very interesting phenomena that, depending on what kind of light they're shining on this Bacteriorhodopsin, it’s changing to different colors. And so, we decided to form this collaboration, trying to answer what’s really going on when you shine laser light versus UV light on this molecule. The type of spectrometry that we do in my lab is UVV and circular dichroism. So these two techniques allow us to follow the degradation of the chromophore. The UVV spectroscopy just simply observes the photodegradation, but the CD spectroscopy gives some additional information, and so we can have some additional insight on the mechanism. We're exploring the fundamental processes of the photochemistry of the protein. That, we think, we can address for sure, and we'll get some very unique and interesting answers from the research. The long term dream of this would be to find ways to apply this -- to create artificial retinas, to make optical data storage work a little bit better, and to treat diseases of the retina.
