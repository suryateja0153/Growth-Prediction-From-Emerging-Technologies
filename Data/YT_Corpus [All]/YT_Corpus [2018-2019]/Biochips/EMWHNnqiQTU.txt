 Cell transfection can be a pain. Experiments require careful optimisation, and even then, yields can be low. With increasing interest in CRISPR and high-throughput gene editing processes, this problem is expected to grow. At Cellix, we want to solve this issue, and give researchers something that is label-free, high-throughput compatible and streamlines transfection. After 12 years of R&D, we developed our Inish Analyser technology - impedance spectroscopy for multiparametric cell analysis and sorting. After electroporation, there are 4 cell populations – alive but closed, dead, damaged and alive and open - the useful set. In traditional sorting, 3 of these populations are lumped together. With the Inish, you can isolate just the useful sub-population, saving you inserts, media and time. Applications in gene editing include clinical use, such as for CAR-T cell therapy, improving high throughput processes in industry, or label-free flow cytometry and cell analysis. The Inish non-invasively measures membrane conductivity, cell size, and cell organelle content, while retaining normal cell function with its gentle analysis. The Inish Analyser is available for in-licensing, and complements other gene editing or cell analysis technologies, such as flow cytometry or electroporation - giving devices an edge in a crowded market. Want to collaborate or in-license our technology? We’re looking for research partners in industry and academia. For more information or to get in touch, visit wearecellix.com
