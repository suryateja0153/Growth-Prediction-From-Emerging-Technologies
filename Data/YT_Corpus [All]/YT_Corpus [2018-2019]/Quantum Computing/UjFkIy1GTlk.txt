 [Music] hey yo I'm Diana you're watching physics girl and I want to tell you about a well known problem in the field of quantum cryptography the problem is basically flipping a coin over the phone but let's see why that might cause problems hey Jade Hey oh we still on for the Beyonce concert Friday night that's the same night as the star set concert Oh what if I flip a coin if it's heads we go to Beyonce and if it's tails we gotta stop that okay I'll flip it okay but let's FaceTime so I know you're not cheating oh my phone's gonna die I can't okay fine looks like you landed on tails star said here we come oh he totally did not land on tails you'll say this we always do is Europe you see but we could do a quantum coin flip which is the obvious solution for a situation like this between two parties who don't trust each other a quantum coin flip goes like this first we need to know a basic principle of quantum physics known as wavefunction collapse which states that measuring a quantum object like a tiny particle changes it for example photons the particles of light have a quantum property called polarization polarization is like lights orientation because yes light travels in a direction but it also waves in a direction like it can wave up and down but it can also wave side-to-side and diagonally and the direction it waves is the polarization guess what direction normal light like light from sunlight or from a lamp is polarized trick question it's uncool arised because it has waves of all different and random polarizations mixed together but we can make light wave in one particular direction by passing it through a filter like pass it through a vertical filter and it'll come out waving up and down but if we try to pass light that's already vertically polarized through a horizontal filter it'll be blocked photons can't pass through filters that are at 90-degree angles to their polarization however and this is the interesting part if we try and pass a photon through a filter with a 45 degree of difference like vertical to diagonal something weird happens half of the time it goes through and half the time it gets blocked and there's no way to predict which it'll do it's completely random and the photons that make it through are now diagonally polarized which means the act of measuring the lights polarization changes it that is wavefunction collapse and it can be demonstrated using polarizing filters in a demo that has blown many a mind including mine check it out vertical polarizing filter some light goes through horizontal filter all the letters blocked but when I add a diagonal filter in between some light can make it through this is the weird thing about quantum objects they acts based on probabilities so when they're vertically polarized photons come to the diagonal filter they act completely based on chance so half of them make it through and half of them don't the ones that make it through are now diagonally polarized and so now when those get to the horizontal filter they're again at a 45 degree angle so now again half of them make it through so cool now we can use this wacky property of photons to make sure no one cheats this is what's gonna happen Diane is going to choose one type of orientation vertical and horizontal which is called rectilinear or diagonal then using only that orientation she's going to send me a stream of photons which will encode a random sequence of ones and zeros I'm going to record these ones and zeros and try and guess which orientation she chose if I'm right I win if I'm wrong she wins here's an example okay say I choose the rectilinear measurement orientation don't tell Jade so I only use the vertical and horizontal filters on my photons now I make a random sequence of ones and zeros on my computer and then I encode or match these ones and zeros into photons by saying a vertically polarized photons a one and a horizontally polarized photon means a zero and finally I'll send my photons off to Jade via a secure channel Jade I'm sending you some photons okay I've polarized them so that these the vertical and first diagonal are ones and these the horizontal and the other diagonal are zeros wait how will I know which filter to use you won't Jade doesn't know which orientation I chose so she alternates randomly between using a rectilinear and a diagonal filter when she measures a vertical photon with a vertical sir it passes through and she notes down a one when it's a horizontal photon and it gets blocked she writes down a zero but when she uses a diagonal filter to measure of vertical photon there's a 50/50 chance it gets blocked and when that happens she has no way of knowing if it was vertical horizontal or just the wrong type of diagonal but because it gets blocked she notes down a zero the same thing could happen with a horizontal photon it could go through and in that case she would wrongly note down a one ok I've recorded them all and noted them down in separate tables ok guess whether I've polarized them using a rectilinear or a diagonal filter her recordings don't give away any information as to which orientation I chose so just like heads or tails she has a 50/50 chance of getting it right diagonal no it was rectilinear oh you totally just cheated again no to prove that I'm not cheating I just read out my sequence of ones and zeros it should match exactly what Jade got in her rectilinear side of the table if we imagine for a second that she correctly guessed rectilinear and I tried to cheat by saying it was diagonal which of course I would never do I would have to guess all the ones and zeros in the diagonal column and I'd have to get those correct but if we used enough photons that'd be pretty much impossible ok here goes one zero one zero zero zero one one one one zero one it's rigged I'm staying home Friday night as Jade knows because she's also a physicist there's no way to rig this system it was just an unfortunate outcome thank you so much for watching we made a video on Jade's channel as well it's called up and Adam I will put a link to that in the description check it out it's more quantum physics hit subscribe if you want more physics content right here on physics girl and happy physics thing I'm gonna go enjoy a concert should have come to the concert Jade [Music]
