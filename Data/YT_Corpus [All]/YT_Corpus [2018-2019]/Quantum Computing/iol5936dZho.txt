 The year is 1927 29 people gather in Brussels  to discuss physics 17 of those people  will eventually win a Nobel Prize and for a few short days in the middle of Leopold Park They will wrestle  with the smallest question or perhaps the biggest one to ever face mankind The question at the foundation  of everything. [intro song] For those few days those 29 physicists wrestled  with the question of the quantum determinancy and whether our world  at the minutest level operates  as a fixed system or merely as a group  of probabilities Their question stemmed from one  of the oldest problems in modern physics, the problem of light For nearly three centuries since Newton wrote  his famous treatise on optics Physicists had debated  whether light was a particle or a wave in 1803 this argument was thought  to be put to rest by one of the most beautiful  and simple experiments ever created the double slit experiment Okay, think of two buoys  bobbing up and down in the water as the waves spreading out  from these buoys hit each other and overlap They interfere  with each other if the peak of one wave hits the peak of another they'll amplify  and become a bigger wave Same with the troughs but if a peak of one wave  hits the trough of the other they'll just flatten out they'll combined  back down to nothing. A man named  Thomas Young said, Let's take that principle  and apply it to light And so he did  the simplest thing imaginable he took  a monochromatic light, to make sure that all the light  had the same wavelength and he shone it on a partition  with two small slits cut into it If light acted  like a particle he should simply see two columns  of light on the wall on the other side But if light was a wave then the waves coming  through each of the slits should interfere  with each other amplifying and cancelling  each other out in places And he would instead see a weird pattern  of bright and dark lines as a result And as he expected he did indeed see  that funky pattern and that was that. The particle theory of light  was done and dusted he'd solved  the dang thing Now everyone could finally move on  to talking about just how smart he was But then physicists  in other labs found something strange  in their own experiments They found that when light strikes  a material it can force electrons  to spew out of it this wasn't that startling but the way it happened  was all wrong and definitely not how it should have happened if light was the continuous wave they'd believed it to be Then in 1900 a man  named Max Planck came up  with an equation that fit it made sense  of what was happening But as Planck himself  would later say it was an act  of desperation It went against everything  he thought he knew The only way he could get  all of the math to work was by treating energy as something that could  only be absorbed or released in discrete units How could this be?  He thought. How could energy  not be continuous? How could it not be a flow? He had no idea, but then this fellow named Einstein took  Planck's act of desperation and ran with it He declared that light itself  was quantized That  in many ways we can think of it as a particle  of zero mass always moving at well,  the speed of light And it is for this theory, not for special  or general relativity, that Einstein was awarded  his Nobel Prize Because this concept,  which we now call the photon solved a number  of lingering issues with how light interacted  with the world But the photon brings us right back to the problem  of Thomas Young's double-slit experiment Because if light has  both the properties of a wave and a particle What happens if you fire  those particles through the slits one at a time? Well, here is where this becomes  the most astonishing and humble experiment ever devised Because if you shoot one photon at the slits and detect where it hits on the other side You'll find that it impacts some arbitrary point just the way  you think it should And if you fire  a second photon through, you'll find that it too shows up at some  other arbitrary point on the other side But if you do this enough times, you'll eventually see  the same interference pattern build up that we got back in  Thomas's original experiments. That is madness each individual photon, which should  be completely independent of the rest shows up at some seemingly  random point on your wall And exactly where  they show up will be different each time  you run the experiments And! Knowing where the previous photon appeared in  no way allows you to predict where the next one  will show up yet when taken as a group it's as if they're affected  by how they Should interfere with each other This feels impossible and yet it is experimental fact And the reason for this phenomenon  is one of the most hotly debated mysteries in physics Because the only way to conceptualize this is that each photon passes  through both slits as a wave, interferes with itself and then resolves down to a photon  when it actually hits the wall What is going on here? What is this? No, no, no, this is magic. This is magic ! [sine wave] [meow] No, you're right Zoe. I should calm down because  we are not done yet because here is where it gets really freaky Remember how when Thomas  was first doing his experiment? We said that if light  were really a particle we should just see two columns  of light on the other side of his double slit paper? Well, if you put a detector on the slits, so that you can determine which slit  the photon you fired passes through That is exactly what you get. That's all you have to do You don't have to change the experiment  in any way or interfere directly with the photon You simply have to measure  which slit the photon passes through. Why does it do this? Because a photon is a particle and a wave but it can't be both simultaneously The mere act of measuring  which path the photon took Forces it to resolve the wave-like nature  of the photon into a particle And this may be the hardest thing to wrap  your head around in all of quantum physics because the most common  way to view this is that the photon  when acting like a wave isn't a real wave at all but rather a wave  of possibilities That wave represents  where the photon could be but not  where it is It's only when something acts to detect the photon whether it be  your measuring device or the wall on the opposite side of your double slit experiment That the photon is forced to, for lack of a better term, decide on where it will actually be and in doing so becomes a particle More unsettling still, is the fact that  these waves of possibility interfere with each other  just like normal waves The interference pattern  we see from firing particles one at a time through the double slit experiment is caused by peaks  and troughs of possibility cancelling each other out When you fire that photon and the wave  of possibility hits your double slit paper It is funneled through  as two possibility waves Just in the way that any regular physical wave  would be and just like  those regular waves waves of possibility interfere with each other Essentially making it so there are places where it is  more or less likely for a photon to land when detected Thus when you fire a lot of photons one at a time through  your double slit experiment The bands you see are simply  the high probability lines playing out But if you think  we're done getting weird, think again, we're only on episode one so join us next time as we get serious about  this idea that energy only comes in discrete packets and begin our journey  on what this means for the future  of quantum computing. We'll see you next time or will we just perceive you next time because  would that mean we'd have to watch you watching us to know the oh boy [outro song]
