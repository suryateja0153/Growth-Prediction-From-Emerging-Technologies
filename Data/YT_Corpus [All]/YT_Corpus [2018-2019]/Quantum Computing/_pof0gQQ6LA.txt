 what is quantum computing quantum computing is a new type of computing architecture they will make our devices millions of times faster than they are today in order to solve a problem today's computer must run through all possible solutions and sell finds a single one that works for example if you're looking for a name in a phone book with 7 billion names we'd have to go through each name one by one until we found a match similarly classical computers work using bits single pieces of information that exists either a 1 or a 0 quantum bits or qubits however can exist as both a 0 and a 1 simultaneously this means a quantum computer can check all possible solutions to a problem at one time for example just 30 qubits can simulate 2 to the 30 or 1 billion possibilities in a split second and this is awesome for solving huge problems that are virtually an infinite number of possible answers problems that simply cannot be solved by today's computers but this same superpower will also pose a major threat to cyber security the encryption algorithms of today rely on massive math problems that are near impossible to solve like factory numbers hundreds of digits long a single quantum computer whoever could easily decrypt any piece of sensitive information and render our entire system of cybersecurity obsolete that said quantum computers will likely also allow us to create new quantum methods of encryption so I'm not too worried about that still that begs the question well the first quantum computer be used for good or evil you
