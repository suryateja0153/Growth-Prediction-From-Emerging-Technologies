 Modern healthcare today is really based on imaging. In the area of MRI scanners, we've developed a technology here called Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting that really allows us to take a quantitative picture of the patient's body. Microsoft is providing Optimized Quantum Inspired Algorithms to really solve our hard problems using them to make MRI faster, cheaper, and more efficient to help people all over the world with this technology.  Microsoft in case Western Reserve are working together to push the forefront of healthcare technology using algorithms that look at the world in a Quantum way. We can go much much faster than any classical algorithm that's been out there today.  These Quantum-Inspired Algorithms are giving us a window into a future that we just didn't think about before. We want to use that power to find diagnoses and treatments that mankind has not been able to come up with yet.  Quantum computing is going to allow us to solve problems that we never thought we could. This Quantum-type thinking is going to open new doors that we haven't have before.  These Quantum computers well-being in our Azure Data Center, this is the ultimate intelligent cloud. We are going to be able to make profound impacts in the world with Quantum Computing whether it's health care, whether it's climate change, whether it's food production.  I just can't wait to see the impact of this is going to make on people's lives.
