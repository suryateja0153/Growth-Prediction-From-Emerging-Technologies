 [Music] thanks to Lockheed Martin for supporting PBS Digital Studios heyo I'm Diana you're watching physics girl and I have a story for you so I just got back from the biggest gem show in the world the gem and mineral showcase in Tucson Arizona that I went to with my friends Sophia and Kyle because why not I'm finally starting back up the rock collection I had as a kid which was the least weird thing that I collected so stick around to the end of the video to see what we ended up getting but while we were in Tucson Kyle and Sophia and I got to talking we just finished many many hours of shows and while we were walking around Sophia mentioned the magic the magic Russian diamond and Kyle was like the question is what is the magic diamond in 2005 in Germany physicists were looking through scientific journals searching for a diamond with very specific properties they finally found what they were looking for better than they were looking for in a specimen from Russia the unusual thing about this diamond is that it was made of carbon but like very made of carbon you're thinking Diana now I know you're no chemist but all diamonds are made of carbon and they're arranged in a beautiful lattice structure and that's what makes them so durable and that's what makes them diamonds but most diamonds have impurities like if you if you go and get diamonds like mine or whatever it's actually like really hard to find a diamond that's like pure carbon most gems have impurities and that's good elements that don't belong in the gem meaning that meaning that they are not the same elements as the base chemical composition of the gem will sneak in there and change the gem for example a ruby which is made of aluminum oxide might have chromium impurities and that's what gives it it's red color but the same base material aluminum oxide but then with iron and titanium impurities will be bright blue that's known as the gem sapphire same base chemical composition now diamonds have impurities too and the parody's naturally occur at a rate of about one impurity per thousand carbon atoms in the lattice which is also about the cominis of giving birth to triplets now impurities in the magic Russian diamond occur at a rate of one in a billion which is more like the cominis of having quintuplets naturally like not with lab practices how many quintuplets do you know so scientists wanted a diamond this pure because they thought that it could be useful for quantum mechanics so like in the mid-2000s these physicists were just like oh we think that this might be useful for quantum computing and in fact they wanted the diamond for its impurities see the specific impurities they were interested in are called nitrogen vacancy centers they're actually a pair of impurities an odd couple consisting of a nitrogen atom replacing a carbon atom in the lattice and then the other one is a whole simply a missing carbon atom there's the nitrogen vacancy center and you can think of it as a little frozen atom inside the diamond lattice and that atom has an electron spin because electrons will all tiny particles really have a quantum property called spin spin is one of the important properties we're gonna need to control and read out for quantum computing so just as in modern computers transistors are the electronic bits that can be read out as ones and zeros qubits in quantum computers will have quantum properties that will need to read like spin their spins everywhere and their states are their quantum states are very fragile because they're just interacting with everything around them all the time they can be influenced by other particles and magnetic fields around and they're hard to control but the sturdy lattice structure of the diamond can keep the electron essentially shielded the nitrogen vacancy Center is special in this way it's really protected by the diamond lattice it's kind of almost like a cage around it that's keeping it from interacting too much with other stuff there's just carbon in this nice pristine lattice and also in our research we use electron spins for high sensitivity sensing and magnetic imaging yeah we're applying diamonds to neuroscience lasers and diamonds to neurons all the buzzwords at once the funny thing about this diamond is that it was tiny it was only two millimeters by two millimeters that's smaller than the size of Washington's ear on the corner but it was so perfect for research and the scientists couldn't find anything like it so they split it up and shared it among their labs for quantum research um so it's not cut really pretty or anything like we're yeah rectangle it's so pure that it's clear so like if you saw saw it it would look like glass since 2005 scientists have learned how to make these diamonds lab-grown gems are a thing I should know my dad sent me a bunch of real synthetic gems out of the blue because he became intrigued by advances in synthetic gem technology and ordered a bunch from China he said he thought I could make jewelry out of them this dad really but Dad I love them for whenever you watch this video six months later and thanks to all of y'all suggestions on Twitter I'm gonna enchant a bunch of swords and make a bunch of gem encrusted goblets lab-grown gems are chemically and structurally identical to real natural gems this Ruby really is aluminum oxide and it fluoresce is under UV light as it should and there's no discernible difference unless you're looking at it really close you can probably tell that it's much more pure than anything you would find out in the wild diamonds that are growing in the lab can be super super pure or you can on purpose introduce impurities and even more than that you can even engineer the diamonds to have only one isotope of carbon so be completely carbon-12 99.999% carbon-12 companies can fabricate diamonds now with very specific rates of impurities for use in jewelry as well as for uses in scientific labs and that's now what scientists are using to do their quantum research good stuff and now as promised the rocks here they are where do I put all this so we've got malachite and blueberry and other colors of berry and chrysocolla I'm real dart and a rope of it and I've never heard these printouts so I have no idea if I'm saying them right and have you ever seen pure sulfur in real life that out oh and this is this is pure silicon silicon silicon silicon and a fossil and another fossil this fossil has like it's been opalized got opalescence in it i've also got an opal we spent like an hour talking to the opal guy and you showed us an opal that cost over a hundred thousand dollars and we got some calcite which is birefringence you can see the multiple images through it and a shiny rock over here and this is a pointy rock over there but the one that I'm most excited about is this one I know this rock looks like it was a piece of construction that accidentally fell into the rock show but when you take this in the dark and shine a UV light on it yeah if fluoresce is so I'm pretty happy tell me about the coolest rocks that you've ever seen down there in the comments and don't forget you can always send me expensive precious gems and minerals to my PO Box listed in the description and if you like this stuff too my friend Natalie over at Jay TV has a really cool episode about asterism which is an optical phenomenon in gemstones so check out that video and subscribe and that's it happy physics thing one last thing I'd like to thank Lockheed Martin for supporting PBS Digital Studios if you use a weather app in the morning to dress yourself then you can think weather satellites on March 1st 2018 that's today the goes s weather satellite will launch from Cape Canaveral to join its sister satellite goes 16th and provide coverage to the west coast thank you with the added capabilities of the goes our series of satellites will have better tracking for all weather and early warnings for dangerous storms across the country this 17th weather satellite will help your local weather alert systems so they can report to you quickly and accurately visit Lockheed Martin's website link in the description to watch goes s journey to Florida and learn about its contribution to weather systems [Music]
