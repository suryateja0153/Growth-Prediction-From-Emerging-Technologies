 Two digits have gotten us far. But the evolution of innovation demands a revolution. What if binary was just the beginning? And the space between two digits holds the key to our future? Computing power has reached its limit. We've made things as small as they can get. A new frontier. [programming code scattered across the screen] A new language. A new era of software, of computing. From definite states, to superpositions of states. States of exponential power. Quantum computing. Computers 100 million times faster than yours. Stored in temperatures colder than deep space. Processors so powerful. The future is being invented today. Cures for diseases Unbreakable encryptions Artificial intelligence. Power machine learning. Astronomy. Engineering. Finance. Logistics. Climate change. This is the next chapter in our evolution. How will you define the future? UTS. Faculty of Engineering and IT.
