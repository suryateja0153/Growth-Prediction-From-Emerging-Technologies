 I think that the admin team contributes significantly to research at IQC if we're doing our job well you don't see us we're behind the scenes I look at it as a theatrical production at Stratford where you never see the people behind the scenes but when the plate comes off well it means they did their job well we look after all the nitty gritty non glory jobs we look after the mail we like after supplies we make sure their desks are there we make sure their paper is there we help them with their grants we help them monitor their accounts and all the stuff that we can do so that they can concentrate on their research and teaching
