 so the quantum information graduate program here at University of Waterloo is giving me the chance to work with some very excellent experienced researchers I get to work with you know Kevin my supervisor and also another professor that were in close collaboration with and both of their supervising styles are fairly hands-off which works well with the way I like to work you know that allows me to go into the lab to really sort of try my hardest at developing my experiment and building things to take ownership of the experiment that I'm doing but then they're also available when I'm not having so much success and I need advice or guidance so I can you know really learn a lot both in terms of like physical skills in the lab and theories and also in terms of figuring out when to ask for help
