 a big part of our research is really just fundamental exploration of quantum physics the same physical systems that are good candidates for building a quantum computer also exhibit a lot of interesting quantum effects low temperature and magnetic fields and so forth so there's a lot of neat physics that you can explore and learn about and of course unexpected discoveries arise this way and so you know you can discover a new effect or a new property of the material has which might lead to a completely unexpected new direction for you know building a quantum device or exploiting that behavior in some way just studying that behavior there's a tremendous depth of you know new findings that that will come out of that and are coming out of that
