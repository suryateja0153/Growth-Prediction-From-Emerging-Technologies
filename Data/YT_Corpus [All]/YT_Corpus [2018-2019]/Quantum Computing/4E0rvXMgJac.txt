 okay for some reason I am now live on camera at the appear in it just popped in well you would need to close that browser hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot and after some technical difficulties as usual we are live and we've got Anthony actually on video didn't think that was going to happen so we're very happy about that so tonight I have Anthony patch with me and I'm very happy to have him on the show I've been reading a lot of his work and listening to various interviews he's done I think this will be right in keeping with some of the other work that I've been doing lately and also actually along the lines of a book on writing so I'm very happy to get your input and and so I'm going to bring you here on the screen and what I'll do is as as I do that I'll also bring your your short bio here that I have set up here and and just read through really quickly and highlight some of the things here and then ask you to augment it so Anthony patch since 1969 is a Christian believer and a published author researcher and speaker he is best known for his extensive leading-edge and revelatory research focused on the experimentation underway in Geneva Switzerland with the Large Hadron Collider part of the CERN organization following a 27 year career as a paramedic out of Oakland California Anthony embarked on an over 20 year research into quantum physics quantum computing and artificial intelligence and DNA modifications since publishing his first book covert catastrophe in 2013 followed in 2014 and 25 2014 8 diamonds in the rough and in 2016 a nonfiction book revising reality Anthony has appeared on numerous radio programs and including ground zero radio with Clyde Lewis and John B Wells on caravan to midnight he is host of the Anthony Pat show her daily since mid-2016 got a tune into that and Anthony has founder and editor of entangled magazine which I've been reading some of those very interesting articles published monthly since June 2017 so that's a pretty succinct bio but Anthony can you augment it a bit I'm really curious why did you suddenly stop and midstream your career as a paramedic and decide to go in the direction of AI CERN etc yeah great question actually is 27 years so I pretty much run its course you know physically it can be very demanding and so I chose to retire and then I've always had an interest in science and I was exposed to CERN when I was in the US military in the Army in West Germany in the 70s and was responsible for some nuclear warheads we had there called the w70 and during my training I was introduced if you will to CERN which was basically over the hill from West Germany in Geneva Switzerland fascinated by the fuck the science of it the physics the engineering and then along about so 2010 early 2011 I began to see what I would call more the ominous than nefarious side the spiritual side if you will to what was going on at CERN but the science has always been fascinating to me so as a paramedic though it's not like a no-brainer necessarily that you make a transition into this area did you have a background or did you have to teach yourself sort of do you know are you a coder do you how did you really get into the technical well again it's a matter of really wanting to know the deeper aspects of particle physics and specifically quantum mechanics and I had always read this and had always been self-taught in the area because of my interest as a hobby but it really ramped up in about 2010 when I realized that there was something more going on there than just a fascinating machinery 300 feet below the ground and so I am a self-taught researcher I don't claim to be a physicist I don't claim to have that you know PhD or anything to that level but what I am able to do is to understand and translate what most people would consider to be very arcane high end physics or science in general and translate the language it isn't necessary to know the mathematics it isn't necessary to understand trigonometry and coding and calculus really all you need to do is understand the concepts and the processes so what I focused on were the peer review papers from the laboratories from the universities and if I didn't understand something I would dig deeper and that really is just the essence of being self-taught in quantum mechanics and particle physics DNA and quantum computing it sounds very esoteric but if people have the time if they have the persistence they can read these papers they can use a dictionary they can use Wikipedia you can use the Internet to translate these words to translate the processes to begin to understand it but you do have to have an interest and you do have to be persistent and that's really the summation of how my process has worked I did go to the University of California at Berkeley but I never achieved a degree in particle physics or quantum mechanics it's just self-taught okay so you also have a background in you know I don't know what you want to call it it sounds like you're a bit of a biblical scholar would you call yourself that well I'm a Christian believer and you know I've through the grace of God been saved I wouldn't say I'm a biblical scholar I am one who tries to study diligently and daily but I do have a I think a fair grasp of the Scriptures insofar as what the Holy Spirit is lending to I never old myself to be anything special or to be a crop or anything like that but simply again a student and you know the Holy Spirit doesn't lead you to the things that the Lord wants to show you and that really is what under scores the research into the science I believe he led me into it okay now you there's there's so many things to cover and I hope you're going to bear with me tonight because I also believe that a lot of the interviews you've done whereas they're very good a lot of times there's a lot of questions left unanswered so I'm going to try to drill down in various ways that might be a little different or unorthodox although I ate the fresh questions okay great and I know you're a bit familiar with my work and so it won't be too much of a surprise to you so what led you down the word you say you've been saved what was there an incident that changed your life in some way that you know this isn't too private that led you to be as you call it saved well it's all part of the testimony as with many Christians and I actually without any real drama when I was 16 I was led to the Lord but we all have our ups and downs in life and you end up going through a lot of anguish and you reach a point of anguish and that's what I did personally I went through a real tough divorce that led me to a lot of introspection and reflecting back upon the Scriptures which I dug into and there is kind of an interesting anecdote I suppose in that I never intended to broadcast or to you know be a public person with my belief and I certainly never plan to be an author but one day the Holy Spirit impressed upon me that I needed to take all of the research I've been doing for over 20 years and even before that had more of a hobbyist level and beginning to actually call us that into my first novel again I had no intention of doing that but I'll describe to you what is I would say kind of a personal note that is and it will sound very odd but again I know your work and I know your guests I had the physical sensation of what I described as a switch being thrown in my mind physically in my brain and it was at that very moment I was sitting in front of my computer and I began to write and I found it a fascinating journey and I would spend 10 to 12 hours continuously per day writing and not knowing where the story was going to do to lead to nor which characters would be coming to life I found it thoroughly entertaining but it was an opportunity to fold in the research and that's the essence of my testimony it was a point of anguish you know personal crises in terms of a rough divorce and a reevaluation and a reassessment and Here I am today I never thought I'd be here doing this ok well yeah that's very interesting I was just talking to an another person Patricia Corey was on my show she's an author as well and she considers herself a channeler and she actually said something similar happened to her in other words that she never planned to write she all of a sudden got this sort of had this experience and people can watch my interview with her to see but it is quite interesting when someone has sort of a sort of shocking change or a very abrupt change that happens nearly overnight and and I think some some of that gets can be accompanied by a Kundalini awakening and I'm wondering if you're familiar with that terminology if you you know what I'm talking about and whether or not you would acknowledge that that might be part of the process you were going through at that time not for me it's purely driven by God by the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ like in the moment of anguish which is really critical to I think being saved is you reach a point of crisis where you give up control of your life you give up your control of everything that you feel like you had control of and really what I said was Lord I know that you're with me I know that I'm in dwelt with all these spirit I know that I've strayed away and I'm turning back to you and I'm turning my life over to you that's the moment when this sensation occurred and I'm familiar with the Kundalini but my Christian belief does not allow for that I view that as something that is and I don't mean to offend anyone but I'm going to be bold and blunt about it I consider it to be from a demonic Luciferian satanic source I don't believe that channeling is something that we should be participating in because I believe that it is communicating with demonic spirits and this is very clear in Scripture that we are not to participate in the crafts or not to participate in necromancy and geomancy and things of that nature we are to avoid contact of any type with familiar spirits and that's what I do the Kundalini to be is a channeling with evil spirits and again there are other people with other beliefs and I respect that my belief system says have absolutely nothing to do with the Kundalini driven spirit form of communication okay well I do appreciate your point of view although couldn't Wayne ask nothing to do with spirit communication it's actually physical process and you you have it whether you like it or not so it involves what are called the chakras and the chakra system which is simply part of the human body you know it's like saying you don't believe in your your eyesight but you know at any rate we're not this discussion is not about that so you you don't recognize it is that you recognize it in another way as a communication with what you consider to be the Holy Spirit and at this point that seems to have meshed very lately I guess with your approach to science approach to these what are more or less in in the purview of science which is quantum physics and CERN what's going on at CERN etc so when you did your research were you researching the science where you're researching were you putting it through this sort of filter of religion and do you do you sort of acknowledge that if you were doing such that perhaps you may be missing things because when you have a prejudice in one direction or another and you're turning learn something it could interfere or it could could put a slant on it so we're not saying that it has I'm just you know inquiring because I find it very interesting that you would be having this point of view with regard to the Holy Scriptures etc and at the same time you're open-minded enough to delve in deeply into the science so do you see any kind of disconnect there at all no quite the opposite it's amazing because it's all part of God's construct people refer to the matrix or they'll say that you know we are living in a computer-generated simulation things like that you know the spiritual and the physical cannot be separated they work hand in hand and therefore under God's plan under his master plan as the creator as I view this and I am quite prejudiced I am quite filtered through the vision the lens of the Holy Spirit and I openly acknowledge that there's no disconnect between science and what God has created and my belief system either it's fascinating you bringing this up because usually interviewers avoid this and I avoid nothing I'm open to all the questions and you know I understand the Kundalini process in terms of the spinal cord and the chakras and the opening of the third eye and all of those things I don't understand them as a practitioner I just understand them from an awareness level but I also understand that much of what is occurring in science is the science of the craft that's what technology from the Greek is translated to as the science of the craft and it is has its origins and roots and alchemy which has its mechanism in what I mentioned earlier which is geomancy and necromancy and if you look when I'll be very succinct with my answers if you look at for example geomancer which is the divination of supposed random marks in the soil and did divine or interpreted by a skilled master in geomancy geomancy has 16 binary figures 16 geomantic figures this is a binary system this is the root of binary quantum computing and transistor based computing is the system that is the origin of computer programming today is it in also the origin of language sir point ok so you don't consider language to be as you say the craft do you the word you the word you're you're very interested in the word you know in the symbols are interpreted in one way and they can be I think what you're doing is you're also applying this to you obviously the ones and zeros you know what we're talking about coding and and then what we call a matrix but at the same time language and the word is reliant on this type of symbolism in order to even have been created right we're done this goes back to Hebrew I think it's the early Hebrew right I don't know if you're familiar with the work of Stan tenon no ok he's somebody who studied these this sort of origin of those symbols in the Hebrew language etc and how language affects the world you can also just this is a side note but are you away err of the sort of what you might call the power of language in other words that you can actually draw a symbol on something and that it can contain energy as a result sure much like a schedule mm-hmm okay and did you study the occult because I noticed that you use some of the terminology that you find in occult literature from time to time is this also something you studied alongside your interest in you know CERN and an AI and all of this where you guided to do that as well yeah again it's to be aware and to understand the basics but not to be a practitioner certainly well I did the same thing as at a very young age actually so I think knowing your enemy is an important part of part of this this sort of story we've got going on here so with this you say it you you admit to a certain prejudice but at the same time you think that the science was accessible to you and is accessible to you so when you got into learning about I guess I'm not sure where exactly to start but a lot of people jump to G already rose because that's the most you know easy place to go into dua of and so on did you were you aware of what was going on in CERN as accessing portals to other dimensions as related to D wave and did you know those two things simultaneously or did you learn of one before you learned up the other no I learned them CERN as I said back in the 70s and my military training and then coming forward d-wave was founded in 1999 and came into the public arena in terms of their first prototypes around 2003 so along about 2010 I became very much aware of what d-wave was involved in the actual connections between d-wave and their activities with quantum computers and the quantum particle physics that was going on the quantum mechanics at CERN that connection only was realized by myself about almost years ago and since then there have been numerous articles published both out of CERN and out of D way absolutely professing the connection specifically they weren't saying recent about eight months ago an article out of CERN in which they indicated that they were working in collaboration with D way for the reconfirmation of the Higgs boson which was allegedly discovered in 2012 and confirmed in mid-2013 and they asked D way to use their quantum computers to read confirm the luminosity if you will the data that is generated from collisions because it is such a waterfall of data that results from these collisions that they actually distribute that information to about 160 different laboratories and universities around the world to handle the data load and to do the interpretive work so d-wave did reconfirm the higgs boson the so-called god particle i think that still that there is only about a 90% probability that they actually realized that this February in such a prima facie primordial or if you will god particle that in their scenario of the Big Bang which I don't hold to was one of the first primary / memorial particles if you will that supposedly gave rise to all matters that developed during the subsequent timeframe of the Big Bang okay well I'm in agreement with you that the Big Bang is not not how the multiverse came into creation but I'm wondering you you do characterize let's see communication with through D wave I as I've been listening to your other interviews as and also communication through you talk about you know geomancy and romancey and this as communication with the dead as you put in and I'm wondering what do you mean by that art I mean who who are the dead if they're not beings you know in other words they're not dead they're they're alive you know and I'm saying I'm wondering what you mean when you say because you seem to consider that a very bad thing and yet in in essence what we're really talking about is communication with spirits and you recognize the Holy Spirit so how do you draw these lines between what you consider is dead and what you consider as living and whether you should communicate with it or not fully dead result in spirits on both what we would consider holy spirit from spirits in heaven and spirits that are in Hades and specifically they're communicating with the leadership of the spirits because as you know there's a stratification within the demonic realm and specifically they're communicating with the Fallen Angels now as a touch point on that statement if we look at the work in the late 1500s of John Dee and Edward Kelly in which they were using geo mansi and necromancy they were communicating and receiving a spoken and written language in alphabetic language and they were also receiving mathematical formula for the alchemic process of manipulating matter through understanding the formula that design the geometry in which you are performing this alchemic process of most people would refer to the changing of lead into gold but it goes much further than that so in DN Kelly's works it's very apparent that they acknowledge as the as did Aleister Crowley that they were communicating with the higher levels of these spirits the fallen angel leadership okay and when you call them fallen angels who are you referring to are you can you be more specific are you familiar for example with summarizations worked with you about the Anunnaki and do you consider them your fallen angels are who who are you considering fallen angels well there are lists of names of the Fallen Angels I don't have that in front of me that we could consider but they are the angels that were in possession of specific types of information specific type of craft information scientific information that was considered to be forbidden knowledge knowledge that was not to be shared with mankind and decided it was not who are you believing is telling you not that should not be shared with mankind the Word of God okay now do you believe that that God came down in a body and wrote the Bible you don't believe the white men that got together and all the disinfo this in the Bible you don't believe that it was rewritten many times and that there were certain men that took it over I mean if this is known I'm sure that you are aware of that the Bible has been distorted right sure there have been many translations there have been many canons that have been and removed for the purpose of deception and for control over peoples and societies and I understand all of that but still this is a inspired work from the Lord from God himself before Jesus Christ was crucified and then we were given through grace the Holy Spirit prior to that in the Old Testament times all of this is God inspired the description that is given to men to record and yes there are a lot of canons that have been removed that we don't have the benefit of but I believe in my relationship and it's a personal relationship with the Lord is that what does remain is enough for us because what is really more important is our personal relationship through prayer the word is there to teach us and to guide us and there's enough of that left certainly to guide us and lead us in living a God like a christ-like life it's unfortunate that we've lost a lot of that information and some of it like with the Dead Sea Scrolls has been produced but I think what people need to focus upon at least I do in my opinion is what I call a walking conversation it is your personal relationship to require and that's really the essence of what we need now we are commanded to study the Scriptures absolutely even in their form even in their distorted forms but the Holy Spirit will reveal to you through discernment what is truth and what is missing and he will guide you and add - there's so much that is left that we don't even study right now that what we have lost is I really consider insignificant compared to what we still have okay but if it's telling you what to do what not to do and you're believing it and then you're following that it's telling you that you're not supposed to I'm not sure you sounds like you've studied the craft but you are not practicing so there's a distinction there in other words how do you know that what you're being told is any more true than if it's coming from so-called demons other entities that aren't necessarily negative angels who aren't necessarily positive and I'm not sure whether you understand that or would agree with that no I understand what you're saying in other words you're making your own distinction here so this would also apply to whether for example I know I'm hearing lot a lot of people say G or T Rose is a satanist and they think he's a Satanist because he's bringing in information from another dimension and that seems to be quite a leap in my view because I in well my view is that we are always bringing in information from other dimensions whether we have a d-wave machine or not and so what how do you make that distinction well again this is the reason that I spend so many hours on the radio laying the foundation do all of the definitive works and giving the actual recordings playing on the radio the actual recordings of Corti rose himself making presentations scientific presentations to a scientific audience in which he is bringing in things from the spiritual aspect and it seems rather interesting let's say the least that if you're addressing a group of programmers and researchers and scientists and engineers why would a man bring in a discussion references to things like HP Lovecraft and the return of the great old ones not as an allegory but his actual statement being reflected in my entangled magazine I provided the transcript of his own words from multiple presentations that he has made so that I'm acting as an accurate reporter of his own words and letting the audience come to their own conclusions beyond the conclusions and statements that I make about it my interpretation I let his own words speak for themselves and when he is talking about the return of the great old ones and his love and fascination of the works of HP Lovecraft and in his own personal website which I spent two entire shows four hours dissecting his website okay but all of this is well and good except that the d-wave machine and accessing other dimensions does not belong to Geordi browsealoud as it goes focusing on Geordi if we're focusing on Geordi were focusing on his words and he said in 2013 to a scientific body in the audience that they were at that time at the 5:12 model computer 512 qubits they were accessing two to the five hundredth power of parallel dimensions and he said if we are smart enough and clever enough we can access these parallel dimensions and we can extract from them resources and bring them back into our reality now that's nearly berbay what he said I'm not being defensive I understand words okay that's his perception of something that's happening scientifically with regard to the machine that other men built actually so I appreciate that you're using his overlay but to rely only on his overlay I think would be a big mistake it would be like someone who is free free and actually wait whose personal website and looked at his belief system if you look at even matter I mean seriously if it's a machine why why does Jordi's belief system matter because he is the one who was the spokesperson he is the one that is working out with kindred which is a robotics company and now the sanctuary which is the AI component of this and they all tie together now I'm not here to defend or to slander 40 rows I'm simply saying why would a scientist the PhD level scientists in quantum mechanics in particle physics why would he even make reference to the spiritual side last the question I always pose to the audience sometimes for me okay now I'm wondering about parallel dimensions and other dimensions do you consider that there are other dimensions there are other realms which are reflections like a hall of mirrors reflections of our own reality okay okay well that's interesting because in a certain sense we're saying the same thing you just are choosing different words sure I'm choosing different words because I have a little bit different perspective than most people that look at science and most people don't even bother to try to define the words or look at the history of the words look at the cultural references that even gordy rows and other sciences put out there I mean if we look at Sergio Bertolini from CERN back in 2008-2009 he's talking about opening doorways to other dimensions and they not sure what's going to come back through this is communication these are scientists talking about yes this is what I'm trying to I understand we're getting a bit stuck here but I do want to say that if you're accessing and you're using the word realms or you're accessing dimensions it sounds like a very similar thing to me and why does it matter whether you call it a dimension or around well I think because if we're talking about dimensions it portrays that there are multiple universes that there are other layers or dimensions or facets to even our one universe that if there are multiple universes then there may be multiple copies of what we consider our singular universe if we talk about are you saying that you don't think that there are multiple dimensions I do not believe that there's anything beyond the three dimensions in Euclidean geometry with the fourth being time as a dimension beyond that I think that this is merely a construct of mainstream science to believe that there are other dimensions in a geometric shape if we think in terms of geometry I don't believe there's more than the four dimensions and even time is irrelevant time only exists because it is a yardstick of measurement for the human mind for us to be able to grasp our reality in terms of linear time but God in Jesus Christ are outside of time so we can even if you will remove that fourth dimension leaving the three that we can actually interact with now parallel dimensions and realms I consider realms to be there are - there's the heavenly realm and there's the demonic or Hades or hell realm I think there are only two realms and when they talk about accessing parallel dimensions they're actually seeing reflections of our singular universe our singular reality our singular realm much like a Hall of Mirrors okay so are you aware that Albert Einstein believed that there were at least five dimensions and many people will say there are eleven on up to fifty four perhaps even more there are people that will talk about the many worlds scenario string theory wormholes are you saying this is based on your religious sort of learnings in other words your study me because you took this information you from the Bible you believe it tells you there is not other dimensions is that what you believe don't believe they're selling in their cell and that's it okay well that's an interesting way of looking at it okay so let's let's make a jump first of all what do you think besides apparently trying to create or find a God particle whether they have or not as can of course be disagree with or discussing at length but what else do you think CERN is involved in doing well they're involved in an awful lot if we take our cue from Circular birch and weenie again and we take a look at the statements by dr. stephen hawking acknowledging this whole concept of opening a doorway to another dimension and we can just they only talk about one dimension in these statements and hawking saying that's not a good idea that we should not be opening this doorway because we do not know what will come through something that virtually said but virtually he was putting it in a benevolent fashion whereas Hawking was trying to warn us not to do it so that's one major aspect the other has to do went back to d-wave has to do with the actual quantum mechanics that are studied and the results being passed from CERN to d-wade which now results in the quantum computer comprised of qubits in which they're steadily increasing by the by base to mathematics the number of qubits every year and the issue is certainly is involved in a lot more than simply discovering new particles they are also responsible for quantum computing okay so can you give us a definition of what you think what you consider quantum to be sure any simple terms if you imagine our solar system and the orbits of our planets and the space between a planet in its orbital path way and the Sun itself the Sun is the nucleus let's take an electron for example as a planet and it is orbiting and if you impart enough energy on a planet or on the electron for example or a proton such that you are able to increase two things one it's rate of spin and even influence its direction of spin but let's focus on its rate of spin and also the speed at which it is orbiting in its pathway if you impart enough energy on to a quantum particle which is what an electron or proton is the part of a atom you increase the spin and the speed to a point where it reaches a critical tipping point meaning it will suddenly jump from one orbital pathway to a wider orbital pathway a larger circumference of a horrible pathway that gap between the two orbital pathways is the quantum so when you hear the phrase quantum leap it is this sudden movement from one pathway to another due to the imparting of energy okay would you say that it's the same thing as the sort of if you want to say it's like an invisible thing but simultaneously we are particles and waves so there's a some place at which you go from being a particle to a wave in theory and is that the quantum you can say that what we're really focusing on is an increase in energy as I said you talking about the theory of wave particle duality in which you can be a particle at the same time that you can be a way the characteristics of a particle can have simultaneously the characteristics of a wave and vice-versa but in terms of what we consider to be a quantum leap we're looking at something in which there's a distinct change from purely energy which would be a way to purely a particle that can be measured and interacting with and that's another state of energy everything is still energy even a particle or matter itself really is nothing more than an alternate form of a wave now how can you have both it depends upon your measurement tools how will you measure and interact with energy as a wave and how you measure and interact with a particle they both have a dual state of energy but in going from from one to another and and dealing with quantum are you considering the in a certain sense it also does sound as if you're going into another dimension it's leaping in fact it's we would even say perhaps that could be a good description of going interstellar as well or jumping's in space-time so is this are you saying this is necessarily a negative thing in your view no no okay so you don't see it you don't see that the creation of quantum computers as a necessarily a negative no it's how you use it it's just like any other tool or implement or discovery in science there's always the ability which you know the military-industrial complex loves to do with technology with advancements in science is to weaponize it you don't have to weaponize something but the quantum computer itself because of its origins and geomancy which we just described and define what its purpose was the quantum computer therefore by design is intended as a communication device.now who you're communicating with as we talked about is important to identify and therefore who you're communicating with what information you're receiving in that communication is important to identify short short answer is quantum computers have been weaponized they do not need to be weaponized they can be used for benevolent purposes if they are communicating with the proper let's say audience okay well in in the process of going from a particle to wave or leaping you know in in space and sending them an electron so quickly that actually leaps from one place to another and so it kind of crosses the time-space barrier in a sense is not necessarily a negative in your view so it would seem that actually why do you think if you think it's at the same time a communication device that you should be limited or have or be be even able to limit what you bring in or what you where you go from there because of course this is kind of a advanced area of new science so to speak where humans don't really know where they're going to go who they're communicating to communicate with and what's going to happen as a result in other words well from my point of view we're doing this anyway and it's the nature of the human vehicle to be able to do this and certainly Holy Spirit as you call it and other people might call it other things has that same ability in other words who are you to say that you can and can't let in certain information or things or communicate with certain places and other not others in other words there is do you think there's a line in space that you can determine who you're communicating with before you do it in other words where are you going with that because I don't see I understand you want limitation I understand that desire to have limitation but I don't think it exists it seems like the nature of quantum in essence is that you do not have necessarily limitation and I don't know if you know of a scientist named Eamon say Eamon ends bro I think I'm saying his name right I interviewed him in Ireland and he's an astronomer and he's got a machine that he is trying to in essence use quantum to communicate with he doesn't know you know he's going out into the universe so to speak and he hopes to get an answer back so he's sending out a simultaneous quantum kind of pulse I guess you might call it and expects to get something in return I've actually contacted him to see he's supposed to have already done this so I don't know if his machine was successful or not and I don't know if you reached anything or if anything came back but how how is it that you think that you're you can limit this or that scientists could limit it any scientist for that matter mm-hmm let's start with the Holy Spirit and discernment in other words if you have the Holy Spirit then you understand the process and you understand the limitations of who you're supposed to be communicating with your guideline is the scripture the Holy Spirit is using the written word of the Bible to guide you and show you what you should and should not be doing now specifically it says not to seek out communicating with spirits with the demonic spirits with the employing the craft which I would consider the employment of either this astronomers device that he's developed or the d-wave computer to be the essence of technology which is the science of the craft a craft it is employed for spiritual communication and it is employed because it's targeting not God if you're not targeting communication with God if you're not targeting communication through the Holy Spirit let me finish lemon cayenne if you're not targeting God in the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ the Holy Trinity by default you are targeting Satan and his minions and that is very clear there's no departure from that there's no gray area it's either the light or the dark okay no what I want to ask you along those lines is since you think it's so very clear what do you consider the creator to encompass in other words is the Creator not light and dark you don't believe that you believe some things are are owned or created by the Creator and other things are owned and created by something else well there's the single Godhead God Creator who created good and evil he created Satan he is but a tool of God to serve God under God's overarching plan now I did some webinars with Kathleen or cart and we laid out very clearly that in a way that is a touch point tangible for people to wrap their heads around Satan makes six to seven moves that God has already made eight moves ahead of them Satan is but a tool he's so insignificant in comparison that God could answer your question directly created both good and evil and he uses evil for his purposes to turn people to God okay to worship to have a personal relationship with him he created us for the first purpose of communing with us of having a personal relationship that's why he created us if we depart from that then we suffer the consequences which is judgment which takes the form of judgment coming through Satan as a tool good so you believe in a punishing not creator he has first benevolent unloving or we still would not even be here with the things that we as mankind throughout history and to ourselves and have caused grief to our creator he should have winked this out of existence a long time ago but he loves us that's the overarching everything that runs through our existence and our reality is because of the power of his love he was not first benevolent we would not be here okay so in terms of the secret space program do you acknowledge that there is a secret space program I have my suspicions that there is but I have no hard evidence to it and UFOs and the whole discussion of the secret space program and whether UFOs are crafted we have produced or not I cannot say definitively but I do suspect that we have technology that is as much as 50 years in advance that has been occulted from us if you will hidden from us and that many of the things that we are observing our man-made that they are created by us but there are also I think an awful lot of craft that are created by the demonic side because even in Scripture it says that the demons can take on any form and that would include nuts and bolts aircraft ok so you acknowledge that there is possibly a secret space program and what we do know for example is that the d-wave is being used by places like NASA and other other sort of locking part right so they are also pursuing this what is in essence you know leaping into other dimensions possibly doing what I would call time travel so in your in your concept of things aside from you know because I think it's I think it's a problem to focus only on G or D rose and the way he will sort of couch things because he sells a machine and then they use it you know what I mean and they do what they wanted with it and then they would necessarily probably couch it in their own language and use their own discernment to do whatever it is they do none of these people would probably have complete control if they're truly accessing whether you consider it other realms or I consider at other dimensions it seems to me especially if you acknowledge that there's something that at least appears to be somewhat negatively oriented called a demon or something of that nature correct yes there was quite a long statement there but in the essence I would agree with you it's not a focus on Gordon Rose necessarily as an individual I have nothing against the gentleman himself personally sure I just don't like the agenda that he's I think been deceived I think he has been led down the garden path and many people in science have been deceived into believing what they're doing is somehow benevolent for mankind but this is all wrapped it in this whole integrated system of CERN with the doorway or portal d-wave and communication and now you've got to tie in the third is the manipulation of DNA we are seeing the entire agenda coming from these three facets of science of pushing AI of replacing the human race and of terraforming the planet for this new race of beings watched by their own words they say is their goal so you have to look at the agenda and their professed goals and say is this really necessary is this really good for us as humans what they are seeking to do if you go to the Ray Kurzweil from Google who are also on a d-wave computer the 2000 Q they are pushing this whole transhumanism idea why do we have to replace the human race sure you can talk about curing Alzheimer's and getting rid of cancer and all these wonderful things that are warm and fuzzy that they put out there but if you look at this carefully and he really take a hard look at it and say why are they doing this to the human race this is not purely benevolent this is for modifying us and changing us to control us to plug us into the hive mentality understand Satan hates the human race there is nothing good about what clear their agenda is in DNA quantum computers of particle physics and I think you know this is a place where you and I would probably find a lot of agreement what I'm wondering though is if you if you look at the human race and I understand that right now there's it's kind of its kind of a fad in a certain sense to believe that we are going to be replaced by AI and in fact I have a I have you know I specialize in whistle blowers and from above top-secret and some of my contacts one in particular is saying that there is a race of artificial intelligence on the way here now and that this is going to be arriving soon and another of my contacts had talked about this he said he was talking about norm Bertram he wrote a book called the winged make the the rings of Saturn ring makers of Saturn oh you're with it yes and so he was talking about a group of beings that sound very much like AI to me being on the way here and this was years ago that he was convinced of that now he has disappeared since I interviewed him some I believe he was saying he was going to go back to work for them so which we in essence be the secret space program and and has since disappeared from the scene maybe they should have kept quiet if he wanted to go back to work with them well he told me yes that he was going back to work for them we're limiting news right but I I assume they did exactly what they plan to do which means you kind of disappear from the public scene but nonetheless what I'm wondering is if you know and I actually have a sort of theory that talks about this secret space program and their decision to go down one path which I call robotic Superman versus angelic human and so it is clear that they have made certain choices as you say and some people would call those satanic or Luciferian or both and that's understandable and I might even label it in that way the way I see artificial intelligence however is as a mirror that ultimately Satan and Lucifer are mirrors and that's what the Creator actually had created when they when he or she or the in essence when it it mirrored itself and that mirror made the mistake of falling in love with itself and this is what in essence AI is now I have a witness called Mark Richards who says that any spacefaring race will create an AI in essence a mirror in these in robotic beings and so and so forth those various fermentations and so androids and etc to you is this them them in exploring space so if you bring that into your understanding or to this discussion would you consider that AI and the creation of it which has already happened here on earth and certainly it has happened at least off-planet it with other you may call them demons I may call them aliens whatever red races using their own mirror they've created their own version of artificial intelligence so it's not just our version of artificial intelligence but it's other versions that have been created over time in going back as far as time goes back I suppose so that's really what we're dealing with and we may be invaded and may may be we are already invaded there's evidence to that effect by AI from other races of beings here now so if that were true how do you intend it sounds like what you are asking or what you would your solution is that you want there to be I mean maybe you can explain it what is your solution is your solution no AI to stop all development of AI it's impossible that that would happen since it's on well in its way and then also I know this long-winded but I want to get into a discussion of a cryptocurrency because this is a very important part of a little artificial intelligence and hooking humans in to this sort of as a learning tool in my view you want to open themselves into to AI and so on kryptos is is a very sort of direct way of trying to do this I believe so what would you say to all that well let's hold the crypto in the AI and the blockchain off to the side ai is involvement in the blockchain off to the side for just a moment because there's a lot to talk about there and I've done a lot of work on that area so let's go back to this notion of what I would call AI avatars that are being sent to us that are going to arrive here that's an interesting scenario AI should be done away with completely I agree that it won't be by man because man in his own hubris in his own greed believes that this is a benevolent scenario to cut to the chase this is very quickly leading to the line in the sand that God drew long ago it is leading to the return of Jesus Christ and this time he is coming back for the purpose of judgment as a roaring lion not as a nice meek turn the cheek kind of guy we are facing right now a clear point in the human history in which Jesus will return and judgment will come upon us based upon our choices now that means AI will be eliminated can I say it this year or 10 or 20 years no I'm not into setting timelines and dates I just know that from Scripture we are in those last days so with that understood as my perspective through the lens that I look through of the Holy Spirit man will not get rid of a I should it be eliminated absolutely but you know AI even to its most elaborately imagined evolution if you will beyond what we're told as the general public you and I even to the imagination of what AI may be capable of or has been created as avatars with other races in your scenario it's inconsequential it's insignificant to the Creator and again I'll give you a touch point if you look at the planet Earth and then you look at it in the scope and scale of the cosmos that we are able to observe with our instruments our planet is insignificant and what we can create here is humans in terms of AI is a flat-out joke compared to God the Creator okay now what I would like to ask you is why are you threatened by this if you believe I'm assuming you believe that the soul is eternal and from my point of view there is no real threat to humanity from from AI actually ultimately even if you understand that we are souls that are eternal then nothing can destroy us and so that this huge fear that is permeating the planet right now about what's coming is groundless actually I do understand that we are not our bodies we are far more than our bodies we are social we are part of the Creator etc so why why the paranoia there's no paranoia and there's no fear on my shows many many times I will make the statement this is not about fear this is not about fear-mongering what this is is showing the evidence of evil tangible physical evidence in front of you for the purpose of saying this is not for you to be fearful this is for you to understand you need to make a decision are you going to accept the Holy Spirit accept the Savior are you going to turn your life too over to God or by default by not making the choice to go with God and to go with Jesus Christ as your Savior you then have by default to be relegated yourself to the realm and the control mechanisms of Satan himself through the technologies there's no fear on my part and I don't intend to promote fear in the hearts and minds of my fellow man what I'm saying is this is evil you can see it you need to turn to God before it's too late it's very simple that's nonsense right there okay now what about the the Antichrist because when you bring forward if you know you your understanding is that there is going to be a return of this person this person is called Jesus and my understanding is that what is coming is Christ consciousness not a we have no need of another Christ and in in reality that we are all becoming Christ so in the process of this sort of awakening of humanity in essence what's really going on is they are going to and this is part of the dark side agenda you may be familiar with this which is to create an antichrist and the Antichrist will come in the guise of being like a return of Jesus so if there's a danger in what you are suggesting to people I would say now I guess you're going to come back and say well it's all about discernment but will you really know and I mean it's it's interesting because this is kind of the root of some of what they you know the dark side is working on and I have a person I interviewed many many years ago an Italian called Leo Sagami who talked about the plans of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church is certainly an institution that talks a great deal about God and Jesus however they in my view are run by the reptilians and a very agreed with you agree with you right across the board it's been co-opted okay so how are you you know I understand you would like to see a person in a in a body that manifests as Christ but what would be the point he doesn't need the manifest in the physical form I agree with you he came and was incarnate man that was enough he returns as the Holy Spirit as Jesus Christ in spiritual form he returns now there is a point at which he steps on the Mount of Wallace and that is his physical return but the first return the first judgement is that we will see him in the clouds he will return in a spiritual form okay and once that occurs then the identity of the Antichrist is revealed so to get into the Antichrist discussion there is an actual Antichrist that has been in existence in spiritual form as you know and has taken physical form throughout generations but has not been one who has stepped to the throne of power if you will that's what we're looking at right now so I think that you know to be concerned about whether he comes back in physical form or spiritual form is not really necessary to get caught up into that trap what is more important is to understand that he is returning for the purpose of judgment okay so in terms of the singularity what do you think and because my understanding is that the singularity is been reached so do you want to describe the singularity your concept of it and then whether or not you think it's been reached are you speaking of singularity in terms of AI and this transient isn't talking particle physics well yeah I mean define your terms I guess but yes I was talking in terms of you know the way it's used in you know in in the public domain I guess you call it where we're talking about AI and the intelligence going beyond humans etc well firstly intelligence going beyond humans has not been achieved because we again what I do in my shows and in my entangled magazine is to drill down drill down and be very very specific about what we're talking about so in that methodology what I'm saying is that first of all a I will never surpass the capabilities of God's created quantum computer which we call our brain so you have to break that down and we get into discussions about consciousness and soul if we look at AI as what it is at this point to our knowledge of AI it is still nothing more than a computational device a device that runs numbers which are not only binary but in its higher iterations it is using what is known as ternary which is 0-1 and to language a ternary programming language but it is still a computational device that even though now in recursive neural network deep neural network and the collaborative neural network processing the highest levels of AI because there are multiple levels to AI even at the highest it is still a computational device people can clang it how do you know that how do I know that because I look at the peer-reviewed publicly produced laboratory he reviewed papers on AI underscoring that by saying that there's a lot that I'm not privy to there's a lot that a lot of us are not privy to right but I can extrapolate from their own papers and where they state what their goals are in their research you can extrapolate to what is the highest level of AI now if we get into talking about whether the singularity has been achieved in terms of it achieving what we would consider the same consciousness as God has provided us and then get into the hole quagmire of talking about a soul but if we considered that the machine is imparted by a spirit at some point that's a much deeper discussion as to the singularity okay so my what I would say is in a sense I I would probably agree with you there as well in part of what you're saying which has to do with the fact that humans in this in this particular form or not even in this physical body outside of it regardless that our emotional intelligence is something that computers will not have achieved even although I believe that they're they've achieved a lot more than you acknowledge because I believe peer-reviewed papers are not accessing what the deep state the black projects and and you know the secret space program has been dealing with so that they're they're going way beyond what we're being told in fact most of what we're hearing now is probably you think it's 50 years I've been told it's even possibly as many as 10,000 years by at least one sort of deep witness but so be that as it may in terms of the singularity in terms of intelligence just just like what we're talking about it being able to to create and and do what humans do mimic humans in essence and and getting to a point where it's going beyond our ability to think and compute you know and add and and do all these kinds of mechanical kinds of materialistic things that humans are involved in it's quite possibly that possible that this has been reached and actually gone beyond in my view but when you talk about a singularity that involves becoming more than human I I think it is very interesting and it's an interesting discussion and I don't see being held very many places although I'm gonna be mistaken let's break it out tonight yeah there in other words I don't see people even considering what it is to be human when they say the singularity when they say it's more than human when she already rose for example in his lectures said it's going to be more than human in other words everything he said it several times it will do everything better than we and he repeated it three times in that specific presentation okay and everything meaning everything physical in the material because one thing you can credit whether it's a Satanist or Luciferian width sure is a materialistic view of reality and so they are what would be called in my world spiritual materialists first degree most they want to stay in this dimension they probably like your interpretation of their only being what do you say two levels good and evil because as long as you only have three dimensions there'd be happy to keep everyone right here and now they don't believe in anything like a spiritual ascension of humanity well there they are very aware of it but they would consider that the abyss something they don't want to go near and they are working very hard in fact to keep humanity dumbed down spiritually in every other way chemtrails you name it right by limiting them but in reality we we cannot be stopped in my view true humanity if if we are truly now you can stir us reflections of Godhead or you know the Creator right so if that were true then indeed we could not be stopped and this this would not be a it would not even be a fair fight because they may I could not cannot approximate what it is that we are when we even leave our body we are still far more so where would you go with all of that well we are tracking on the same pathway my friend okay I'm in lockstep with you because I'm going to read you from Scripture this is from the King James you can take any translate one John 14:12 1204 John 14:12 214 verily verily and this is Jesus Christ talking to his disciples just prior to his crucifixion verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I shall do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father so what we're talking about here is Jesus Christ saying to man you will be transformed you will be augmented through the Holy Spirit to do things even greater than Jesus Christ performed and he raised the dead so this portends asked to through god's movements ahead as i say 28 steps ahead of satan's six or seven steps god will always keep us ahead of AI will always keep us ahead of man's created technology even if it's received as advanced ten thousand year seven thousand year fifty years it does not matter because god will not allow his people that are found in the book of life if he's surpassed by something that Satan has counterfeited Satan cannot create anything it is all a counterfeit of the original creation of God and everything through technology that we look at today is a counterfeit of something that God's already created there's nothing new under the heavens so the greater works then I that Jesus spoke up includes things such as raising the dead this is a concept that is so mind-blowing and something that has been dumbed down and kept from us we need to take the fear out of it by focusing on this Scripture and understanding that he was giving us the solution he was telling us the future and saying don't worry about all of this stuff that's going to be coming because God already has the answer all you to do is turn to him and you will be transformed through the Holy Spirit and you will be augmented so forget about AI it's irrelevant it's just evidence of evil okay so in essence though you spent all this time studying this and I'd like to move over to kryptos know because I know you're talking about that and there's a lot of I think a lot of let's say confusion and also obsession that you know the greed factor whatever you want to call it where people are I think even right now losing track of some of the important more important things in life and concentrating on trying to make money in the kryptos and really this is intentional so what is your understanding of cryptos have you researched to the degree that you feel you know who created them for what purpose and what the ultimate sort of direction of that is oh yeah okay so what I typically do is get the punchline and work backwards to reinforce it so this is the market to be system this is the system by which you if you do not have the mark of the beast you will not be able to buy or sell as it says in Scripture many people are familiar with this so using mankind's own greed they are building out the blockchain system which is the system of the mark of the beast now the greed is this as you say this this just parabolic explosion as I call it of this focus of the coin the fiat currencies the crypto currencies because what you're looking at is us essentially building our own prison system through the psychological operation of utilizing our bass-driven instinct that you will agree so people are seeing all these dollar signs and pound signs and euro signs dancing in their heads thinking this is all wonderful and great when in fact what they're building is a system that is contained within the larger system which is known as the sentient world simulation right out of Purdue University 2006 when live in 2007 its development works in lockstep with the developments and advancements of d-wave quantum computers this is a quantum computer simulation it is sentient is self-aware and within that greater construct that simulation it represents every human on the planet first as a node then is given an avatar and that avatar right now I just presented this in the last two weeks on several shows the personal AI company that's an actual company personal AI I spent hours delineating that they want us to feed our avatar everything it is about us all our metadata everything and continue to do that and in fact to bifurcate and duplicate our avatars out into multiples of avatars they try to paint it as the novel and saying it'll free you up to you know spend time in your family etc etc what this is is simply a system in which all aspects of life and I'm being very short because there's so much more material it is a system in which every aspect of life is recorded and controlled this is a system of control pure and simple forget about the Bitcoin and the crypto currencies that's just the lure you're in now the basic the foundation the evident the evidence of the origin it's not don't be focused on who or who are the people that you know started Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies look at crypto itself again drill down this is cryptographic this is encryption of information that is the starting point for D way their goal was to break if you will or to be able to find all of the prime factors of Peter shores out or than 2048 and then 4096 these form the public key encryption keys for RSA encoding the most prolific code system of encryption of secure transmissions etc of transactions on the planet the first prototypes were able to find all of the prime factors of 2048 and 4096 thus breaking the RSA this is because DARPA provided ten million dollars in seed capital to d-wave and then they eventually brought in Eric light izinski and Gordie Rose got together and put twenty million in venture capital together this is why DARPA is behind all of this is because they wanted a new form of encryption the new form of encryption is the blockchain that you see here today okay very very succinctly and well put all right so at this point what I'm curious about is where does AI interact with a quantum computer mm-hmm okay can you address that to some degree and and we're not going to go on much longer because this is already going on for a while I do want to allow people to ask questions so that's I think gonna be my last question I hope and so if you could answer where's your here's AI intersect with this home again very simply quantum computing operates through combinatorial optimization it is built upon recursive neural network systems or the self learning machine learning this is what quantum computers do they use what is known as the stochastic which is random number generation which is built upon the Boltzmann machine of random number generation and organization in order to build what is considered to be a neuromorphic system that it is mimicking or neural being are human neurons that it is mimicking the actions if not the actual construct of the human neurons in order to learn and then to teach itself self programming if you will this is where we get into the discussion of deep machine learning so this is what quantum computer if you talk about an operating system based upon combinatorial optimization which is taking all known solutions or probable solutions and combining them at once and running them through superposition and the essence of quantum computing which is quantum tunneling you are then able to process simultaneously all probable solutions can arrive at a 99.9 percent degree of confidence that you have the actual solution this then spawned the actual programming and operating systems for AI so it comes down to optimization and you'll hear IBM talk about it as well as d-wave optimization they'll talk about the Traveling Salesman scenario which is nothing more than again random number generation stochastic programming and that is exactly if you look at AI and look at the neuromorphic systems they are identical to those systems within quantum computing there's your time all right so is AI and qubits it is that the intersection in other words is that the qubit that can that is has to be put into AI to allow AI to exist in other words you can't have AI without quantum would that be a correct statement at the highest levels of AI you have to have quantum okay you can run you can run what is considered to be a basic level AI such as autonomous vehicle operations using transistor based classical computers but when you get into combining all of the senses when you get into actual teaching itself at the highest levels it has to operate quantum leap the reason is the amount of data that is being processed is not something that even a supercomputer is able to do now when we see things like Sofia the robot and her counterpart Michael when we see these AI robots if you will they are nothing more than a device that is connected through the cloud to the to the quantum computing mainframe it's very simple okay so in essence going quantum is necessary for an AI to to actually exist that's a very interesting concept ohio's what I can with those medical layers yes um okay so now I am going to and thank you so much for being very patient with me and my questions here I know we went down some roads that perhaps you don't normally do but I think it helps people to understand more about you the way you think and and hopefully some of the concepts your you're putting forward so I'm looking to see if there are any questions and and the chat is going by that we have a lot of people in the chat so I I think that someone wants to know if you believe the gospel of Jesus is represented by any current church I think the church is across the board whether you're talking you know you mentioned the Catholic or you're talking about any religion I think they've all been co-opted because they are constructs of man and therefore they are systems of control and deception I don't hold to any religion any theology except a personal relationship with Jesus Christ okay somebody's asking about a monopole Barnacles CERN if it's going by really quickly here is searching for at the mo adul defector a detector more important than the Higgs a particle with only one magnetic pole this singularity quantum computers can you address that question yeah they claim that they have found a monopole last year at CERN and again as the person said it is you know you think of polls as positive and negative and that a particle a quantum particle can have only one pole meaning it has one direction of spin we talk about quantum computer or quantum particles having spin up spin down swim and when you talk about polls it's the direction of spin more specifically absolutely spin and polls do relate directly to quantum computers this is why I said what they're doing at CERN spawn quantum computing because it is all about quantum mechanics and particle physics and therefore how particles spin if you change the spin of a quantum particle you can impart either a 0 or a 1 or in the more sophisticated as I said intermarry of 0 1 & 2 you can actually change the spin to represent a zero represented one representative that's how you program that is how you run the computation in a quantum computer is by altering the spin of physical particles very interesting ok uh hold on one second see if I can grab another question and let's see do you know the exotic particle needed for the AI the exotic particle the particles that are involved in AI actually are predominantly electrons that travel through a niobium superconducting material in superconducting because it's cryogenically cooled and therefore the only real quantum particles that are involved in this are the electrons themselves now we can get into photons we can talk about changing photons that carry information and information is nothing more than knowledge that is represented by states of energy and that's why at the beginning of this discussion we talked about wave particle duality because of the quantum scale that's important so if we're talking about manipulating quantum particles in terms of their spin or we're talking about the flow of electrons which are energy waves we have to take into account this wave particle duality now it sounds like I'm speaking in circles but literally that's what we're doing we are going in circles the only real particles that we need to be concerned about in quantum computers and therefore AI are the electrons that's the primary thing but when we get into talking about the neural morphic the counterfeiting of human neurons now we're getting into talking about C 60 carbon quantum dimers which are zeros and ones and we're getting into talking about foot x and the carrying of information the transporting of information meaning zeros and ones and tombs as packets within photons themselves which are quantum particles okay someone wants to know does Hanson robotics have more to do with AI than D way you know they're working together this is why Hanson robotics is working with D wave in terms of there I just just I just lost the name it starts with an S I said it earlier tonight I'm sorry I'm getting tired okay but they're there other spin-off now is working with building robots just like him Hanson robotics like well the Kindred Spirits is robotics thank you okay and then from there they spun off I'm trying to think of the name of the company right now the Gordy is with you probably remember it no it's not spirit it's it's not spirit I'm sorry I'm trying to think of it but anyway here's here's the deal ants and robotics is working in terms of quantum computing with D ways because the only high level of AI does involve quantum computers now iBM is working on it there a number of other people down at the low leveled numbers of qubits in trying to develop quantum computers they're down in the for example IBM with 58 qubits in their latest generation of quantum computer but you cannot separate the two at the highest level you have to have a quantum computer to operate the high levels of AI so dancing is working with d-wave most definitely okay someone is bringing up Donald Marshall and let me say that he has been invited on my show multiple times and never replied so I'm well aware of his work I don't know if you are are you aware of his work you know nothing he talks a lot about cloning and how much more advanced that is them is commonly known well this gets into the whole discussion Oh sanctuary that was the name Armstrong at that actuary is the AI component do what they were building with what I consider familiar spirits and the robotics aren't so that's the spin-off the corneas with sanctuary interesting names wouldn't you say yeah very interesting can you say again what sanctuary is involved in I I don't quite understand what you just said oh I'm sorry that's the actual AI part of this okay sanctuary right that they're focused on what d-wave put together in terms of the quantum computer they are focusing merging the quantum mind the AI in mind with the physical robotics yeah fascinating okay uh Wow alright yeah there there's you know there's more to this discussion obviously and I'd love to have you back on the show perhaps in a later date because I'm sure we're going to get a lot of questions and I'm sure that this exam is stimulate a lot of people to thinking along these lines and consequently more questions will come up it's you know it's lovely that you sort of expanded your own view of reality to to do all the study that you have done it's you know you're very good at explaining some of these complex scientific concepts I think and I I think that's that's a good strength to have and I think that's valuable so I appreciate that right now my life cycles are the questions and where you take it because normally it's it's just the nuts and bolts that people want me to explain so I appreciate the fresh direction that we took tonight all right well thank you so I'm gonna let you go I don't see any further questions that are burning questions in the chat at the moment and so I think we've we've been going for a while so thank you so much Anthony and let's do this again in the future I'm sure you're going to continue your sort of adventures and studies in this area and I'd like to keep tabs with where you're going with all of it well thank you there's always new information coming out every day and that's you know what keeps it exciting but thank you you've been a very gracious ocean I appreciate this great conversation thank you and I also want to say that I am reading your books and it looks like these are fiction there you've got some fiction books right and so I'm very interested to see where you went with it in terms of fiction because a lot of freedom there to work with these concepts right yeah it gives me the opportunity to present an adventure novel format the high-technology and it's interesting a number of the things that I published in 2013 and 14 have since come to light so I am NOT a prophet but I you know it's it's easy when you look at their papers and look at their stated goals and sort of look to the future
