 statement American tech rules the world yes it does but not in the g-wiz field of quantum computing which I barely understand understand it period so who better to spell it out for me and explain the Michiyo capital physics professor extraordinaire and the author of that book the future of humanity professor Walker of the program glad to be on the show again just treat me as a common or garden idiot please and explain what is quantum computing well remember when we were kids they were vacuum tube televisions and vacuum tube radios remember those days remember where we went to Silicon and everything changed Silicon Valley got up to ground all of a sudden trillion-dollar corporations got started we could be witnessing the next transition from transistors based on silicon the transistors based on atoms so the Pentagon already is raising the alarm bells saying there's gonna be a quantum gap like the missile gap of the 1960s it's just quantum computing it's just the manipulation of individual atoms that's it that's right in other words silicon like for example in your Pentium chip has a layer about 20 atoms across that's how small transistors aren't getting however in the next decade or so Moore's law will slow down computer power will level off and we're going to go to the next transition which could be molecular computers optical computers or quantum computers we're gonna enter the post silicon era like today we are in the post vacuum tube era we're going to be in the post silicon era in other words Silicon Valley could become a Rust Belt oh so you're implying and I think the premise of your appearance today is that China is ahead of us in quantum computer that's right however we shouldn't hyperventilate because the actual creation of a successful quantum computer which could crack any code on the planet Earth any nation's code can be cracked like that we're still decades away from that from that goal so we shouldn't think that almost said everything's going to collapse because of this but American companies are involved in quantum computing everybody's involved Microsoft Google all of them are rushing in to learn the quantum mechanics of atoms because we're going to be computing on individual atoms individual atoms on a magnetic field can be either up or down or sideways or in between so instead of zeros and ones zeros or ones you can have anything in between zeros and one now think about that anything in between 0 & 1 you can compute with why that would make an ordinary silicon computer look obsolete like a Model T can you find the password for my gmail computer will break any password any code this is why the CIA and the NSA have had study groups we know this because of course these documents have been leaked look into it and they say that it's still decades away however we got to get into it now before other nations get there first I'm sure we will cuz they surely profit involved professor thank you so much for joining us I think I understand thank you professor good stuff
