 So life as a graduate student is very open-ended. There's a lot less structure in my day than there was as a typical undergraduate taking five courses and a lab. And I think it's a bit difficult to adapt to, but ultimately I think it really helps build me executive functioning skills and my skills as a researcher. I'm an experimentalist, so I spend a lot of time in the lab when I can. Sometimes it's very frustrating trying to align the same bit of optics again and again, it can sometimes be frustrating. But ultimately I really like the hands-on component, to be able to tinker in the lab, build something tangible, and getting data. That is the most exciting thing.
