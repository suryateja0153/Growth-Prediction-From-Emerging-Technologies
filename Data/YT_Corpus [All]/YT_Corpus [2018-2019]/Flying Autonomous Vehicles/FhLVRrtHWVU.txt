 [Music] peace on you brothers and sisters Tech Tube you here back with another video and a very interesting topic today we are talking about autonomous cars or better say driverless cars as interesting as this might sound we needed to dig deeper in order to know more about reality and now let's take you into a journey to discover more about these cars we have six main levels in the autonomous vehicles driving technology at level zero there is no kind of automation whatsoever but at level one we start seeing some automated assistance functions such as anti-lock brakes and cruise control on level two this partial automation of central driving functions including steering acceleration and lane correction jumping to level three where there is conditional automation of driving in which human presence behind the wheel is necessary to take over in some cases but on level 4 driving functions are mostly automated now level five is all about complete driverless experience in other words full automation in all circumstances in order to achieve this automation we need to understand the technical aspects starting with the connection for a car to navigate the street without human interference it needs huge number of sensors and a very solid connection with the data servers the most advanced connected cars around right now only hit about 30 gigabytes of sensors data in uploads each month to seize the opportunity customer service providers will need to make sure that 5G is included in the design of future vehicles as a result 5g networks make customer service providers an important partner for enhancing vehicle systems this autonomous cars will be equipped with numerous sensors that allow real-time data processing and decision-making within milliseconds in terms of connectivity 5g provides critical latency and extremely high relability playing a key role in security information sharing and decision-making times you can watch more about 5g from the i above or the links in the description box below in addition cars are currently making decisions based on the sensors built into them we can say that it is an isolated decision without taking into account the surrounding environment 5g enables that all cars can send information from their sensors this way it is going to be able to make a decision based on the situation of the area in particular and not on a single car if in addition to this we add the interconnection of everything such as the pedestrians traffic light then the chances of an accident occurring are going to decrease drastically so what we understand from this that 5G has much to offer especially regarding to high throughput and low latency and allowing the download of high quality content while in movement in a few milliseconds and enabling of the enjoyment of content in the vehicle and the so-called sensor sharing in other words everything "learned" by an autonomous car can be transferred to the cloud so that the rest of the actors can benefit from the experience and the most appropriate reaction to different events in the environment composed of a fleet of autonomous vehicles there will be a crucial need for 5g in order to manage the flow of information between the shuttle's and the control center to exchange command function videos and data 5G will provide guaranteed maximum latency and dedicated bandwidth which is not available in 4G environments finally it is predicted that by 2025 the autonomous cars will upload over 1 terabyte of sensor data to the cloud every month and all thanks to 5G technology that's it guys thanks so much for watching if you are new to my channel then please consider subscribing and don't forget to activate the notification bell and leave your comment below one last thing smash the like button that was Tech Tube see you in the next video Peace Out
