 [Music] Stanford University it gets more interesting if you say well what else could they do besides take video what if you want drones to interact with the world these are micro tug robots they're flying micro tugging robots and they are micro air vehicles that also have the ability to anchor onto their environments and tub with large forces micro air vehicles typically have payloads that are about their own weights due to the amount of thrust that they can produce and so what we did was combine some attachment mechanisms onto these micro air vehicles so they could latch on to their environments and talk with forces much larger and they could what they're available thrust we have two ways of anchoring on surfaces and they both come out of with a prior work that we've done on climbing robots if you have smooth surfaces then we have a gecko inspired adhesive that works on the tabletop or on the floor on a window we have a different technology that we developed for climbing robots that's inspired by how insects climb they have many little tiny spines on their legs and those interact with bumps and pits on the surface and allow them to latch on and again to hold with the force much greater than their own weight so we have adapted that now to these flying robots we looked at lifting heavy sensor payload to inspect a collapsed building we also as a sort of a proof of concept opened up a door so one of these vehicles grabbed onto the handle another one slips a hook underneath the door and I was able to pull the door open all of these were manually piloted within line of sight so was really testing the capabilities of the hardware what we've done so far is we have a proof-of-concept that says yes you can have these small air vehicles that are able to interact very forcefully with the world by by anchoring themselves and tugging so if you've got the sight of an earthquake or an explosion you want something that can rapidly go over to a building get inside look around but then also maybe move a piece of debris out of the way or make something become unobstructed and for that now it needs to hanker itself and pull with a hard force for more please visit us at stanford.edu
