 ever since the Wright brothers first flight over 100 years ago airplanes have been propelled by moving services that accelerate air such as propellers or turbines inside jet engines electro aerodynamic or EAD propulsion is an entirely different propulsion system it produces thrust directly from electrical energy without the need for any moving services an EAD thruster uses very high voltages to create ions in the atmosphere when a sufficiently high voltage is applied across two electrodes of different sizes the electric field around the smaller electrode becomes so high that electrons are knocked off from air molecules around it producing a source of positively charged ions an electric field then accelerates these ions from the smaller electrode to the larger one while moving between electrodes the ions collide with neutral air molecules transferring momentum this creates an ionic wind which produces a thrust force similar to the wind from a propeller except without the noise or the moving parts MIT threw the first ever EAD airplane which had all power systems and batteries on board the aircraft achieved steady level flight demonstrating that flying planes using this different propulsion technology is possible while our EAD thrusters are not yet as efficient nor as powerful as conventional propulsors we hope to continue improving this technology and inspired novel applications for quieter cleaner and simpler aeroplanes
