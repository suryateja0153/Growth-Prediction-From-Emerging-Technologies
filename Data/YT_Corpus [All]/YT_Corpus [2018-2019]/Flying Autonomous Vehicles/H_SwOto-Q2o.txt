 It's the first autonomous boat system, a platform to move things, to move people, and also is something that can help build and develop a flexible infrastructure— a temporary bridge or a floating stage. We've already received inquiries from Venice and from Tokyo about how we could use something similar to Roboat over there. But then the other thing—you think about taking all the technology and making it very very small and self-contained, and then applying it, potentially, to every boat to make seas safer, with just you adding this little intelligence to every boat. And you add its self-driving capability.
