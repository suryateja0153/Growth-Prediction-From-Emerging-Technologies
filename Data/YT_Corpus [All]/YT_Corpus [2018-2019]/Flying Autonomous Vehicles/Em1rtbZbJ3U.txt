 I'm mr. mobile and every time I do a video on an electric car someone in the comments pops up to say gab but the real future is in hydrogen cars maybe but to drive a hydrogen car you need to live near hydrogen fueling stations and the closest one to my home in Boston is two thousand five hundred forty-seven miles away so when I was in San Francisco last week I thought hey why don't I call up Toyota and ask them to put me behind the wheel of the Mirai the company's fuel cell vehicle which is named after the Japanese word for future and before I knew it I was hurtling down the highway leaving nothing behind me but water here's a look at how hydrogen cars work why they're cool and why I think they're probably not the future [Music] the first thing I was surprised to learn about hydrogen cars is that they're electric cars the me rise wheels are turned by an electric motor just like a Tesla or a bolt evie the difference is in how the power is created where a battery electric car gets its juice from a charging station or a plug in your house a hydrogen car like the Mirai generates power using something called a fuel cell the engineering behind this is complicated but the concept is simple see the car pulls in air up front through what on an older car would have been a radiator grille and a filter separates the oxygen which has passed onto the fuel cells along with hydrogen from two tanks under the cabin the hydrogen does not burn like gasoline does instead it's chemically combined with the oxygen and that chemical reaction produces electricity the electricity is then fed into the small battery and the drive motor to get you moving as different as it is under the hood driving a fuel cell car feels much like driving any other car in fact the Mirai feels like a slightly sporty-er version of the Prius Prime I reviewed last year and I do mean slightly sporty-er when I toggled power mode I could get accelerations of zero to 60 in nine seconds hydrogen maybe rocket fuel but the mere AI isn't gonna hit escape velocity anytime soon of course it's not built for that it's built for grocery runs and driving your kids to little league games and while this isn't a review video my three days with the car gave me the impression that it would do that job just fine are your kids safe in a fuel cell car it's a good question when you're in the Mirai you're literally sitting on top of two tanks of hydrogen which are pressurized to ten thousand pounds per square inch it doesn't sound terribly safe to put those into a 4,000 pound car flying down the freeway at 55 miles an hour but Toyota has a good reputation for safety and the fuel system bears that out in a crash the cars chassis is designed to redirect impact forces around the fuel tanks the tanks themselves are carbon fiber reinforced polymer and they were tested by an outside firm which filled them to operating pressure then did things like drop two and a half tonne weights on them they just bounced off the lab was able to penetrate the tank but it had to shoot it with a 50 caliber bullet in the case of a similar sized breech in a crash the hydrogen would escape over the course of 15 to 30 seconds and yeah it would be an ignition hazard but then so would gasoline and gas sticks around a lot longer than hydrogen we don't have a lot of data right now because there aren't a lot of these on the road and thankfully even fewer of them have been in crashes but after looking into how these have been built and tested I didn't feel any less safe in a fuel cell car than in a conventional one the best and worst of hydrogen cars can be found in the same place the fueling station on the positive side you can top up your hydrogen tanks in a fuel cell car just as quickly as you can gas up your old Buick I went from three-quarters to full in under three minutes that gave me enough time to press the h2o button on the dash dump some of that nasty dihydrogen monoxide byproduct for those not in on blame science jokes dihydrogen monoxide is water that's the only exhaust this car produces hopping back in and getting back on the road with a full set of tanks I'm good to go again for about 250 to 300 miles the negative remember how I said the only place you can get one of these right now is in California that small scale means hydrogen fuel is still quite expensive that quarter tank I paid for cost me about 30 bucks extrapolating that to fill up from empty at today's rates you'd pay over $80 Toyota does take the sting out of it by giving you either fifteen thousand dollars of free fuel or three years worth of it whichever is cheaper plus you do qualify for a five thousand dollar California state rebate and/or an HOV sticker but with an MSRP of over fifty eight thousand dollars for the Mirai you're still shelling out a ton of money to get a car that only works in a small part of the country looking down the road it would be exciting to see a hydrogen fueling infrastructure develop across the United States but these cars would outperform battery electrics in very cold climates and yeah it's definitely nice to be able to refuel in minutes instead of hours other countries that are more aggressively pursuing zero emissions targets will probably order more Japan in particular is big into FC B's also using hydrogen as a means of large scale energy storage has some advocates so a ways down the road hydrogen may indeed be our collective energy future but in the nearer term here in the States I think we'll continue to see battery electric cars maintain their momentum they may refill more slowly but it's a lot easier to find a charging station than a hydrogen one and in the worst case with an e v you can usually find a wall plug to plug into also V's let you wake up with a full battery everyday if you charge them in your garage every night that's a lot easier than digging out a part of your yard to accommodate your own personal hydrogen fueling station you get the idea still I am fascinated by the technology that's driving fuel cell vehicles and I'd like to hear your thoughts on them to drop a comment below especially if you own one of these things and be sure you don't miss my coverage of electric cars from Tesla Mercedes Audi and GM among others subscribe to the mr. mobile on YouTube until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends
