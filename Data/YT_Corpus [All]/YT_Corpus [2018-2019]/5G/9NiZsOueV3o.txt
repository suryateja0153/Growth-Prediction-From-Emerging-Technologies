 you've probably already guessed today we're talking about 5g hello you're being a super week in public do you want to be in it right great so before we can really talk about 5g we need to know why it's a big deal we all know that 4G is big in America and you even have the LTE but in Europe most places we'd kind of struggle just getting the 4G so it will take some year but like expired and tech world both say there will be a roll out in 2020 so that's in two years that's pretty damn soon the big deal about this is that it would make the internet speed ten times faster so there would be no more buffering there'll be nothing but you would be blinking it looks like we're walking over a red light right now i strata guarded screen it screen it is look we just walked into got into traffic so there will be no buffering and that's amazing but the biggest difference between 4G LTE and 5g is that 5g uses high frequency waves where 4G and LTE and everything else really uses low frequency waves but we've run out of space on those waves that's why it's really difficult for IOT devices right now to get online Internet of Things is IOT and it's basically when you put an internal SIM card into an object so that it can communicate with your device and you can sort of interact with it even though you're not near by it so freeing up more real estate by using higher frequency waves is a brilliant thing to do but it's a lot tougher than it sounds Nokia and Ericsson are sort of predicting 2025 but no matter when it really happens let's just talk about the downsides because there's five technologies that has come out because of the down sides and now made it possible to make an even more efficient network even though high frequency waves have some really big downsides so higher frequency waves get blocked by walls and absorbed by rain which makes it harder to use yes and this is what we call millimeter waves it's basically waves between 30 and 300 gigahertz it creates a big obstacle that it can't go two obstacles so in order to sell this we need to use mini cells which is like a small cell phone tower we could put multiple locations throughout a city and then those waves would be able to go through some of the walls and thereby give us Internet also when we were inside and they would be able to give us Internet outside even when it rains but there's more this doesn't really solve the entire issue using these mini cells create more outputs this is called MIMO multiple input multiple output points and it'll create much more problems because the signals themselves are being sent out in circular waves and when we send them out like that they can interfere with each other so we need to solve the interference problem we definitely don't have a script for this no keep informing which is basically a traffic signal for it's true it is yeah it basically transforms the wave into a beam and then we can send the signal we need to send to a specific device only to that device meaning we cut out like 99% of the entire wave and it's only being sent out in like a small bit to that specific device which solves part of the interference problem then we have the full duplex technology which basically means that you can send one signal from each side at the same time at the same time and they won't interfere with each other exactly we kind of solved the best prosecuted problem by creating this transistor so that instead of having a one-way line at each time we can actually send them past each other at the same time which is brilliant and it solves the remaining of the interference problem this is all the five psychologies that we need to make 5g happen we do already have them but we don't have however is an agreement on what range we're gonna send the signals are and how much we actually need because we need to set up all of these new towers and we need new chips and we need new antennas in all of our smartphones before we can even take advantage of all of this I think a great intellectual vlogging so this is a big deal for a few reasons groups special mobile association have come out with some numbers they're basically saying we'll have one to ten gigabytes per second we'll have ten times the bandwidth per unit area and we'll have a 90% reduction in the energy usage meaning the battery problems we already have in our mobile phones might also be solved by doing this there's some really really big upsides to it and it's really interesting because it allows for the IOT I mentioned in the beginning Internet of Things can all of a sudden start using this extra bandwidth to actually get online we solve the entire real estate problem and we can start living the high-tech lives we all wish we could live I mean I don't know about you but I always wished I could turn on my car where I love us at work just don't write a press of a button that's a lot of really useless functions but it also allows for some really really really great and amazing technologies like these let's really think about the potential for a world filled with devices that can detect changing conditions and reacts so quickly it makes the blink of an eye look like an eternity 360 degree VR video + - 360 degree VR experiences back there all of them are streaming down one single 5g connection we're actually sending 1.6 gigabits per second and that's just the demos for using that is not the max bandwidth it's just that we don't even have enough demos here to max out the bed width of our connection it has two players who are meeting in personal space in the cloud and yet they're seeing it here and in the lag is so low there's so little latency that it seems real-time we are investing than the whole infrastructure in the cloud the clients the network so that 5g can roll out we have already announced our first range of commercial 5g modems the X mm 8000 series you're driving down the street on your way to work your car is communicating with sensors embedded in the environment your car is also in constant communication with the city's traffic system funneling you through the best route clearing your path of red lights and other delays compared to tomorrow our did is nothing tomorrow IOT Internet of Things everything connected we think it were a big data company today that was compared to yesterday compared to tomorrow we are nothing improve people's life improve the machines to make me sure the machine can do better job to support human beings we don't know how data really can make money today but we know we have to protect the privacy of the data and when we know one day the data will empower the human being a simple illustration is the capability for your voice to issue a command through an interface to perform everyday tasks like turning on a light bulb or managing your home or office security system we all need to become technologists and product designers we've been connecting our environment to the Internet the Internet's been around but I think the reason why it's becoming so exciting now is that smartphones have basically commoditized this wonderful technology that now is so cheap we can take a little mini smartphone stack and embed it in all sorts of things in our houses in our cars on our bodies in order to sort of have the Internet of Things I think these interesting it as it is it not only needs this smart technology on the sort of processing and networking side but you also need a lot of sensor technology I've been fortunate to have worked with a couple of I think some of the more exciting early successes in the Internet of Things nest you know it's a really incredible team who built the Apple iPhone and you know the smart thing they did is they they said that learning technologies allows them to sort of predict and react and understand consumer preferences that then makes the device really work for the customer in the future chip will cost a penny so the internet will be everywhere including our contact lens when we blink we will access all human knowledge that is gonna be it for this video guys thank you so very much for watching I do put a lot of work into these so if you knew the channel then please subscribe and let me know what you think in the comments down below there are a lot of other possibilities with this new technology and yeah do you have anything to add well you do have a point you could put artificial intelligence online a lot easier with this and you could put autonomous vehicles on the road a lot easier because of the low latency they could talk to each other almost in real time not too far out into the future but yeah let me know what you guys think in the comments down below I'll see you guys next week what do you do this like this is this is a good arm workout do you want me to hold it again
