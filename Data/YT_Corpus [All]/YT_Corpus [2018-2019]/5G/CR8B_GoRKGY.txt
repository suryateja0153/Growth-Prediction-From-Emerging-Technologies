 six a parade of people turned up today and for the DC City Council to sound a warning about 5g technology now Phi G is the next generation of cell phone and wireless service now being built across our region it's a lot different than anything we've seen before so we asked our Scott broom to explain why so many people seem to be alarmed about 5g I mean come on people isn't 5g just the latest upgrade in cell phone technology well no not exactly in fact 5g is potentially revolutionary because it carries more data faster than ever before so much more data it can potentially run a fleet of driverless vehicles in real time or replace cable service to your home with the same stuff through the air anywhere no wires and 5g will be different than existing wireless service it'll work on ultra high frequencies never used in commercial applications like this before high frequencies do not travel far so carriers like Verizon and AT&T will need to build hundreds of thousands more antennas closer together 3,000 new transmitters in DC alone carriers say existing light and utility poles like this one would be good spots but lots of new poles and towers will have to go up too which means lots more antennas in your neighborhood close to your house one on every block in some places and in places like Santa Rosa California residents are complaining about how they look and some studies now suggest the new ultra high frequencies may come with increased health risks that have not been fully studied and you can see it's about 15 feet from this woman's home at hearings in DC today Ward 5 councilmember Jack Evans warned wireless companies they are in for a fight the idea that I would allow someone to put two more poles on each side of the street in historic districts I represent is ludicrous and that puts Washington and a bunch of other cities on a collision course with the FCC the Federal Communications Commission some cities like Seattle are already suing the government and saying no to carriers 5g plans Scott broom WUSA knob Montgomery County Maryland is poised to pass restrictions on those 5g construction plans but a scheduled vote on the bill was delayed back on October 30th
