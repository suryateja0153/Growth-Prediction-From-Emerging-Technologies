 hi I'm Dan with Weavers in this video we'll talk about a topic that is getting quite the attention lately 5ye will help answer some questions about 5g and how they impact you so what is 5 g 5g is a cellular standard that means fifth generation it is the next evolution in cellular communication beyond today's 4G LTE standard 5g will be developed alongside existing 4G LTE networks 5g will meet the demands and needs of a network that is growing quickly with more and more connected devices more people the Internet of Things and higher data speeds for content delivery so why all the excitement about 5g well a future with 5g means two main things increased speed and increased capacity as a demand for cellular grows so does the number of users the 5g network will be able to support up to 100 times the number of connected users or devices the speed at which users download data and applications are 100 times faster than what 4G LTE network currently delivers for example a 2-hour length movie used to take 26 hours on 4G LTE that same movie would take 6 minutes and on 5g the 2-hour length movie will take 3.6 seconds impressive right 5g will also be able to support 10 times more battery life for low power applications real-time gaming and video will be 5 times faster than the current standard so what is the timeline for 5g don't get too excited just yet there are trials and testing currently happening to enhance 4G LTE network speeds but between specifications and hardware development 5g probably won't be happening until 2020 even then the network will only be a fixed wireless system which means it won't be completely mobile it is safe to say that there are faster data speeds in our future let us know what you think about 5g in the common below and please subscribe to our channel for more helpful videos like this every week thank you for watching and we'll see you next time [Music]
