 Being a Verizon engineer is about doing things right. And there’s no shortcut to the right way. So when we roll out the nation’s first 5G network, it'll be because we were the first to install millions of miles of fiber optics. And we’ll be the first to upgrade the towers and put up the small cells  that will help power the smart cities of the future. When I started at Verizon, I knew I was joining a team  that was pushing the industry forward. Now, with the launch of the only 5G Ultra  Wideband network, we’re doing it again. This time, changing the way we learn, work and live. And I’ll always be proud that we’re not just  building America's first 5G network. We’re doing it right.
