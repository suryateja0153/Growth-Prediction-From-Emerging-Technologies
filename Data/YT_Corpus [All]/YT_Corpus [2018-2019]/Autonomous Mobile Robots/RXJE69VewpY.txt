  The Scientific Association of Vehicles and Mobile Robots is a strategic student group at the Wroclaw University of Technology. Our goal is the development of motorization and electro mobility. Our main project is LEM, or Light Electric Motorcyle, which participates in international competitions. To build this motorcycle, we started from the design phase and went into the execution phase, i.e. we welded a frame or built a battery. We have built 6 motorbikes that have always made it to the podium at the Smart Moto Challenge. Last year we were able to beat all of our competitiors and win the whole competition. Thanks to the many training sessions provided by SOLIDEXPERT, we were able to learn how to unlock all the potential of the SOLIDWORKS environment. The Scientific Association of Vehicles and Mobile Robots is bringing students together from all corners of the Wroclaw University of Technology, enabling them to work on interesting projects, such as an autonomous vehicle named Jurek, the first Polish car adapted for drifting, and a light electic motorcycle. Thanks to the SOLIDWORKS electrical module, we were able to design the entire electric motorcycle. This year, we set a new goal. We organized electrical motorcyle competitions under the name Wroclaw SmartMoto Challenge. The Scientific Assocation of Vehicles and Mobile Robots is one of many student groups that participates in the SOLIDWORKS Student Sponsorship program. As members of the program, they recieve access to a full range of SOLIDWORKS solutions for design, simulation, visualization, and more. As a result, they can implement their projects  in a professional way and gain experience that will enable them to enter the labor market in the future.
