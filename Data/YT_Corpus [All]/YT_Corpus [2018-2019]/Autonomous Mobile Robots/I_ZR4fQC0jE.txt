 orders for millions of holiday packages are about to be placed mean someone has to pack up those orders to ship them out or does it in tonight's Boston next how robots made right here in Massachusetts are changing the game when you get that next package delivered to your doorstep chances are robots helped get it to you this is really a new paradigm this is a game changer and this is one of the most cutting-edge out there the Locust robot designed in Wilmington the Locust robot is an autonomous mobile robot think of it as a self-driving car that works collaboratively with humans usually in a warehouse environment here's how it works someone places an order online locus sees that order uses barcodes to go find it in the warehouse and then lets a human picker know it's time to load up the car she just picks it out of the shelf scans it and drops it right into the tote so one of the first questions you might have when you see all of these robots zooming around is will they hit the workers will they hit someone but they have kind of an intricate set of lasers and cameras on the front that allow them to see me and then figure out how to get around me locus can then head to several other orders and eventually bring them all back to base to be boxed up and shipped and when you suddenly deploy 50 of these robots across a warehouse the productivity gains are dramatic you don't have to search for an order you don't have to walk so many miles to get the order the local spot is doing everything for you except picking up David Marcantonio helps run the operations at quiet logistics in Devon's quiet does the shipping for several companies and they're one of the first companies in the country to rent these locust robots we are picking 3 times more efficient than we were in the manual building but what about the human cost these robots of course could mean workers losing their jobs but Marcantonio says there is a constant labor shortage in the logistics industry especially in peak shipping seasons like Christmas when they'll ship 60,000 packages in a day locust helps fill that need and Marcantonio says they also make the job physically easier for the human workers a normal picker could literally walked 20 miles a day around a 300,000 square foot facility with the locust it's cutting it down to like 2 miles a day in fact quiet he's found the locust to be so helpful it's ordering another 50 of them pretty well to be in that warehouse and seeing it it's just the sea of robots moving around with no one around them the next step by the way is potentially to put some arms onto the robot so they could actually pick into the bin themselves we're a long way off from that for a variety of technological reasons but there is a company in Massachusetts and a lot of these companies are in Massachusetts that's working on making those arms I'll show that story to you next mistake some of our co-workers of the future are going to be machines get ready it's not news broadcasters now to see other stories in our Boston x-series go to CBS boston.com click on the Boston next icon in addition to technology we've looked at the future of housing security transportation race relations weather and politics you could spend a whole day watching those Boston next series great story
