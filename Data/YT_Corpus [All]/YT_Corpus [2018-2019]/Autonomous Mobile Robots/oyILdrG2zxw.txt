 right so moving on to robots from the University of Washington they are the center of pioneering research on carbon in the waters around Antarctica and send real-time data about ocean conditions back here from thousands of miles away it has a phone modem on here and we are able to send emails and text messages and anything that you can do on your cell phone we can do with these satellite phones that sends data back and forth so when it comes up from the middle of the ocean it can send us a text message that says it is 2 degrees in the middle of the Southern Ocean please bring me home please bring me home yes that's what I'd be saying ok these poor robots do all the hard work in the cold stormy seas while the scientists here just stay at home there are more than a hundred of them now in the southern ocean they measure all kinds of conditions there from temperature to acidity scientists can control their buoyancy to collect data at different depths and because these robots can survive winter conditions in Antarctica unlike humans like these scientists who often haven't been able to study this area they're changing how scientists now can track climate change for instance they found that the ocean and one spot is actually releasing carbon back into the air ten times more carbon than originally thought also by using this new technology and taking taking observations from this remote and very inhospitable place the information that we're getting is is going to allow us to better predict what's going to happen in the global climate system Wow so this research research could help better target policy related to climate change that's obviously the big issue with carbon so where do we focus our efforts or what kind of effects are we gonna see if you see you know the ocean is taking carbon particles to different spots on earth or releasing more of it back into the atmosphere all of that changes these projections that scientists are working on for what happens 50-100 even a thousand years from now it's the models they're working on
