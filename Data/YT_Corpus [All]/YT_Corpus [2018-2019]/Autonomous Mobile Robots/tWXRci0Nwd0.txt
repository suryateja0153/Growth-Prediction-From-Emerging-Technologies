 In regards to the recent Uber crash and the fatality and how it plays out with public perception, I think that it is a setback. My expertise around self-driving cars is mostly centered around a project that we're doing for the National Science Foundation right now that's looking to quantify one measure of safety, and in particular navigation safety, so how well a mobile robot -- and that could be a self-driving car or any mobile robot, really -- how well that robot knows its position, how much it trusts the sensor information to give an idea of where that robot exists in space. All these sensors, so laser rangefinders or lidar, radars, and GPS, and inertial navigation sensors, they all have noise on them and they all have faults that can occur to them. And so what we try to do is quantify how well that robot knows its pose in the presence of these potential faults. And this becomes really important not when you have a single robot wandering around a street but when you have millions of these robots then all of a sudden the possibility that these faults are going to cause an error, an error or a crash or any sort of fault, is becomes a distinct possibility. I think the the car companies and the autonomous vehicle companies, Waymo, Uber, whoever they may be, are showing that there is a strong push to get self-driving cars on the road and they're putting in a tremendous amount of resources to get this to work. From our point of view we want to make sure that this is done safely, and I think that it's important to get the technology on the road, to get it out on the road quickly, we have to ensure safety so that the public has some level of trust in these robots on the road, they have faith, they have trust that these robots are not going to injure the people inside the car or the other stakeholders who are using the space, bicyclists, pedestrians, whoever it may be. So from our point of view we are very concerned with proving that, you know, with mathematical analytical guarantees that that these robots are safe, at least in terms of localization.
