 I would like to welcome you to this special event this afternoon where I have the pleasure of welcoming professor Tom Shakespeare from the University of East Anglia who will be joined by UNSW's dr. Eduardo Benitez Sandoval and associate professor Gemma Carey to discuss the opportunities and threats of Robotics in the disability care sector I am Rosemary Kayess, I'm the interim director of the disability innovation Institute here at UNSW and I'd like to begin by acknowledging the Bidjigal people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet and pay my respects to their elders past and present and extend that respect to any Aboriginal or Torres Strait island people who are here joining us today this event is hosted by the disability innovation Institute in partnership with the UNSW Grand Challenges a grand challenge on living with 21st century technology the disability innovation Institute conducts whole of university interdisciplinary research in partnership with people with disability and I'd like to acknowledge our partners from the community sector that have joined us today it's good to see you here and hopefully this is the beginning of lots more opportunities for us to work together currently UNSW scholars are working on world-class disability applied innovative research in areas such as social robotics and artificial intelligence smart communities and environments this research has the potential to provide accessible and inclusive solutions in providing urban transport education and health and disability care services the Institute seeks to influence world disability scholarship providing thought leadership to the challenges and opportunities in the global area the UNSW grand challenge program has been established to facilitate critical discussions on the biggest issues facing humanity and in the process raise awareness of the groundbreaking research and excellent initiatives undertaken by UNSW academics staff and students we have a fantastic panel assembled for you today which will be chaired by associate professor Gemma Carey the research director for the center of social impact here at UNSW Gemma has investigative processes joining up within government and between government and non-government organisations her current research focuses on the design and implementation of the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme and the challenges of quasi markets in the area of disability in addition to her academic research she runs a Policy Forum the power to persuade which is aimed at improving the relationships between policymakers academics and the community sector I'm delighted to welcome our chair Gemma Carey and thank you to the disability innovations Institute for hosting such a great event and so when we talk about robots we tend to think about sci-fi movies and these kind of futuristic technology that doesn't exist yet and but one day maybe it will but actually robots are all around us and chances are if you used a smartphone today or your credit card a robot played a role in manufacturing one of those products and facilitated you doing this in health and social care robots and AI as well a rapidly advancing and becoming further embedded in the delivery of those services but also our day to day lives robots can make a really positive impact on the ways that we live our lives and this is no different people with a disability but this doesn't mean there isn't also the potential for harm and a whole host of ethical questions that we need to work through when we're adopting new technologies so today we're going to discuss the good and the bad of robotics and what it might mean for the disability sector broadly and then also specifically for people who have a disability so here's some introductions professor Tom Shakespeare is here from the UK I understand he's pretty well flown here twice in the last week having to turn around and go back and then come back again Tom completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge he's worked at the University of Sunderland Newcastle Leeds and University of East Anglia teaching and researching in sociology here's the author of disability rights and wrongs and co-author of the sexual politics of disability he spent five years at the WHO where he was co-author and co-editor of the world report on disability and in the UK has founded several large disability peoples organizations we also have you UNSW’s own Eduardo Benitez Sandoval he's a social robots robots researcher at UNSW and his work spans different aspects of social robots such as reciprocity and human robot interaction robots and education robots in fiction and then beyond traditional robotics and there's also growing interest and here's a growing interest in the design designing machines that are capable of meaningful social interactions with humans Eduardo's work incorporates insights from behavioral economics and social psychology in order to explore a different approach to social robots so we're going to hand first to Eduardo all right okay well thank you so much for the invitation guys I'm really glad to be here and share some thoughts about what I'm doing in my research firstly I would like to introduce this is me. Im a little bit crazy about robots since I was a kid so fiction fictional robots cuddly a bit impact in my life and that's why I'm research in this area and yeah certainly fiction has some impact in the research that I am performing here and before in other universities as belief in the University and contributing University in New Zealand the main topics as Gemma mentioned in my research are reciprocity in human robot interaction in other words how people take decisions towards robots in terms of the rationale behind these decisions but I'm moving on to another topic Ally bit more broad in social terms which I call it meaningful machines in other words I want to do robots that are not gizmos robots that are not just for sale in robots that are not for rich kids which will use it for one year or two and you know and this is one of the first traits that we can see in this area connected to this topic as well I want to investigate addiction to technology these two topics are very close each other because we need machines to have a better performance in the world generally speaking right but to what extent we can use these machines in order to avoid addiction to them and the first example that we have around is the social media right like when it's healthy users and when it the user there is a very very not well known truthful about that and besides this research that I'm developing and I still will develop in the future as designing robots so I have been involved in the design of several robots some of them low-tech some others a little more high-tech yeah this is the expertise that I can present to you guys today about what I will talk later on over the projects that we are developing in the creative robotics lab here in UNSW so in general speaking we have several types of disability and also we have several types of high tech solutions for different cognitive disabilities developmental disabilities intellectual disabilities mental and physical and sensory disabilities so there are world of products and research for disability but not necessarily all of them are the perfect solution or the the most suitable solution for for the needs of people with certain kinds of disability just to put a little bit of context this is a report of the International Federation International Federation of robotics and we can see that the numbers in terms of how many robots have been sold in the world per million in different categories we can see that medical robots have increasing numbers in the same way that a powered human exoskeletons and other professional service robots no specified about which means there is not a special category for robots in disability so I guess also it's a fierce thought that comes to my mind that probably we should create a category a special category for these kind of robotics because generally speaking in this research area we have several robots we have many robots but we need designed specifically robots for disability probably one function a one purpose for what dedicated to specific problems and for a specific people so after this context I would like to talk about what projects we have been doing the creative robotic labs this project for instance it has been performed by Scott Brown before I arrived to UNSW so he has been working with robots and artists with positive results he is using this robot and it made in UK in order to offer some therapy for autism in situations where the child may have limited social or communicative skills and was not yet ready for interaction with a human peer apparently in this in social robotics we have good results using robots for this kind of therapy I have been not involved directly with this problem but as far as I know now robots or Caspar robot have been providing these results and in terms of research probably the next step is trying to standardize and try to commercialize and try to make a district knowledge more available for the people another approach that the Scott Brown have developed and his research and his PhD is working with tangible interfaces interactive tangible interfaces this interface has worked with a small group of autistic and neurotypical children to look at how responsive environment could be used to encourage social engagement between children and their parents so in this case the approach is technology as a meal as a mediator of a human human interaction which is not necessarily social robotics but another approach that could be useful in the future let's see when Scott Brown finishes his research and present results what we can see about this addition approach and then I can talk about my own projects right so I can talk a lot a lot a lot about of them so one of the projects that I have been involved with directly is the development of our robot lifter for nurses in hospitals but thanks for the input of rosemary and other people we can think we think that we can move this project to another applications the thing is injuries work injuries in Mexico my homeland my homeland are very present in hospitals imagine 1.5 meters in nurse trying to lift a patient that is 120 kilograms right so as far as we know the reports the national report says that 48% of work injuries are back injuries so all these people require some assistance and we think that the robot lifter could be the perfect assistance because that avoids a repetitive task a task that requires a lot of physical effort and then also have an impact in financial terms for the hospital and a benefit in the health of the workers in the hospital and we choose fiercely hospitals because it's a standardized environment so hospitals have standards and they are very much the same infrastructure all around the world ideally so we think that if we can test this technology in a hospital then the next step could be probably moved the technology the social robot into the homes of people we didn't try from spheres because the technical limitations houses are a very complex environment for robots even if you use the best technology on them like a artificial vision algorithms for localization it's still a very big challenge technical challenge so but step by step we can start with with hospitals and see how we can move the robot there so in this robot we are using several or we are experimenting with several interfaces we are doing just to reading and we also are training with a new interface based in EEG electroencephalographic signals and but used it with eyes so the problem is electroencephalographic signals are very they are not reliable yet but usually blinking eyes movements in the eyes we can do a better ready reading of their assignments and we can control the robot with more accuracy another project I have very limited time to talk about the project sorry I will rush a little bit it's a conversational robot to conduct theraputic interventions for dementia and for dementia I made this project as well with a very famous Research Institute in Mexico in the north of Mexico nearby Tijuana and San Diego Colette ccsl so it's this is a chat board using a homemade robot but the chat board has other resources coming from the api's of IBM and we are developing personalized conversations in order to have our therapeutic effects in the patients yeah I can talk further about this project later and we are we have also other projects in the creative robotics lab that are not directly related with disability but they are basic science and basic research that could be used in the future like artificial sensitive skin that provides possibilities for new interfaces and reasoning about action with formal context that provides basic research for development of chat boards and all the cultural aspects of the development of robot embodiments and so on so you can see your website and you can see more information about that so close in my intervention here is an opportunity or threat in my formal point of view I can say that we have all these troubles in the world but none of them is a specifically designing for disability so probably we can put some effort on that so we can design a specific purpose robots for disability and made them available for the public however as a CDC says it's a long way to the top if you wanna develop robots for disability thank you so much thank you it's it's wonderful I love working with technologists and scientists and I want to start by saying that I think these sorts of developments this sort of research is very very exciting but you've already heard that I turn back the flight got nearly to Singapore and turn back and why was that that was because the warning light went on on the dashboard of the plane there was a problem with one of the engines they didn't know what it was they closed it down and they drove us home and so for me you know I don't know whether they have a eye on a plane sensor system but it's an indication that technology doesn't always work there may have been nothing wrong with that plane it might have got us there absolutely fine but we didn't know and that's a warning I'll tell you another story also a transport story I've been slapping around Sydney by taxi and I had a fantastic taxi driver yesterday really wonderful warm human being not Australian in origin for that sir coincidence and he was telling me about all his clients most of whom had disability and how he drove them around and he said many of them were aging and now he went to many funerals and he still saw the families of the people that he'd worked with and he waved at them in the street he said you know sometimes I know more about these people and their families themselves for example he said I had a lady she'd had a child by a French soldier many years before the family didn't know anything about this and she asked me after she died to tell the family about this half-sibling which I did and six months later he turned up but they were forewarned that he didn't the social interaction went better so we were also talking about self-driving cars and he was asking me where they thought self-driving cars would ever come to fruition these are robotics and obviously a taxi driver is quite interested in that question because it's going to do them or their subsequent generations of taxi drivers out of out of work but what I'm asking you here is would you invite a self-driving car to the funeral of your loved one would you confide in a self-driving car about your illegitimate child this gentleman was playing a social service he was a taxi driver but he was a social spiritual emotional service for the people with whom he worked let's not forget that so this is I've made a mistake on the slide this is actually CRPD article 19 the Convention on the Rights of persons with disabilities article 19 so blame jet lag but this is about the right of all disabled people to live in the community each choice is equal to others section B access to a full range of in-home residential and other community support services including personal assistance necessary to support living a nice inclusion in the community and to prevent isolation or segregation from the community so please hold on to that it doesn't mention robotics maybe we're going to have to rewrite the CRPD to include new technologies there is other space in the CRPD which does talk about technology but I want to focus on that to prevent isolation or segregation from the community that's really important so hold on to that so this a wheel of assistive technologies disabled people we use them all the time I don't want to single out rosemary but we're all you know we've got hearing aids we've got communication software we are where we love the Internet we've got wheelchairs that can do all sorts of things that you can only dream of and we are actually the cutting edge because stuff that's developed for us today will be used for the masses tomorrow and one example is audiobooks audiobooks were driven by disabled people who had visual impairment I remember back in the day my putting a tape from RNIB for my grandfather in the envelope to post back to RNIB and I remember he'd been reading or listening to Mansfield Park now everybody takes audiobooks for granted so we actually pay a really important service in the world of technology so cochlear implants screen readers magnifiers environmental controls to operate our houses mostly things that we control sometimes tracking devices for people with dementia or other cognitive impairments so you can see where they are and they can perhaps be stopped from harming themselves so these are really really important I just wanted to say one thing I learned this morning I was with a friend from the Aboriginal community and he was talking about a wonderful wonderful piece of research he's done with Aboriginal people in rural and remote areas in particular but the whole community and he was saying when he first turned up to talk to folk they didn't really want to talk to him and he didn't know why that was and the reason is is because he wears hearing aids big bulky hearing aids over his ears and they thought he was a copper because he was had some sort of communication device I didn't want to talk to a guy in a suit who came from the city wearing these communication devices he might have been a plant he might have been somebody to detect what they were up to and he had to show them take him off I'm deaf mate I need these to communicate with you at which point they welcomed him with open arms so I'm telling you that story with his permission to show that cultures react to assistive technologies in lots of different ways we cannot predict that that was a surprise to me but it was entirely sensible from the point of view of Aboriginal people in rural and remote areas for whom the police are often the enemy so we need to be sensitive to those cultural differences and sensitivities and thoughts about how things may turn out and it's about the social context in a social context actually says that what Eduardo and other people are developing fills potentially a need we are aging even Australia is aging but particularly European countries are aging now in 1995 there was a hundred and one million older people in Europe in 2050 there'll be 173 million in and in that time sorry I've got another glitch on my right thing in that time their working age population will fall by 25% so we got more older people and fewer younger people who are able to support them so that is a fact we what can we do about that well at the same time and rightly women are working more and women historically have borne the brunt of caring so there are more older people fewer younger people fewer women who are homemakers willing and able to support older people so we have a big issue and we could solve it by having more migrants we could open our arms to people and say come do this work work with us but at the same time there's a populist backlash against immigration in my country in Germany in Eastern Europe and I think in Australia also so we cannot solve this problem because we have a huge potential shortfall in carers and so we need to solve this somehow and this is a social problem and we could solve it in different ways but one of the ways this proposed as we know is robotics socially interactive robots and I have to confess I've not experienced any of these directly myself but there's the robot pepper which is I think a humanoid which is care and entertainment there's PARO which is a small robot I'll show you in a minute it's the kind of seal a cuddly seal particularly for people with dementia and the this there's been some research here and the evidence is that it improves communication improves mood reduces depression reduces loneliness so this works at least in the studies that been performed Paro works it takes the boxes it's cheeves what we'd hope you achieve and there's lots of others NeCoRo AIBO Bandit often in animal forms which is instinct let's let's go back to that i see an assistance animal in the room but you know we're going to do him out of business or her out of business and these are often about possibly these are often about mimicking social interaction they're playing the roles of the dog or the human where those might not be available and so here's a picture of PARO I think at a trade fair this is a picture of a couple of seals and you can come and Stroke and they'll do the weekly thing and what's interesting to me is that these technologies have been particularly important in Japan and I was in Japan a few years ago and I took a personal assistant this is soon after I became paralyzed and I'm just showing you this is coffee boss and he was very excited about coffee boss because the voiceover for coffee coffee boss was done by a American actor and they were pretty cool and this is a coffee dispensing machine and in Australia in England we in America and everywhere we generally have a barista producing our coffee and that's really important for us but in Japan as we know the rules of social interaction are very rigid and stressful interaction with other human beings is stressful in Japan in a way that it isn't here here you just go no worries and you're okay in Britain you say terrible weather and you're okay although people who don't know what I say now because it's sunny all the time and we're absolutely lost or we can talk about is our miserable faulty so this is coffee boss and I'm showing this because it's about the fact that these technologies have often developed in Japan where there is a culture which because of the stress of social interaction you want to interact with a machine so that's why we don't get those coffee machines in Australia and Britain because we like interacting with people it's not stressful but in Japan it's stressful and people would far rather buy their hot coffee out of a machine sir I've gone too far like this one so that's why those are prevalent there and not here and that's why I think in Japan has been a big driver of these robotics it's a place with far more older people living longer particularly in rural areas where there are very few younger people in a lot of older people fewer care workers because there's a huge hostility to immigration there are very very few immigrants in Japan so and you've got obviously a history of technological sophistication so all of those add up to a strong driver for the development of social and interactive robots so I mean that's just sort of culturally and sociologically interesting so what do we have to what do we think about all of this there isn't a lot of research and this is a really important area I'm really glad that Eduardo and others here are researching it there isn't a lot of research but what there is seems to suggest particularly in Japan that it's been so far positive but you know Paro is not going to support you live look after you it may entertain you briefly it may relieve the carer slightly but it's not the solution because they have only ever been used in the context of care relationships support relationships so it's not as if in these cases people just go and leave you you are there with your carer or support worker with this what you could call an entertaining gadget but the second point which is more important is that what people aspire to remember my taxi driver remember his clients is connection they were aspire to relationship real human relationships and it's inserted two people being companionate to sometimes challenge him conversation affection reciprocation status you know they want that equality that's what disabled people want and it's very interesting because I've done a lot of research about personal assistants human personal assistants and at the start of the disability rights movement disability community said we want tasks not emotion we want to pay somebody to do stuff for us to empower us yeah but what we found in our research is that's not true every support relationship is a relationship and the social side of it the companion side of it is just as important as getting the task done and that's why we studied how that relationship can go better and can go worse we want the worker to be happy and the disabled person to be happy and that depends on a good relationship between them so that's instructive it's not just a matter of getting tasks done um I think that you know we've got at the moment a demographic bulge we've got more old people and fewer younger people but that's gonna change it's like a sort of football or a melon going through the Python we will get I think an equalization in terms of sorry I don't know if that's me or see the gadget we will get it maybe a temporary problem we may now have a problem of a shortfall of care workers but we may not always have that problem that's one thing to bear in mind the other thing is that we are in economies which are transitioning from industrial manual production to service economy but it's also an opportunity we can retrain people we can change our workforce slowly but surely to be more appropriate for this sort of service dominated workforce we need and finally I think and this comes out of the research personal assistants I think there's an issue a problem because in order to automate something you need to basically break it down into simple tasks so when you break things down into separate tasks with simple tasks which is what you need to do to automate them you possibly are leading to a devaluing of care itself once something can be done by a robot we may not value it in the same way and so I think this is real significant what we need to be doing in today's world is to value support is to value community is to overcome individualism and yet the very simplification involved in automation may undermine that and lead us to not think that those tasks those activities those relationships are important and so I think we've got a warning there I mean it might happen the other way I don't want us I don't know it may be that if we get the robots to do the simple tasks we will free up time to do the more complex interesting tasks that might be the case but the evidence is from for example domestic technology hoover's washing machines dishwashers they were all meant to free up time but they haven't they really haven't so I think that Eduardo's right that we need to look at the social and cultural framing within which these robotics are both developed deployed used because that is up to us it's up to us to our families communities and governments and Vees of the key questions thank you very much thank you bye so you've had from Eduardo who's at the frontline of developing new technologies and robots and for disability specifically and tom has rightly pointed out that actually disability drives technological innovation for everybody else but there are also some social issues so how will the robots change the value we put on care what's gonna happen to the workforce and what do we get potentially lose when a robot comes in and does the role of a person so we're going to open up to questions but I might first give you a chance Eduardo to speak to some of the issues that Tom raised I agree with many things that are Tom said I particularly I would like to make emphasis and that robots give us the opportunity to unleash human potential people is worried about lose job positions and so on but to be honest this is not the first time in the history that that happens you know a lot of manual work a lot of repetitive world has been relegated to machines and this is not exception this is the the next revolution so I guess social technologies new interfaces social robot occurs will give us the opportunity to to be more creative to socialize whether to improve our human skills but in order that that happens we need attract more social scientists to this area we need more psychologists in this area we need more sociologists in this area because I'm to be honest I'm very skeptical with my Japanese colleagues and the results Japan is a boot camp for new technologies they have specific conditions that shape the technologies that they appeal every year there they have crazy things they're like I remember when I was there they have a mobile phone with a projector 10 years ago and it's like a why we need a mobile phone without tiny projector that projects just 12 inches right but they have and the problem what I see in my image Japanese release is that they are engineers performing social and psychological research and this is something that in the creative robotics lab we try to avoid we want people from all the disciplines contributing to this field which is fascinating you know when you put designers and sociologists and psychologists and engineers and computer scientists working together in the same physical place it's just amazing the outcomes are really really really good another point that I would like to highlight as again we have high expectations over social robots it's a no long long way in order to make them real partners real social interaction my personal experience with robots particularly with kids for instances that the robot is attractive and it's really cute and they like it for two minutes they do they lose all the interest on it and it's because the way that we designed interactions is just not about technologies how we keep the interest of the user and that so one possible solution for that is gamification as one of the things that I want to use in my future research yeah summarizing we need better research more researchers in this field in order to make shorter periods of development to have a viable technology for consumer for the final consumer customer what can I have to open up to the floor if you've got questions but our Lord why don't both or perhaps you want to ask Eduardo how you can go work in his robotics lab Graeme I obviously use a guide dog so I'm using an animal I'm desperate to get the robot to replace it and and people will say oh but isn't it lovely to have the dog well you take it out to the bathroom at 6 o'clock in the morning you feed it every day you know you groom it you do all the things that you have to do so my first question is I rather of you aware of research in that area and progress in that area and the second thing I'd like to do is challenge a couple of your assertions Tom towards the end of your presentation in terms of saying that and I agree with a lot of what you said but um in terms of saying that things like washing machines and dishwashers and stuff like that haven't haven't progressed us in terms of you know getting things done and having more time I mean I use the dishwasher and the washing machine in our house oh I know I have more time than if I had to do those tasks manually and without using them but I'm not looking for and I'm not claiming to be representative of all people with disabilities but I'm not looking for companionship from robots I'm looking for a robot that can provide me with orientation with mobility that can tell me the shops that I'm walking past in case I might want to pop in and do all of those sorts of things so it seems to me that there's a diverse range of needs and that not all of them are represented by the the the sort of sort of companionship and relationship in an in a caring situation that you talked about yeah I mean I'm sure you're right Graeme you know I did I did start by welcoming what technology could offer and as somebody who is cognitively pretty challenged the use of you know direction-finding in my car is fantastic I don't need to remember the route anymore it'll just tell me and there are many many uses of that you know online banking and all the rest of it so yeah I welcome all those things and I could imagine for a visually impaired person having something you know clipped on your ear which would say you're passing the bank you know move two steps to the left because there's a pram coming towards you or whatever it would be would be tremendously liberating and yeah I completely accept that some people are looking for companionship and some people are just looking for tasks but I still do worry that a lot of this individualizes us and so for example you know I don't go to the bank ever anymore I do it all online I never talked to the bank clerk I don't have a relationship with a bank manager and in the old days you did and maybe that was inconvenient but it was part of the pattern the sort of social capital the network of relationships that you had you know and I worry that we're going to lose something as well as gain something and I think we should be alert to what we might lose and think about ways that we might replace it it may be that I never knew it's not about banking it may be that I find connection in other ways but I can't eliminate connection from my life and we should be alert to the dangers of it in terms of task versus companion definitely we can see cultural differences between Western and Japan for instance comes to my mind are the research from Elizabeth Broadbent she has 16 Paros so her office is full of fluffy cute robots all around and she uses in restive houses and so on and the resources she percent is that the people is not very keen to use them again is this thing about a attention to the robot and interest about the robot and somebody say yeah yeah it's cute and so on but then what else can I do us and then some of the participants that are stupid robot I don't want use it but literally they say that and if you compare with the Japan results you see like oh there is something different yes different people different needs what is the right level that we can achieve in terms of design of social robots we don't know we don't know yet but maybe we can follow the example of the development of smart phones you know smart phones are not culturally adapted to each country or to each population on a special population they are just one technology our people adapt to them I'm not sure if that could happen in social robotics but maybe it's a shift that we can take try to have a platform that can do both things in the right way so it will there be a guide dog replacement in terms of robots no but I know experiments about stimuli in the optical nerves that allows to see some spots of light when with the special devices in front of connecting with the optical nerve but that works with our partial vision right you should have certain degree of vision but um in terms of a companion robot even for that north as far as I know but maybe some birthday idea to develop I guess you know evilly prototypes can be developed using these vacuum cleaners that we have at home they have reasonable good localization systems they have reasonable good in terms of adapting to the environment around them so probably is working about the interface that could be used between the user and the robot so but yeah it's good ideas probably we should try to do some prototypes some paper and thinking later associate the different concepts in Africa I see visually impaired older members of the community and they walk around with their hand they're probably grandchild or great-grandchild and obviously that is both liberating but it's also confining presumably for the great grandchild but it does also create an intergenerational relationship which might be important and valuable so I just think as Eduardo says that we need to think social sociologically and psychologically to be open to the possibilities but also to realize what what else might change as a result I have questions for the whole panel just in in thinking about the ways that that we as a culture consider the possibilities of technology and what it can do for us it's my sense that we use our existing mental models to translate what's possible and I'm interested in the idea that it's possible that robots or other forms of technology might actually be able to provide domains of support that we don't know about yet because they're not human and I wondering if other you have thought much about that this is a very interesting question that I discussed with my colleagues recently usually when we develop social robots we use the model human human interaction sometimes we use the model animal human interaction but it's less often and yeah you're totally right and our mental models are rigid so we are thinking as a humans of course we are humans but we need to explore different different approaches I reckon it's worth it it's really worth it because all the developments and artificial intelligence deep learning even embodiment of the robots we can see this sense of anthropomorphism and the development of these models the gap we see of human model and we just directly try to implement it but yeah definitely I suppose one example of that is back to mobile phones and text messaging yeah and it was I don't believe it was ever considered by developers of mobile phones that text messaging would take off and be the connective means that it is and when we get text messages or emails or these other online or mobile phone communications it's a different sort of thing as we know to a phone message or to a letter it's creating a new possibility it's creating a new demand because you know we all anybody who works has a you know an inbox full of unanswered emails so it it causes a stress it changes our working life so it's both liberating and confining in ways that we didn't conceive of we had no idea and it fulfills it sometimes that totally different role in our lives so I think you're right I think there will be unimaginable ities but also an imagined threat it's it's going to be a bit of both mainstream technology so I guess the opportunity of threat is legit or topical debates even just in anyone and so I guess that where they will like it or not the mainstream technology is progressing everyday so and talking about inclusion and disability inclusion sorry there any work in this area of pushing more user experience these people with disability in the designing of mainstream technologies I mean it's certainly the case that accessibility features and things like Microsoft and other technologies are there in ways that they've never been before so I do think I mean the notion of reasonable accommodation the notion of universal design should suggest that all of these technologies can be developed to include you know the needs of as many users as possible and by being so flexible not don't disable us but enable us we're not excluded we're included and in theory that's brilliant and it should work and often it does work but we also know that you know for example touchscreen technology has been terrible for visually impaired people so it clearly it was developed by people who didn't give him monkeys for the fact that a section of the population would never be able to use this so you know you have both very positive stories and horror stories and that's why it's really important for the voices of disabled people to be heard and there are initiatives to try and make no websites accessible or trying you know for example if you're a white-collar worker you probably recruited through an online recruitment system and we still have not solved the problem though online recruitment systems are appalling for visually impaired and people with dexterity problems you know so it's kind of a no-brainer but it's still a problem so I would say that mainstream applications have the potential to include but frequently exclude it's not that they probably don't give a monkey's it's probably they couldn't even conceive that there would be people that wouldn't be able to use touchscreens you know in their concept of the human condition of course everybody can put their finger in a screen probably you have decided right I guess I can talk just a specific level about my research field and I'm very critical about my own research field social robotics in the way that we develop research is very I can tell you with all school is I mean we research for one variable one specific group let's say you know citizens in Sydney from uni SW 50 60 120 participants just insulated in an experimental room not in the into the wild and of course that is not inclusive right it's just to cover answer about what happens in this variable under these conditions so that's why I inviting people from social science from psychology from people with other expertise to help us to perform better research because otherwise we will take longer to implement social robotics in the mainstream the I have one more point I've got to get the plug in this is what we see the Institute to him bringing people with disability into the research design phase of emerging technologies into the research and design face of emerging policy for medicines you know the whole gambit that people with disability are conceived as part of the human condition and that what what we through our knowledge exchange is developing research for the wider community that's informed by the whole community Thanks it's Mary my name is Anthony I'm from Indonesia I'm actually student school Social Sciences goodness of you so it's really interesting technology using get really helpful and to me like this power chairs been really helping me a lot in a dream I study here in Australia but I think we might have forgotten that technology for disability especially tends to be really really expensive and and not all people with disability especially those living in the global South or developing countries can access technology maybe in the future we need to think about technology that is cheap and accessible for all people with disability in the whole world to use and they can access them at an affordable price I think thank you yeah absolutely no question about it and as we develop you know for example more and more expensive I don't know the the I bought chair which can go upstairs and downstairs and raise you to eye level height and all rest of it and you think that one of these chairs cost 30,000 or 40,000 dollars and you think well you know most people in the world are living on a dollar a day or whatever it might be so this is clearly inaccessible and I think that we need to think about technologies some technologies are never going to be replicable by everybody like even with Elon Musk we're not going to go to the Moon or Mars that's a an inaccessible technology but other technical and we and back in the day they thought we'd all be living on Mars by now but other technologies do become distributed and widespread and you know in the past they thought they'd only be a need for six computers or whatever it is and now we have more power in our mobile phones and they had to send that rocket to the Mars or to the moon so we can't really predict what is gonna fly and what is not gonna fly and unit costs come down and when I work in Africa I haven't worked in Malaysia but when I work in Africa everybody all the adults I work with have a mobile phone in a smartphone and that is completely leap frogged landline technology and is a huge you know whatever it is transformational technology in Africa and I never anticipated that I certainly didn't expect it and yet here it is everybody's got a smartphone so some technologies do get out there and the question is can we make the technologies that liberate disabled people those mass transformational technologies that can really be produced at low cost and available to everybody I don't know I think it's very interesting to see how the wheelchair goes with Chinese manufacturer you know Chinese manufacturer of bicycles makes them cheap and cheap and we're trying to get wheelchair manufacturer in the same way so that instead of this wheelchair across two thousand pounds and we're trying to get wheelchairs reach across 15 bucks and let's see how that goes and if that goes well then maybe that's the precedent for the more complicated technologies that you're interested in and that we're talking about today I hope I guess one way to go and I live it by myself this situation as the hacker culture I guess we are living the democratization of Robotics nowadays students around the world even in high schools they have access to 3d printers for instance I'm just saying that is general but it's more and more more common these days and I can tell for instance when I was doing my PhD we be in the robot with a 3d printer a very basic 3d printer took months and months but it was possible and the first prototype that we did of the social interface of the robot that we are as a company in Mexico it was also made in a 3d printer of course there are limitations but you know talent s everywhere potential developers are everywhere social scientists and psychologists are everywhere is just to put the right resources in the right moment in the right place and amazing ideas spark in that field so yeah by country as a for my personal experience this hacker culture I guess it's a potential way to develop new ideas or new technologies in Kenya m-pesa the payment system on mobile phones has really let forward in ways that it wasn't possible in in the West because it filled a need and it was accessible and easy to do so I'm not I'm hopeful rather than pessimistic Karen hi I'm Karen Fisher thank you very much I really liked the way that you started with sci-fi Eduardo and so far we've mainly been talking about robotics as something out there can you each talk to us a bit more about the ethics and opportunities around robotics that have become part of our bodies so where as I'll think of my artificial hip is just part of me what happens when that becomes robotic right well not sure if I have the expertise to talk about that but you know I've used glasses right so it's given me kind of extension capability to say see the things in the right way is it supposed to see it and I did buy electronics and biomechanics when I was in the bachelors program and so on and to be honest as engineers we don't consider the ethical limits the ethical boundaries so we just do the things to see further away how long we can go what what is the limit and I have been talking with the guys in the bionics Department in UNSW we catch up in one of these Scientia events then yeah we still have this mindset we still have this mindset but um generally speaking I can say that the limits are low you know what what bylaw can be possible and why Cannot you know like I don't know I remember an experiment that I was reading a few years ago about new nebula economics people still studying the neurological process behind the decisions and they did an experiment with this magnetic resonance and in which throw up decision game decay they can influence the decision of the people stimulating certain part of the brain and that blows my mind like oh my god like what if they can do it in a small device and distance and they go to the oh and you meetings of the presidents of the world and so on and they influence the decisions that they have I don't know if it's likely I don't know if it's really possible but uh but you know there is some research about that and yeah I can say that at least my generation or well I did my education we were really not aware about these things and definitely we should be aware as you know the newer generation of scientists and researchers should be intelligence say I mean I we're influencing people's behavior all the time normally with alcohol and I suspect in many negotiations alcohol has proved a catalytic factor I don't know so I think that you have an artificial hip other people have artificial hearts and you know whether I think that we get really worried when it comes to cognitive prosthetics as it were things that change the way we think we know that there are brain implants now that help people with epilepsy I have a friend and you know he has a stimulator in his spine that stops him having neuropathic pain or another one that makes possible for him to pee normally rather than have his paralyzed sphincter that stops him peeing so you know more and more we will have these things I think they are definitely coming the question is are they under our control or are they autonomous and I think is yeah with their outlet our control we're generally happy with them and when they start becoming autonomous we get ethical problems and anxieties but it's certainly the case and I'm glad again that Eduardo stressed the social scientists and the rest of it that we need to have ethical scrutiny alongside the technological progress we've already heard engineers just see a problem and want to fix it and I'm not criticizing them that's great but that means but that means that they need to do it with us they need to do in social scientists and ethicists and also with with Poly's you know with political involvement because these are essentially political questions the one that we heard about who gets it that's a political question who funds it who pays for it who profits from it and how has it changed the way that we interact and behave in the world I mean that the enthusiasts the transhumanist feel that we're all going to be better off for it but I mean when I come to ethics I'm still reading Aristotle from thousands of years ago so I don't believe that our ethical thinking has progressed a whole lot further The interdisciplinary nature of what you’re talking about is exactly what the Disability Innovations Institute is planning to do and as you just said Tom it's not just I mean sociologists psychologists roboticists tech developers important but also what's the policy framework what's the regulatory framework we put around that that can both ensure that technology's diffuse but also a limit harms on people and wider I just wondered if you want to interest manitto to the point about autonomous technology and whether that is a long way to the top of that as well in terms of Robotics in us autonomous robots for social companion for social purposes I guess still we are very complex beings right like as a humans we have a lot of needs a lot of feelings emotions and all these considerations that it's really difficult implement in a machine you know and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence are very very good in one thing and just one thing and when you try to use the same algorithms to generalize if it's good doing other things in another field and so they just break so if you try to implement that in a machine that is capable to do things in the physical world that will be a disaster right like that you don't want autonomous robots that are not capable to do right decisions in the real world because they are present potential harm to the users so I'm always aseptically I don't want right expectations Haggar because media is very good doing that as a researchers we should be responsible of going step by step step by step little by little try an arrow try an arrow and if it's a bigger or go back and again it is what I true that I try to do in my research like try to not do over generalisations and try to be consistent and soldier than what I do I think he was in Australia that for people who are receiving state welfare benefits the a I went a little bit off the rails and sent everybody overdue or debt payment reminders and that was not under the control of humans that was on its own accord upsetting a whole lot of people and causing a lot a lot of problems so I think there is some way from the truly autonomous and we still need human oversight to make sure that it doesn't do the wrong thing and if that's the case with something as frankly simple as accounts then it must be even more the case with any of the more interesting applications we're talking about We are out of time if you can join me in thanking Tom and Eduardo and the Disability Innovation Institute and we're still looking for a robot dog Graham will tell you when we find it and I just like to thank Gemma for chairing today's session and I'd like to thank you all for attending it's um it's been a very interesting discussion and it won't be the last discussion that we have thank you very much
