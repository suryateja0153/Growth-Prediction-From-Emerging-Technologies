 this mass is about autonomous robotics the competition today we've got several teams with different turtle BOTS and so we've been tasked to explore the neighborhood and look for animals that might be in need of rescue these robots are small but they comprise the most of the sensors that actually you would see on a real self-driving car one thing I'll have to do is use the lidar which is just kind of a spinning laser on top to map its environment the robot will figure out a way to navigate kind of throughout the map without hitting anything at the same time molds building up the map it's also localizing the animals so it's using the cameras and machine learning to determine what objects are what we can figure out which ones are animals and what are trees and people we made sure that the base requirement of the project were kind of small and that everyone could tackle them but then give times the students who kind of develop their own extensions so some teens are able to react intelligently to a bicycle crossing the road some other teams will kind of be extremely efficient in the way that they'll choose which animals to go rescue of course we are not dealing with all the complexity of a theatre pairing car but the point of this class is going to show the students know about all the key technical aspects it's definitely given me a healthy dose of respect of what real autonomous cars have to do here it's funny when we mess up and like misclassify something but in a real-world situation there can't be any of these mistakes I needed this population they knew a little bit about everything before but like being able to implement it on a real robot and integrating all of these ideas putting them all together has been really fun [Applause] [Music] for more please visit us at stanford.edu
