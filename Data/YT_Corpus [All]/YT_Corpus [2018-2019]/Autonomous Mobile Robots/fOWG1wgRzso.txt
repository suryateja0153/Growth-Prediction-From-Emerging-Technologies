 THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY DURANGO PARTY RENTAL. WE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER PERFECTLY. YOU’RE WATCHING DURANGO TV NEWS. I’M WENDY GRAHAM SETTLE. HERE’S YOUR STORY FOR THE DAY. IF SAN JUAN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER EVER FOUND ITSELF AT THE EPICENTER OF A MAJOR EPIDEMIC, IT HAS A NEW, HIGH-TECH WEAPON TO BATTLE INFECTION – AND SAVE LIVES. THE HOSPITAL RECENTLY ADDED A SECOND TRU-D SMART U V C GERM-ELIMINATING DISINFECTION ROBOT TO ITS ALREADY STRINGENT LIST OF DISINFECTION PROTOCOLS TO PROTECT PATIENTS FROM HOSPITAL- BORNE INFECTIONS. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ESTIMATES THAT MORE THAN 1 POINT 7 MILLION INFECTIONS ARE ACQUIRED IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING EACH YEAR WITH MORE THAN 99 THOUSAND DEATHS OCCURRING AS A RESULT. TRU-D IS A ROBOT THAT WORKS BY GENERATING U V LIGHT ENERGY THAT MODIFIES THE D N A OR R N A STRUCTURE OF AN INFECTIOUS CELL. THE ROBOT’S SENSORS CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF UVC ENERGY NEEDED TO DISINFECT AN ENTIRE ROOM WHILE COMPENSATING FOR ROOM SIZE, SHAPE, SURFACES, AND CONTENTS. HOUSEKEEPERS ROLL THE ROBOT INTO THE ROOM, CLOSE THE DOOR, AND OPERATE THE DEADLY LIGHT DOSE BY COMPUTER. TREATMENTS LAST AS LONG AS THE ROBOT DETECTS ANY DANGEROUS MICROBES. THE GERMICIDAL LAMPS KILL DEADLY GERMS LIKE EBOLA, MRSA, AND OTHER DISEASES. THE HOSPITAL PURCHASED ITS FIRST DISINFECTING ROBOT TWO YEARS AGO, AND THEY CAN CLEAN THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL IN SEVEN DAYS. IT’S USED EVERY TIME A PATIENT IS DISCHARGED FROM A STAY AT THE HOSPITAL AS A RESULT, THEY’VE HELPED TO REDUCE HOSPITAL-BORNE INFECTIONS BY MORE THAN 30 PERCENT AMONG PATIENTS STAYING IN THE SAME ROOM. IT TAKES AWAY HUMAN ERROR. SO, AS A HOUSEKEEPER YOU COME IN AND YOU DO ALL THE HIGH TOUCH SURFACES IN A ROOM, BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS SOMETIMES ROOM FOR HUMAN ERROR IN THAT. SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT TAKES EVERYTHING. SO EVERYTHING THAT THE HOUSEKEEPER DOESN'T TOUCH, IT GETS THAT. SO IF YOU OPEN A CABINET, YOU DO THE HIGH TOUCH AREA OF THAT WHICH IS THE CABINET HANDLE, AND YOU WIPE EVERYTHING ELSE THERE, BUT SOMETIMES THE STUFF IN BETWEEN IS WHAT YOU FORGET. AND THAT’S WHAT IT DOES. IT DISINFECTS EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM. WHAT’S GOOD ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT STOPS BY ITSELF. SO, IT MEASURES IT. SO AFTER EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM HAS BEEN DISINFECTED, THAT’S WHEN IT STOPS. THAT’S THE BEAUTY OF THIS THING, IS THAT IT MEASURES IT ITSELF STAFF CALL THE ROBOTS THELMA AND LOUISE AFTER THE CHARACTERS OF THE MOVIE WITH THE SAME NAME. THEY WERE PURCHASED BY THE HOSPITAL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ARAMARK, THE CONTRACTOR THAT PROVIDES HOUSEKEEPING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER.
