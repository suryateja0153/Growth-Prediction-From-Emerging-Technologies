 This is the antique cosmo so coming in from Anki is a bit of a smart robot e-type affair it's actually a much smaller box than I have there some brass information this is a robot that interacts with you and all stuff thankfully as opposed to being a robot that doesn't do anything I thought that seems to be a bit useless he's a cute little critter that has two eyes here and can push stuff around runs around on some tracks and learns a bit from you has got some artificial intelligence and a camera in here so it can interact with you you can talk to it it'll respond and have emotional exchanges with you via its eyes okay so there's some blurb if you would care to read through that a bit like Star Wars flowing through here it obviously has an app that's are compatible with Apple Google Play and Amazon app stores will also compatible with Kindle I'm guessing it's got a Qualcomm inside it and it's quite connected voice-activated need to interact people with people help site and hangs ID and help site hopefully does the vacuuming explores the world and learns new things included in this is the vector robot a cube the charger I'm guessing the cube is a bit of a toy that it plays with much like in terrahawks so we're gonna pop it open set it in to its charger and get it going it's one of those boxes okay right yeah so la-dee-da sensible packaging we'll start with this because it's closest this is one of the blocks it looks like it takes a battery of some description and house well some stuff on it there's there's things over here I don't know what actually supposed to do but yeah okay and then under here we have a charger thing okay I'll go over something else is dead this this is him I actually thought from the imagery that he was a bit bigger but that we'll have a look around him in a second that's why we pull that out so we've got the charge bay there that he parks in a bit like a Roomba it's charged by USB okay well we've got over there I wonder if it'll do stuff eventually yeah that's a little wrong desk of foam we have an instruction manual to the side here with vector product information guide and a Quick Start Guide um the bag of silica that's it that's your lot so this is our guy there's two little pogo plugs there which obviously connect here to charge these are the trucks allow him to drive around probably I'm supposed to do that was it's he's not on that's this little face in there which and you can see the camera in below that there's a we run cut out camera and then there's this as well which he uses to pick up the block and there's speakers I think something else here and if we put that there we get a green light there's a blue light there so he's he's lacking battery power I'll leave him charging for a whiie how far and and come back to him later on and see what he's doing okay so we're pretty much charged it's green now as opposed to blue it's still flashing that charging is happening but we're gonna go ahead anyway because I'm too excited about getting this up and running okay so we have to download the app which is called vector robot from Anki Inc it's got three point three stars after 388 reviews it's a 10k downloads so I mean that's sold 10k these are people just downloading the app to be new Z vectors whom robot who's alive aware voice-enabled eager to help okay vector robot is vector right now is okay the app is a problem it crashes and phrases on maybe some lesser devices okay so some people are having problems with the app we'll see how we do let's get that installed okay so this thing has a has a personality apparently it's a wee bit coy when it first comes alive so I'm interested to see how this actually works I don't think it's gonna do tricks straight out of the box but you never know just to get people into it it might start doing that sort of thing and we're going to throw that in there as well just for giggles okay so welcome it's official let's go okay we're with UK English place vector on charger oh we have to sign up for an account we've done that so we're just collecting anonymous usage create your account yet can't keep me informed of all things Anki creating accounts activating a condom your friend is not active okay so was searching for vector and we're right beside each other so hopefully it won't take too long Dulce uses Wi-Fi so it'll obviously pass the Wi-Fi details over to the vector robot I'm I'm guessing there isn't anything I have to press on the vector it's taking his time so much so I'm getting bored bored so while not taking a very long time to do it here's some of the specification tenses and we have an HD camera an infrared a laser sensor a power button a capacitive touch sensor and beamforming for microphone array mm-hmm okay after hitting get help it decided to ask me if I can use the Bluetooth I said yes oh right yes Annie it you seven any eight new seven Kinect vector needs to pair your device via bluetooth start to start pairing place a factor on charger and then quickly click the button on top twice whoo there's a key okay we have to confirm the code GUP confirmed find networks without one oh and we're knowing all my local Wi-Fi so it's got updates today meet vector he's humping whilst doing that doing the upload I'm going to entertain you all by pulling this little piece of plastic right it led up did you enjoy it Dundee this is gonna take three minutes and 50 seconds to do that okay so we're getting to the end here and it's restarting the vector after and unloading and strolling some updates it's connecting now okay so we know I have a connection with the env thing so we're gonna try and connect to it and see what happens we've got V and we've got a V on the front so with any luck aha references vectors location city is incredibly wrong we'll change that to wonder how advanced this gets buying or not there we are at the top north join yeah right so we want to go with Celsius because it's correct inches you know no I prefer centimeters I know yes and we'll go with a 24-hour clock and continue right and let's find the cube thankfully we've already pulled the table height as I entertained you with earlier we have connected to the cloud as well and we're ready to go I believe vector is now registered to with your Anki account to connect to vector from another device done of the vector app and login using your IKEA kind okay so we hit continue vector is noise is ready we wake up laptop start and look at vector hey vector okay so it's giving us some some tips here is it too hard to interact with them come here come here okay so he will make a signed on his back lights will turn blue they're not blue while his lights are on say come here if you speak softly where is the ho Ria's the volume of your voice of your voice instead of saying a vector come here okay hey vector my name is Gareth that's right yes okay so I'm going through some of the cute the tips and tricks that's suggesting in the app hey vectors go and find your cube hey vector pick up your kids pick up your cube Hey look at that maybe it's just not on or something like that maybe I have to there's a way to turn it on there's no buttons or anything all this hey vector do wheel stand hey vector give me a fist bump hey vector give me a fist bump so looking through the application we can do a few things like we can play Bach Jack with it we can give me a fist bump there's cube tricks that I couldn't get it to do quite right away dance to the beat oh close to the edge of the table but apparently that's what they do they they explore they get to know their surroundings and things hey vector start exploring hey vector pick up your cube a vector go to sleep go to sleep and he just switches off just like that okay well there's a lot to learn here there's a lot to be going through there's all kinds of commands and things that are built into the app that we're not going to be able to get to go through right now also I'm not entirely sure how much you can bombard him with with requests and tasks because they've injected a bit of a personality he can follow up with you and things about he can become a little bit annoyed with you and I'm bit annoyed that I can't get him to pick up the cube something simple like that but we're gonna throw this out to Peter for him to review hopefully you can have more luck with it than I can obviously he's gonna try it a little more longer than two or three minutes but if you have any questions or anything you want him to look at in particular let me know in the comments box down below within reason hit that subscribe button and give us a wee thumbs up if you fancy and other than that take care
