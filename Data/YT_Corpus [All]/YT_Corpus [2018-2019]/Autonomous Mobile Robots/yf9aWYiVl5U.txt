 here's an inside secret I here at Fox Business did you know Fox visits anchors also our Hollywood stunt women on the side I'm kidding that's our own liz claman she's at the world's largest electronic gadget show it's a consumer electronics show now in Vegas she was on this virtual reality gizmo all day I needed a Dramamine to watch her I was so nervous watching her it's a virtual reality machine that makes you feel like you're in an action movie and let's get to Liz claiming she's in the middle of the action in Vegas Liz what are you trying now you know that that was not nerve-wracking something that is nerve-racking here is the the robotic influx here at CES 2018 robots are definitely taking over the people who brought you the Segway remember that well they're now bringing you a personal robot I want to introduce you to LUMO you just turned this head because it goes from being a Segway to then a little personal robot okay why do you need this well think about the different types of applications that I'm going to say hello to it right now hello LUMO housey yes I'm ready to rock and roll I'm glad you are because I'm getting pretty exhausted going over these five football fields but Lizzie this can be used in everything from factories and it can do tests for security it can test doors and do all kinds of things and repetitive tasks you can train it and customize it and it just rolls along but it could also be a Segway where you can take it go to a park for example and then it is supports very heavy because it's very heavy machinery and then you can get off and play football and it will follow you and you can put your heavy backpack on it but when we talk about things like our invisible little friends this is it Liz I'm getting a little I'm getting a little worried here there's too much robotic activity robots and artificial intelligence and I think we just need to make sure we keep our humanity but this seems to work certainly for people who want to have things that are can repeat do repetitive types of experiences but I'm going to have Alex here he's going to jump on and he's going to ride away on this this thing so go ahead and jump on it and you can show the Segway as it goes away this is called LUMO there it goes it switched around and live from CES 2018 we are signing out listing we're going to have much more tomorrow the first interview with Simon Sea guards of ARM Holdings we just talked to him he says he does not want or expect a recall on those chips that have been affected by the meltdown and Spectre problem Liz signing out thank you
