 [Music] so our aim is to design and develop intelligent and autonomous robot now we have seen how to collect the information of the environment in the help of senses with the help of cameras now this particular camera could be either the onboard camera or the overhead camera there could be multiple sensors there could be a combination of senses as well as camera and we collect information of the environment one safe collected the information of the environment now an intelligent robot should be able to take the decision as the situation demands so how do take the decision how can a robot take decision so that I am going to discuss so we are going to start with a new topic that is called the topic eight robot motion planning so in motion planning actually what we do is we try to plan the motion or try to find out the course of action while moving from an initial position to the the final position now let us concentrate let me consider that this is nothing but the tip of the manipulator so this is the initial position of the the robot and the final position is here so starting from here so it is going to reach this particular the final point through a number of intermediate points and might be there could be a few obstacle sort of thing so it will have to avoid collision with the obstacle so how to determine the course of action or the path that is the collision free path that is the task of a robot that means to perform that particular task the robots would have a proper motion planner the path planner okay now here I am just going to discuss like how to design and develop a suitable path planner or the motion planner for this particular the intelligent and autonomous robot now if you see the the robot motion planning so this robot motion planning are broadly classified into two subgroups so these are broadly classified into two subgroups so these are broadly classified into two subgroups now one is one is known as the gross motion planning or the pre space motion planning and another is your the fine motion planning or the compliant motion planning now let me let me take one example let me take one example just to find out the difference between this gross motion planning or the pre space motion planning and the fine wasn't planning so let us take one example supposing that say I have got one board something like this and on this particular board say I'll have to write say one word say I am just going to write a word say say robot I am just going to write okay now this is the black board on which I am just going to write okay with the help of a marker or a chalk now if you just give the same task to a robot to an intelligent robot that intelligent robot will first try to find out the free space on this particular the board where it can write that particular the what for example say the board could be something like this so this is here this is not the free zone so this is not the free zone so this is not the free zone okay so the board could be something like this so I am just going to so the free zone and your the dark zone sort of thing so this is actually the structure so something is written here and this part is not cleaned of this particular board so I cannot write anything on the this part where there something is written so how to write the word robot okay or the robotics now if you give this particular task to the robot the robot will first try to find out where is the free space where I can write down so this particular the word that is the robotics so all such your the latest I left right okay so first thing it will do is it will try to find out the free space so the first thing is it will try to find out the free space and one see it has got that particular free space now it is going to write down the robotics are will be written here so our o be oh t I see s so the robot is going to write down robotics on the board okay now let me repeat the past thing you'll have to find out the free space and once I've got the free space now I'll have to write this particular the word and this letter she'll have to write down and writing this particular letter on the board is not so easy particularly for the the robot because whenever I am writing this particular the letter so this particular marker is in touch with the board and there will be compliant motion that is called the compliant motion okay so this particular the marker is in touch with your the compliant motion mercury is in touch with the word there and I'll have to put some force while writing some amount of force is to be put that is called the compliant motion so here there are two types of planning one is called the pre space planning and other is called the plant wasn't planning now compliant motion planning is if you want to write down then how do how to put force how to manipulate and while writing so I am just ripping so that particular marker with the help of my finger then I am doing some sort of manipulation so that I can write down our oh and all such things okay so I have got a planning to write our I have got a planning to write oh I have got another planning to write a I have got another planning another sequence okay and those things starting from our childhood we run we we learn through a number of iteration through a lot of practice that is called the compliant motion planning and pre space motion planning the purpose of pre space motion planning is to find out the feasible and the infeasible John for example say this is an infeasible John but this part is a feasible zone where I can write down one letter okay so the purpose of pre space planning is to determine the feasible space and infeasible space but the purpose of compliant motion planning is to write that particular the letter so this is actually your this is actually a bit difficult so this compliant motion planning or this particular fine motion planning is bit difficult okay and this gross motion planning or the pre space motion planning is easy I should say and here in this particular course so I will be concentrating only on this particular the gross motion planning or the pre space motion planning but I will not be discussing the pine motion planning or the compliant motion planning because this has been kept actually beyond the scope of this particular course so I will be concentrating on this particular the the gross motion planning or the free space motion planning now this grows motion planning or the pre space motion planning can be once again subdivided into two parts one is called the manipulation problem another is called the navigation problem the moment actually I am just going to take the help of one serial manipulator just to write something on the board that is called the manipulation task or the moment I am just writing something on this particular board okay so that is nothing but the manipulation tasks and the moment that movie moving robot or the mobile robot is actually walking okay that is nothing but is your the navigation task in fact we are planning to give some practical examples of this manipulation and navigation in this particular course might be at the latter part so we are going to concentrate on this particular manipulation and navigation that means if I just want to put it in another way that a serial manipulator or a parallel manipulator solves the manipulation problem on the other hand a mobile robot it could be a will robot or a multi legged robot or a tracked vehicle tackles the the navigation problem okay and let us see how do how to proceed further with different types of the motion now this particular it shows this sketch shows actually if this is the total time for planning now the pre space motion planning takes only a small part small duration on the other hand the compliant motion planning takes the larger duration and the total time is nothing but is your the the total time for the motion planning or total task time so the total task time if I divide the pre space motion time is much smaller compared to your the compliant motion time but as I told I am just going to concentrate in this course only under the preface motion planning now this whole actually the sequence of robotic action and you will see that all such things all such modules I have already discussed okay and now I am discussing motion planning so if I complete this discussion on motion planning you will see that all such modules of robotics have been touched for example say if I just want to solve one robotic one task with the help of a robot the first thing is your the task identification so you will have to identify the task the task which is going to be tackled or shulte with the help of a robot then we go for the motion planning which I am discussing now and once that particular the motion the plan of action or the course of action has been planned we go for the kinematic analysis that I have already done already discussed then we go for the trajectory planning before the dynamics so dynamics also I have discussed the control scheme also I have discussed because you have to realize that particular the torque with the help of a motor with a suitable controller and once those things are ready now we are in a position to generate that particular the motion and this is actually insert the all the necessary modules of robotics and as I told that in this course I am just going to touch the fundamentals of all the modules okay so let us try to concentrate more on this particular the motion planning now now if you see the environment the environment could be either a structured environment there is an own environment or it could be unstructured now if the complete information of the environment is known beforehand that is called the structured environment for example say I am just going to solve a motion planning problem like this where the environment is known let me take a very simple example supposing that say I have got say x and y in Cartesian coordinate system and I have got a robot say the robot having say say two degrees of freedom very simple so this is l1 this is l2 okay so this is the length of the first link length of the second link and this is the tip of the manipulator whose coordinate is x and y supposing that I am just going to give a task that you start from here that is point s and you reach the goal that is point G okay now the tip of the manipulator is going to start from here and it is going to reach the goal and supposing that I am just going to put one condition or the constraint that the tip of the manipulator should not collide with any of the obstacle supposing that I have got one triangular obstacle I have got one circular obstacle I have got one line obstacle and these are all 2d stationary or the fixed obstacle now here the environment is known this is a structured environment okay so we know this particular the static obstacle we know their location and I know my problem that the tip of the manipulator should start from here and it will reach this particular the goal okay and this type of environment is known as the structured environment okay now if I just modify a little bit for example say if I add if I just consider that these obstacles are moving for example say this obstacle is moving in this particular direction with some speed so this is moving in this particular direction with some speed so this is moving in this particular direction or say this particular direction with some speed okay now the problem becomes difficult okay and the position of the obstacles are going to vary with time and that particular problem will become a problem of motion planning in the presence of moving obstacle so the path planning or the motion planning in the presence of the structure environment that is called the point worth problem that is called the point path problem and the motion planning in the presence of an structure environment so this is known as your dynamic motion planning problem dynamic motion planning problem or the motion planning among dynamic obstacle or dynamic environment ok so I am just going to discuss like how to tackle the problem that is your the fine first problem and your this type of dynamic motion planning problem and I am just going to discuss the working principle of a few tools the tools for motion planning and with the help of some example I am just going to explain now here the motion planning approaches if you see those are broadly classified into two subgroups now one is called actually the global approach or this is also known as act after thinking process or this is known as the offline planning okay and we have got another that is called the local approach act while thinking process or the online planning now if the environment is known if the structure environment we have then we can go for some sort of global planning global approach or offline planning okay but supposing that I have got some set of the moving obstacles in the environment the the the the environment is dynamic so here so this environment is your unstructured environment so we will have to go for the local approach or at while thinking process or online planning now let us try to explain the principle of this particular both global approach and the local approach now let us start with so this particular your the motion planning scheme now if you see the motion planning schemes those are broadly classified into two groups one is called the traditional schemes or the algorithmic approaches and we have got the non traditional schemes using the principle of the sub competing now here actually the traditional schemes are known also known as algorithmic approaches these are once again classified into two sub groups one is called the graph based techniques and we have got the analytical approaches now if you see if we compare this graph based methods and the analytical approaches the graph based method actually it was proposed fast for example the visibility graph that was proposed fast in the year nineteen hundred and sixty nine by Nielsen okay then we have got the Voronoi diagram send decomposition tangent graph accessibility graph so these are all graph based methods on the other hand actually we have got some analytical approaches for example say we have got the potential field method we have got the path velocity decomposition then we have got the incremental planning probabilistic approach then comes a relative velocity approach then reactive control scheme or behavior based robotics etcetera okay so we have got a large number of approaches large number of methods to solve this particular the motion planning problem now on the non-traditional side in fact we have got a pure approaches like the motion planning approaches using the principle of fuzzy reasoning tool using the principle of you're the neural networks using the principle of the combined neuropathy system and so on now those things actually is beyond the scope of this particular course so this will not be taught in this particular course so here actually I am just going to concentrate only on the traditional schemes or the algorithmic approaches and both the group based techniques as well as the analytical approaches we are going to discuss and we will see that how to solve that particular the fine path problem and dynamic motion planning problem now here so we are going to start with say one the grub base technique which is known as the visibility graph and this particular visibility graph as I told so this is the first approach which was proposed in the year 1969 by Nelson ok and here the principle is very simple now for simplicity we are considering that the robots are point robot so we are just going to consider the point robots okay and we are going to consider that the obstacles are obstacles are stationary that is the fixed obstacle okay now the problem scenario is very simple at this type of problem is known as the find path problem so this is known as the find path problem that means starting from an initial position so it will have to reach the goal by avoiding collision with this particular the static obstacle now let us try to see so this is the starting point for this particular point robot and for simplicity we are going to consider the point robot and this is the goal and here we have got some obstacles like your we have got the obstacle like so this is obstacle one okay here we have got say obstacle 2 and these are all 2d obstacle stationary obstacle okay so this is your another obstacle now according to this particular method so we will start from here now if there is no such obstacle so very easily you can correct this S&G by a straight line and that will be the best path or the optimal path that will be the collision free and time optimal path could be but because there is no such obstacle but due to the presence of this particular obstacle so the robot will have to find out a peaceable path so that it is not going to collide with this particular the obstacle the rule is very simple the rule is as follows it connects those made vertices of obstacle which are visible from one another now let me start from here and let me try to look towards the goal so starting from here if I look towards goal so this particular vertex is visible this is also visible this is also visible so you draw one line here you draw another line here you draw another line here now you come back here now from here you look into this so this particular vertex is visible this vertex is visible this is also visible so the visible vertex you connect by the straight line visible vertex you connect by the the straight line and similarly from here so this particular vertex is also visible but this is not visible this may not be visible this is also not visible now from here so this particular vertex is visible so this matrix is also visible similarly from here so this is also visible this is also visible but this is not visible this is also not visible this is also not visible now from here so the goal is visible then from here so this is visible so from here so this is visible from here this is visible okay now so another thing is from here so this is also visible okay and this is also visible now if I just do the numbering say it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and this is G okay so I can write down the different feasible paths for example one path could be starting from s you go to 2 you go to 2 then 2 to 8 2 to 8 then 8 to g8 to G another path could be that you start from s then you go to three so you come here then you go to six go to six and then you go to G similarly there could be many other possible combinations possible sequence okay now out of all the possible sequences you can find out the time optimal path the time of these are all collision free path and if you want to find out collision free at the same time time optimal path will have to take the help of some optimization tool but Nielsen did not use any such optimization tool he could give all such feasible paths and then he concluded that starting from is to reach this particular goal there are many such feasible collision-free paths and out of all the feasible paths the robot will have to choose one this is actually the principle of the visibility graph thank you
