 the work of making the United States Army and Marine Corps the most efficient and powerful forces in the world is quietly happening on mound Road in Warren at tar deck the target is the tank automotive research development and Engineering Center whoo that's a mouthful Terry's cutting-edge technology is born they test vehicles in extreme environmental conditions temperatures 60 below zero to the 150 degrees troops encounter in the desert a filtration lab to measure vulnerability to dust but most of the work here is on robotics so we work on several different sized robots from little ones the size of like your Roomba robotic vacuum all the way up into like the giant trucks like you'd see in a mining or in discussing robotics and the military it's an easy leap of the imagination to the robot armies of Star Wars is that where we're headed and the realm of the possible it's all out there but I don't think it's gonna be in my lifetime current military robotic applications are a little more down-to-earth primary mission for a lot of the smaller robots is for EOD or explosive ordnance disposal and for larger robot veterinary food backpacks so you might load it up with the guts acts extra one or extra fuel extra batteries so now that the soldiers are burdened with carrying all this equipment through the woods or the desert not as exciting as legions of robot soldiers but technology that saves lives everything is so automated in the vehicle I got a chance to try out a simulator where engineers refined driverless vehicle technology tackling a challenge the auto comes we don't have that luxury on the battlefield now we can't say timeout bad guys we want to go into your country map at 210 centimeter resolution and then go back and drive through it in the battle little things that you can do on the interior vehicles and ocular I mean just to save somebody a few minutes might mean the difference between life and death to somebody the students here at CCS in downtown Detroit have a clearer think outside the box and push beyond this and get as abstract as you can and then they're Oh down from there Wow these designers from CCS to come here to sit with the soldiers and they come up with the design concepts and then these design concepts then go to us engineers the soldier expresses the need the designer comes up with the concept engineer is there and they can bring in you know feasibility what this unique collaboration means most to soldiers in the field is that somebody is actually listening to their needs so they can tell that we're sincere about it we really want to make their lives better safer more efficient and and they really appreciate it a half century ago Detroit was America's arsenal of democracy it's nice to know that hasn't changed I'm Steve Garagiola local 4
