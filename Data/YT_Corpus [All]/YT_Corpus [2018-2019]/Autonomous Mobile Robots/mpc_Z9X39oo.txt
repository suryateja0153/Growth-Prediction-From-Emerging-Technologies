 Hello and welcome to the IOT Transfer Center of the Fraunhofer FOKUS! To visualize the Smart Streets project I have a sample scenario about braking events by two cars in traffic. The scenario shows a smart car with various sensors which sends the data to an IoT gateway, often a streetlamp, whenever a braking event occurs. The Gateway then evaluates the data locally and detects dangerous traffic conditions like ice on the street or the frequent crossing of pedestrians. This finding can be then forwarded to the neighboring lamps and then be used as a message sent to the dashboard of future passing drivers to be more cautious on this segment of the street. Over here you can see the video output of the front facing camera within real-time object detection overlay, so you can identify what kind of objects are on the street in the time of the braking event. Additional sensor output is shown over here - like the braking torque to dereive what kind of forces are acting on the car's body. The large amount of telemetry to be transmitted can then be overcome by the use of 5G or LiFi. The individual braking events are then anonymously aggregated inside the IoT gateway and they are also evaluated, which is shown here by the flashing of the lamp. When I jump back in an earlier segment of the recording to symbolize another car passing in the same location as the Gateway this car can now receive a message from the gate editor aggregated data as shown here by the different flashing of the light and show the driver a message on his dashboard to advise him to more attention in the next street section.
