 all right thank you very much Candace and thanks everybody online for joining us this afternoon for the opportunity to share with these phones of work that we're doing on developing various detection methods for some of the toxins that are to be by harmful algal beings and we're making an effort here to try to cross over a little bit between both marine and in fresh water systems so Tina and I are going to be doing a little bit of a tag team on this so I'm gonna get the ball rolling with a little bit of a background and refresher on harmful algal blooms I know many of you - probably familiar with them but I thought it was worthwhile to kind of step through some of the particulars here so blue and purple algal blooms were effectively aggregations are simulations of either caustic or non toxic micro or macro algae that can cause harm due to a variety of different features some of these organisms produce various toxins that can be transferred through food webs in either marine and/or freshwater systems ecosystem in many cases high biomass levels of the algae accumulate and can attenuate light and upon decay of the bloom they can also drive the dissolved oxygen levels down to like the low levels and in some cases physical effects themselves in effect the organisms things such as production of the various because substances, sharp spines, etc. the types of species that we're talking about are quite diverse and they can be vary according to the species that they occur in, in marine systems dinoflagellates and diatoms comprise the majority of the harmful algal blooms that were in a city and although there are a variety of different organisms that can be involved in freshwater systems the cyanobacteria are the primary culprits here and in the context of the toxins that we're really focused on today the toxins can actually range from these small water soluble toxins such as domoic acid and the saxitoxins all the way up to fairly large molecules such as ciguatoxins which are much more lithophilic in nature and in the case of microcystin the peptides toxin is shown here there are a variety of other toxins as well and some of them obviously yet to be discovered so still some of that that work is ongoing. In the context of the blooms again are both in the marine and freshwater systems are really controlled and affected by complex interactions between both external and internal environmental and ecological factors so some of these are shown here this is a really nice diagram that was just published by Hans Pearl in an article in Toxins. This one refers more specifically the freshwater harmful algal blooms, cyanobacterial blooms in particular but it again in the marine environment there are similar and analogous factors that control the growth the toxicity and the accumulation and ultimately what happens to these blooms as they go there their development stages so I basically a whole lecture can be given really on my delving into the details here but this could to give you again a bit more of an appreciation for all the different ways in which environmental and ecological factors can control and so the drivers for these bloom events. In the context of monitoring management research in real time in situ observations are are very key for a variety of different reasons those include the intrinsic value of such observations in the context of providing early warnings of the development and toxicity of these bloom events that helped to support some of the management decisions in some cases they can support regulatory applications that are actually mandated to ensure that water is safe for drinking and recreational activities in the case of the data that have generated through these observations one of the aims ultimately is to be able to assimilate those data or that information into the predictive models that formed the basis for HAB forecasting as well as trying to discern long-term trends in bloom activity and finally on the basically from the research perspective, a better understanding of how these different factors are actually impacting growth and toxicity allow us to identify some of these drivers and predictors that commend these factors back into some of these these predictive models so lots of reasons for as to why these new real-time and CC observations can be can be important and useful so in that context the site basically we are very interested in being able to detect both the species that cause these plumes as well as the toxins they produce and the reason for that is that toxicity of these organisms can fluctuate significantly it over a very short time period due to a variety of different environmental factors and that the bottom line here is that cell numbers high cell numbers don't always equate with high toxin levels and what we're showing you here are a couple examples one on the left-hand side from the marine environment this is the diatom pseuto-nitzchia which is the possessor of domoic acid as you can see in some cases the cell concentration and the toxin concentration tend to mirror each other but there are other cases where we can have high cell concentration in very low or no toxins present in the in the water and the same case for microcystis and the toxins that they produce, microcystin, we can have cases where those blowing up quite quite well and other cases where there's a significant disconnect between the cell concentration or the biomass in the toxin level so bottom line here again is that we really want to be able to look at the organisms as well as the toxin to be able to make better decisions based on the data that these in situ observations are providing so with with that one of the visions that we had back in the late 1990s this is some work that we initiated with or that was initiated with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute with the aim of developing autonomous and in-situ detection capabilities for HAB species and toxins and so there's a real centerpiece of this effort is an instrument called the environmental sample processor which you'll learn a lot more about over the course of our talk this afternoon and the environmental sample processor or ESP as we will refer to it the aim here was to address them some long-standing challenges that were really fundamental to being able to effectively manage and mitigate as well as understand some of these these blooms and some of them are shown here one of them is relates to the title of the boss being here the fact that we really would like to be able to autonomously sample in and process these samples actually in the environment in situ and that goes back as well to the ability to apply different molecular based technologies to actually interrogate or analyze some of these samples and on top of that that capability really needs to be able to be executed over extended deployments if you will so there are many cases for example where ships are not able to go out and sample because of rough seas days etc whereas these the subsurface autonomous capabilities are actually they're always on they're always doing their the job during a deployment not necessarily weather dependent and finally being able to provide tools to visualize data that actually support decisions being made by by resource managers so with that we'll get into the on the actual technology that we're going to be talking about today so the ESP basically when you can't actually be there the environmental sample processors the first and second generation are shown here on the left the first generation is the kind of history at this point but I put that up there just as a point of reference the second generation ESP at the bottom left is what we'll be focusing a lot of our attention today and then on moving forward, actually imparting some mobility to these capabilities with a smart short-range autonomous underwater vehicle and then finally, converting a second-generation instrument into the third-generation instrument on a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle so that's kind of the flow that we're going to be going through today so what I'd like to do is just kind of kick off here now with the second-generation instrument and give you a little bit of an idea of what the technology actually does during a deployment so it's actually in most cases the the ESP is deployed on a fixed location marine, this picture shows the the ESP is contained in a pressure housing the orange box at the bottom are the batteries that power the instrument and at the top here is the surface expression that actually transmits the data that are generated in the ESP so this is a little video hopefully it comes across ok, Candice said there is a little bit of a jitteriness to it, but let's go through it anyway here so the instrument as its deployed actually is able to acquire a water sample that can be anywhere from milliliters up to liters and that water is actually passed through a filter contained in this little this will posterior colic and we are doing that in order to capture the particles are in the water so those would be the algal cells that were interested in and then we expose its some chemicals to light those cells and release the targets that were trying to analyze those might be in nucleic acids they could be toxins among other things and so once the sample is acquired, it's applied to an array which is basically how we're running our molecular based analyses and all these different color solutions that you saw flowing over that are basically what we'd do on a laboratory bench to conduct these molecular based tests and we'll hear more about those as we move forward. Once the test is completed, and image is taken and each of these little spots on here represent either an organism or a toxin in our case that are quantified and those data are then transmitted to ship or shore and then we can access them in effectively real time. So that gives you a little bit of idea about the technology Ok, so Iwanted to go through more of the specifics of the sensor that we are responsible for and is put on the 2GESP. DNA's there are several different applications going on the ESP there's a real proper cases of DNA probe array so you can detect algae, bacteria, invertebrates, through  DNA probes in a film with carbon-based informant where we sort of come in here in the second step the real-time applications cELIZA's for phycotoxins um as well this instrument is capable of archiving samples for whole cell microscopy looking at gene libraries of phycotoxins and also has some of them are equipped with a real time quantitative PCR to look for various target genes use right now mostly for bacteria this the capability the DSP also include two-way communication and I'm gonna expand on this a little bit this is pretty important if we're out in the water and we see a sample that may be building beyond our upper limit of quantitation for one sample we are able to actually relay that information to the lab that has deployed the ESP and they are able to change say the volume of the next sample or if we want to change the timing of the sample, if we originally planned to do samples every other day but then were really seeing some bloom activity you can actually change those samples to be every day every hour so you can change as you go into into different things and you're able to see they communicate with the ESP no matter where you are right now so the ESP was originally designed by and embarri that we've talked about before was right now if they're actually manufactured commercially by MCLane Research Laboratory so um we have developed array based ELIASs for several toxins on board these instruments so basically the instrument is able to do what you put on it, so our sensor is basically a data generating aspect of the ESP to generate data on toxins. It's a competitive ELISA membrane-based format and what I have here is a picture of our protein spotter right here and we are spotting these array with a toxin conjugate and we have controls there in the white those are just to make sure our chemistry is working and then we have five rows and toxin OVA plus on BFA this is just a generic one because we've developed several just to kind of tell you how to serve you use an antibody either monoclonal or polyclonal the dependent and what aspects of those toxins and it's selected those antibodies is selected based on their affinity and their cross-reactivity to the various congeners used. This is a picture of what our array looks like when it's developed so these seven spots here are control spots and makes you always light up and remember this is a competitive Eliza what that means is when there's very low toxins, we'll get a bright signal and when there's high toxins, you'll in a very low to no signal. If we have very high toxin it's going to be off of our curve and we will actually get it a black signal and then we'll call them rescue it. This is kind of just to go smoothly competitive horizon and what that was that again it shows our spotter and what we thought are these plots right here is it is a toxin protein conjugates on board the membrane and during the assay that is completed with toxin in the samples shown by the blue triangle and unknown quantity of antibodies and after that competition occurs the excess antibody toxin is washed away and that thought that antibody that was free and not bound to toxin sample is then bound to the toxin that is immobilized. You then get back with a secondary antibody that is designed through that primary antibody and it has dual substrate and that takes substrate and make light this is a luminescent reaction and we get that same thing I showed previously this kind of luminescence. And we get a the signal, it takes about one hour on board this is just one example of the toxins that we work with , semoic acid, just to show you a curve and have about 11 points curve here, and this is particulate DNA because we're filtering the sample, so we're getting just getting particulate. The alert level is about 200 ng/L. and our lower limit of detection is 2.6, the lower limit of quantification about five ng/L so we are well within the alert level that we're looking for for detection and quantification for in water this is based on a 1 liter sample if you are able to get a larger sample you're going to basically to make it more if you're going to lower that detection limit make it more sensitive and if you have a situation where you have a lot of particulate in A sample you may have to take a smaller sample and that's ok there's plenty of room to work towards with that. So what I wanted to do here is discuss some of the ways that we disseminate data how you through the data and other data that's available on the ESP this is an example of a web portal designed by Monterey Bay Marine Research Institute for these What we have here is each deployment has its own name so here's what an example from the ecoHAB deployment and then each ESP itself is given a name so these ESPs are onboard multi-function moorings and there's a lot of contextual data that goes along with the toxin data so you can look at light, temperature, depth, chlorophyll dissolved oxygen communities humidity, in addition to the informational species and toxin that we provide them so this is an example just from a desk reporting from the CTD on ESPbruce (ones that have been deployed off the coast of California) And then it also has a situation where you can click on the add new and/or da image to display that image so that you can see what that image looks like. Another thing that we have is a flat map that can be you can get from the desktop or the smartphone application this provides an ability to have 24/7 communication at the team before during and after deployment so sometimes get information about the deployment didn't happen today if the deployment out in California and we are in South Carolina this is good information what we weren't able to drop the ESP today we have some bad winds, that kind of thing so you can get back to communication as well as the data so you can get real access to the images as they come and we can know when an image has been taken right from the phone here in South Carolina no matter where the ESP is. We have many HAB related applications in the unit we've had many deployments off the coast of California and Monterey Bay and Southern California mostly and many in the Gulf of Maine. These are the first two that we have been working on this one the first one was develop acid this one is a of peacocking we have also had several deployments off the Washington Coast. So are so far off the domoic acid and three deployments using our microcystis censor in Lake Erie this is our newest area of the deplooyment. Well we're going to focus right now on the Washington Coast, so this is kind of give you an idea of what's going on with sitting in chalices the positive organisms is presumed to be or theorized to be here in the Juan de Fuca Eddy because the cells are offshore and this kind of gives you an idea of the different things that can occur to be cells in good weather they can move down the coast but with some big storms they can move inland and so this star right here the pink star shows where ESP Friday is located and so if we're detecting ballast here you can give an early warning to managers along here that have had some aquaculture is going on so they can get an early warning The idea is that this type of the bank is another area of cell development and eventually it would be good to have two ESPs at one time, one Juan de Fuca eddy and on eat the tip of the bay so we can have some determination of their cells ability in different times and different weather conditions. This is a picture of what the mooring looks like in this situation so off the coast we have here it's encased in that synthetic form coast and this is what Brent had said is given the communication to that pal ability basically the human communications on shore and so it's a little bit under the wave action getting the sample here and then here is a MacLean profile and that's giving you all that information the other contextual information but what's important to note is that these moorings are different for every deployment it really depends on where you want that ESP to sit. Together together with floral lab there was a specific mooring design for Lake Erie for example because in that case the mooring is actually laying right on the ground and Lake Eerie is relatively shallow so a different mooring was designed for damages and the Gulf of Maine on the ESP foot deeper because the wave action is very strong so every situation of ESP deployment needs to be looked at to see what kind of differences you need to make in the mooring to make sure that it sends your environment. This is another example of our data dissemination on to managers that are interested in the toxin data this was part of the Manning Northwest Association and network ocean observing system this is what their system looks like, their product. And if you're looking for the data is right under the real time HABs. One of their products we don't find that and when you click on real time HAB this are just real sondes. But the real time HABs you can get species abundance and these arrays are the DNA base arrays that I talked about these are gonna die and body and then the toxin array here of the demoic acid. So if you're interested in what's going on with your population for example you could click on there and you would get this screen and this screen is going to tell you abundance of cells and this is going to tell you dates and then you're also going to get information about is it quantifiable, is it lower than that is it the lower level quantification or above the upper level of quantification. So if you look at the domoic acid this is for two different deployments and I just kind of wanted to show both of them so you can get as much or little information in the screen so that you can sort of focus in and out but this gives you an idea to highlight when the point you're looking for you can get a toxin nanogram per liter the date and the time of that sample and there's a good explanation below about what these numbers mean and if it's quantifiable or if it's between the detection and quantification or the lower limit of detection of the toxin. The next screen just kinda is that second deployment be kind of stood out to you to see it in a little more detail and you can see that we had a juvenile toxin in certain cases but this is the same deployment and they didn't necessarily have the cell available to qualifying so there to kind of give you an example of how to look for this data the interesting thing that I think cities here in South Carolina is that these come in for us at about 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and I'm able to go ahead it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to and quantify these images and I'm able to go right on to this manage site and put the data in real time so that those managers can get the data as soon as possible. This is another example of how our data is  used; this is the Pacific Northwest HAB bulletin. NOAA life is focusing on transition of forecast to operational status and so our data and eat right here in the bulletin here's the ESP offshore toxicity so that our for our data is able to be used in the forecast bulletins to be used for management purposes right now our data is also being used for a toxicity forecast in Lake Erie I'm gonna now turn it back to Greg. great thank youTina. Good to be back. Okay so at this point what I'm what I want to do is Tina has provided a really nice summary and description of our 2g ESP capabilities and applications and as I said that's really at this point in time more the the centerpiece of what we're doing however we're also moving towards trying to enhance the capability of our autonomous in-situ observations. So one of the things that you can imagine is the fact that these harmful algal blooms, they change continuously over both time and space and so with the deployment of the 2G ESP on six location mooring some of the limitations are quite obvious there and the fact that some of these boom populations are moving around and there's clearly a benefit to being able to actually track and intelligently and adaptively sample those bloom populations and so with that in mind our collaborators at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has developed a strategy and this is actually done several years ago this controlled agile novel observing Network cannons as the acronym here to be able to actually deploy multiple platforms to actually track and sample harmful algal bloom populations. So in the first instance basically we want to try to I you know find locate and identify the population that we want to sample and that can be done using a combination of platforms satellite imagery could also be autonomous underwater vehicles etc so once we've actually settled on a patch that we are interested in This red area here is the  a high chlorophyll area in particular we can deploy a long range upon the underwater vehicle to actually generate maps to system map and track that that bloom population and once we're able to figure out exactly sort of the configuration of that population we can then deploy a more targeted and intelligent means of sampling that population and that's shown here this is a short-range autonomous underwater vehicle called the Dorado actually has these they're they're effectively big two liter syringes that can acquire a sample at a very specific location within that bloom and this this AUV is actually able to target very specifically maximum chlorophyll levels and actually acquire those samples pulling into those the gulpers as they're called and then return those samples to the laboratory for analysis so unlike the 2g ESP the analysis is not actually taking place onboard the AUV and I would say yes as we will see when we get to the this gives you a little bit of an idea it's sort of what's going on there was I we can actually pick up a water mass and follow it with a drifter and then drop off this long-range vehicle start mapping and then drop in the short-range vehicle and these vehicles can actually communicate with each other one telling the other where to go to pain the kind of samples that that were interested in and so that can continue until the end of the mission and those samples then returned to the laboratory for analysis and in terms of the types of data that that we can acquire using this approach we basically can generate a three-dimensional picture over time of this bloom population and that's what's shown here would be these are the AED tracts basically you're seeing here but the important point to note here is that where each of these samples are taken by the the instrument by the AUV and cell concentration and toxin concentration are determined we're then have an ability to actually assess the toxicity of those cells or the toxicity of the bloom and layered in on top of that with all those contextual data that the AUV is picking up as well we can start to try to get an understanding of the factors that may be causing an increase in toxicity or conversely it deeply so I would encourage you go to the paper that cited here if you want to see a little bit more information on this particular technology and how to use this is actually data from the Monterey Bay Area so at this point now we've gone through the 2g instrument that's normally deployed on a fixed location mooring it has been deployed on a drifter also can be deployed on piers etc but the bottom line is the does not have much in the way of mobility we now have capabilities with the algorithms that are programmed into this system to actually track and intelligently sample the bloom population so the obvious next step is to combine these three capabilities and that's in fact what we've done with the third-generation ESP that is mounted on a integrated into a long-range upon an autonomous underwater vehicle so we have the benefit of both the ESP and the ability to actually acquire process and analyze samples and coupled with the mobility and the smart so to speak of the of that short-range vehicle and we can we can add on to that a variety of different analytical capabilities so what I'd like to be now just kind of briefly run through that 3G system just so you have an idea of what it entails so this is the long-range autonomous underwater vehicle on the 2G ESP is basically been completely re-engineered and reconfigured and this is largely the work of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute folks we've been participated somewhat in some of the the analytical module design and that's integrated into the AUV at this location so this would be where the ESP sits in the AUD and this really does in fact represent the first mobile long-range capability for in-situ autonomous capability for detecting and measuring HAB species and toxins along with the ability to intelligently track and sample these features so the the actual ESP part of this is it is actually completely re-engineered as I mentioned so instead of the on the puck in the the samples array that you was being on the the 2g instrument this little guy here is where all of the sample processing takes place is the completely self-contained sample struck cartridge so the filter is actually located in here and all the reagents that are needed to process that sample are located in these little syringe barrels and each of these carcasses is loaded into a lot like fins on a wheel here on this so these are all these cartridges here total of sixty cartridges can be can be loaded onto the instrument further the analytical capabilities in this case we've used these little miniaturised sensor chips that we they actually take the place of the arrays that Tina was describing to you but a lot of the chemistry is is very same very much the same so but I'm not going to go into detail at this point the other part of this is that the results just like the 2G instrument are transmitted and effectively in real-time which is critical for certainly for management decision and this instrument has been deployed in a marine environment in Monterey Bay and we have plans to display that Lake Erie this coming fall for detection of microcystin. The other big plus was distance idea is it's very easy to deploy as you can see here you basically just slap it on a zodiac pick it up and just slip it into the water and also very easily recoverable as well and I wanted to just show you one of the data sets that we generated here the instruments basically being deployed here it goes down kind of like a yo-yo boom here comes back up it's actually detecting the the chlorophyll maximum here but when it comes down here it actually knows where it is we'll come back and relocate that and hone in on it and it can float basically within that chlorophyll maximum can resurface send the the data, transmit data come back relocate and then continue on and sample above or below that maximum and in this case here we actually executed a sampling and lysis of that sample in an analysis for the detection of domoic acid and that actually represented that it was really the first time that that's been actually executed on an autonomous underwater vehicle actually in situ and again our aim is in the freshwater environment is to be able to do this for microcystin in Lake Eerie our plans are for late summer in Western Lake Erie to actually do that so winding down here I wanted to finish up by talking a little bit about the emerging role of learning systems and also the observing technology that we've been discussing today in detection and forecasting of the HABs this is good just gives you an idea of how complex if you're trying to set up some of these high level observing Network what it looks like when you're actually looking at ship tracks tracks of autonomous underwater vehicles and gliders etc it's a pretty significant undertaking so that's one of the big challenges depending on how complex you want to get planning for all those assets the deployment an important coordination between those aspects is also a big challenge the other part of this is also being able to handle the data that are generated there's a tremendous amount of data that come out of all these these different assets and those need to be dealt with appropriately if you're going to make the use out of those and one of the things that were really focused on again apart from these large-scale networks even the deployment of some of these like for example a 3g instrument being able and a 2g instrument for that matter being able to generate new real-time in-situ data that can be assimilated into predictive models for supported forecasting and what I wanted to do was show you an example of what we're actually trying to do in Lake Erie then in collaboration with NOAA's Great Lakes environmental research laboratory and their Recon network this is real time coastal observing Network and they have a variety of stations that they routinely sample and generate a lot of contextual information so what we're trying to do is take advantages of that and leverage that that network infrastructure for locating the platforms that we want to deploy and in this case this is actually the 2G ESP on a LAN or Tina was mentioning the different types of configurations depending on where we deploy and in this case this system actually sits on the bottom in Western Lake Erie near the Toledo water intake and we're actually able to sample at the depth of the instrument as well as at the surface so we get a little bit of a picture of what's going on in the view of the entire water column and again what we're able to do by integrating these these real-time data that are being generated at these fixed locations with again more physical chemical types of sensors we can integrate that with the measurements that we're making on the cells and toxins using the ESP technology and as a result of what we can generate are intrinsically valuable data that this provides early warning of HAB events and specifically increases in toxicity as well as again when you combine in the contextual data you start to be able to develop an understanding of how the environments changing relative to the toxicity and the growth of the and again that falls back into being able to develop better predictive models and ultimately this is the for us in NOAA we are very interested in trying to develop and operationalize on these forecasts for harmful algal blooms and we have done that. NOAA has operational forecasts on going in the Gulf of Mexico for blooms caused by the dinoflagellate community and last year on the Lake Erie harmful algal bloom bulletin shown here went operational sent experimental for a number of years last year was the first year following the transition to operations and so these prices of data and information provides really of the aim is to provide user-friendly tools and accurate forecast to the resource managers in order to support finally decision making and that's really critical for us being able to provide accurate information again out ahead of when certain impact might be expected to occur and from the ESP standpoint well we are really excited about with this is being able to generate again near real-time data on changes in the toxicity of those blooms so what you're looking at here are satellite data that are giving you an idea for the biomass of the blooms but as we saw from that one data set I showed at the outset just because we have a lot of biomass doesn't necessarily mean we have a lot of toxin associated with that and so that for a water plant managers is better those types of data are critical and really important to have especially given the fact that they that can change over fairly short time intervals. So to finish up here just to give you a little bit of an insight of where our thinking is and planning is that at this point what we're trying to do now and again this was really demonstrated by the the re-engineering of the 2G technology into the 3G instruments that are now deployable much more easily on the autonomous underwater vehicles we're continuing to try to actually improve the focus on the smaller better faster cheaper mantra and continuing to modify some of the sensors that were deploying on for example the AUV that is R&D work that that's currently ongoing in collaboration with anbari and some also some industry partners what we had ultimately like to be able to do to develop so-called plug-and-play modular sampling and analytical modules what this really translates into this technology should be usable by a number of different sectors in analyzing as detecting and monitoring and measuring different targets harmful algal blooms species and toxins are only one example of things in the water that we might want to be able to measure in real time and do autonomously things like you know pathogens other water quality indicators and again a whole variety of different chemical contaminants etcetera those are all within the grasp of this technology and again me being able to operationalize this is also important. Tina mentioned the 2G implement is now commercially available the 3g instrument is not there yet presumably it will be a boy and those capabilities of the distension should hopefully allow others to take advantage of that technology to focus in on some of the targets that they might be interested for their particular application so with that what I'd like to do and whip is acknowledge our collaborators this video are a team of in Monterey California and Tina appear at our improv laboratory lots and lots of support from various agencies to basically fund the development of this and again get the I the idea again this technology the development started back in the in the late 90s and is still continuing to evolve at this point and again a long-term effort in a lot of funny agencies that contributed to that that after they some of them are here so with that I think we're about ten to ten minutes left for questions
