 robotics is special at Sam Houston high school an understanding of robotics will help students to gain jobs as engineering technicians our students walk out of here with certifications in CAD modeling systems which stands for computer aided design and they are able to go out into the workforce and make fifteen to twenty dollars an hour straight out of high school the FIRST Robotics Competition has a key term and that's called coopertition so we have to cooperate with an alliance of two other robotics teams and compete against an alliance of three other robotics teams we do ten rounds of competition and every round our students must promote what our robot can do see how we can work together and here's how we will win our match the robotics competition this year is a UIL base so that means that students can earn a letterman jacket for participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition however that also means that we will compete at the Alamo Regional and another place somewhere in Texas so that requires food and lodging for the students and travel and so it's a little bit more of a task to raise the money for competition and that's where you come in these students are ready to compete and ready to bring on the bright future ahead and they're calling on their community now to assemble the cash to support the cause if you'd like to support you could send a check to Sam Houston high school made out to the Sam Houston robotics team reporting from the city's east side jon coker Ken's 5 Eyewitness News and we caught it
