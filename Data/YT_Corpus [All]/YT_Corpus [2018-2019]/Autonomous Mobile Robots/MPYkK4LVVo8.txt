 [Music] robots spam every industry automotive industrial and consumer electronics robots provide a difficult challenge to the engineers who design them to build a system that is at the intersection of electrical mechanical and computer science disciplines a strong understanding of electrical engineering including software and hardware design power constraints and wireless communication along with mechanical engineering is critical to unlocking the potential of robotics we call it systems thinking it's the reality of how today's technologies are designed and built while the industry seeks engineers with systems knowledge structured curriculum has not been available to university academia to assist in teaching across engineering disciplines meet the ti robotics system learning kit or ti r SL k an education solution from Texas Instruments to teach systems design using a low-cost robot kit based on TI's industry-leading use simple link msp430 to MCU launch pad development kit students will discover the role of each hardware component included within the TI r SL k they will write code and then learn to integrate with hardware finishing with their own fully functioning robotic system that can complete challenges and even compete against other TI r SL k robots the TI r SL k comes with 20 educational modules each complete with lecture videos and slides lab documentation and demonstrations quizzes and classroom activities for the robotics kit the kit and curriculum is fully customizable and comprehensive hands-on and interactive and focused on the entire system students will learn build and compete with the TIR SLK all while developing the valuable systems thinking they'll need to engineer their future in any industry with a foundation built on systems thinking students can become better engineers and able to build the next frontier of smart robots and systems so let's work together to discover the technology of tomorrow and change the world today
