 carbon nanotubes chemistry involves chemical reactions which are used to modify the properties of carbon nanotubes CNTs CNTs can be functionalized to attain desired properties that can be used in a wide variety of applications the two main methods of CNT functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications because of their hydrophobic nature CNTs tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts the resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite the surface of CNTs can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment topic covalent modification covalent modification attaches a functional group on to the carbon nanotube the functional groups can be attached on to the sidewall or ends of the carbon nanotube the end caps of the carbon nanotubes have the highest reactivity due to its higher pyramid ization angle and the walls of the carbon nanotubes have lower pyramid ization angles which has lower reactivity although covalent modifications are very stable the bonding process disrupts the sp2 hybridization of the carbon atoms because a sigma bond has formed the disruption of the extended sp2 hybridization typically decreases the conductance of the carbon nanotubes topic oxidation the purification and oxidation of carbon nanotubes CNTs has been well represented in literature these processes were essential for low-yield production of carbon nanotubes where carbon particles amorphous carbon particles and coatings comprised a significant percentage of the overall material and are still important for the introduction of surface functional groups during acid oxidation the carbon carbon bonded network of the graphic layers is broken allowing the introduction of oxygen units in the form of carboxyl phenolic and lactone groups which have been extensively exploited for further chemical functionalisation first studies on oxidation of carbon nanotubes involved a gas phase reactions with nitric acid vapor in air which indiscriminately functionalized the carbon nanotubes with carboxylic carbonyl or hydroxyl groups in liquid phase reactions carbon nanotubes were treated with oxidizing solutions of nitric acid or a combination of nitric and sulfuric acid to the same effect however over oxidation may occur causing the carbon nanotube to break up into fragments which are known as carbonaceous fragments Shing at all revealed sonication assisted oxidation with sulfuric and nitric acid of carbon nanotubes and produced carbonyl and carboxyl groups after the oxidation reaction in acidic solution treatment with hydrogen peroxide limited the damage on the carbon nanotube network single walled carbon nanotubes can be shortened in a scalable manner using Oleum 100% h2 so4 with 3% so3 and nitric acid the nitric acid cuts carbon nanotubes while the Oleum creates a channel in one type of chemical modification an Elena's oxidized to a diazonium intermediate after expulsion of nitrogen it forms a covalent bond as a narrow radical topic esterification am edition carboxylic groups are used as the precursor for most esterification and emendation reactions the carboxylic group is converted into an acyl chloride with the use of thionyl or oxalic or IDE which is then reacted with the desired amide amine or alcohol carbon nanotubes have been deposited on with silver nanoparticles with the aid of emanation reactions amide function alized carbon nanotubes have been shown to chelate silver nanoparticles carbon nanotubes modified with acyl chloride react readily with highly branched molecules such as poly the middie amine which acts as a template for silver ion and later being reduced by formaldehyde amino modified carbon nanotubes can be prepared by reacting ethylenediamine with an acyl chloride functionalized carbon nanotubes topic halogenation reactions carbon nanotubes can be treated with peroxy trifluoroacetic acid to give mainly carboxylic acid and trifluoroacetic functional groups the fluorinated carbon nanotubes through substitution can be further functionalized with urea guanidine thiourea and aminosilane using the Hunts Dieker reaction carbon nanotubes treated with nitric acid can react with iodine so benzene diacetate to iodate carbon nanotubes topic cycloaddition also known our protocols for cyclo additions such as diels-alder reactions 1 3 dipolar cycloadditions of azimeth eeny ylides and azide alkyne cycloaddition reactions one example as a DEA reaction assisted by chromium hexacarbonyl and high-pressure the ID IG ratio for reaction with Dana chefs Keys Dean as 2.6 the most well known 1 3 cycloaddition reaction involves as the methane elides reacting with carbon nanotubes which are of great interest the addition of the parotid and ring can lead to a variety of functional groups such as second generation poly emitter amine dendrimers phthalocyanine add-ins for fluoro alkyl silane groups and amino ethyle een glycol groups the deal cyclo addition reaction can occur especially on fluorinated carbon nanotubes they are known to undergo Diels alder reactions with Dinah's such as 2-3 dimethyl 1 3 butadiene anthracene and 2 TR IM e th yl s IL o XY l 1 3 butadiene topic radical edition the modification of carbon nanotubes with aryl diazonium salts was studied first by tor at all due to the harsh conditions needed for the in situ generated diazonium compound other methods have been explored Stephenson at all reported using aniline derivatives with sodium nitrite in 96% sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate price at all demonstrated that stirring carbon nanotubes in water and treating with anna liens and oxidizing agents proved to be a milder reaction the diazonium chemistry functionalized carbon nanotubes which was used as a precursor to further modifications suzuki and heck coupling reactions were performed on iota phenol functionalized carbon nanotubes wang at all demonstrated mild photochemical reactions to silyl 8 the carbon nanotubes with try meth excessive lane and hexaphenylethane topic nucleophilic addition Hirsch at all conducted nucleophilic additions with organolithium and organo magnesium compounds onto carbon nanotubes with further oxidation in air they were able to create alkyl modified carbon nanotubes Hirsch was also able to show the nucleophilic addition of amines by generating lithium amides leading to Amino modified carbon nanotubes topic electrophilic addition nanotubes can also be alkylated with alkyl halides using lithium or sodium metal and liquid ammonia birch reduction conditions the initial nanotube salt can function as an polymerization initiator and can react with peroxides to form alkoxy functionalized nanotubes the alkyl and hydroxyl modification of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated with the electrophilic addition of alkyl halides by microwave irradiation testing yet all modified carbon nanotubes with amino groups by deprotonating with butyl lithium and reacting with amino substitution Balaban at all applied friedel-crafts acylation to carbon nanotubes with nitro benzene at 180 degrees Celsius along with aluminum chloride topic non covalent modifications non covalent modifications utilize Van der Waals forces and pi PI interactions by adsorption of poly nuclear aromatic compounds surfactants polymers or biomolecules non covalent modifications do not disrupt the natural configuration of carbon nanotubes with the cost of chemical stability and is prone to phase separation dissociation in between two phases in the solid state topic poly nuclear aromatic compounds some common poly nuclear aromatic compounds that are functionalized with hydrophilic or hydrophobic moieties are used to solubilize carbon nanotubes into organic or aqueous solvents some of these amplifiers are phenyl naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and porphyrin systems the greater pi pi stacking of aromatic amphiphiles such as pyrene amphiphiles had the best solubility compared to phenol amphiphiles with the worst pi PI stacking lead to more solubility in water these aromatic systems can be modified with amino and carboxylic acid groups prior to functionalizing the carbon nanotubes topic biomolecules the interaction between carbon nanotubes and biomolecules has been widely studied because of their potential to be used in biological applications the modification of the carbon nanotubes with proteins carbohydrates and nucleic acids are built with the bottom-up technique proteins have high affinity to carbon nanotubes due to their diversity of amino acids being hydrophobic or hydrophilic polysaccharides have been successfully been used to modify carbon nanotubes forming stable hybrids to make carbon nanotubes soluble in water phospholipids such as licenser office Philippa DES have been used the single phospholipid tail wraps around the carbon nanotube but the double tailed phospholipids did not have the same ability topic pi PI stacking and electrostatic interactions molecules that have by functionality are used to modify the carbon nanotubes one end of the molecule are poly aromatic compounds that interact with the carbon nanotube through pi pi stacking the other end of the same molecule has a functional group such as amino carboxyl or Theal for example pyrene derivatives and arrow thiols were used as the linkers for various metal nano beads such as gold silver and platinum
