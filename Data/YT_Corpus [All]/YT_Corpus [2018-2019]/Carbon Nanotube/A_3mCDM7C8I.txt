 humans are smart right we know this I think I'm smart you probably think you're smart but even with all of our brainpower our technology and our inspiration we still fail where nature succeeds I have questions about it [Music] limpets err won't they're gross limpets are really gross but their teeth are one of the strongest things known to humankind limpets live underwater and they scrape their teeth on rocks all day trying to get food and they come out the other side just fine seriously they're super duper strong spider silk of the Darwin's bark spider is ten times stronger than Kevlar nature makes some incredible stuff of course we humans have created super cool stuff too like graphene a one atom thick sheet of carbon atoms that's super light biodegradable electrically capacitive and when rolled into a tube it's a super-strong fiber and it's just one of the strongest things known in the world no big except that we can't make graphene into anything we can barely create it in bulk spiders literally produce silk constantly out of their bums I mean literally out of their bumps I know commenters go ahead comment it's fine it's actually good for the video comment go away go go go go so until we figure out how to grow Tobey Maguire's gross Peter Parker glands and that was bad serious spider-man it just was bad we have to figure out something else right and this is where we turn to what I'm gonna call Mad Science sometimes a scientist does something and you're just like haha that worked but some Italian scientists literally went outside grab some common cellar spiders aka daddy longlegs aka skull spiders their scientific name is velocity spiders and they're on every continent except Antarctica they're super common their webs are not actually anything special they're not even sticky they're just disorganized masses and they took these spiders and they put them in cages and they took a spray bottle and they sprayed them with water that contained get this graphene yeah little bits of graphene they just sprayed it on the spiders what do you think would happen you'd think I think the spiders would just be like what's a wiz at the Goff and I am just trying to be a spider yeah but that's not what happened in true comic book fashion the spiders absorbed the graphene and somehow added it to their silk crib the strongest fiber known to humankind it's that easy huh did you spray the bottle you sprayed them how do they do that I don't get I don't understand they just I don't I don't I don't and then the next thing you know they got it how does that work huh it's that easy I guess and in 2017 researchers improved on the web slinging and they engineered a spider that could produce a web that could hold a human even the strength of fibers are measured by humanity in a number of different ways we've got strength toughness or tensile strength and then Young's modulus they each measure different things but generally speaking strength is resistance to failure under stress like a stretch or a load toughness is the energy required to crack or fracture a material something you would use to test for impacts young's measures elasticity in general but we ain't makin spider-man here so what exactly we doing all this for let me run this thought bubble by you what if we could take a thirty six thousand kilometer inter woven and knotted super spider cable and attach one end to a space station or an asteroid and the other end to the ground and on that cable we could build a space elevator that could go between the two next stop low Earth orbit to do that we'd need super-strong fibers that would be able to hold the weight of the cable to cargo the weight of the space station maybe the asteroid on the other end is its anchored to the earth and that ain't no easy task turns out carbon nanotubes alone can't do it that's the strongest material we can make can't do it they fail at about 40 Giga Pascal's the tubes unzip and the elevator becomes a horrifying whipping tail it's amazing but terrible spider silk unfortunately can't do it either even though it is super strong can't do it alone but what about spider silk with carbon nanotubes incorporated together maybe we can use this discovery to improve our nanotubes technology maybe we can incorporate what we've learned from limpet teeth as they are five times stronger than spider silk the equivalent of a spaghetti that could hold 1,300 kilograms nanotubes alone have a toughness of 40 Giga Pascal's and we might only need to get 250 to build the space elevator cable we're not quite there yet but we're close the thing about these spider nanotubes silks is that we don't know what they're gonna be used for yet we're thinking maybe advanced fabrics parachutes stuff like that we could use this technology to invent another new technology and then another one and then another one all based on the idea that humanity and mother nature can make something that neither of them could have done alone ironically the future of humankind is going to be in space but to get there we're gonna need to recruit our animal friends which means we should probably take care of the planet because if we start killing them off for no reason we're on our own we get no inspiration from nature that doesn't exist no nature no biomimicry no new ideas thanks for watching uno dos of tres this week everyone for more come back next Saturday just a quick reminder I quit my job to do this so if you can donate just a few seconds of your time to subscribe to like to share this video with your friends those go a huge way to help growing the channel thanks again for watching I'll see you next time on no dose of tres what's with the graphene brick I don't know why they're south-african spiders I guess they'd be Italian spiders because these were Italian scientists science there's a spray in the bottle and they get the thing I don't understand
