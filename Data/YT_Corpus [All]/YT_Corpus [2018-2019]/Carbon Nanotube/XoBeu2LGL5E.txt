 we are discussing carbon carbon structures and we have already discussed by now the structure of graphene diamond and graphite today we will discuss our topic is another carbon structure which is very important and is recently grown much importance in research and development is the carbon nanotube so carbon nanotube also sometimes abbreviated ad CNT so what is carbon nanotube the best description of carbon nanotube and a simple description comes from relating it to the structure of graphene which we are already familiar so we have seen that graphene is a hexagonal structure a single sheet 2 dimensional hexagonal sheet of carbon atoms just like one layer of graphite so carbon nanotube is nothing but a rolled up it can be considered as rolled up sheet of graphene a tube made by into a tube graffiti a rolled-up sheet into a tube this is structure was discovered in 1991 by Japanese scientists electron microscopist someo edema probably only one eye so tsumuji my in Japan discovered it in 1991 there is a lot of discussion in literature whether this was the first real first observation of nanotubes or some people have seen it before that but the fact remains that only after his 1991 paper in a journal called nature a very famous journal the topic actually caught the attention of the world and a lot of research and development it is established itself as a field of in its own right so that credit does go to AG MA so let us try to relate it to the graphene sheet you will do that soon let us look at some classification of carbon nanotubes one particularly scheme of classification is the so called single walled nanotubes or multi walled nanotubes so let us say CNT we are classifying it in two SW NT or single world single-walled nanotubes or mwn t which is multi walled nanotubes name itself is self-explanatory in a single walled nanotubes a single graphene sheet is rolled into a tube form so you have a single single tube and that is called a single wall nanotube multi-ball nanotubes had several walls and again can be classified into two types depending on its structure one is called interestingly the Russian doll structure and another parchment structure the rest rescind all structure is several concentric so instead of just one graphene sheet rolled into a tube you can have several graphene sheet multi-walled so several concentric tubes if they are there then this is the rescind all structure of a multi walled nanotubes in a parchment structure actually there is a single graphene sheet but that rolls itself like a parchment into a multi walled tube the distance the inter tube distance in the case of multi walled tube is about three point four angstrom which is same as the inter layer separation in graphite in clear separation graphite you can think of it as a curved graphite instead of flat graph graphite another classification so that was one classification scheme where we got the single walled and multi walled nanotubes another classification is based on what is called chirality so based on chirality we again classify nanotubes as either chiral or achiral well chiral is just another word for handed so when we say chiral we mean that it has a handedness so it will come in two varieties a right-handed and a left-handed person whereas a chiral will not be handed it will not have these two varieties so for example for example my hand my we know that our hands are left-handed and right-handed I have a left hand and a right hand and these cannot be superimposed although they can be imagined to be mirror image of each other so but my single hand single hand relax any mirror symmetry so that's why when I reflect it into a mirror a different handedness and is produced so four chiral or handed structures it is important that mirror plane is absent absent only when mirror is absent you can have left-handed and right-handed version of an object and that is called a chiral object whereas a chiral is not handed in this case mirror will be present think of a think of a sphere you don't think of a left-handed sphere or a right-handed sphere and this fact is it related to the fact that is feared has several mirrors a cube doesn't have a left-handed or right-handed version because Cube has mirror so any object which will have mirror will not have left-handed or right-handed version whereas object where mirror is absent it is possible to have both left-handed and right-handed so in science or in crystallography the word chiral and a chiral is used for that so when we say C and T the carbon nanotube is chiral we say that that nanotube will not have any mirror plane whereas a chiral nanotube will have mirror plane present so it's more symmetric a chiral is more symmetric again in a chiral two different kinds of tubes have been identified so one is called there is exact - and another is called Jetley so we will look at this soon what is the meaning of zig zag and J so let us try to make let us try to make a tube out of graphene sheet so this is a model of a graphene sheet just the hexagonal rings are drawn and if I if I fold it into a tube I will get a nanotube to do this and I want to make a zigzag tube and show it to you so let me try to fold this so all I am trying to do is to bring the two edges together such that they meet coherently without leaving any gaps or so so if I can do that then I have a nice carbon nanotube in this tube if you see so let me first try to paste this edge so brush recon can I take your health so Shrikant a is a TA in my course and he will help me to paste it sellotape is very important in carbon structure as you know from discovery of graphene which was sellotape played an important role now it is playing an important role in making my model yeah so thank you sir I can't here's pasting the tape and I have now a tube to form this cube is known as a zig zag to why it is known as the exact you that if you look at the free edge of the tube then you see a zigzag structure the top the top free edge it is exact structure of course in real nanotubes the there will be a cap a carbon cap of fullerene on the top and bottom to close the ends so the nanotubes are closed structure instead of open tubes but it still the fact remains that there is a jig zaga structure on the top and based on this a name is exact is given but this is not the only way to fold that you sew another tube I will fall in another structure known as the armchair structure so this is again the same same hexagonal tiling with carbon structure shown so again I am starting with graphene but now I want to fold it differently to make it an armchair tube and one thing so please see this that in the yeah maybe I can show it here in this exact cube along the tube at one set of bonds one set of bonds is parallel to the tube axis and you can see that if you draw a plane passing through these bonds that will act like a mirror plane of the cube so a mirror plane is present in this tube also so if I can draw that mirror plane for you maybe I can use a red pen and I'm trying to draw a line representing the mirror plane so you can see that if you imagine a plane passing through this line and the tube axis the tube the two parts of the tube are mirror symmetric to each other also there is another mirror plane and that is perpendicular to the tube axis so if I draw another line let me use so perpendicular to the tube axis this plane which will cut the tube a cylindrical tube in a circle so this plane also you can see that the top and bottom Adam mirror images of each other and all the atoms will reflect into each other so there is it this exact tube has two mirrors and obviously this will be a chiral the zigzag tube cannot be a left-handed zigzag tube or a right-handed is exactly it will just be as exact you it is a chiral so now let me try to make MJ for you so the same tube this is what is interesting about nano tube structure that although graphene is the same single structure and by folding the graphene or rolling up the graphene we are making the Nano but depending on which way we fold we get different structures of the nanotubes and these different structures also have different properties so now I am trying to make an armchair for you I will again need help of silk on see I'm trying to match the atoms if I don't match the atom then something like this something like this will come yeah something like this will come so your tube is not good or something like this if it happens so what I am doing when trying to make the cube is to bring and join the atoms coherently such that there is no no such boundary and the tube is continuous along that line so we have synthesized another nanotube now this is the MJ nanotube why it's called MJ again if you see if you see the top edge of the cube now the last time if you remember in the zigzag tube we saw a zigzag structure but now you are seeing an interesting structure that you there is a horizontal bond then there is an inclined bond another horizontal then oppositely inclined bond then horizontal bond so it's not going to zigzag it's doing something else and this is what has been imagined and by somebody as an armchair so these these can be thought of these can be thought of as arms of the chair and this is the seat of the chair and somebody can sit comfortably if I can show you here yeah so you can see here like this so somebody can be sitting comfortably there with his hands on the two sides so that's why the name armchair has been given so we will look at these two tubes again in a slightly different and more mathematical way and for that new notation the nm notation of carbon nanotube is required so let us look at the nm notation because in literature you will find a 10-10 carbon nanotube a 10 10 - 10 10 CNT or n 0 CN teens or five nine CNT the question is what is what is the meaning of this notation so this is what we want to explain so the enemy notation we will explain we will also define two important concepts which are related the chiral vector of the q and the Kyra angle so to do this we again begin with our graphene sheet and now I will try to show carefully what I was telling you that what I do when I was trying to match the atoms along the tube axis so let us look at this graphene sheet we when when discussing the graphene structure we have already talked about that in the graphene structure it's the alternate atoms the alternate atoms so if I take this atom as in my origin then the near neighbor is not equivalent a brighter color maybe so if if this is my origin then the near neighbor is not lattice equivalent because it has a different kind of neighborhood you can see this if I take this as my origin then the origin atom at the origin has a neighbor on its right at a distance equal to the carbon carbon bond distance D but this atom at the same distance if I travel D we come into the center of the hexagon and there is no atom at the center of the hexagon so this we had explained while discussing graphene also so I am repeating this here so alternate and nearby atoms near neighbors are not equivalent in the lattice sense it's the next near neighbor which are equivalent so I leave one set of atoms and try to mark all the equivalent crystallographically equivalent or lattice equivalent atoms the she then I keep taking the alternate ones leaving out the near neighbors so all these carbon atoms which I am now mocking are equivalent to each other translational equivalent to each other and equivalent to the atom mapped as the origin and the ones I am leaving out are not equivalent to this set because there is no lattice translation in the graphene sheet which will bring the marked atom to the unmarked one so essentially these red marked atoms are now forming the lattice of the graphene in this lattice we need to find two two vectors which are the basis vectors and that is selected so I have a four basis vector I have to go from the origin to the nearby equivalent atoms so I cannot go to the nearest atom I go to the next nearest atom and I mark this as one of my basis vectors let me call that vector a1 and then another vector let me call that vector a to these two green vectors which are at an angle 60 degree to each other define a primitive unit cell of graphene so if I complete this this rhombus will be a two-dimensional primitive unit cell of graphene so these two vectors are used to then define all vectors all lattice vectors in this graphene machine we are trying in this exercise we are trying to explain the nm notation now you can see that when I was trying to roll a sheet I was trying to bring the atoms together such that there is a coherence between them and there is no defect along the axis of the cube so the atom should match in terms of lattice that essentially means that I can fold the graphene sheet in a way such that any of the lattice equivalent atom is identified with the origin so if I if I fall in such a way that a lattice equivalent atom any of these lattice equivalent atom if it overlaps the origin I get a carbon nanotube so this brings us to the fact that if I take any vector in the graphene sheet so let me take let me take this particular vector this blue vector so this end end atom will be identified with the origin so that is how I will rap so I will rap such that I bring the head of this vector to its tail at the origin so I will get a tube so you can see the vector which I have drawn here the blue vector will become the circumference of the rolled-up nanotube such vector are known as the chiral vector of the cube Kyra with a more transparent name could have been so let us use that is a circumferential vector we call this is the vector which will become circumference of the tube obviously a vector normal to that you to circumferential vector for example a vector like this let me call that T will form the axis of the cube so this tube will be folded like this circumference L vector becomes the circumference and the vector along the and the vector perpendicular to the chiral vector so the chiral vector becomes the circumference of the tube and vector perpendicular the chiral vector becomes the axis of the tube so that's the definition of the carrier vector and a chiral vector will always be a lattice vector in the graphene sheet otherwise you will have defect along the line where you will join as I had shown you in my previous example in trying to when when I was folding the nanotube so Carl vector has to be so cairo vector let us call this C and this car vector C has to be a lattice vector of graphene which means it can be expressed as combination linear combination of the two basis vectors a1 and a2 in particular you can see the chiral vector which I have drawn here this particular Karl vector is four times a to four times a 2 and zero times a 1 sorry I should write first the a 1 so 0 a 1 plus 4ei - so I can call this a zero for the nanotubes which will form will be given the designation a zero for nanotubes which means zero for is the lattice vector of the graphene sheet which will become circumference of the nanotube so C has to be a lattice vector of the graphene sheet so C can always be expressed as C can be expressed as n times a1 plus M times a to any lattice vector as you know since we have selected a primitive unit cell and a1 and a2 are the basis of the primitive vector so any vector in the sheet will all can always be expressed as n times a1 plus m times a2 so the resulting tube the resulting tube will be called n n m2 I hope this designation or this notation is clear so we have so you can see that if one of the one of the components is 0 so 0 for tube this time we are getting a zigzag tube because you can see the zigzag structure along the circumference if you want if you want um jeito you will take a different carrier vector and it will have a different enemy designation so let us now try to make a chiral vector for arm j to you so i again mark all the alternate atoms as my equivalent sites and in this graphene sheet I will identify a vector which when wrapped up will become circumference of an arm ghe so remember that armchair had a armchair along its edge had something like this so which means that the lattice vector or the chiral vector for the arm j-tube will be something like this what I've shown in black here and if I take my basis vectors again two vectors at expiry this time has changed the orientation from but that's allowed you can take them in any orientation so if this is my a one this is my eight two you can see that this car vector which I have now marked will be 1 a 1 plus 1 a 2 then 2 a 1 plus 2 a 2 3 a 1 plus 3 a 2 so the one which I have drawn out is 3 a 1 plus 3 a 2 in terms of these a 1 a 2 vectors so which means the resulting cube will be a 3 3 2 now I will fall like this to bring the head of this vector the carrier vector to its origin and if I join then I will get a tube which will be a 3 3 2 so in general any NN tube will be an arm JQ so the two components are equal then you will have an arm chair finally I will show you so both armchair and zigzag as you know were chiral but of course since all these atoms are equivalent any of these atoms could have been brought to the origin and a tube could have been created so if you now see mmm let us let us randomly make let us randomly choose one let us choose this let us do is this atom and let us say that we want to identify this atom with the origin and create a tube which means my circumference L vector will be going from origin to my chosen atom now if I try to define this in terms of N and M we see that we have to go [Music] remember a 1 and then we took a 2 and another a one then another a two to come to this point so this point was to two because we had taken to a ones and to a two to reach here and after that I will I want to reach here sorry this is not parallel to that so I should go parallel to this direction so which is this one I had over short so this is a line which is parallel to my a 2 so I should come only up to this match so not to 2 but 2 1 1 so here I have already come to 1 1 and then I keep going in the two direction by 1 2 and 3 steps 1 2 & 3 steps so 3 extra steps in the two direction which means this location is a 1 4 location this vector which I have drawn as my carrer vector C is 1 times a 1 and 4 times 8 we can see now here clearly from this triangle that I go 1 times a 1 and 4 times a 2 to reach there and so this becomes my circumference of a vector and if I now wrap it up then this will be called a 1/4 nanotube and this will be a chiral nanotube arm-chair and zigzag by a chiral this will be a Carol an OT so in summary in nm notation if one of the component is 0 n 0 [Music] so this will be his exam if both are equal nn then we have MJ and if neither is zero nor they are equal we have nm then you have a chiral so just one one more concept which I wanted to show you is the chirality angle or the chiral angle sometimes the tubes are characterized by what are called the chiral angle so that is nothing but the angle which the chiral vector makes with one of the axis usually taken to be the first axis a one so if we let us say if we have if this is my origin again and these are my basis vectors and let us say that this is the Chi Rho vector C then this car vector is making an angle theta with a one so angle of the carrier vector with a1 will be known as the chiral angle angle of chiral better see with a one that is the chiral angle and in fact you can try to derive I leave this I don't do this now in this lecture but I leave it as an exercise that both both the diameter both the diameter diameter D and the karl angle theta theta of where of an nm nm CNT can be expressed in terms of n and M and of course for D you also require a length parameter which is the carbon-carbon bond length or this is an interesting geometrical exercise which I want to leave it as an homework for you because you can see that once the circumference will be nm nm defines the circumference of vector C because C is nothing but n times a 1 plus M times a 2 and of course once you know the vector C the length we are we are telling that she becomes the circumference of vector so lengths of C is nothing but circumference the conference so this will become PI D so with this relationship you can find the diameter in terms of nm an angle between C theta is by definition angle between VN a1 there is a nice exercise in vector geometry in non Cartesian frame because your to a 1 a 2 are not not at 90 degree but at 60 degree so I leave this as an homework exercise for you so thank you with this we finished our discussion on nano queue we are coming close to the end of discussion on carbon structure maybe in the next video we will discuss little bit about fullerene
