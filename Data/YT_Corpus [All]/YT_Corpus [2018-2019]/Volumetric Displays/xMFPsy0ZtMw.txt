 if thank you very much so this talk is just set about shapewear materials and how we can support interactive pipe fabrication with a system that will up code shake me edit this together with my advisors to finance and dealers and when I'm a kite so like okay I have some technical problems is the last slide let's say so thank you for your attention and yes I saw like the system that fear that we implemented you can see right here so we have material that a maker or an artist can model and it automatically streams in real time digital a digital model of the changes that have been made physically so on there the goal or like what is the the advantage of this is that we want to support both physical and digital modeling so physical digital digital physical modeling gives you many advantages for example you can use traditional crafting techniques people can artists can use their the tools that they are most familiar with also like you directly get a response from the object that you create so you get the stereoscopic vision you can hold it into the light you can see the shadows but digital tools also have advantages that physical modeling cannot really support for example when you can explore symmetries by using the mirror tool they just have to work on one side of the object and the other side gets rendered automatically also digital tools are very precise they have a high speed and the model is that you create a lightweight because they're data so you can just send them around and you have you can have like a huge library of different models on your on your harddrive stored which is really hard physically then this is exactly what we're we wanted to support makers and artists with the system so we have on the one hand the support of physical tools with the material that you can shape with with with physical tools and also this digital model that gets streamed directly into a 3d CAD environment with where you then have we can then apply digital tools to it so this concept was was before interest for HDI so far so this mixing of digital and physical tools for prototyping like one stream of research goes into a camera based systems where you actually tracked with the physical changes of an object and create a digital model from it these systems re great but also like the like this camera based systems have sometimes problems with occlusion when the person is working on it and as some sample some parts may be hidden also there are smart tools they attract the position of the tool and then from this they compute a digital model but these systems also have the problem that when you move to tool you need to read recalibrate and like look where this where this what whether where the way the tool is to have like a code to have a correct model so like the first thing that we did we wanted to like more understand actually how make us create objects and how they model with it so first thing we did was we were interviewing we did interviews with professional makers so we were visiting a shoe manufacturer where they produce shoes for people with special needs so like it very individual shoes and one of the main challenges for them is to create the sole that created consist of multiple layers they are very similar but each of them needs to be needs to be fabricated individually because it is this physical process there is no copy-paste operation then for architects architects like use both digital models and physical models physical models are very often shown to communicate with a customer for example and also like here we see a layered approach so they create layers they shape them them stacking them out on top of each other to create volumetric objects we also do the workshop with novice makers so we had 11 participants that had the task to create a gingerbread house with modeling materials so we used to form core sheets we started with paper sketching stage or face secured to create an initial idea and then the prototyping was to form core sheets you see here like a couple of outcomes from it and we observe some techniques that people used so on the one hand this physical modeling was really helpful for them because they had individual pieces they were there and they could combine them to explore different and alternative solution so I supported ideation but on the other hand when they did a mistake in it it like a wrong cut that was like really hard to actually undo this operation so they actually had to like we fabricate it we fabricate these objects so like this these are these are first explorations on how people model and we like the benefits and the disadvantages of like physical and digital modeling are brought us to like what we actually wanted to implement so our challenge so we hope you like these these two parts and we want to support physical modeling and digital modeling and what we need on the one hand is when we do physical modeling we want to have this transition to a digital model so we need some kind of a sensor technology that is able to capture all the changes that are made by the maker and create a digital model from it and the second direction is when you have now the digital model we need to have some software toolkit that allows us to recreate a physical model that is again shape aware so that can caped that can capture its own shape so we will start now with the first part with the sensor technology and how how this can be made so the question is how can we actually capture the shape of physical material and digitize it so now imagine you have some cuts of a voice or like image this is a sheet of paper yes so this sheet of paper we we print a set of like a grid of line shaped sensors how they might or will come later to it but let's imagine this is the shape of these sensors so when this sheet now gets cut these answers will be cut with them so and now in the case that we would be able to teach our mind for each one of these line sensors where this cut actually happened then we would be able to to combine like these cutting points and do an approximation and interpolation between these points and by this we would get a digital model of the shape so and what we need for this is since the position of each sensor is known only thing that we need now is we need to be able to measure the length of the sensor so to get to get so and with the position and the length of the sensor we can compute the cutting point exactly yes so the question is like how can we now sense the length so we need a cuttable sensor that is able to sense the length and our solution to this is the following so again like in the middle this dielectric layer imagine this is a sheet of paper and you're looking at now from the side so you can see in the top electrode that we can print the top electrode as on the top side of the paper and the bottom electrode on the on the lower side of the paper yes so and when these two electrodes are overlapping what we actually then get is a capacitor system so when we now a PlayOn let me now apply on the bottom electrode an AC current let's say off like 60 volt what will happen for a capacitor is that you will get and we get a reaction on the top electrode and you will also get an AC current these the line sensors that we have are pretty small so like the area is pretty small and the distance between the two plates is pretty small which leads to the fact that they have very low capacitance which on the other hand means that these 60 volts are not like it doesn't reach the same amount of voltage on the top electrode it will be a little bit lower so now comes the trick to it when we cut it the area you can get smaller and when the area gets smaller the capacitance drops and also with it the voltage will drop so coming from this voltage we can we can we want to like recompute the length of this sensor so but now we need to have a mapping function that map's this voltage to the length and for this we did the technical evaluation so you see here or a set up on the left side you see 50 and test answers that all had a length of 250 millimeters and on the right side a set of reference sensors with different lengths that started at 250 millimeters and then went to 0 and 25 at 25 millimeter steps also we printed these sheets in two different sizes so one the width of one a set of the sensors was 1 millimeter and the second set of D sensors was 0 to five millimeters and our procedure was that we were cutting the test sensors and five millimeter steps and in after each step we were measuring 100 times the voltage of each of these test sensors so this is our outcome as and what you see here is and this is like the main finding of this technical evaluation there's a linear relationship between the length and the voltage so when you cut the when you cut the length of the of the sensor also the voltage will drop in a linear fashion we also like try it out with the width of the sensors to go down to 0.25 millimeters what you can see here is there's a bit more noise of course because the capacitance is smaller so we introduced more noise with one millimeter the descending various sensing values worked quite clear and we could reach an accuracy with this mapping of on average of 2.5 millimeter so now that we have these layers that are able to sense the shape we want to now integrate it into into modeling material that actually you can use it as a shape where a modeling object so and the way how we do this is very straightforward actually so we take these sensor layers and we apply them on a sheet of modeling material this then is going for like plates like these foam core plates that we had in this study before and you can also extend it to volumetric objects in 3d by just sampling it so by just a stacking layers of sensors and modeling material on top of it so now we talk about these grits of sensors so what you saw and this and structure that you and like the question is of course like what kind of grits do we actually want to print so in this initial example you saw this year so we have there some specific topology of these sensors and when this cut when the cut is made like this one it active reconstruction is actually pretty well with like a few small arrows however they are all so this is one an alternative example of a cut that is a little bit more problematic so you see like here on the left side and there are sensors cut off so this is a challenge to the system because when these sensors are broke only the last point of the cut can actually be measured so you see it here in this figure then these are the intersection that would get measured by our system and when you do an interpolation with it you see that there's a problematic area that cannot be actually accurately captured so we were suggesting for this a set of alternatives to sensor topologies so you see here like it's like a couple of examples and these red lines are indicating what the ideal direction of a potential cut would be so we have they're the parallel line setup which is optimized for more horizontal cuts that have like a roughly horizontal shape we support structures that go more into direction of pair of peripheral cuts and also our system with the last sensor topology is also supporting holes and vertical cuts and a user can then when there's some initial idea on what kind of cuts will be made the user can then select your appropriate apology so a lot of fabrication and like taken together with what we would have just showed about how the sense of the technology works we have the three layers so we have the top layer which contains the topology of the sensors then an insulating layer which is some cat oval for example paper or transparent foil and also when you remember we need to have a lower like a bottom electrode that is charged with an AC current and for this we don't need to individual ones but we can use one homogeneous conductive layer that gets just charged and is powering all the sensors on that one but on the top layer the fabrication of each of these layers for this we use an inexpensive and intrepid for vacation technology based on inkjet printing that prints conductive silver traces well with this technology we this is also commercially available with this one we print the top layer with all the detailed sensors and for the back electrode at the moment we use screen printing of conductive polymer called Peter PSS but alternative solutions are possible so for example you can also spray some carbon filled particles as long as it is conductive and is an homogeneous layer so another challenge for the system is we want to have a high resolution in the shape reconstruction and to get a high resolution of course the more senses you have the better this and this brings now the challenge of scalability when you have to connect like twenty thirty or sixty four sensors like in this case we need to have some hardware that's actually supporting a convenient way to connect them and for this we developed a shape meat board it contains a PC connectors where you can just it's a plug-and-play system you can just put these connectors in and click and then a disconnected and this enables makers to also to connect larger and high resolution high resolution shape sensing sheets I'm in the example that we saw before about this volumetric object they can also like the shape where material can also have multiple layers and for this we made the shape me board also stackable so it can even connect more of these boards together to send even more sensors so this was now the the first direction about the sensor technology the second direction going from the digital model back to that makes the communication from the digital model also to a physical model such as you can fabricate it and integrate the sensors we developed as a software software to wicked that that is a supporting this we call this dish to shape me to a kids and it is what you see here on the left side so this this this software system is supporting the communication between the between the digital model and the physical model so on the one hand you can create initial shapes digitally and in the shape me design toolkit it creates all the necessary layers and senses which can then be fabricated and the way that I just presented and on the other hand when Wendy shaped me when these sensors are are active and there are physical changes made it also collects all the voltage data converts it into geometric data and can send it to a 3d environment we made the plugins for unity so you can for example directly render it with microsoft hololens for example anymore anything that support unity or we also have a plugin for blender where which is more focused on this digital modeling aspect so like now we will I will show you were like the one application scenario bot and modeling we also will see in action how just wicked and how to Furby on how the the fabrication and the interaction was posted digital and physical works so I'll imagine now there's an architecture student and she wants to make a building so the first thing that she does this and she wants to make it physical she wants to design physically and wants to combine this digital physical modeling and what she does is she takes the design toolkit selects the amount of layers the layer thickness and then when this is done she goes through the template and select the template that suits her this is reversed the toolkit automatically creates all the sense of topologies that she wants she can customize the shape the size of the entire sheet it creates the connector the wiring to do connections you can select the topology of those that that are sorry that we have and finally this can then be export it into a PDF file that can then be sent to the inkjet printer for this silver entered printing to the laser cutter to cut out the particular sheet so when this is done you can see here the setups on the bottom of this image you see like an example of a fabricated layer this one gets connected to a computer and to the shape we toolkit and a shape meet wicket streams over OSC in the geometric data directly on the left side to blender readout on where does a blender wear this shape where object automatically gets created the the tweak addenda some calibration and the architecture student can start designing now like digitally and now even physically and all the changes that are made physically they are data or data made physically are directly captured and it can be done like reconstructed on a with a laser cutter so and also they can like parts can be also designed digitally for example the roof of the house can be again with wicked fabricated and small-scale details for example like adding details to the roof can be done can be done physically and now if we see like an example where like a mistake has been made and like a large piece work to cut away so well now we can use the history to cut off the design kid go to an earlier version and we fabricate it again so we are tracking here the physical changes digitally so and in the second part we want to create a tarantella this is now a multi layer objects or volumetric object so we create multiple layers we again replicated connected now with the shape me to a kid that gets a better shape me bored it gets stacked on top of each other and the geometric data gets cream directed to directly to the to the digital model and then these digital models of the house and of the Torah can be combined to do Tinian so so far as a conclusion what we wanted to achieve was at this combination between physical and digital modeling we showed the sensor technology that is able to capture the shape and we showed a software design toolkit that manages the communication between the physical and the digital object and allows to fabricate these shape aware materials with with inkjet printing technologies and with personal fabrication tools so this is the end of my talk I thank you very much and I'm happy if I can ask two questions okay while we're asking questions I'm gonna go ahead and ask vikram to set up hey Daniel book University of Copenhagen this is really really fun as I'm wondering if you've thought if there's up to a possible architecture to enable you to do this like folium three dimensions so that actually sculpt something where you can have holes and parts cut apart and mmm sculpture essentially it will be captured yeah of course I would say this is like this is related a lot to the possibility apologies that can be printed inside so like one of our one of our limitations that we have right now is that we have to layer it because there's not really a 3d printing technology for like printing these sensors like in 3d which I have a little bit so and this is definitely like one of the challenges that we would like to also like go onto the future towards who would like to make a have more high quality model of actually how we can print yeah could you stack different topologies to spread on top of each other within insulation it's like they're two versions on one hand you can just use like one topology and use like many layers or what is also very interesting is combining them because each of these topologies has an advantage and some kind of sense but when you combine them stack them on top of each other you can increase the geometries that you can actually a sense from it yeah cool thank you hi Shawn Palmer Stanford University great talk really exciting work I'm wondering my question is sort of towards a similar direction in terms of thinking about extending your work - like kirigami or or origami and I'm wondering if you've thought about how you might be able to use your sensor to detect more complex bends and if there's a way to both sense cutting and bending at the same time so this is like a very interesting question because I also have like a second demo today where we do X do something with origami awesome yes so like at the moment we are we are focusing on sending the cut so I like to sense a shape change so to say of rigid object the next extension of course is when we talk about the chilled properties to go into flexibility and stretch ability and to also sense that so we didn't do this so far because we were focusing more on this cat ability part but an extension to it that we all I can sense deformations of the object this would be definitely like a very very interesting direction that I'm would be very into they let's think our speaker
