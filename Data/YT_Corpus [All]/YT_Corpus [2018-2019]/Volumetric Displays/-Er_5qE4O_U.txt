 thank you Mike for the introduction hello everybody I am Hamid le noir second so the Sun bender is work with my colleagues at the University of Sussex yagura madrenas placencia Spiros Paula Cole applause Gianluca I'm Emily utakata CUDA and Sriram super Mannion and this works funded by u Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and it's the technical malaysia melaka so we our work make use of ultrasound for levitation and haptics this follows the previous works for example levitation of the point of polystyrene ball and then manipulate in 3d space or levitations and rotate them for example make a display and also a different format for example this glove and with the levitated object so the main point here is how are we different from the previous work so we enable a levitation even on top of passive object for example this toy you can see and we also enable haptic feedback around these blocks that blocking the ultrasound we enable the flow control of non solid object and not only that we also can manipulate them even though blocked by this object on left right top and bottom then how come we come up with to this solution so let me first introduce you to the existing approaches that have been around in sound field so for example if you have one transducer and a reflect on top you pretty much can create a levitation a levitate the object by just having a standing wave so but this is pretty much you can have you can also increase the amount of transducers now you can create a focal point so this focal point and can create haptic feedback this is what you will see in other haptic this body did it does so you can increase the complexity by creating multi for the points to create them some sort of mid-air haptic subject like like a sphere in the air or you can increase the complexity by having only one single transducers but you have the object that levitate on top so you also can manipulate it so the I think this sounds will increase throughout the examples I showed you and they shared a common problem so what the common problem is to create this focal point for example you need to have a contribution of all transducers and then you will have this pressure point over there but but one question how about if I have this obstacle so this is what happened to your field you destroy the field because of the scattering effect of the obstacle in the middle of you the transducer and then that if you stick your hand on top you will not be able to feel now you're not going to feel anything if you try to levitate object you're not going to get any objects lie so yeah we come up with a come across to this paper how are we going to fix it this is how they try to fix it we found this is a good paper look how it bends so this is paper from Zhang in 2014 so what he did in this paper is he try to create acoustic cloaking you see try to move the sound band avoid the obstacle and then meet at the top and this object will not scattered and destroy the film also we can see invisible hey invisible so if I have a bit Asian point on top and haptic fibbin top yeah I should have not destroyed it be there right so yeah let's give it go how hard can it be it turned out to be Jana it's not getting there yet see the pressure across the line is getting there but not there yet so we start think about what was wrong because it's simple just put the face on the face the rate reduces it should be there but we try to figure out after simulation and after few months late I mean a few hours later and then we found out that a the size of the transistors is ten point five mm and if we look at the features of the wave Lanisha is eight point six which means the ultrasound speakers is larger than the wavelength okay if I ask you to draw a Mona Lisa or using your thumb or your hand you're not going to get Mona Lisa its amount of detail compared to Brad isn't it so this is what happened here now let's take a look how we can fix this let's say metamaterials for those who don't know what mathematician acoustic is it is clever a plastic that can somehow go to these channels and then by changing the channels you can somehow change the delay okay and the this is actually a work by memory at all so he provided themes provide this very good nice looking brick say I know let's try this out man so again we try we implement it boom that's it it's showing as it's good looks good nothing's that clean inside in the cavity we see this is what you are man now there is another problem it's clever it's not clever enough it started you cannot change it once you print it that's it you don't so can we get both worlds like getting best of these both worlds and making them a good prototype forth they say heartbeat modulator by having the complex field created by the static clever plastic thing and then they modified the field by using ultrasound transducers at the bottom hey we also need to know what's the gap right it's not maybe not maybe it's affecting the sound field or not we don't know yet so in this paper we will provide exploration of our hybrid model laters and we describes how we fabricate the meta materials we describe the algorithms to control it and we also sort some other stuff like the gap so we will recommend some looks so this is the simple idea bending means it helped or forced us to explore the space we stuck in it but what we want to share is our insight on hybrid modulators we summarize this in five step so the first two step is only for self bending beam but the other three can be done for can be useful every used for other sound fields so let's jump to first step so how do we compute this 17b nothing fancy here is just a natural spline and then we just what we did here is the first we find the geometry of course and make sure it's not occlude object and then we create natural spine but what we did at the bottom and top we make sure they align to that red dashed line and then we go to the next step this is we just apply the zank method zhang at all method where the acoustic cloak remember and then what he did he this work is get a 1.87 named Ben and then trace back to the wavefront and then you try to map the face on top of the metamaterials but thanks to the first step that we take we fix the first point and the second point at the top the final point at the top so we get a simply simply fit we simplify the zhong method and we get we get it simpler and is in our paper so now we discretized by having this all set 16 breaks and then there are real numbers so you can have take one for example the red color and then the red color refers to bricks number 16 which is pi and then all of them we just come out to the one-to-one D profile so because of our envelope is 360 there are enclosed so we just revolve them and then by revolving them now we have this is a fabricated and printable printed metamaterials for those who don't have maybe it was deal with none exists a metric also then you can check our papers because we provide some equations also for non as it's symmetric now we have the transducers at the bottom and then a metal material top turn it on you get that shape and it's levitating so now we don't want to dynamically control them how we do it just change the pattern of the viscera transducer and now it tilt to the left or to the right now you can change the levitated object and we introduce another pattern and then we can increase the height in a z-axis direction so how we do this we actually borrow optical tweezers so what optical tweezers profit is like if you have a point and this point you can track them and then move it in three dimension space but they didn't cook provides how you going to modify the field so let's say what we do is we find a point so let's say at this point so by having this point we can now introduce a Delta X and Delta Y so the diffraction grating will tilt it to the left right our backward or forward and the deltas that increment that will be the term to move it up and down we also introduced the switching between tactile feedback and levitation trap so for those who want to use for a levitation or it can use it with our method now the final step is spacing between them so we recommend for this setup for our transducer is 0.75 mm sorry 0.75 lambda Y we come across to this because we do some observation good ok so we do some observations and we found that if you refer to 0.5 lambda and you'll see this bumpy kind of final transmitter pressure which is not really good and homogeneous but if further you go the displacement and then the more homogeneous it is but there's an interplay between them so if you go beyond the like 0.75 you cannot get homogeneous so we try to get this trade correct one like you have a very good pressure and then you get a very nice and homogeneous pressure across the distribution but if you see at the end of this distribution it becomes low and then we need to add extra that's why we call padding you get extra transducers just to support and make it more imaginisce get good result then we do some evaluations this is the field at the top is a a simulation bottom is a measurement and it's good correlation so the applications is if you seen in the video like it's a tactile feedback around object and levitated object levitate around the object and also control flows but what is the most interesting for us is we can create now play with these meta materials for this one is example a hologram of acoustic for acoustics where we can create icons for example while using these Nick's cannot be done by a year ultrasound speakers so by having this example let's say board game you can change and swap between the obstacle between the toys and then half uptake and then levitation by having a new type of metamaterials to get this be more engaging and more interactive for the users so with the tic wait I'll say I wouldn't say that ultrasound speak is bad but it's they're versatile course but a complex field if you want to go to complex will be quite limited and the hybrid model letters can offer like a conflict fields it's just a less versatile you have to you know couple it with transducers but if you try to go for a create a sound field try first with ultrasonic occurs if you think you cannot get it then this is might be the answer so that then I thank you that's all [Music] well typos could take one question if there any thanks for a great talk we really enjoyed it and could you give us an idea of the degree of angular stir you can get around an object how far around the corner can you go firstly and secondly can you tell us what the effect is on the degree of maximum pressure you can exert compared to not having the object there thank you nice question so because of we doing this if you saw the image of how we create the curve is actually a tree tracing back to the linearly attract back to the ultrasound speakers so if I'll say if the speaker can still see the point and trace back to the speaker then you'd be having it so if you cannot see if the speaker cannot see this point so it's what to increase small speakers and the second question was oh yeah just what the effect is on the amount of power you can actually exert compared to having not having the object in the way so is it just the ratio of the number of transducers that can see you can see that particular point for the object you mean yeah yes oh so it's the amount of pressure you can exert at the point of interference of the of the of the tree sticks reduced to the in the same ratio as the number of transistors that then can't see that point so because of if you have this envelope and the pressure is not getting around so I don't think it's matter so just these get the geometry right and then yeah you get it's not being you know it shouldn't be a problem okay thank you all right so two announcements before we go there's lasting impact a war is happening right now upstairs and the second thing is that your badge
