 all right so I'm Dominic Bechard and I'm a dermatologist I'm at the National Institutes of Health and so I work with the group with dr. we do men's group as well as dr. gross so today I'm going to talk about the kinis neurofibromas working group and what we have been working on so as you heard earlier we're a relatively new working group it's been probably about a year that we've been that we've been in production is that right okay so I do want to tell you what what we set out to do as the cutaneous neurofibroma working group okay so the first thing was we wanted to identify research priorities for cutaneous neurofibromas in nf1 and so we've worked on that the other big thing that we want to tackle and this is multiple activities as we want develop recommendations for clinical trials and this includes clinical trial endpoints clinical trial outcome measure tools and clinical trial design so first I want to show some pictures of what cutaneous nerve fibromas are and this is part of why it is a challenge to study cutaneous no.4 I promise so as you can see on the screen they can look quite different so we can have cutaneous neurofibromas that stick out of the skin has these soft nodules we can have some that are a little bit deeper in the skin and they might just feel like a dome shape on the skin we have some that it's hard to see on the screen but they are little almost blue violaceous if you feel it it almost feel like it indents in so are these how do we measure these in the clinical trial and tell their response and as patients we want to know do you recognize a difference is it important for you based on the type of cutaneous nerve fibromas that you have i also because i'm a skin doctor i look at the skin a lot and i like pictures but I wanted to show there's a lot of things on the skin of the general population which includes individuals with nf1 that are not related to nf1 and I get asked a lot this red thing this cherry angioma is not related to nf1 it's just a normal mole that comes some time after your 30 these brown ones here seborrheic keratoses or the adult scaly mole it's a gift you got from one of your parents or grandparents it's inherited and they come in anytime after your 30s these are skin tags they can look kinda like cutaneous neurofibromas they're a little bit floppy sometimes they're smaller sometimes they're like on a little tiny stock and this one here this is a mole so as moles mature they can actually lose their pigment so you may have a flat brown spot when you're younger and then as it grows if it lifts up and then it can lose its color that can be confused for cutaneous nerve fibroma we don't expect to treat moles in a cutaneous nerve ever I'm a trial so it's important to recognize what the cutaneous nerve fibroma and what's something different all right so when we talk about an endpoint in a clinical trial we want to it's the primary outcome that's being measured in some sort of interventional trial so in cutaneous nerve fibromas these interventions could be destruction it could be a medication so some sort of intervention that's being done and what is it that we should be looking at should we look at the number of cutaneous neurofibromas the number of new cutaneous nerve aromas the size or the cutaneous nerve I promise how soft the cutaneous nerve fibromas aren't most importantly what we need to know is what is meaningful change so as dr. Cerf said this morning 20% reduction in a plexiform neurofibroma may be significant but 20% change in one of these skin neurofibromas is that meaningful to a patient with kids with nf1 and that's the input that we want so as dr. Cerf said the current tools that we use to measure neurofibromas are these two this paper frame as well as the caliper so the paper frame you put it on three different areas of the body and you count the number of neurofibromas that are within that area all right so that's a it's a general measurement of the number of neurofibromas that someone has and when we look in a clinical trial we'll only count the ones that are within this paper frame so we're not doing whole body counts so we're looking at three areas and then the calipers are used to measure the size so these are two ways that we're looking at these endpoints the number and the size but there's challenges associated with these tools these are not the perfect tools and so we want to find better tools what are some of the challenges well we heard this morning from dr. Cerf they have a very slow growth so their natural history is that it's going to take time and the next slide is actually a slide that dr. Corp showed this morning so this is growth over years so if we're gonna do a study that's gonna look to see if it slows growth we're gonna be in the study for a long time small changes in size measurement so with the caliper maybe we can't measure very small changes which might actually tell us if a drug is biologically active in these cutaneous nerve fibromas maybe it was that we didn't have enough of a dose but we would like to be able to measure small changes even if those small changes don't end up making the trial meet its endpoint it's important for us to know biologically if there's any change only measures above the surface so what about the part of the two minutes underneath the skin it would be good to know maybe that shrinks sooner maybe it actually doesn't change at all even when the surface does change full-body count says dr. Cerf said those are very challenging if you want to account the number of tumors on a full body it's not consistent across visits or even across people counting which tumors should be measured I showed you the different presentations of the tumors should we be measuring certain types of the tumors or certain presentations of the tumors and the tool that we use to measure it should be available so if it's such a specialized tool that only one place has it then it's not something that can be done in a multicenter study or across multiple places so these are some of the challenges that we've had so one of the important things for us to know it like I said what is a meaningful change and so in order to understand the patient perspective the patient or a patient representatives perspective in the cutaneous nor fibroma working group we've developed a survey and we this in this working group we have three patient representatives and they have been very involved in developing this survey so what did this survey do it's two main things we want to know how do patients view their cutaneous nerve fibromas so does the location of the cutaneous nerve fibroma matter is it the size that matters is it the symptoms associated with the neurofibromas the itching the breakdown of the skin is it the number of neurofibromas that matter also we want to know what patients would think about treatment options so is the result if you're left with a scar but the neurofibromas gone is that acceptable would that be a change that would be important to you the treatment type would be okay taking a medicine every day or twice a day and for how long as opposed to doing a surgery or some destructive method to the actual tumor and then of course the side effects what types of side effects would one tolerate for treatment of the cutaneous nerve fiber illness so these services I've said has been developed so we had a group within our working group which included our patient representatives and this is a survey that will be distributed through the CTF registry I'm so please look out for that hopefully we'll have that out this summer but this really was a lot of hard work we did benefit from having the patient representatives on our group give input and then also dr. cannon reached out to a larger group of patient representatives to vet these questions look at this the study make sure that we're asking the questions and getting back the answers that we think we're getting back phase 2 will be to do a second survey that will be paired adolescent and the caretakers to see to ask similar questions so hopefully that'll be out in the faller winter so briefly I wanted to show you some of the proposed measurement tools so we have a camera that can look at it creates a 3d volume of the neurofibroma um so that would be good for looking at the size that's above the skin this is a picture of a high frequency ultrasound so when you do an ultra time you can see what's underneath the skin and then MRI so these are just three proposed tools sure that's a great question yeah so the question was what is a relative cost of these tools so this camera is about a ten to fifteen thousand dollar piece of equipment so not something that people would buy to have at their house but when you're talking about doing a research study it's a reasonable cost the ultrasound is on the order of twenty five thousand dollars again within the reasonable realm for a research institution to invest in MRI most institutions have an MRI they may need to change the sequence to be able to look closely at the skin but that's a tool that hospitals would have so this is just an image of a continuous neurofibroma and what you can see on an ultrasound top of the skin here this dark spot is your cutaneous neurofibroma and then this is as you're going deeper into the body okay so this is all skin so there you're seeing a dark spot within the skin and with this you can measure the size of the tumor and you could re measure it at a follow-up visit this is the camera that I showed you and looking at a cutaneous nerve fiber them on the foot and it creates a 3d visualization this is another example of a tumor that was on the arm and just to show what it can do so using the software you can create this topographic map of the tumor that then will give you a volume so again this is on top of the skin it's not answering the question but what's going on below the skin so that's it that's a great point to bring up and it does not would not necessarily take into account this one of the skin what this does do so a person has to circle so this was my circling of the neurofibroma and then what I did well I didn't include it in this picture in this presentation but then you circle an area around it to say this is going to be my background so that may take into account some of that swelling of the area but not the neurofibroma itself it's a good point and thank you for bringing it up I'm sorry the question was does this take into account any swelling that occurs because you're saying that it can change day by day so the tumors can appear to grow in a very hot space on the skin will have to temperature control mm-hmm yeah that's a great that's a great point all right and then finally I just want to briefly mention that dark Wharf did mention it this morning I believe but the Sally meta nib study for cutaneous neurofibromas i'mso University of Alabama has already started enrolling patients and at NIH we will start enrollment soon but just a general timeline and so at the first visit what we're doing is we're measuring the cutaneous neurofibromas so we're using those two tools that I talked about the paper frame and the caliper we are sampling or biopsy in one of the cutaneous nerve fibromas patients are doing surveys as well as blood draws and then you can see by the fifth month so at one of the visits by the fifth month we're gonna sample another cutaneous nerve fibroma and do more blood draws and then after that every month patients will have measurements of their cutaneous nerve fibromas as well as these patient surveys and at the end we will do measurements another sample and patient surveys so this is for adults with potatoes neurofibromas and I just want to finish with acknowledgments I'm so it has really been such a pleasure to have our three patient representatives be part of this working group I feel like we were very lucky that as a group we started around the same time that the patient representatives started I'm so they've been an integral part of our group and I do want to encourage those who are affected by cutaneous neurofibromas and want to make a difference and want to have your voice heard to please look out for this patient survey that will be coming out it'll be really critical for us to know what's meaningful for you and this is your chance to have that engagement in the catina's neurofibroma research I just want to thank Pam Walters who's been really critical in helping us in developing this survey and working with our group so Thank You Pam and to the Children's Tumor foundation not only for the opportunity to be here today but also for helping us with distribution of the survey thank you you
