 you [Applause] Here I am displaying a colorful depth map I can add contours quickly and easily using the display tab of the map view and selecting the show contours option setting a valid interval value of 25 meters displays the contours typing 3000 into the highlight box emphasizes the contour of value 3000 mètres so that I can clearly see that I've got closure at this step changing the starting contour value to 3,000 and setting the increment to zero removes all other contours from display if I click on the create contour polygons button the visible closed contours on-screen become polygons that can still be seen when I turn off the contours the polygon can also be seen listed in the polygon tab here there are several options to change the appearance of the polygon or edit the polygon points in the map view geometry tab the polygon can be selected for use in calculations such as volumetric estimations providing the top horizon and a base horizon which in this case is a 10 meter shifted copy of the top horizon it is possible to calculate a quick area and volume estimate within the polygon if you have questions or would like to discover more then visit our website at www.fiberlinecommunications.com
