 Soyuz Russian Sue's IPA s jus litt Union is a series of spacecraft designed for the Soviet space program by the korolyov design bureau now rkk Energia in the 1960s that remains in service today the Soyuz succeeded the Voskhod spacecraft and was originally built as part of the Soviet manned lunar programs the Soyuz spacecraft is launched on a Soyuz rocket the most reliable launch vehicle in the world to date the Soyuz rocket design is based on the Vostok launcher which in turn was based on the 8k 74 or r7 a semi orca a soviet intercontinental ballistic missile all Soyuz spacecraft are launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan topic history the first Soyuz flight was unmanned and started on November 28 1966 the first Soyuz mission with a crew Soyuz 1 launched on the 23rd of April 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov the following flight was unmanned Soyuz 3 launched on October 26 1968 became the program's first successful manned mission the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident Soyuz 11 killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry these were the only humans to date to have died above the Karman line despite these early incidents Soyuz is widely considered the world's safest most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicle established by its unparalleled length of operational history Soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from Salyut and later Mir Soviet space stations and are now used for transport to and from the International Space Station ISS at least one Soyuz spacecraft is docked to ISS at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency the spacecraft is intended to be replaced by the six-person Federation spacecraft topic design a Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts from front to back a spheroid orbital module which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission a small aerodynamic reentry module which returns the crew to earth a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached which contains the instruments and engines the orbital and service modules are single-use and are destroyed upon re-entry in the atmosphere though this might seem wasteful it reduces the amount of heat shielding required for re-entry saving mass compared to designs containing all of the living space and life-support in a single capsule this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew 6.2 cubic meters in Apollo cm versus 7.5 cubic meters in Soyuz in the mass budget the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space with the service module containing the fuel main engines and instrumentation Soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life-support for about 30 person days the life-support system provides a nitrogen oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures the atmosphere is regenerated through potassium superoxide k o2 cylinders which absorb most of the carbon dioxide co2 and water produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen and lithium hydroxide lioh cylinders which absorb leftover co2 the vehicle is protected during launch by a payload fairing which is jettisoned along with the SAS at two-and-a-half minutes into launch it has an automatic docking system the ship can be operated automatically or by a pilot independently of ground control topic launch escape system the Vostok spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bailout the cosmonaut in the event of a low altitude launch failure as well as during reentry however it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy inspired by the mercury less Soviet designers began work on a similar system in 1962 this included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred based on data from r7 lunches over the years engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap-on booster low engine thrust loss of combustion chamber pressure or loss of booster guidance the spacecraft abort system SAS Russian Systema averin ogo spasiba translate sistema Avril no-go space Ania could also be manually activated from the ground but unlike American spacecraft there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the Soyuz service module cleanly the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort for folding stabilizers were added to improve aerodynamic stability during ascent two test runs of the SAS were carried out in 1966-67 the basic design of the SAS has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use and also as lunches carry it the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the SAS motor nozzles was removed for weight saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7 kt spacecraft carried extra life-support equipment the unmanned progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and removes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud there have been three failed launches of a manned Soyuz vehicle Soyuz 18 to one in 1975 soyuz t10 one in 1983 and Soyuz ms 10 in October 2018 the 1975 failure was aborted after escape tower jettison in 1983 Soyuz t10 one SAS successfully rescued the cosmonauts an unpaid fire and explosion of the launch vehicle most recently in 2018 the SAS subsystem in the payload shroud of soyuz ms 10 successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure two minutes and 45 second after liftoff after the escape tower had already been jettison topic orbital module the four part of the spacecraft is the orbital module Russian by Devoy oxic translate by Devoy oxic also known as habitation section it houses all the equipment that will not be needed for re-entry such as experiments cameras or cargo the module also contains a toilet docking avionics and communications gear internal volume as six cubic meters 212 cu feet living space five cubic meters 177 cu feet on the latest Soyuz versions since soyuz tma-21 introduced providing the crew with a forward view a hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed crew members exiting through its side port near the descent module on the launch pad the crew enter the spacecraft through this port this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life critical descent module the convention of orientation in a micro G environment differs from that of the descent module as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the SAS system is complicated because of the orbital module separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing without separation of the orbital module it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module this is because the orbital module would interfere with proper deployment of the descent modules parachutes and the extra mass exceeds the capability of the main parachute and braking engines to provide a safe soft landing speed in view of this the orbital module was separated before the ignition of the return engine until the late 1980s this guaranteed that the descent module and orbital module would be separated before the descent module was placed in a reentry trajectory however after the problematic landing of soyuz tma in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver this change was made as the tm5 crew could not do or 'but for 24 hours after they jettisoned their orbital module which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to me the risk of not being able to separate the orbital module as effectively judged to be less than the risk of needing the facilities in it following a failed deorbit topic descent module the descent module Russian spy CMI apparat TR specia me apparat also known as a reentry capsule is used for launch in the journey back to earth half of the descent module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry this half phases the earth during reentry it is slowed initially by the atmosphere then by a braking parachute followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing at 1 meter above the ground solid fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing one of the design requirements for the descent module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency internal volume / whole area the best shape for this as a sphere as the pioneering Vostok spacecrafts descent module used but such a shape can provide no lift which results in a purely ballistic reentry ballistic reentry's are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn that is why it was decided to go with the headlight shape that the Soyuz uses a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled seven degrees conical section to a classic spherical section heat shield this shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution the nickname was thought up at a time when nearly every headlight was circular the small dimensions of the descent module led to it having only two-man crews after the death of the soyuz 11 crew the later Soyuz T space craft solved this issue internal volume of Soyuz saw is four cubic meters 141 cu feet 2.5 cubic meters 88 cu feet is usable for crew living space topic service module at the back of the vehicle as the service module Russian preborn Oh aggregate in each oxic TR pre-born Oh aggregate neots sake it has a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can instrumentation compartment pretty neon tech that contains systems for temperature control electric power supply long-range radio communications radio telemetry and instruments for orientation in control an unpressurized part of the service module propulsion compartment aggregate Nyanza contains the main engine and a liquid fueled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth the ship also has a system of low thrust engines for orientation attached to the intermediate compartment para hanoi oxic outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array which is oriented towards the Sun by rotating the ship an incomplete separation between the service and reentry modules led to emergency situations during soyuz 5 soyuz tma 10 and soyuz tma 11 which led to an incorrect reentry orientation crew ingress hatch first the failure of several explosive bolts did not cut the connection between the service reentry modules on the latter two flights topic re-entry procedure the Soyuz uses a method similar to the Apollo to deorbit itself the spacecraft has turned engine forward and the main engine is fired for deorbiting on the far side of Earth ahead of its planned landing site this requires the least propellant for re-entry the spacecraft travels on an elliptical Hohmann transfer orbit to the entry interface point where atmospheric drag slows it enough to fall out of orbit early Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module as they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation later Soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine which saved propellant since the Soyuz TMA the orbital module is once again detached only after the re-enter firing which led to but did not cause emergency situations of Soyuz TMA 10 and TMA 11 the orbital module cannot remain in orbit as in addition to a space station as the airlock hatch between the orbital and reentry modules is a part of the reentry module and the orbital module therefore depressurizes after separation reentry firing is usually done on the Don side of the earth so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening Twilight illuminated by the Sun when it is above the shadow of the earth the soyuz craft is designed to come down on land usually somewhere in the deserts of kazakhstan in central asia this is in contrast to early u.s. manned missions which splashed down in the ocean topic spacecraft systems thermal control system Systema obese pechenyi attempt logo resume

projects exist topic specifications you topic Soyuz 7k part of the 7k 9 K 1 1 K circumlunar complex 1963 Sergey Korolyov initially promoted the Soyuz ABV circumlunar complex 7 k 9 k 1 1 k concept also known as l1 in which a two-man craft soyuz 7 k would rendezvous with other components 9 k and 11 K in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle the components being delivered by the proven r7 rocket topic first generation the man Soyuz spacecraft can be classified into design generations Soyuz 1 through Soyuz 11 1967 to 1971 were first generation vehicles carrying a crew of up to three without spacesuits and distinguished from those following by their bent solar panels in their use of the Igla automatic docking navigation system which required special radar antennas this first generation encompassed the original soyuz 7 Kok and the soyuz 7 k oaks for docking with the Salyut one space station the probe-and-drogue docking system permitted internal transfer of cosmonauts from the Soyuz to the station the soyuz 7 kl1 was designed to launch a crew from the earth to circle the moon and was the primary hope for a soviet circumlunar flight it had several test flights in the zahn program from 1967 to 1970 zon fortas on date which produced multiple failures in the 7 KL ones re-entry systems the remaining 7 KL ones were scrapped the soyuz 7 KL 3 was designed and developed in parallel to the soyuz 7 KL 1 but was also scrapped Soyuz 1 was plagued with technical issues and cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed when the spacecraft crashed during its return to Earth this was the first in-flight fatality in the history of spaceflight the next man version of the Soyuz was the soyuz 7 k Ochs it was designed for space station flights and had a docking port that allowed internal transfer between spacecraft the soyuz 7 k Ochs had to man flights both in 1971 soyuz 11 the second flight depressurized upon reentry killing its three-man crew topic second-generation the second generation called Soyuz Ferrier Soyuz 7kt comprised Soyuz 12 through Soyuz 40 1973 to 1981 it was developed out of the military Soyuz concept studied in previous years and was capable of carrying two cosmonauts with Sokol spacesuits after the Soyuz 11 accident several models were planned but none actually flew in space these versions were named Soyuz P Soyuz PPK Soyuz our Soyuz 7 kv and Soyuz OE s orbital research station the Soyuz 7kt a nine version was used for the flights to the military Alma's space station Soyuz seven KTM was the spacecraft used in the apollo-soyuz test project in 1975 which saw the first and only docking of a Soyuz spacecraft with an Apollo command/service module it was also flown in 1976 for the earth science mission Soyuz 22 so as seven KTM served as a technological bridge to the third generation topic third-generation the third-generation soy is t he Russian transport needs translate transport nee litt transport spacecraft 1976 to 1986

changes to accommodate requirements requested by NASA in order to service the International Space Station including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems it is also the first expendable vehicle to feature glass cockpit technology Soyuz TMA looks identical to a Soyuz TMA scraf thanh the outside but interior differences allow it to accommodate taller occupants with new adjustable crew couches topic Soyuz TMA M 2010 - 2016 the Soyuz TMA em was an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz TMA using a new computer digital interior displace updated docking equipment and the vehicles total mass was reduced by 70 kilograms the new version debuted on the 7th of October 2010 with the launch of TMAO one M carrying the ISS expedition 25 crew the Soyuz TMA Oh 8 M mission set a new record for the fastest man docking with a space station the mission used a new six hour rendezvous faster than the previous Soyuz launches which had since 1986 taken two days topic Soyuz ms since 2016 Soyuz ms is the final planned upgrade of the Soyuz spacecraft its maiden flight was in July 2016 with Mission MSO one major changes include more efficient solar panels modified docking and attitude control engine positions for redundancy during docking into orbit burns new 'krsna approach and docking system which weighs half as much and consumes a third of the power
