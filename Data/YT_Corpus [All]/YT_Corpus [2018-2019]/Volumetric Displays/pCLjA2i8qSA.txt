 the space shuttle solid rocket boosters SRBs were the first solid fuel motors to be used for primary propulsion on a vehicle used for human spaceflight and provided the majority of the space shuttles thrust during the first two minutes of flight after burnout they were jettisoned and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean where they were recovered examined refurbished and reused the SRBs were the most powerful solid rocket motors ever flown each provided a maximum 13,800 kilonewtons three million 100,000 lbf thrust roughly double the most powerful single combustion chamber liquid propellant rocket engine ever flown the Rocketdyne f1 with a combined mass of about 1 million 180 thousand kilograms 2,600,000 pounds they comprised over half the mass of the shuttle stack at liftoff the motor segments of the SRBs were manufactured by thiokol of Brigham City Utah which was later purchased by ATK the prime contractor for most other components of the SRBs as well as for the integration of all the components and retrieval of the spent SRBs was you SBI a subsidiary of Pratt & Whitney this contract was subsequently transitioned to United Space Alliance a limited liability company joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin out of 270 SRBs launched over the shuttle program all but four were recovered those from STS for to to a parachute malfunction and STS 5 1 l Challenger disaster over 5,000 parts were refurbished for reuse after each flight the final set of SRBs that launched STS 135 included parts that flew on 59 previous missions including STS 1 recovery also allowed post flight examination of the Boosters identification of anomalies and incremental design improvements topic overview the two reusable SRBs provided the main thrust to lift the shuttle off the launch pad and up to an altitude of about 150,000 feet 28 miles 46 kilometers while on the pad the two SRBs carried the entire weight of the external tank in orbiter and transmitted the weight load through their structure to the mobile launch platform each booster had a liftoff thrust of approximately two million eight hundred thousand pounds force 12 mega Newtons at sea level increasing shortly after liftoff to about three million 100,000 lbf 14 mega Newtons they were ignited after the three Space Shuttle main engines thrust level was verified seventy-five seconds after SRB separation SRB apogee occurred at an altitude of approximately 220 thousand feet 42 miles 67 km/h then deployed an impact occurred in the ocean approximately 122 nautical miles 226 kilometers downrange after which the two SRBs were recovered the SRBs helped take the space shuttle to an altitude of 28 miles in a speed of 3000 94 miles per hour along with the main engines the SRBs were the largest solid propellant motors ever flown in the first of such large rockets designed for reuse each is 149 point one six feet 45 point four six meters long and 12.1 seven feet three point seven one meters in diameter the SRBs committed the shuttle to liftoff in ascent to orbit flight without the possibility of launch or liftoff ascent abort until both motors had fully and simultaneously fulfilled their functions consumed their propellants were producing zero net reaction thrust and had been jettisoned again simultaneously by explosive jettisoning bolts from the remainder of the vehicle launch stack shuttle with engines fuel oxidizer tank only then could any conceivable set of launch or post liftoff abort procedures be contemplated in addition failure of an individual SRBs thrust output or ability to adhere to the design performance profile was not survivable each SRB weighed approximately 1 million three hundred thousand pounds 590 and kilograms at lunch the two SRBs constituted about 69 percent of the total liftoff mass the propellant for each solid rocket motor weighed approximately 1 million 100,000 pounds five hundred thousand kilograms the inert weight of each SRB was approximately two hundred thousand pounds 91 thousand kilograms primary elements of each booster were the motor including case propellant igniter and nozzle structure separation systems operational flight instrumentation recovery avionics pyrotechnics deceleration system thrust vector control system and Range Safety destruct system while the terms solid rocket motor and solid rocket booster are often used interchangeably in technical use they have specific meanings the term solid rocket motor applied to the propellant case igniter and nozzle solid rocket booster applied to the entire rocket assembly which included the rocket motor as well as the recovery parachutes electronic instrumentation separation rockets Range Safety destruct system and thrust vector control each booster was attached to the external tank at the SRB zaft frame by two lateral sway braces in a diagonal attachment the forward end of each SRB was attached to the external tank at the forward end of the SRBs forward skirt on the launch pad each booster also was attached to the mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four frangible nuts that were severed at liftoff the boosters were composed of seven individually manufactured steel segments these were assembled in pairs by the manufacturer and then shipped to Kennedy Space Center by rail for final assembly the segments were fixed together using circumferential tang clevis and clevis pin fastening and sealed with Oh ring z' originally to change to three after the Challenger disaster in 1986 and heat-resistant putty topic components you topic hold-down posts each solid rocket booster had four hold-down posts that fit into corresponding support posts on the mobile launcher platform hold down bolt held the SRB and lunch her platform posts together each bolt had a nut at each end the top one being a frangible nut the top nut contained two NASA standard detonators n s DS which were ignited at solid rocket motor ignition commands when the two NS DS were ignited at each hold down the hold down bolt traveled downward because of the release of tension in the bolt pre-tensioned before launch NS d gas pressure and gravity the bolt was stopped by the stud deceleration stand which contained sand the SRB bolt was 28 and 710 millimeters long in 3.5 and 89 millimeters in diameter the frangible nut was captured in a blast container the solid rocket motor ignition commands were issued by the orbiters computers through the master events controllers to the hold-down pyrotechnic initiator controllers picks on the mobile launcher platform they provided the ignition to the hold-down and s DS the launch processing system monitored the SRB hold down pics for low voltage during the last 16 seconds before launch pic low voltage would initiate a launch hold topic electrical power distribution electrical power distribution in each SRB consisted of orbiters supplied main DC bus power to each SRB via SRB buses labeled a B and C orbiter main DC buses a b and c supplied main DC bus power to corresponding SRB buses a B and C in addition orbiter main DC bus C supplied backup power to SRB buses a and B an orbiter bus B supplied backup power to SRB bus C this electrical power distribution arrangement allowed all SRB buses to remain powered in the event one orbiter main bus failed the nominal operating voltage was 28 plus or minus 4 volts DC topic hydraulic power units there were two self-contained independent hydraulic power units HP use on each SRB each HP you consisted of an auxiliary power unit a poo fuel supply module hydraulic pump hydraulic reservoir and hydraulic fluid manifold assembly the APUs were fueled by hydrazine and generated mechanical shaft power to drive a hydraulic pump that produced hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system the two separate HP use and two hydraulic systems were located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB Mazal and aft skirt the HPU components were mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators the two systems operated from t-minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank the two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the rock and tilt servo actuators the HPU controller electronics were located in the SRB aft integrated electronic assemblies on the aft external tank attach rains the HP use and their fuel systems were isolated from each other each fuel supply module tank contained 22 pounds 10 point o kilograms of hydrazine the fuel tank was pressurized with gaseous nitrogen at 400 psi 2.8 mega Pascal's which provided the force to expel positive expulsion the fuel from the tank to the fuel distribution line maintaining a positive fuel supply to the op boot throughout its operation in the oppo a fuel pump boosted the hydrazine pressure and fed it to a gas generator the gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot high-pressure gas a two stage turbine converted this into mechanical power driving a gearbox the waste gas now cooler and at low pressure was passed back over the gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard the gearbox drove the fuel pump its own lubrication pump and the HPU hydraulic pump as described so far the system could not sell start since the fuel pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel too accordingly a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the OP who speed was such that the fuel pump outlet sure exceeded that of the bypass line at which point all the fuel was supplied to the fuel pump when the a poufy Drita Appa primary control valve closed and the a poufy Dwoskin trolled by the OP to controller electronics if the primary control valve logic failed to the open state the secondary control valve assumed control of the op PO at 112 percent speed each HP yuan an SRB was connected to both servo actuators on that SRB by a switching valve that allowed the hydraulic power to be distributed from either HP you to both actuators if necessary each HP you served as the primary hydraulic source for one servo actuator and a secondary source for the other servo actuator each HP you possessed the capacity to provide hydraulic power to both servo actuators within percent 115 operational limits in the event that hydraulic pressure from the other HP you should drop below 2050 PSI 14.1 mega pascals a switch contact on the switching valve closed when the valve was in the secondary position when the valve was closed a signal was sent to the op PO controller that inhibited the 100% apoo speed control logic and enabled the 112 percent approve speed control logic the 100 percent up to speed enabled one Abu hpu to supply sufficient operating hydraulic pressure to both servo actuators of that SRB the OP to 100% speed corresponded to 72,000 revolutions per minute 110% to seventy nine thousand two hundred revolutions per minute and 112 percent to 80 thousand six hundred forty revolutions per minute the hydraulic pump speed was 3600 revolutions per minute and supplied hydraulic pressure of 3050 plus or minus 50 psi 21.0 3 plus or minus 0.3 4 mega pascals a high pressure relief valve provided overpressure protection to the hydraulic system and relieved at 3,750 PSI 25.9 mega pascals the APIs HP use and hydraulic systems were reusable for 20 missions topic thrust vector control each SRB had two hydraulic gimbal servo actuators to move the nozzle up down in side to side this provided thrust vectoring to help control the vehicle in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the ascent thrust vector control portion of the flight control system directed the thrust of the three shuttle main engines and that to SRB nozzles to control shuttle attitude and trajectory during liftoff and ascent commands from the guidance system were transmitted to the eight TVC ascent thrust vector control drivers which transmitted signals proportional to the commands to each servo actuator of the main engines and SRBs four independent flight control system channels and for atv siege annals controlled six main engine and four SRB eight TVC drivers with each driver controlling one hydraulic port on each main and SRB servo actuator each SRB servo actuator consisted of four independent two-stage servo valves that received signals from the drivers each servo valve controlled one power spool in each actuator which positioned an actuator Ram and the nozzle to control the direction of thrust the four servo valves in each actuator provided a forced some majority voting arrangement to position the power spool with four identical commands to the four servo valves the actuator forced some action prevented a single erroneous command from affecting power Ram motion if the erroneous command persisted for more than a predetermined time differential pressure sensing activated a selector valve to isolate and remove the defective servo valve hydraulic pressure permitting the remaining channels in servo valves to control the actuator Ram spool failure monitors were provided for each channel to indicate which channel had been bypassed an isolation valve on each channel provided the capability of resetting a failed or bypass channel each actuator RAM was equipped with transducers for position feedback to the thrust vector control system within each servo actuator Ram was a splashdown load relief assembly to cushion the nozzle at water splashdown and prevent damage to the nozzle flexible bearing you topic rate euro assemblies each SRB contained three rate gyro assemblies RGA s with each RG a containing one pitch in one yanira these provided an output proportional to angular rates about the pitch and yaw axis to the orbiter computers and guidance navigation and control system during first stage ascent flight in conjunction with the orbiter roll rate gyros until SRB separation at SRB separation a switchover was made from the SRB RG ace to the orbiter RGA s the SRB RGA rates passed through the orbiter flight aft multiplexers demultiplexers to the orbiter G pcs the RGA rates were then mid value selected in redundancy management to provide SRB pitch and yaw rates to the user software the RG A's were designed for 20 missions topic propellant the rocket propellant mixture in each solid rocket motor consisted of ammonium perchlorate oxidizer 69.6 percent by weight atomized aluminum powder fuel 16 percent iron oxide catalyst 0.4 percent pban binder also acts as fuel 12.0 4 percent and an epoxy curing agent 1.96 percent this propellant is commonly referred to as ammonium perchlorate composite propellant or simply a PCP this mixture gave the solid rocket motors a specific impulse of 242 seconds two point three seven kilometers per second at sea level or 268 seconds two point six three kilometers per second in a vacuum the main fuel aluminum was used because it has a reasonable specific energy density of about 30 1.0 mega joules per kilogram but a high volumetric energy density and is difficult to ignite accidentally the propellant had an 11-point star-shaped perforation in the forward motor segment and a double truncated cone perforation in each of the aft segments and aft closure this configuration provided high thrust at ignition and then reduced the thrust by approximately a third 50 seconds after liftoff to avoid over stressing the vehicle during maximum dynamic pressure max Q topic function you topic ignition SRB ignition can occur only when a manual lock pin from each SRB safe and armed device has been removed the ground crew removes the pin during pre-launch activities at t-minus five minutes the SRB safe and armed device is rotated to the arm position the solid rocket motor ignition commands are issued when the three Space Shuttle main engines ssmes are at or above 90 percent rated thrust no ssme fail and/or SRB ignition pyrotechnic initiator controller pick low voltage as indicated and there are no holes from the launch processing system LPS the solid rocket motor ignition commands are sent by the orbiter computers through the master events controllers mechs to the safe and armed device NASA standard detonators NSD s in each SRB a pick single channel capacitor discharge device controls the firing of each pyrotechnic device three signals must be present simultaneously for the pic to generate the pyro firing output these signals armed fire 1 and fire 2 originate in the orbiter general-purpose computers G pcs and are transmitted to the max the mechs reformat them to 28 volt DC signals for the pics the arm signal charges the pick capacitor to 40 volts DC minimum of 20 volts DC the GPC launch sequence also controls certain critical main propulsion system valves and monitors the engine ready indications from the ssmes the MPs start commands are issued by the onboard computers at t-minus six point six seconds staggered start engine 3 engine 2 engine 1 all approximately within 0.25 of a second and the sequence monitors the thrust build-up of each engine all 3 ssmes must reach the required 90% thrust within 3 seconds otherwise an orderly shutdown is commanded and safing functions are initiated normal thrust build-up to the required 90% thrust level will result in the ssmes being commanded to the liftoff position at t-minus 3 seconds as well as the fire 1 command being issued to arm the SRBs at t-minus 3 seconds the vehicle based bending load modes are allowed to initialize referred to as the Twain movement of approximately 25.5 in 650 millimetres measured at the tip of the external tank with movement towards the external tank the fired two commands caused the redundant NS DS to fire through a thin barrier sealed down a flame tunnel this ignites a pyro booster charge which is retained in the safe and armed device behind a perforated plate the booster charge ignites the propellant in the igniter initiator in combustion products of this propellant ignite the solid rocket motor initiator which fires down the entire vertical length of the solid rocket motor igniting the solid rocket motor propellant along its entire surface area instantaneously at t-minus zero the two SRBs are ignited under command of the four on-board computers separation of the four explosive bolts on each SRB as initiated the two T zero umbilicals one on each side of the spacecraft are retracted the onboard master timing unit event timer and mission event timers are started the three SS mes are at 100% and the ground launch sequence is terminated topic liftoff in a scent timing sequence referencing an ignition is critical for a successful liftoff in ascent flight the explosive hold down bolts relieved through the launch support pedestals and pad structure the asymmetric vehicle dynamic loads caused by the ssme ignition and thrust build up and applied thrust bearing loads without the hold down bolts the ssmes would violently tip the flight stack orbiter external tank SRBs over under the external tank that rotating moment is initially countered by the hold bolts prior to release of the vehicle stack for liftoff the SRBs must simultaneously ignite and pressurize their combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles to produce a thrust derived net counter rotating moment exactly equal to the ssmes rotating moment with the SRBs reaching full thrust the hold-down bolts are blown releasing the vehicle stack the net rotating moment is zero and the net vehicle thrust opposing gravity is positive lifting the orbiter stack vertically from the launch pedestal controllable through the coordinated gimbal movements of the ssmes and the SRB exhaust nozzles during ascent multiple all axis accelerometers detect and report the vehicle's flight and orientation referencing the flight deck aboard the orbiter as the flight reference computers translate navigation commands steering to a particular way point in space and at a particular time into engine and motor nozzle gimbal commands which orient the vehicle about its center of mass as the forces on the vehicle change due to propellant consumption increasing speed changes in aerodynamic drag and other factors the vehicle automatically adjusts its orientation in response to its dynamic control command inputs the net result is a relatively smooth and constant then gradually decreasing gravitational pull due to acceleration coupled with a diminishing aerodynamic friction as the upper atmosphere is reached and surpassed topic separation the SRBs are jettisoned from the space shuttle at high altitude about 146 thousand feet 45 kilometers RB separation is initiated when the three solid rocket motor chamber pressure transducers are processed in the redundancy management middle value select and the head end chamber pressure of both SRBs is less than or equal to 50 psi three hundred forty kilo Pascal's a backup Q is the time elapsed from booster ignition the separation sequence is initiated commanding the thrust vector control actuators to the null position and putting the main propulsion system into a second stage configuration 0.8 second from sequence initialization which ensures the thrust of each SRB is less than 100,000 lbf 440 kilonewtons orbiter yaw attitude has held for four seconds an SRB thrust drops to less than 60,000 lbf 270 kilonewtons the SRB separate from the external tank within 30 milliseconds of the ordnance firing command the forward attachment point consists of a ball SRB and socket external tank ét held together by one bolt the bolt contains one NSD pressure cartridge at each end the forward attachment point also carries the Range Safety System cross strapped wiring connecting each SRB are SS and the et are SS with each other the aft attachment points consist of three separate struts upper diagonal and lower each strut contains one bolt with an MSD pressure cartridge at each end the upper strut also carries the umbilical interface between its SRB and the external tank and unto the orbiter there are four booster separation motors on each end of each SRB the BSM separate the SRBs from the external tank the solid rocket motors in each cluster of four are ignited by firing redundant and SD pressure cartridges in two redundant confined detonating fuse manifolds the separation commands issued from the orbiter by the SRB separation sequence initiate the redundant NSD pressure cartridge in each bolt and ignite the vsms to effect a clean separation you topic range safety system a range safety system RSS provides for destruction of a rocket or part of it with onboard explosives by remote command if the rocket is out of control in order to limit the danger to people on the ground from crashing pieces explosions fire poisonous substances etc the RSS was only activated once during the space shuttle Challenger disaster 37 seconds after the breakup of the vehicle when the SRBs were in uncontrolled flight the shuttle vehicle had to RSS's one in each SRB both were capable of receiving to command messages arm and fire transmitted from the ground station the RSS was used only when the shuttle vehicle violates a lunch trajectory red line an RSS consists of two antenna couplers command receivers decoders a dual distributor a safe and armed device with two NASA standard detonators and SD to confined detonating fuse manifolds CD f7 CDF assemblies in one linear shaped charge LSC the antenna couplers provide the proper impedance for radio frequency and ground support equipment commands the command receivers are tuned to RSS command frequencies and provide the input signal to the distributors when an RSS command is sent the command decoders use a code plug to prevent any command signal other than the proper command signal from getting into the distributors the distributors contain the logic to supply valid destruct commands to the RSS pyrotechnics the NS DS provide the spark to ignite the CDF which in turn ignites the LSC for booster destruction the safe and armed device provides mechanical isolation between the N SDS and the CDF before launch and during the SRB separation sequence the first message called armed allows the onboard logic to enable a destruct and illuminates a light on the flight deck display and control panel at the commander and pilot station the second message transmitted as the fire command the SRB distributors in the SRBs are cross strapped together thus if one SRB received an arm or destruct signal the signal would also be sent to the other SRB electrical power from the RSS battery in each SRB is routed to RSS system a the recovery battery in each SRB is used to power RSS system B as well as the recovery system in the SRB the SRB RSS is powered down during the separation sequence and the SRB recovery system is powered up topic descent and recovery the SRBs are jettisoned from the shuttle system at two minutes and an altitude of about 140 six thousand feet forty four kilometers to rise to about 220 thousand feet 67 kilometers the SRBs begin to fall back to earth and once back in the denser atmosphere are slowed by a parachute system to prevent damage on ocean impact a command is sent from the orbiter to the SRB just before separation to apply battery power to the recovery logic Network a second simultaneous command arms the three nose cap thrusters for deploying the pilot and drogue parachute the frustum ring detonator for main parachute deployment and the main parachute disconnect ordnance the recovery sequence begins with the operation of the high-altitude burrow switch which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters this ejects the nose cap which deploys the pilot parachute nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15,000 704 feet 4,700 87 meters about 218 seconds after SRB separation the 11.5 feet 3.5 meters diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps this allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position at full extension of the 12 105 feet 32 meters suspension lines the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy and the 54 feet 16 meters diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition the drogue dish reefs twice after specified time delays using redundant 7 and 12 second reefing line cutters and it reorients stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment the drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315 thousand pounds 143 thousand kilograms and weighs approximately 1,200 pounds 540 kilograms after the drogue chute has stabilized the SRB in the tail first attitude the frustum is separated from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low altitude Burroughs at a nominal altitude of 5,500 feet 1700 meters about two hundred forty three seconds after SRB separation the frustum is then pulled away from the SRB by the drogue chute the main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum at full extension of the lines which are 203 feet 62 meters long the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reef condition the frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splash down after specified time delays using redundant 10 and 17 second reefing line cutters the main chute reefing lines are cut in the chutes inflate to their second reefed in full open configurations the main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions each of the 136 feet 41 meters diameter 20 degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195 thousand pounds 88,000 kilograms and each weighs approximately 2,000 180 pounds 990 kilograms these parachutes are the largest that have ever been used both in deployed size and load weight the rsrm nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation water impact occurs about 279 seconds after SRB separation at a nominal velocity of 76 feet per second 23 meters per second the water impact range is approximately 130 nmi 240 kilometers off the eastern coast of Florida because the parachutes provide for a nozzle first impact air is trapped in the empty burned out motor casing causing the booster to float with the forward end approximately 30 feet 9.1 meters out of the water formerly the main chutes were released from the SRB at impact using a parachute release nut ordnance system residual loads in the main chutes would deploy the parachute attach fittings with floats tethered to each fitting the current design keeps the main chutes attached during water impact initial impact and slap down salt water activated release SW AR devices are now incorporated in the main chute riser lines to simplify recovery efforts and reduce damage to the SRB the drogue deployment bag pilot parachutes drogue parachutes and frustums each main chute and the SRBs are buoyant and are recovered specially fitted NASA recovery ships the MV freedom star and the MV Liberty star recover the SRBs and descent recovery hardware once the boosters are located the diver operated plug dop is maneuvered by divers into place to plug the SRB nozzle and drain the water from the motor case pumping air into and water out of the SRB causes the SRB to change from a nose up floating position to a horizontal attitude more suitable for towing the retrieval vessels then tow the boosters and other objects recovered back to Kennedy Space Center Topic Challenger disaster the loss of space shuttle Challenger originated with a system failure of one of its SRBs the cause of the accident was found by the Rogers Commission to be a faulty design unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors of the SRB joints compounded by unusually cold weather the morning of the flight the Commission found that the large rubber o-rings in SRB joints were not effective at low temperatures like those of the January 1986 morning of the accident 36 degrees Fahrenheit 2.2 degrees Celsius a cold compromised joint in the right SRB failed at launch and eventually allowed hot gases from within that rocket booster to sear a hole into the adjacent main external fuel tank and also weaken the lower strut holding the SRB to the external tank the leak in the SRB joint caused a catastrophic failure of the lower strut and partial detachment of the SRB which led to a collision between the SRB and the external tank with a disintegrating external tank and severely off axis thrust from the right SRB traveling at a speed of Mach 1.9 to at 46 thousand feet 14 kilometers the space shuttle stack disintegrated and was enveloped in an explosive burn ie rapid deflagration of the liquid propellants from the external tank concerns were briefed by the SRB manufacturer due to the cold temperatures but were overridden due to resistance from NASA managers to change launch criteria at such a late stage in launch preparation during the subsequent downtime detailed structural analyses were performed on critical structural elements of the SRB analyses were primarily focused in areas where anomalies had been noted during post flight inspection of recovered Hardware one of the areas was the attachment ring where the SRBs are connected to the external tank areas of distress were noted in some of the fasteners where the ring attaches to the SRB motor case this situation was attributed to the high loads encountered during water impact to correct the situation and ensure higher strength margins during ascent the attached ring was redesigned to encircle the motor case completely 360 degrees previously the attachment ring formed see shape and encircled the motor case just 270 degrees additionally special structural tests were performed on the aft skirt during this test program an anomaly occurred in a critical weld between the hold-down post and skin of the skirt a redesign was implemented to add reinforcement brackets and fittings in the after ring of the skirt these two modifications added approximately 450 pounds 200 kilograms to the weight of each SRB the result is called a redesigned solid rocket motor our SRM topic construction the prime contractor for the SRB motor segments was ATK launch systems wasatch division based in magna Utah United space boosters Inc

motor a SRM project NASA was planning on replacing the post Challenger SRBs with a new advanced solid rocket motor a SRM to be built by Aerojet at a new facility designed by subcontractor rust international on the location of a cancelled Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power plant at yellow creek mississippi the ASRM would have produced additional thrust in order to increase shuttle payload so that it could carry modules in construction components to the ISS the ASRM program was cancelled in 1993 after robotic assembly systems and computers were on site and approximately two billion dollars spent in favor of continued use after design flaw Corrections of the SRB topic filament wound cases in order to provide the necessary performance to launch polar-orbiting shuttles from the SLC six Launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California SRBs using filament wound cases FWC were designed to be more lightweight than the steel case is used on Kennedy Space Center lunched SRBs unlike the regular SRBs which had the flawed field joint design that led to the Challenger disaster in 1986 the FWC boosters had the double tang joint design necessary to keep the Boosters properly in alignment during the Twain movement when the ssmes are ignited prior to liftoff but used the two o-ring seals with the closure of SLC six the FWC boosters were scrapped by ATK and NASA but they're filled joints albeit modified to incorporate the current three o-ring seals and joint heaters were later incorporated into the present-day field joints on the current SR B's topic 5 segment booster prior to the destruction of the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 NASA investigated the replacement of the current four segment SRBs with either a five segment SRB design or replacing them all together with liquid fly back boosters using either Atlas V or Delta four AEL V technologies the five segment SRB which would have required little change to the current shuttle infrastructure would have allowed the Space Shuttle to carry an additional 20,000 pounds 9,000 100 kilograms of payload in an International Space Station inclination orbit eliminate the dangerous return to launch site RTLS and transoceanic abort tall modes and by using a so-called dogleg maneuver fly south to north polar orbiting flights from Kennedy Space Center after the destruction of Columbia NASA shelled the five segment SRB for the shuttle program and the three surviving orbiters discovery Atlantis and endeavour were retired in 2011 after the completion of the International Space Station one five segment engineering test motor ET MO three was fired on October 23rd 2003 as part of the constellation program the first stage of the Ares I rocket was planned to use five segments SRBs in September 2009 a five segment space shuttle SRB was static fired on the ground in ATK's desert testing area in Utah after the constellation program was cancelled in 2011 the new Space Launch System SLS was designated to use five segment boosters the first test of SRB for SLS was completed in early 2015 a second test was performed in mid-2016 at orbital ATK's promontory Utah facility topic displays space shuttles solid rocket boosters are undisplaced Center visitors complex in Florida the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County Mississippi the United States Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville Alabama and at orbital ATK's facility near promontory Utah a partial filament wound booster case is on display at Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson Arizona you topic future and proposed uses over time several proposals to reuse the SRB design were presented however as of 2016 none of these proposals progressed to regular flights before being cancelled until the 2019 planned first flight of the Space Launch System SLS a sole test flight of the Ares IX prototype in 2009 was the farthest any of these proposals progressed topic Ares NASA initially planned to reuse the four segment SRB design and infrastructure in several Ares rockets which would have propelled the Orion spacecraft into orbit in 2005 NASA announced the shuttle-derived launch vehicle slated to carry the Orion crew exploration vehicle into low-earth orbit and later to the moon the SRB derived crew launch vehicle CLV named ares i was planned to feature a single modified four segment SRB for its first stage a single liquid fueled modified space shuttle main engine would have powered the second stage the Ares I design updated in 2006 featured one five segment SRB originally developed for the shuttle but never used as a first stage the second stage was powered by an uprated j-2x engine derived from the j2 which had been used in the upper stage of Saturn V and Saturn if in place of the standard SRB nose cone the Ares I would have a tapered interstage assembly connecting the booster proper with the second stage an attitude control system derived from the Regulus missile system and larger heavier parachutes to lower the stage into the Atlantic Ocean for recovery also introduced in 2005 was a heavy lift cargo launch vehicle see a LV named Ares V early designs of the Ares V utilized five standard production ssmes and a pair of five segment boosters identical to those proposed for the shuttle while later plans redesigned the boosters around the -68 rupee's rocket engine used on the delta 4 AE L V system initially NASA switched over to a system using the five segment boosters in a cluster of five rs-68 which resulted in a widening of the Ares V core unit then NASA reconfigured the vehicle with six - sixty eight billion rupees engines with the boosters themselves becoming 5.5 segment boosters with an additional half segment to provide additional thrust at liftoff that final redesign would have made the Ares V booster taller and more powerful than the now-retired Saturn V in 20 n1 and enter here rockets and would have allowed the Ares V to place both the earth departure stage and Altair spacecraft into low Earth orbit for later on-orbit assembly unlike the five segment SRB for the the 5.5 segment boosters for the Ares V were to be identical in design construction and function to the current SR B's except for the extra segments like the shuttle boosters the Ares V boosters would fly in almost identical flight trajectory from launch to splashdown the constellation program including Ares I and Ares V was canceled in October 2010 by the passage of the 2010 NASA Authorization bill topic direct the direct proposal for a new shuttle-derived launch vehicle unlike the Ares I in Ares V boosters uses a pair of classic 4 segments SRBs with the ssmes used on the shuttle topic Athena 3 in 2008 planet space proposed the Athena 3 launch vehicle for ISS resupply flights under the cots program it would have featured two-and-a-half segments from the original SRB design topic Space Launch System SLS the first versions blocks 1 and 1b of the Space Launch System SLS are planned to use a pair of five segment solid rocket boosters SRBs which were developed from the four segments SRBs used for the shuttle modifications for the sls included the addition of a center booster segments new avionics and new insulation which eliminates the shuttle sr B's asbestos and as 860 kilograms 1,900 pounds lighter the 5 segment SRBs provide approximately 25% more total impulse than the shuttle SRB and will not be recovered after years topic labeled diagram you topic C also solid rocket booster pep con disaster
