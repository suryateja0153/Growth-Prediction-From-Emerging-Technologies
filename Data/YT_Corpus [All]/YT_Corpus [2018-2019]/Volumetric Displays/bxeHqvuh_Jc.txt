 [Music] Oh welcome back today we are going to talk about the machine applix we are starting a new second face of our course and mission haptics so far we have been looking at the human haptics part of it whatever we have learnt in human haptics we are going to use it to simulate the haptics part of it so before we see the human haptics again if you look at just to summarize what we have been learning is specifically about the human hand is that human hand has large number of degrees of freedom you are talking about now 23 or 24 degrees of freedom and extreme sensitivity of the cutaneous receptors specifically in the finger pad the Kootenays receptors are extremely sensitive and when we design machine haptics we have to achieve this kind of cutaneous receptors sensitivities the joints if you look at it the joints are sensors and actuators without frictions so very very less frictions okay so in our missions haptics also we have to achieve this kind of frictionless sensors and actuators and the control systems when we look at it it is highly adaptive control systems ok we are going to see how of what kind of control systems we are going to develop for haptic devices and also how to make it turn our adaptive control system for those haptic devices ok so if you look at the the way we we handle objects it can be divided into three different grasp over type of the graphs one is the contact grasp where we can use only one finger and our thumb alone or no hands for the purpose of contacting objects okay hand in our combing condition these are the different contact group contact grasp precision grabs where we emphasis on their control that's okay so minimum we use two fingers for precision graphs or three fingers for equally distributed precision grabs our five fingers or an eye equally distributed five different fingers on and then power grasp where we emphasis on the force generated in the human hands two fingers can generate some force three fingers can generate more force four fingers or the entire hands can be used now when we generate how are we going to enable this in the Machine haptics is what we are going to see it is a very complex task and it took the research I started about 1960s it's a very sixty years old topic how the research evolved is also we are going to see in the human machine haptics okay so this cycle if we look at it this is what we had understood in the earlier class where we focused on the human haptics and the same thing is what replicated in the machine haptics in the human haptics essentially if you look at the only contact purpose of the grasping when an user is touching an object let us say it is a real object the contact forces are sensed by the mechanoreceptors and the mechanoid receptors are conveyed to the brain where we perceive and we react to the the perception using the motor commands and the motor commands are given to the muscles the muscle generate forces and motions and that is how the hand moves and perceives objects the same thing we can convert it into machine haptics where where the motions suppose if the the human finger is attached to the end effector of a robotic device this robotic device movement can be sensed by the sensors movement sensors and the that that is going to give the position information to the computer the computer can generate torque and then actuators can apply force to the end effector and that will be the end effector will be resisting the movement of the user that is how we can feel the forces this is one way of machine haptics this is called the now kinesthetic devices because we are using the only the kinesthetic sensors over here the joint sensors where the position information is inferred and that is what is control that is called the kinetic device another classes of haptic devices is the tactile device where there will be an array of pins it will move up and down depending upon the the profile of the surface it can generate that's the tactile devices there's two different classes of devices are in heartache machine haptics we will focus on kinesthetic devices in today's class later on we will focus on the the tactile devices so we are all aware of computer mouse with a very short introduction to water haptic devices can we differentiate between a computer mouse and a haptic device so we have the computer over here let us say this is a computer we have the user over here as a user and we have the computer mouse over here so the user user see the computer and he uses the mouse and the mouse interact with the mouse interacts with a computer probably the user also can view back the visual feedback given to the user that is a very simple you know model of the mouse what will happen if it is a haptic device we are talking about the the kinesthetic device suppose if we have this computer again and if you have the user again again user can interact with the with a computer and just like most the haptic device also is going to be attached to the fingertip of the user and this is going to be connected to the computer so it is almost like a computer mouse what could be the difference the difference is that the haptic device not only sensing this is sensing the position sensing the position of the user right so it not only senses the position but also feedbacks the user force feedback to the user so the simultaneous sensing as well as actuation is the you know very important distinction between a haptic device and other devices or that sensing devices think about your cell phone cell phone again it's a touchscreen we call it as but again the touchscreen it is acting like only they're sensing the position it is not going to know give you touch feedback at all so as Apple calls their iPhone devices as a haptic device that is technically wrong it is not going to give you force feedback depending upon the position it is giving you a gentle feedback it is simple vibration it's like you're not touching a button or whatever that vibration is a very very limited wiper of tactile feedback it is not a haptic feedback haptic feedback we are going to see in detail that it has to give a force feedback ok vibrotactile feedback is not the force feedback you are going to see their differences over here so the simultaneous sensing as well as the force feedback is one of the important characteristic of a haptic device now let us look at the model of a user in a haptic system okay so essentially let us say we have the device kinesthetic device and here we have the user the the user moves the finger and therefore is giving a position out to the device position and is input to that kinetic device and the cholestatic device generates a force output and that is going to be given to the user that is the in a kinesthetic haptic device if you model the user so the force output is coming from the kinesthetic device and this force output is changing stretching the skin tactile let us say tactile system as well as the the kinaesthetic system so we SP whoa is the let us say this is a spontaneous reaction spontaneous spontaneous reaction of the user further force which is coming from the device and he is also perceiving because of the forces he's a he's perceiving the forces let us say that perception of the forces is K and that is given to the CNS perception system and there is a reaction to the the perception under reaction is converted into action to the muscle and joints and that reaction is going to be let us say induced induced reaction the spontaneous reaction is the unintended reaction voluntary reaction this is the induced reaction conscious reaction together they are all summed up so we get a final V out and this final out we out we can convert that into now X out position output and that is what given to their the user this is one simple model of of user using their kinesthetic device okay the same thing if you look at for the tactile device this is for the tactile device this for the kinesthetic device so in the tactile device what he is doing is we are going to keep the finger on the array of pins so you are going to move it you're going to let's say apply force onto the tactile devices and the tactile devices are going to move the pins up and down depending upon the configuration you want to see let's say a brain system okay that's our typical tactile system right so in this case how are we going to model the user again the position output is coming from the tactile devices and this tactile device let us say that is converted into no v out velocity out using the differentiation and that differentiation is again and sensed by the the skin and for so here the user is perceiving the the user is has a perception of the tactical device and the perception is converted into reaction this again an induced reaction rate induced reaction voluntary reaction and then voluntary reaction is moving the fingertip on the fingertip movement is is summed up and then the resultant velocity is what given to the skin and then that is what the user is actually perceiving this perception is again there's a whole cycle of it okay so that is a tactile device is model of a user okay what we will be focusing is only on the kinesthetic device now this model of the user we can consider that as a na all those abstracts can be converted into a transfer function looking from the system's point of view we can turn make it as a transfer function of each of the small blocks and this transfer function so if we can find out and we can have a much better control of the devices and that is one of the important and stages of machine haptics that is also involved in the human haptics how are we going to evaluate each of these transfer functions okay that says no it's still an active research and people are still struggling to find out how to find out the the transfer functions or of each of the the blocks okay this is for kinesthetic system and then next light is for no tactile systems we will see in details in the coming classes but I hope you see how we are approaching the machine haptics all right so now we have an idea about how we want to go about it but the one of the major important and challenge in the human haptics is the the actuator okay so any mechanical device will of its own intrinsic properties so it will have friction it will have mass compliance viscosity but what we are looking for is that no then no device on a cheater we the friction an actuator without mass an actuator which can deliver a lot of very high Ranger for compliances or a very less right amount of viscosity okay so these are all ideal conditions with ideal conditions only we can design a better haptic device so visual interfaces exploit the limitations of the visual apparatus you you are watching this display the visual display which is flickering at 30 Hertz those of you are watching the video it may be flickering you know 60 Hertz and that 60 Hertz is is decided exploiting the the limitations of the visual apparatus similarly can we find out what is the limitation from the our haptic systems which we can also exploit in the design of the haptic systems so in the human haptics we studied that we need at least thousand Hertz in order to in order to make the user not feel the vibration that could be equivalent to 30 Hertz in the way in the in the visual systems whereas in the haptic systems we are going to talk about the thousand Hertz update rate human haptics systems has also limitations and that limitations a lot of limitations one of the limitation limitations is that and until thousand Hertz we will be feeling the vibrations just like the visual systems so we need to understand the biomechanics sensory motor systems leading to the perceptions that is what we have done in the human haptic systems we will use lot of those numbers from the human haptic systems these are all some of the already available haptic devices one of the first haptic devices which came into market sometime in 1990s is this force-feedback joysticks okay I think I'm I have a no very nice personal anecdote of now working with thee the inventor of the first force-feedback joystick it was a lady okay that Marcus she's alumnus of MIT she started this company very small company okay she made this the force-feedback joystick and then sold it to sold it to Microsoft for a huge money there was a time the dot-com and our bubble is yet to come okay she made a lot of money and then she started making more companies and then invested in a lot of one on comm companies and then finally it was a she lost almost all the money back okay so I had a chance to work on this first force-feedback joystick when Microsoft was sued by one of the another companies is for designing and for the patent on this first force-feedback joysticks so we had to make some demonstrations and to make it as a legal case and then produce it in the you know court to win the case so that is one of the first force-feedback joysticks and then came no force feedback my mouse have you seen this so you know the ordinary computer mouse will not resist your moments but suppose if the position of the mouse can be restricted in a 2d okay so that using your 2d haptic device that is the computer mouse okay so there are exoskeletons again one of the earlier ones or major challenge with the exoskeleton is that you can see that the amount of no linkages and then actuators in the human hand its enormous what we want is all these devices should be no as light as possible in fact a zero mass is what our ideal requirement is that is not at all possible so you have to the user has to carry all this masses and it is going to generate a small force on your finger that is going to be killing the the feeling of the emotion the feeling of the purpose of the haptic devices similarly the you know cyber glow also so we are going to review all this machine haptic interfaces in a detail later those are the know one of the few reason exoskeletons one of the earlier 2d haptic device is called the pantograph sorry so this pantograph has a parallel architecture the user is holding over here and he moves in two dimensions and there are two actuators for one arm or one actuator for one arm another actuator for another arm so there are two actuators which is controlling the position of the X and y axis this is from Kennedy and Kennedy and academic Institute which is very well known called the pantographs we have again we are going to see in detail I Drive for navigation is one of the latest haptic device but it is a one degree of freedom I know how many of you have heard about P BMW in the latest versions has this device is called the I Drive okay so just hold the knob over here while driving is essentially in the euro if you look at it the roads are very very fine you can drive the car at you know 200 kilometers per hour alright so when you are traveling at 200 or 300 km/h yeah very small mistake you do if you take off your eyes from the road off of you're in great danger so now we need a lot of interfaces to help the user or the driver to manipulate objects in the car without taking the eyes off from the roll so there are AC switches there are a fan and radio there are so many controls in the dashboard of the car okay but the user has to know access it but he can't take their eyes off the road okay one way is is using this I Drive you just know reach it and then navigate all the controls in the dashboard using only one point contact okay so it has a one degree of freedom using this simple haptic feedback you can control many of the things okay so even though it was considered as no major technology BMW had this device in most of the cars at the latest edition of the BMW this is not there okay so it may be a good exercise for you to find out why BMW did not include the I Drive in the latest cars I would like you to think about it the market leader in the haptic devices is called the sensible phantom okay so sensible phantom you hold this stylus like like a pen and then move this manipulator and this device is going to give you a resistance this is this device is is a startup company from MIT and still it is the leader in the haptic devices each one is a you know this is a three degree of freedom force feedback but it's a sensing is six degree of freedom okay sensing is different from the actuation back okay so sensing can be no six degree of freedom but no force feedback is only three degree of freedom this are all the higher end here it is going to be no work space is going to be more more force it can generate okay this is even higher version and this is even higher version and there is one version this is one point five there is one version now 6.0 also is there okay so six point zero is going to be as tall as a human being okay and we can move our hands in a large workspace okay that cost is very very high we are going to study in detail how this phantom is working okay one of the cheapest devices in the market is called the no winter falcon again is as one of the inventors of there's no bean falcon is from MIT it costs just two hundred dollars or two hundred years it's now resolution is very poor the force feedback also is very poor and what space also is very poor it's a very small work space okay and it's again a thread of thread of position sensing as well as see no force feedback both of things again we are going to see how to make a very simple haptic device as a part of this course okay so recently there are new players apart from the sensible phantom they are called no force dimensions which can give you no more forces and there are three dog versions and there are six divisions and again we are going to see different architectures of the optic devices these are all parallel architectures where the phantom one which you have seen earlier that's all those serial architectures we are going to see what are the different kinematic chains use to develop develop haptic devices most of the things Oh with this devices all the any haptic devices can be considered as a advanced robotic devices okay we are also going to see what is the difference between the robotic device and haptic device okay so all this concept the robotic device students and so can we'll find out a lot of commonality between the the haptic device design and the robotic devices and you'll find and what more is needed in order to design your haptic device it's much more challenging than just develop in your haptic robotic device okay these are the specifications of the Delta 3 DAF again the maximum force it can give you is the 20 Newton 20 Newton is about how much 2 kg if you can hold a 2 kg weight that much force it can give you in each of the degree of freedoms they have a recent version of Omega again the difference is that six degree of freedom and they have no 12 Newton which is much lesser and it is using that Delta based a kinematics those of robotic students will understand it's a parallel specifically Delta structure kinematic structure okay we are going to see different type of the haptic devices as where or one and device is called the haptic masters I guess is very well known it's a very distinct different from all the existing haptic devices it is the isometric device it is also called the admittance device we are going to see when we are talking about the different control systems in the city for the haptic devices you're going to use either impedance devices or admittance devices most of the haptic devices available in the market use the impedance control whereas haptic master is using the admittance control we are going to see different isometry this is impedance as well as the admittance in the coming classes okay this is our one and a haptic device which we have designed specifically for the laparoscopic surgical simulator this is a no this is for one hand this for the another hand each hand is a five degree of freedom sensing as well as the the force feedback both sensing as well as the force feedback the work space requirement is as dictated by the laparoscopic surgeons whatever they wanted that has been incorporated incorporated over here if such a device has to be bought imported from other countries it cost about two crore whereas you know in IIT Madras the whole device has been fabricated within the campus okay and it cost much less than they know now finance okay let's say no innovation we could bring it so that device has been put in the inside the small box over here and the final device what the doctors will use is going to be something like this okay this is one of the our research collars using this device okay all the commercially existing devices can be compared in two different axes suppose if you compare in the x-axis of how much force they are generating and in the y-axis how much is a work space okay so our sensible phantom is somewhere over here Desktop phantom sensible phantom is precision power and 230 years there's a sensible phantom bounzer ya know in falcon it's over here these are all over here sensible phantom okay the the little higher version is going to be here even more little higher version is going to be over here okay so where is if you look at the if you look at the another device called the the haptic master it is going to be over here it can generate no very large force and the workspace also is very high compared to the other devices so most of the devices are over here there's our mittens time yes so we this device if you look at it there's a immersion corporation it's a force range is very less but it can have a very large work space depending upon the the range of the work space and the force it can generate the cost also very these are all commercial devices but there are devices available in the laboratory system okay again x-axis force vs. so workspace if you look at it and that there are no exoskeletons which can have a large amount of forces policy work space there are Renault in the for example this device it's again like a like [Music] exoskeleton but the force it can generate is very very less and it's work space can be very high again the problems with the exoskeletons all those devices can be divided into two categories one is the drone based grounder or ungrounded so if you look at this devices it's it's grounded it is staying on the ground so any force it is generating it has to be no compensated by the reaction force the reaction force can be transmitted to the ground whereas the forces you are generating in the exoskeleton they're all ungrounded in fact it is called a bodily grounded so the generated force has to be no compensated by the reaction force on your skin okay so those are the challenges if you have a force which is generating on the finger if you have a small exoskeleton then whatever the force you are generating it has to be transmitted over here itself the reaction force has to be transmitted over here okay so is will that destroy the immersion will that destroy the purpose of generating the haptic feedback that's all the question this other challenges no researchers are still facing so there are no cost ways we can compare it it can go up $2 an hour 50,000 which each device can cost about 25 lakhs ok so sensible omni maybe it's about $2,000 or 3 $2,500 off now ok now in Falcon as I told you it is $200 ok other vibrotactile devices can be much more a simple simple vibrotactile device it can be even no wonderful but it can develop only d-wave or tactile feedback not the naughty haptic feedback okay so in all these things as I told you actuator is a major issue so we are still searching for the ideal actuator and the whole of the one important challenge in the haptic device if you ask me that is the now finding the the right actuator ideal actuator we are still to invent an ideal actuator for the haptic devices okay so without intrusion how are we going to generate the force feedback that's the challenge okay so we need to find out the position so we need to find out the the trackers in order to give you the range and resolution and the bandwidth whichever we have learnt in the human haptics all those things know without the intrusion we need to find out it we need to find out the positions okay and then when you are generating the forces and thoughts again actuators is going to be a challenge again we know the range and resolution and bandwidth of the forces which the human can sense can we find out actuator which can match this requirements frictionless and backlash backlash in the sense when you turn front and back there should not be any no change in the position T there should not be any no gap okay if you use a gear devices there's a small gap as a backlash okay so so gears cannot be used in haptic device at all okay if you cannot use a gear then what are how are we going to generate force and then transmit the force so all those details we will study in the later classes again as we said mass has to be zero they inertia has to be zero that is not possible okay how are we going to overcome all those challenges the rigorous control of the vibration and an adaptive control this also challenges so each of these challenges which we are going to see it in the later classes okay as far as the control system is concerned again for those students who have taken the robotics classes okay if you if you if you see you can classify all the control system for robotics into now majorly for classifications one of the motion control where you can control either the position velocity or acceleration or the force control where we can explicitly control the forces or the implicitly control the forces in the explicitly control forces again we can have a open loop our closed loop in the closed loop we can find out whether the force based explicit force control or motion based explicit force control again I will go into the details it instead of controlling the force I think most of the robotic control systems are force control based which is not going to be useful for us we are going to see that the impedance control is now we need I think in the human haptics class we talked about why impedance control is necessary okay in the impedance control again we can have two different types impedance control without the force feedback impedance control with force feedback and then finally they are hybrid of any of these things is what you'll find it in the robotics we will be focusing mostly on the impedance force control and specifically impedance control without the force feedback okay so all the sensible phantom are most of the devices they are using this impedance control without the force feedback so essentially if you look at the block diagrams for the force feedback suppose if you have a force controller and let us say this is a target force and suppose if the controller the Robo is giving the force output the generator force can be compared with this and then force control or can have a output the change in the length yeah okay and that is given to the Robo this is a force control with a force feedback you are controlling the force over here another possibility is there position control with a force feedback again the output is a force the input also uses of force but the position can be sensed and then given to the position controller the position controller can be given to the Robo but the force also can be given back sensed and then and inverse of the impedance we can multiply it or integrate it to get thee to get the okay inverse of the impedance and to get the the velocity and velocity if you integrate it we'll get a position and that position is again control so there is a positive summation over here and that can be controlled this is the position control with the force feedback impedance control with a force feedback in the impedance control what is controlled or is the impedance where the force controller is over here the force at the output is measured and then summed up over here the position from the output is measured and given to thee the impedance controller over here the impedance control we are finding the velocity and then that is multiplied by the the impedance what we get out is the force and then that force is summed up with the output force or differentiated with output force and that is what is control over here so in haptic devices we will be using much simpler one because now measuring the force at the output is going to be extremely difficult it's going to add a lot of cost to it so without the force control position alone can be used to control the impedance and that solves the problem ok so there will not be a force controller they'll not be force measurement but there will be a position feedback and then the impedance controller will be there that's what a usual for example the sensible phantoms have been using it okay we will look at different other control systems in the coming classes okay so as I think I mentioned and why we needed the impedance control in the human haptics class remember we needed the not only the the angle for example this is a [Music] hypothetical pendulum if we control the position of the pendulum with the angle control alone and it will swing back and forth if you control the pendulum not only with the angle but also theta dot then we can control it and then make it not swing beyond this position and that's what we have okay so that is the reason we needed the the impedance control impedance control is the you know generalization of the stiffness control which we have seen in the earlier classes so this is a simple haptic device which you're going to know make a simple haptic device suppose if we have a rod and this rod is where you're going to hold it okay and then you can rotate it let us say this is a one degree of freedom haptic device so the angle can be measured so let us say there is a virtual wall over here and this is a position let us say this position is represented by this this is called the haptic interface point hie so this haptics interphase point we can check whether it is colliding with a virtual wall at every frame if it is not colliding then we don't have to generate a force feedback you for this colouring suppose at some time it has come in there then we need to find out how much force it has to generate for example how much torque this motor has to generate in a one degree of freedom so we love our different models of force response for example simple is it depends upon the depth of penetration we can find out the F is equal to KX it's a simplest model okay okay let us say Delta X this is the Delta X so we know that Delta X let us assume that the virtual wall has some stiffness and therefore we can find out the force and then force can be converted into torque we can ask you motor to generate a torque this is a simple simplest one degree of freedom haptic device we have developed a one degree of freedom haptic device in our lab but having two different loots one is controlling the position measuring the position and another is measuring the velocity so in order to render stiffer waltz the virtual walls what you have there is going to be a maximum limit on these stiffness what you can have as far as the stability is concerned so in our earlier work we measured position as well as velocity and then increase the maximum stiffness of a virtual wall that can be rendered by the same haptic device this is one of the earlier works in 2007 the student who had worked on this is right now working in Apple designing haptic devices there are all these devices or for rendering a rigid object but we can also have no deformable objects rendered we will see the details of deformable objects rendering in a later class [Music] [Music]
