 Tinh is a chemical element with the symbol s n from latin stannum and atomic number 50 it is a post transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements it is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite which contains Stanek oxide tin for oxide tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14 germanium and lead and has two main oxidation states +2 and the slightly more stable +4 10 is the 49th most abundant element and has with 10 stable isotopes the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table thanks to its magic number of protons it has two main allotropes at room temperature the stable allotrope is beta tin a silvery-white malleable metal but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense gray alpha tin which has the diamond cubic structure metallic tin does not easily oxidized in air the first tin alloy used on the large scale was bronze made of tin and copper from as early as 3000 BC after 600 BC pure metallic tin was produced pewter which is an alloy of 85 to 90 percent tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper antimony and lead was used for flatware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century in modern times 10 is used in many alloys most notably 10 led soft solders which are typically 60% or more tin and in the manufacture of transparent electrically conducting films of indium tin oxide and optoelectronic applications another large application for tin as corrosion resistant tin plating of steel because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin tin plated steel is widely used for food packaging as tin cans however some Organa tin compounds can be almost as toxic as cyanide topic characteristics you topic physical Tinh is a soft malleable ductile and highly crystalline silvery white metal when a bar of tin is bent a crackling sound known as the tin cry can be heard from the twinning of the crystals tin melts at low temperatures of about 232 degrees Celsius 450 degrees Fahrenheit the lowest in Group 14 the melting point is further lowered to 177 point three degrees Celsius 350 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit for 11 nanometers particles beta tin the metallic form or white tin BCT structure which is stable at an above room temperature is malleable in contrast alpha tin non metallic form or grate in which is stable below thirteen point two degrees Celsius 55 point eight degrees Fahrenheit is brittle alpha tin has a diamond cubic crystal structure similar to diamond silicon or germanium alpha tin has no metallic properties at all because its atoms form a covalent structure in which electrons cannot move freely it is a dull gray powdery material with no common uses other than a few specialized semiconductor applications these two allotropes alpha tin and beta tin are more commonly known as great in in white tin respectively two more allotropes gamma and Sigma exist at temperatures above 161 degrees Celsius 322 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures above several GPA in cold conditions beta tin tends to transform spontaneously into alpha 10 a phenomenon known as tin pest although the alpha beta transformation temperature is nominally thirteen point two degrees Celsius 55 point eight degrees Fahrenheit impurities eg al zein etc lower the transition temperature well below zero degrees Celsius 32 degrees Fahrenheit and on the addition of antimony or bismuth the transformation might not occur at all increasing the durability of the tin commercial grades of 10 99.8% resist transformation because of the inhibiting effect of the small amounts of bismuth antimony lead and silver present as impurities alloying elements such as copper antimony bismuth cadmium and silver increase its hardness tint ends rather easily to form hard brittle intermetallics phases which are often undesirable it does not form wide solid solution ranges in other metals in general and few elements have appreciable solid solubility in ten simple eutectic systems however occur with bismuth gallium led thallium and zinc tin becomes a superconductor below 3.7 2 K and was one of the first superconductors to be studied the Meisner effect one of the characteristic features of superconductors was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals topic chemical Tinh resists corrosion from water but can be attacked by acids and alkalis tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals a protective oxide passivation layer prevents further oxidation the same that forms on pewter and other ten alloys tin acts as a catalyst when oxygen is in solution and helps to accelerate the chemical reaction topic isotopes Tinh has ten stable isotopes with atomic masses of 112 114 through 120 122 and 124 the greatest number of any element of these the most abundant are 120 SN almost a third of all 10 118 SN and 116 SN while the least abundant is 115 SN the isotopes with even mass numbers have no nuclear spin while those with odd have a spin of plus 1/2 tin with its three common isotopes 116 SN 118 SN and 120 SN is among the easiest elements to detect and analyze by NMR spectroscopy and its chemical shifts are referenced against s and M E for this large number of stable isotopes has thought to be a direct result of the atomic number 50 a magic number in nuclear physics tin also occurs in 29 unstable isotopes encompassing all the remaining atomic masses from 99 to 137 apart from 126 SN with a half-life of 230,000 years all the Radio isotopes have a half-life of less than a year the radioactive 100 SN discovered in 1994 and 132 SN are one of the few nuclides with a doubly magic nucleus despite being unstable having very lopsided proton Neutron ratios they represent endpoints beyond which stability drops off rapidly another 30 metastable isomers have been characterized for isotopes between 111 and 131 the most stable being 121 m SN with a half-life of 43.9 years the relative differences in the abundances of tin stable isotopes can be explained by their different modes of formation in stellar nucleosynthesis 116 SN through 120 SN inclusive are formed in the s process slow Neutron capture in most stars and hence they are the most common isotopes while 122 SN and 124 SN are only formed in the art process rapid Neutron capture in supernovae and are less common the isotopes 117 SN through 120 SN also received contributions from the art process finally the rarest proton rich isotopes 112 SN 114 SN and 115 SN cannot be made in significant amounts in the s or our processes and are considered among the pea nuclei whose origins are not well understood yet some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration although 115 SN might also be partially produced in the s process both directly and as the daughter of long-lived 115 in topic etymology the word tent is shared among Germanic languages and can be traced back to reconstructed proto-germanic asterisk 10 ohm con mates include Germans in Swedish ten and Dutch ten it is not found in other branches of indo-european except by borrowing from Germanic eg Irish tin from English the Latin names stand immersion aliy mentality l've ER and led and came to mean TN in the fourth century the earlier latin word for it was plumbum candidum or white LED stannum apparently came from an earlier stagnant meaning the same substance the origin of the romance and celtic terms 410 the origin of stand impressed o nag Nam is unknown it may be pre indo-european the meijer conversations lexicon speculates on the contrary that stand amaz derived from the ancestor of Cornish team and is proof that Cornwall in the first centuries ad was the main source of ten topic history tin extraction and use can be dated to the beginnings of the Bronze Age around 3000 BC when it was observed that copper objects formed a poly metallic ores with different metal contents had different physical properties the earliest bronze objects had a tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are therefore believed to be the result of unintentional alloying due to trace metal content in the copper ore the addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness lowers the melting temperature and improves the casting process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser less spongy metal this was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed moulds of the Bronze Age our Cenacle bronze objects appear first in the Near East where arsenic is commonly found in association with copper ore but the health risks were quickly realized in the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age this created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a trade network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of Bronze Age cultures consider it-- tin for oxide the tin oxide form of tin was most likely the original source of tin in ancient times other forms of tin ores are less abundant sulfides such as stan it-- that require a more involved smelting process cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as placer deposits because it is harder heavier and more chemically resistant than the accompanying granite cassiterite is usually black or generally dark in color and these deposits can be easily seen in riverbanks alluvial placer deposits could be easily collected and separated by methods similar to gold panning topic compounds in chemistry in the great majority of its compounds tin has the oxidation state - or IV topic in organic compounds you halide compounds are known for both oxidation states for SN IV all four halides are well known tin for fluoride tin for chloride tin for bromide and 10 for iodide the three heavier members are volatile molecular compounds whereas the tetrafluoride is polymeric all four halides are known for sn2 also tin ii fluoride tin ii chloride tin ii bromide and tin ii iodide all are polymeric solids of these eight compounds only the iodides are colored tend to chloride also known as stannous chloride is the most important tin halide in a commercial sense illustrating the roots to such compounds chlorine reacts with tin metal to give tin for chloride whereas the reaction of hydrochloric acid and tin produces tin ii chloride and hydrogen gas alternatively tin for chloride and SN combined to stannous chloride by a process called come proportion a ssin tin for chloride plus sn2 10 - chloride 10 can form many oxides sulfides and other chalcogenide derivatives the dioxide tin for oxide cassiterite forms when 10 is heated in the presence of air tin for oxide does Mpho Taric which means that it dissolves in both acidic and basic solutions stand aids with the structure tin 6 hydroxide - - like k2 10 6 hydroxide are also known though the free stannic acid h2 10 6 hydroxide is unknown sulfides of tin exists in both the +2 and +4 oxidation states 10 - sulfide and 10 IV sulfide mosaic gold topic hydrides standing 10-4 hydride with tin in the plus 4 oxidation state is unstable or Gannet and hydrides are however well known eg tributyltin hydride SN c4h9 3h these compound release transient tributyl tin radicals which are rare examples of compounds of 10 3 topic or Gannett in compounds Organa tin compounds sometimes called standings are chemical compounds with tin carbon bonds of the compounds of 10 the organic derivatives are the most useful commercially some Organa tin compounds are highly toxic and have been used as biocides the first Organa tin compound to be reported was diethyl tinned iodide c2h5 to tin to iodide reported by edward frankland in 1849 most Organa tin compounds are colorless liquids or solids that are stable to air in water they adopt tetrahedral geometry tetra alkyl and tetra Alton compounds can be prepared using grignard reagents tin for chloride plus for r mg b RR 4 SN plus 4 mg b RC lthe mixed halide alkyls which are more common and more important commercially than the tetra organo derivatives are prepared by redistribution reactions tin for chloride plus r for sn2 tin to chloride are two divalent or Gannett and compounds are uncommon although more common than related divalent organo germanium and Organa silicon compounds the greater stabilization enjoyed by sn2 is attributed to the inert pair effect or Gannett in two compounds include both stam aleene's formula R 2 SN as seen for singlet carbons and distant Aline's R for sn2 which are roughly equivalent to alkenes both classes exhibit unusual reactions topic occurrence Tinh is generated via the longest process in low to medium mass stars with masses of 0.6 to 10 times that of Sun and finally by beta decay of the heavy isotopes of indium tin is the 49th most abundant element in Earth's crust representing 2 ppm compared with 75 ppm for zinc 50 ppm for copper and 14 ppm for lead tin does not occur as the native element but must be extracted from various ores cassiterite tin for oxide is the only commercially important source of tin although small quantities of 10 are recovered from complex sulfides such as stand it-- cylinder right Frankie Canfield ight and tea light minerals with tin are almost always associated with granite rock usually at a level of 1% tin oxide content because of the higher specific gravity of tin dioxide about 80 percent of mine tin as from secondary deposits found downstream from the primary loads tin is often recovered from granules washed downstream in the past and deposited in valleys or the sea the most economical ways of mining tend are by dredging hydraulic or open pits most of the world's tin is produced from placer deposits which can contain as little as zero point zero one five percent tin about two hundred fifty three thousand tons of tin have been mined in 2011 mostly in China 110 thousand T Indonesia 51 thousand T Peru 34600 T Bolivia 20700 T in Brazil 12000 T estimates of tin production have historically varied with the dynamics of economic feasibility and the development of mining technologies but it is estimated that at current consumption rates and technologies the earth will run out of mine ableton in 40 years Lester Brown has suggested tin could run out within 20 years based on an extremely conservative extrapolation of 2 percent growth per year secondary or scrap tin is also an important source of the metal recovery of tin through secondary production or recycling of scrap ten is increasing rapidly whereas the United States has neither mined since 1993 nor smelted tin since 1989 it was the largest secondary producer cycling nearly 14,000 tons in 2006 new deposits are reported in southern Mongolia and in 2009 new deposits of tin were discovered in Columbia by the Seminole group Columbia see SAS topic production Tinh is produced by carbothermic reduction of the oxide or with carbon or coke both reverberatory furnace and electric furnace can be used topic mining and smelting you topic industry the ten largest companies produced most of the world's tin in 2007 most of the world's tin is traded on the London Metal Exchange LME from eight countries under 17 brands an international tin council was established in 1947 to control the price of tin until it collapsed in 1985 in 1984 an association of ten producing countries was created with Australia Bolivia Indonesia Malaysia Nigeria Thailand and zyre as members topic price and exchanges Tinh is unique among other mineral commodities because of the complex agreements between producer countries and consumer countries dating back to 1921 the earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic and led to the first international tin agreement in 1956 the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985 through this series of agreements the International tin Council ITC had a considerable effect on tin prices the ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile this was an anti free market approach designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries however the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose sometimes sharply especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies during the late 1970's and early 1980s the US government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode partly to take advantage of the historically heightened prices the sharp recession of 1981 82 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry tin consumption declined dramatically the ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources the ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit immediately a major tin crisis followed tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years the ITC dissolved soon afterward and the price of tin now in a free-market environment plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained at that level through the 1990s the price increased again by 2010 with a rebound in consumption following the 2008 o.9 world economic crisis accompanying restocking and continued growth in consumption by the world's developing economies London Metal Exchange me is the principal trading site for ten other ten contract markets are Kuala Lumpur ten market KL TM in Indonesia ten exchange I and atin the price per kilogram over years topic applications in 2006 about half of all ten produced was used in solder the rest was divided between tin plating tin chemicals brass and bronze alloys and niche uses topic Sauder Tinh has long been used in alloys with lettuce solder in amounts 5 to 70% with w tin with lead forms a eutectic mixture at the weight proportion of 60 1.9% 10 and 38.1% LED the atomic proportion seventy-three point nine percent ten and twenty six point one percent lead with melting temperature of 183 degrees celsius 361 point four degrees Fahrenheit such soldiers are primarily used for joining pipes or electric circuits since the European Union waste electrical and electronic equipment directive W EEE directive and restriction of hazardous substances directive came into effect on the first of July 2006 the lead content in such alloys has decreased replacing lead has many problems including a higher melting point and the formation of tin whiskers causing electrical problems tin pest can occur in lead-free solders leading to loss of the soldered joint replacement alloys are rapidly being found although problems of joint integrity remain topic tin plating Tinh bonds readily to iron and is used for coding lead zinc and steel to prevent corrosion tin plated steel containers are widely used for food preservation and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin a tin plate canister for preserving food was first manufactured in London in 1812 speakers of British English called them tins while speakers of American English called him cans or tin cans one derivation of such use as the slang term tin ii or tin ii meaning can of beer in australia the tin whistle is so called because it was first mass-produced in tin plated steel copper cooking vessels such as sauce pans and frying pans are frequently lined with a thin plating of ten since the combination of acid foods with copper can be toxic topic specialized alloys Tinh in combination with other elements forms a wide variety of useful alloys tin is most commonly alloyed with copper pewter is eighty five to ninety nine percent tin bearing metal has a high percentage of tin as well bronze is mostly copper 12 percent tin while addition of phosphorous gives phosphor bronze bell metal is also a copper tin alloy containing 22 percent tin tin has sometimes been used in coinage for example it once formed a single-digit percentage usually five percent or less of American and Canadian pennies because copper is often the major metal in such coins sometimes including zinc these could be called bronze and/or brass alloys the niobium tin compound n b3 SN is commercially used in coils of superconducting magnets for its high critical temperature 18 K and critical magnetic field 25 T a superconducting magnet weighing as little as two kilograms as capable of the magnetic field of a conventional electromagnet weighing tons a small percentage of tin is added to zirconium alloys for the cladding of nuclear fuel most metal pipes in a pipe organ are of a tin lead alloy with 50 50 being the most common composition the proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe stone since 10 has a desirable tonal resonance when a tin lead alloy cools the lead cools slightly faster and produces a mottled or spotted affect this metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance its workability and resistance to corrosion topic optoelectronics the oxides of indium and ten are electrically conductive and transparent and are used to make transparent electrically conducting films with applications in optoelectronics devices such as liquid crystal displays topic other applications punched tin plated steel also called Pierce tin is an artisan technique originating in Central Europe for creating housewares that are both functional and decorative decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety based on local tradition and the artisans personal creations punched tin lanterns are the most common application of this artisan technique the light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits lanterns and other punched tin articles were created in the new world from the earliest European settlement a well-known example is the Revere Lantern named after Paul Revere before the modern era in some areas of the Alps a goat or sheep Sehorne would be sharpened in a tin panel would be punched out using the alphabet and numbers from 1 to 9 this learning tool was known appropriately as the horn modern reproductions are decorated with such motifs as hearts and tulips in America pie safes and food safes were in use in the days before refrigeration these were wooden cupboards of various styles and sizes either floor standing or hanging cupboards meant to discourage vermin and insects and to keep dust from perishable food stuffs these cabinets had tin plate inserts in the doors and sometimes in the sides punched out by the homeowner cabinet maker or a tinsmith in varying designs to allow for air circulation while excluding flies modern reproductions of these articles remain popular in north america window glass is most often made by floating molten glass on molten tin float glass resulting in a flat and flawless surface this is also called the Pilkington process tin is also used as a negative electrode in advanced li-ion batteries it's application is somewhat limited by the fact that some tin surfaces catalyze decomposition of carbonate based electrolytes used in li-ion batteries tin ii fluoride is added to some dental care products as stannis fluoride tin ii fluoride tin ii fluoride can be mixed with calcium abrasives while the more common sodium fluoride gradually becomes biologically inactive in the presence of calcium compounds it has also been shown to be more effective than sodium fluoride in controlling gingivitis topic Organa tin compounds of all the chemical compounds of ten the organic and compounds are most heavily used worldwide industrial production probably exceeds 50,000 tons topic PVC stabilizers the major commercial application of organic and compounds as in the stabilization of PVC plastics in the absence of such stabilizers PVC would otherwise rapidly degrade under heat light and atmospheric oxygen resulting in discolored brittle products tin scavenges labile chloride ions CL - which would otherwise initiate loss of HCl from the plastic material typical tin compounds are carboxylic acid derivatives of de butyl tin dichloride such as the dil or eight topic biocides some Organa tin compounds are relatively toxic with both advantages and problems they are used for biocidal properties as fungicides pesticides algaecides wood preservatives and antifouling agents tributyltin oxide is used as a wood preservative tributyltin was used as additive for ship paint to prevent growth of marine organisms on ships with use declining after Organa tin compounds were recognized as persistent organic pollutants with an extremely high toxicity for some marine organisms the dog well for example the EU banned the use of organic compounds in 2003 while concerns over the toxicity of these compounds to marine life and damage to the reproduction and growth of some marine species some reports describe biological effects to marine life at a concentration of one nanogram per liter have led to a worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization many nations now restrict the use of Organa tin compounds to vessels greater than 25 metres 82 feet long topic organic chemistry some tin reagents are useful in organic chemistry in the largest application stannous chloride does a common reducing agent for the conversion of Nitro and oxime groups to amines the stilly reaction couples Organa tin compounds with organic halides are pseudo halides topic li-ion batteries Tinh forms several intermetallic phases with lithium metal making it a potentially attractive material for battery applications large volumetric expansion of tend upon alloying with lithium and instability of the tin organic electrolyte interface at low electrochemical potentials are the greatest challenges to employment in commercial cells the problem was partially solved by Sony tin intermetallic compound with cobalt and carbon has been implemented by Sony in its NEX Alliance cells released in the late 2000s the composition of the active material is approximately SN 0.3 0.4 C 0.3 recent research showed that only some crystalline facets of tetragonal beta SN are responsible for undesirable electrochemical activity topic precautions cases of poisoning from tin metal its oxides and it's salts are almost unknown on the other hand certain Organa tin compounds are almost as toxic as cyanide exposure to tin in the workplace can occur by inhalation skin contact and eye contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for 10 exposure in the workplaces to milligrams per cubic meter over an eight-hour workday the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has determined a recommended exposure limit Rell of 2 milligrams per cubic meter over an eight-hour workday at levels of 100 milligrams per cubic meter 10 is
