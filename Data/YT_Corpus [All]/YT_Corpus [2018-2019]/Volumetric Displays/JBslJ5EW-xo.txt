 I'm most excited about some very fundamental technology some very early technologies that strongly suggest to me that the type of 3d displays that we imagine will have in the future projections 3d projections and room-sized holographic environments that are tactile these tortes sorts of things that five years ago I would have said are probably unlikely now I'm starting to believe may actually be possible so I'm excited by the idea that the future we imagine for display may may very well be very possible we have even something better than we imagined
