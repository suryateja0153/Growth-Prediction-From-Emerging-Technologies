 [Music] hello welcome to class pad net and this how-to video is just gonna quickly show you how easy it is to graph and how to graph more than one function on a graph and then how to split and merge them so I'm gonna start by actually opening the graph sticky to do that I click anywhere on the screen get my icons up and I'm gonna look for the graph icon that then opens a graphing sticky that I can kind of move anywhere and as you see down here at the bottom I have a couple options I can enter a function or I can enter table data and I have a graph from the table data so I'm going to enter a function by clicking this this opens up my window to enter the function I've got my soft keyboard here that I could use or I could use my if I'm on a computer I can just use my regular but will use this one that comes with it so y equals let's do a parent function here so y equals x squared right so we're gonna just do a parabola and it graphs and you'll see there's the blue matches the blue up here to the function so they're always connected to each other and let's just add a second one and just show you how easy it is to split and merge graphs once you create them so I'm going to enter another function this way and so let's do y equals and let's make this one a little more exciting 3x squared let's see minus 5x plus all right so I'm going to execute or enter and now you'll see that I have a red graph again everything's coordinated it matches the function so red and red and here's my new graph and I can see them together I could look at key points on them if I want to just by clicking on the graph and clicking on the points that I want to see but what if I want to look at each graph separately to kind of explore the differences when you have graphs and you can have many graphs on one you'll notice that each color gets its own little tab and if I want to keep them together it would look like this but if I want to take one and separate them I just simply grab the tab and move it over and now I'm looking at these two graphs separately and you'll notice that the graph the graph function right here is always tied to the graph it belongs to so and you can move that around which is really nice but where you want this is a nice advantage of the stickies and if I decide so now I'm able to look at each of them separately and kind of make some comparisons that way if I want to put them back together all I have to do is drag one over on top of the other and let go and they are now merged back together so really easy to split in merge graphs and have some great visual comparisons and looking at different points either together all in one graph or separate it out so thanks for watching be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel where we're going to be posting how to's frequently and then make sure you follow us on social media [Music]
