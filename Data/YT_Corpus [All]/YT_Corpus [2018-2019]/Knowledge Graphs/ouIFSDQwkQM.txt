 Female Speaker: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHAT WERE NOT HERE FROM BEFORE, THIS IS JEFF HEER FROM THE THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. HE WILL TALK TO US ABOUT INTERACTIVE DATA ANALYSIS, ALSO KNOWN AS CONSTRUCTIVE -- Jeff Heer: YEAH, SO WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT CONSTRUCTS CHARTS AND GRAPHS. BUT FOR THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF GETTING INVOLVED IN INTERACTIVE DATA ANALYSIS. SO TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND JUMP RIGHT INTO SOME EXAMPLES. SO HERE IS A BASIC VISUALIZATION TYPE. MANEESH TOLD US ABOUT A SCATTERPLOT. IN THIS CASE, IT'S AN HOMAGE TO GAPMINDER HANS ROSLING. EXAMPLE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE IS DATA COLLECTED FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THIS IS FOR 1980. WE HAVE FERTILITY PLOTTED ALONG THE X AXIS. SO NUMBER OF CHILDREN PERFECT HOUSEHOLD AND ALONG THE Y AXIS HERE, WE HAVE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN YEARS. THEN WE CAN SEE THE DISTRIBUTION FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WORLD. OF COURSE, WE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM. SO WE MIGHT WANT TO ENGAGE IN INTERACTION TECHNIQUES. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, HERE, I CAN IDENTIFY THE POINT REPRESENTING BANGLADESH. BUT IN ADDITION, I SEE ITS TRAJECTORY THROUGH TIME. SO WHAT OF THE DIFFERENT POINTS THOSE COUNTRIES OCCUPY WITH RESPECT TO FERTILITY AND LIFE EXPECTANCY STATISTICS. SO THIS GIVES ME ONLY PEAK BEYOND THIS 1980 SLICE THAT I HAPPEN TO BE LOOKING AT CURRENTLY. BUT, OF COURSE, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH TIME AS WELL. SO IN THIS CASE, I CAN GRAB THE POINT AND DRAG IT ALONG ITS TIMELINE. I MIGHT GO BACK TO 1955 WHERE OUR KEYNOTE SPEAKER MIGHT HAVE BEGAN AND THEN MOVE FORWARD AND THEN SEE HOW THESE COUNTRIES DEVELOPED IN TANDEM, THAT IS ARE THERE ANY SIMILAR PATTERNS FOR ANY INTERESTING DEVIATIONS. YOU NOTICE THIS RATHER PRECIPITOUS DROP IN THE LOWER RIGHT. IN THIS CASE HAPPENS TO BE RWANDA WHERE OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A GENOCIDE AMONG OTHER ISSUES IN THAT TIME FRAME. SO IN THIS WAY, WE USING BOTH VISUAL ENCODINGS AND INTERACTIONS TECHNIQUES AS WAYS TO GAIN MORE UNDERSTANDING INTO A DATA SET. HERE WE HAVE DONE THAT FOR SOME STATISTICAL DATA. LET'S LOOK AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE. THIS IS COMBINING NETWORKS AND CARTOGRAPHY. HERE IS THE MAP OF THE DIFFERENT DIRECT FLIGHT ROUTES IN THE UNITED STATES. I WOULD CONTEND THAT THIS IS NOT A PARTICULARLY USEFUL VISUALIZATION. PERHAPS SLIGHTLY WORSE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD SEE, YOU KNOW, IN THE BACK OF A MAGAZINE ON THE AIR PLANE. SO HOW MIGHT WE CLEAN THIS UP? ONE APPROACH IS TO CONSIDER THE INTERACTIVE CHANNELS AS WELL. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, INSTEAD, I MIGHT SHOW YOU A FILTERED VIEW AND ALLOW YOU TO EXPLORE. SO IN THIS CASE, AS I MOUSE AROUND I SELECT DIFFERENT AIRPORTS AND SEE THE DIRECT CONNECTIONS THAT THEY PROVIDE. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, I LIVE IN SEATTLE. SO I CAN SEE THE DIRECT FLIGHTS COMING OUT OF SEATTLE TACOMA HERE. AS I DO THIS, IT'S NOT JUST THE VISUAL ENCODINGS, THE ENCODINGS OF THE STATES AND SIZING OF AIRPORTS BY THEIR TRAFFIC, ET CETERA. BUT ALSO ENCODINGS THAT ENABLE BETTER INTERACTION. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT IS INVISIBLE HERE IS WHAT'S CALLED A VORONOI TESSELLATION. THIS IS JUST THIS HIDDEN VISUALIZATION THAT TELLS ME, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE NEAREST POINT OF ANYTIME. SO I DON'T HAVE TO MOUSE OVER THESE TINY LITTLE CIRCLES IN ORDER TO SELECT AN AIRPORT. I CAN SELECT THE NEAREST POINT TO MY MOUSE CURSOR AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND IN THAT WAY ACCELERATING THE SORT OF EXPLORATION OF THE SCENE. BUT THE EXAMPLES I THINK I GET MOST EXCITED ABOUT ARE THE RUNS THAT REALLY ENABLE ANALYSIS AND PARTICULARLY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS. IN THIS CASE, WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT AIR PLANE DATA AGAIN STARTING WITH THE STATISTICAL SUMMARY. LET'S JUST TAKE THREE VARIABLES OF INTEREST. THE ARRIVAL DELAY, SO HOW LATE IS THE PLANE. WHAT TIME DID IT TAKE OFF IN THE LOCAL TIME ZONE. AND THEN ALSO HOW FAR IT FLEW. AND BY TAKING HISTOGRAM, SO BENDING THOSE AND COUNTING THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IN EACH BIN, WE CAN GET A SENSE OF THE DATA SETS. WHAT ARE THEIR DISTRIBUTION? THIS IS USEFUL AS AN OUTPUT TECHNIQUE FOR MAKING SENSE OF DATA. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALSO LOOK AT THESE CHARTS IN THEIR POTENTIAL AS INPUT TECHNIQUES OR INPUT DEVICES. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, I MIGHT MAKE A SELECTION ON THIS CHART ABOVE AND I CAN ENGAGE IN WHAT IS CALLED CROSS FILTERING. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, I'M PICKING A SUBSET OF DATA AND JUST RECOUNTING THE DATA AND THE CHARTS BELOW. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF I ASK QUESTIONS LIKE, WELL, WHAT MIGHT MAKE A PLANE BE LATE? I DRAG OUT TO THE RIGHT AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THESE FLIGHTS HAVE MUCH LATER DEPARTURE TIMES. THIS IS NOT SURPRISING IF YOU ARE A FREQUENT FLYER. THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY CAN USUALLY TAKE OFF IF THERE IS NO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. BUT ANY DELAY, THEN THE ACCRUE TO LATER AND LATER FLIGHTS OF THE DAY. SO AS YOU GET TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE LIKE THE LARGEST ACCUMULATION OF DELAYED FLIGHTS. AND SIMILARLY, I CAN DRAG THE OTHER WAY AND ASK, WHAT MIGHT LEAD TO A FLIGHT BEING A BIT EARLY? IN THIS CASE, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE MOVEMENT IN THAT BOTTOM HISTOGRAM. SO PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY FLIGHTS THAT FLY MUCH FURTHER HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE UP TIME. WHILE WE STARTED WITH JUST SIMPLE ONE-DIMENSIONAL VISUALIZATIONS, AND IN THIS CASE, INTERACTION, WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ENGAGE IN EXPLORING MULTIVARIATE PATTERNS. THAT IS PATTERNS THAT EXIST IN MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS OF WHAT WE MEAN BY INTERACTIVE DATA ANALYSIS. SO WITH THAT, LET'S GO BACK INTO THE SLIDE DECK. NOW, I'VE SPENT A GOOD PROPORTION OF MY CAREER ACTUALLY DESIGNING TOOLS TO CREATE THESE TYPES VISUALIZATIONS. SO THIS INCLUDES D3 WHICH YOU'VE HEARD MENTIONED BEFORE WHICH WAS CREATED BY MY FORMER STUDENT MIKE BOSTOCK AND THEN MORE RECENTLY A SET OF TOOLS CALLED VEGA AND VEGA LIGHT WHICH ARE HIGHER LEVEL LANGUAGES FOR CREATING VISUALIZATIONS. ALL THE EXAMPLES I JUST SHOWED YOU WERE CREATED IN VEGA AND MOST RECENT LANGUAGE VEGA LIGHT ACTUALLY ALLOWS YOU TO EXPRESS VISUALIZATIONS USING A REPRESENTATION VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MANEESH JUST PRESENTED BASICALLY BY TALKING ABOUT VISUAL ENCODING CHANNELS AND THEN THE DATA VARIABLES THAT BACK THEM. AND SO WHILE THIS IS GREAT IN THAT WE HAVE TOOLS THAT ALLOW US TO CREATE INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS, IT'S, OF COURSE, INSUFFICIENT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE A RANDOM VARIETY OF CHARTS, WE WANT SOME DESIGN DISCIPLINE AND SOME SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AS WELL TO GUIDE WHAT WOULD LEAD US TO MORE EFFECTIVE DESIGNS. SO THE NEXT QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER IS, YOU KNOW, WHAT MAKES A VISUALIZATION GOOD? NOW APPROPRIATELY I PUT GOOD IN SCARE QUOTES BECAUSE, OF COURSE, THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR OBJECTIVES AND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. BUT FOR THIS CONVERSATION, WE WILL ASSUME WE WILL MEAN THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY AND ACCURATELY UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION HAD A IS PRESENTED TO YOU IN A GRAPHIC FORM. SO BEGIN TO BUY OFF AT THIS QUESTION, I WOULD LIKE TO CONDUCT A QUICK EXPERIMENT HERE IN THE ROOM. SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO SHAPES. YOUR JOB IS TO COMPARE THEM AND DECIDE HOW MUCH LARGER THE BIG SHAPE IS COMPARED TO THE SMALL SHAPE. DON'T CHEAT BY USING A MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT. JUST GO BY USING A EURO SYSTEM. AND DON'T YELL OUT THE ANSWER. I WILL CONDUCT A POLL. [LAUGHTER] SOME PEOPLE GET REALLY, YOU KNOW, EXCITED. SO HERE IS TWO CIRCLES, HOW MUCH LARGER IS THE BIG CIRCLE THAN THE SMALL CIRCLE? JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT. AND RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK THE BIG CIRCLE IS EXACTLY FOUR TIMES LARGER. OKAY. FIVE TIMES LARGER. SIX TIMES LARGER? ALL RIGHT. SEVEN? EIGHT? BUNCH OF PEOPLE OVER HERE. NINE. TEN OR HIGHER? OKAY. SO THAT WAS A PRETTY WIDE RANGE. WE HAD GOOD NUMBERS OF RESPONSE OF EVERYWHERE FROM 5 TO 10 OR HIGHER. SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU LATER WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EYES, BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO ANOTHER EXAMPLE. NOW, LET'S COMPARE THE LENGTH OF TWO BARS. SO SAME EXERCISE AS BEFORE, MAKE A QUICK VISUAL JUDGMENT HOW MUCH LARGER THE BIG BAR IS COMPARED TO SHORT BAR. OKAY. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU THINK THE BIG BAR IS EXACTLY FOUR TIMES LARGER? OKAY. FIVE TIMES. SIX. ALL RIGHT. SEVEN. LOTS OF HANDS. EIGHT. AGAIN, LOTS OF HANDS. NINE. FEW HANDS, TEN AND HIGHER. AND, AGAIN, VERY FEW HANDS. IN THAT CASE, WE HAD A RANGE OF RESPONSES FROM 5 TO 10. IF YOU LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OR THE SPREAD IN THOSE RESPONSES WAS MUCH MORE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED IN THIS SECOND EXAMPLE. IN CASE YOU ARE DYING TO KNOW, YES, THE ANSWER IS 7 IN BOTH CASES. SO IF I TOOK THIS AND MELTED IT DOWN TO PERFECTLY FIT THE CIRCLE, YOU FIND INDEED THE AREA OF THE CIRCLE IS EXACTLY SEVEN TIMES LARGER AND SIMILARLY, THIS LONG BAR IS SEVEN TIMES LARGER AS WELL. IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. WHY ON AVERAGE ARE PEOPLE MUCH MORE ACCURATE IN THE CASE OF THE BAR THAN THEY WERE IN THE AREA? THIS HAS BEEN A STUDY OF BOTH PSYCHOPHYSICS AS WELL AS AN APPLIED AREA OF GRAPHICAL PERCEPTION THAT MANEESH MENTIONED IN HIS TALK AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS AND BUILD UP RANK ORDERINGS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT VISION AND ENCODING CHANNELS. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS RESULTS OF AN EXPERIMENT WE RAN REPLICATING THE CLASSIC CLEVELAND AND MCGILL STUDY AND ALSO EXTENDING IT USING PLATFORM SUCH AS AMAZON'S MECHANICAL TURK TO CANVAS A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERNET USERS. SO, HERE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SEE POSITION ENCODINGS TEND TO BE LESS AIR PRONE OR MORE ACCURATE THAN LENGTH ENCODINGS WHICH IN TURN OR MORE ACCURATE THAN ANGLE AND AREA ENCODINGS. AND SO IT'S THROUGH BUILDING UP EMPIRICAL RESEARCH RESULTS SUCH AS THESE THAT WE CAN GO IN TO MAKE, YOU KNOW, DESIGN SUGGESTIONS THAT MIGHT HELP INFLUENCE AND IMPROVED DESIGN. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SAW VERSION OF THIS CHART EARLIER, RANKING VISUAL ENCODINGS FOR THE SPECIFIC TASK OF COMPARING PROPORTIONS, POSITIONS TEND TO BE THE MOST ACCURATE WHERE THINGS AS COMPARING INDIVIDUAL COLORs HUES OR SHADES TENDS TO BE HIGHLY INACCURATE RELATIVE TO SOME OF THE OTHER AVAILABLE CHANNELS. SO THIS MIGHT BE INTERESTING FROM AN ACADEMIC OR DESIGN STANDPOINT, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT CAN HAVE VERY SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES AS WELL. SO LET ME SHOW YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT. SO ONE COMES FROM MY COLLEAGUE, MARIAH MEYER WHO IS NOW A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH. SHE HAS DONE SOME AMAZING WORK WORKING WITH DOMAIN SCIENTISTS PARTICULARLY BIOLOGISTS TO BETTER VISUALIZE DATA. AND SO ONE THING THAT SHE RAN IN TO WITH SOME COLLEAGUES WAS CHARTS THAT LOOK LIKE THIS. SO THESE ARE ACTUALLY GENOMICIST LOOKING AT GENE EXPRESSION LEVELS AT A SMALL NUMBER OF TIME POINTS. IN THIS CASE, EACH ROW IS A TIME SERIES AND COLOR AND CODES OF VALUE. THIS GIVES YOU VERY DENSE ENCODING WHERE WE ARE USING COLOR AS PRIMARY ENCODING CHANNEL FOR QUANTITIES. CONSIDERING THAT RANK ORDERING I SHOWED YOU ON PREVIOUS SLIDE, WE CAN CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE ENCODING CHANNELS SUCH AS POSITION FOR THIS PRIMARY QUANTITY OF INTEREST. AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT SHE DID WITH THESE WORKS THAT ALLOWS SUBTLE AND SCIENTIFICALLY MEANINGFUL PATTERNS TO BE MUCH MORE OBVIOUS. THIS INCLUDES, YOU KNOW, WHEN DOES SOMETHING SPIKE? IS IT EARLIER OR LATER IN THE TIME SERIES, WHAT IS DOES THAT SLOPE LOOK LIKE? DOES THE SPIKE FALL DOWN RIGHT AWAY OR DOES IT PERSIST? NOT ONLY CAN YOU MAKE THESE MUCH MORE MINUTE OBSERVATIONS FOR SINGLE TIME SERIES, THE USE OF THIS SHAPE ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO DO GROUPING AND COMPARISON MORE EASILY AS WELL. SO SCIENTISTS WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS AND FIND MEANINGFUL GROUPINGS OF SAMPLES AND SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN VERY OPAQUE IN THEIR PREVIOUS GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION. AND YOU ARE STILL NOT CONVINCED, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ONE MORE EXAMPLE WHICH IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME. THIS COMES FROM MICHELE BORKIN AND COLLEAGUES WHEN SHE WAS POST DOC AT HARVARD. AND THEY WERE STUDYING VISUALIZATIONS OF ARTERIES. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR DOCTORS TO MAKE DIAGNOSTIC DECISIONS. NOW, THE VISUALIZATION IN THE BOTTOM LEFT IS ACTUALLY THE STATE-OF-THE-ART DESIGN WHEN THEY STARTED THEIR STUDY. SO THIS CASE, ANATOMICALLY CORRECT REPRESENTATION OF THE 3D TRACK OF AN ARTERY ALONG WITH DEFAULT RAINBOW COLORING CODING TO SHOW MEASURE OF ARTERIAL STRESS OR SHEER AND THEY EXPLORED SOME VARIOUS REDESIGNS. ONE WAS TO MOVE FROM THREE DIMENSIONS TO TWO DIMENSIONS. IN THIS CASE, CUTTING OPEN THE 3D MODEL AND UNROLLING IT SO THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE OCCLUSION. YOU COULD SEE THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE ARTERY AT ONCE. AND REALIZING THAT PERHAPS THE 3D ANATOMIC CORRECTNESS WAS LESS IMPORTANT THAN JUST THE GENERAL CONNECTIVITY. IN THE UPPER RIGHT, YOU CAN SEE THIS MORE SCHEMATIC FORM OF HOW THE ARTERIES CONNECT WHILE MAINTAINING A STANDARD 2D ORIENTATION. THE OTHER DESIGN MOVE THEY MADE HERE, OF COURSE, IS CHANGING THE COLOR SCHEME FROM SORT OF DEFAULT CYCLING THROUGH ALL THE HUES OF THE RAINBOW TO A MORE MOTIVATED COLOR SCHEME WHERE IN THIS CASE AREA IS PARTICULARLY HIGHLIGHTED IN RED ARE THOSE THAT WOULD BE MOST WORRISOME TO A DOCTOR MAKING A DIAGNOSTIC DECISION. AND MY FAVORITE PART OF THE STUDY IS THAT THEN EVALUATED THIS WITH REAL DOCTORS AT MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL USING REALISTIC DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. PERHAPS SHOCKINGLY, HERE IS DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACIES USING THESE VARIOUS ILLUSTRATIONS. YOU WILL FIND THAT WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART DESIGN, DOCTORS ABOUT 40% ACCURATE. NOW, THAT MIGHT BE TERRIFYING IF YOU'RE GOING IN WITH A POTENTIAL, YOU KNOW WERE HEART CONDITION. AND LOOKING AT THE OTHER MOVES ARE FASCINATING. GOING FROM 3D TO 2D GAVE A BOOST OF 20%. MEANWHILE, CHANGING COLOR SCHEME GAVE 30% IMPROVED ACCURACY AND DIAGNOSES. THOSE WERE ADDITIVE EFFECTS. SO COMBINED TOGETHER, WE GO FROM BASICALLY 40% TO OVER 90% DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY BY MAKING JUDICIOUS CHOICES AND HOW THE DATA IS BEING VISUALLY ENCODED. SO, AGAIN, WHILE INTELLECTUALLY INTERESTING, IN CASES SUCH AS THESE, GETTING THE APPROPRIATE GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE DATA MAY EVEN BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK, CAREFUL CONSIDERATIONS OF THESE DESIGNS IS SO IMPORTANT. NOW WHAT WE DISCUSSED SO FAR IS REALLY ABOUT THE DESIGN OF A SINGLE IMAGE, RIGHT? GIVEN A DATASET, CAN I CREATE A SPECIFIC CHART? AND OFTENTIMES WE ARE ENGAGED IN MUCH MORE WIDE RANGING EXPLORATIONS. SO I CRITICAL PART OF CONSTRUCTING CHARTS AND GRAPHS IS ACTUALLY MORE OF THIS, HOW DO I DO THIS RAPIDLY IN A WAY THAT ENABLES INTERACTIVE EXPLORATION AND REFINEMENT OF HYPOTHESES. OR PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, GOING BEYOND INDIVIDUAL CHARTS, HOW MIGHT WE BETTER SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF AFFECTIVE DATA EXPLORATION? TO DO SO WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. LET ME START WITH THIS ONE MOTIVATING EXAMPLE. THIS CHART COMES FROM MY COLLEAGUE AT UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, KATHLEEN PLESAUNT (PHONETIC). AND THIS IS VISUALIZING ACTUALLY DATA FROM THE JUVENILE DETENTION SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND. NOW THE CRITICAL BIT TO KNOW HERE IS THAT, A, IT'S ABOUT THE JUVENILE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT AND, B, THE X AXIS' AGE. SO ALREADY YOU MIGHT BE NOTICING SOME IRREGULARITY WITH THE DATA. NOW I HAVE A 1-YEAR-OLD SON AT HOME. AND SO I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIOLENT INFANTS HERE. I ALSO HAVE A 96-YEAR-OLD GRANDFATHER, SO I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARAUDING CENTENARIANS TO THE RIGHT HERE WHICH I CAN VERIFY DO ACT CHILDISH SOMETIMES PROBABLY DON'T BELONG IN THIS DATA SET. AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE, I HAVE A DATA POINT THAT I REALLY CAN'T EXPLAIN AT ALL. SO DATA QUALITY ISSUES OFTEN UNDERMINE SUCCESSFUL ANALYSES AND VISUALIZATION CAN BE AN IMPORTANT LINE OF DEFENSE. NOW HERE AS IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE AGE 0 OR 95 WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW THE AGE OF THE PERSON BEING PROCESSED. YET A DATA QUALITY INTEGRITY CONSTRAINT FORCED THEM TO ENTER A NUMBER. RIGHT? AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU ARE SEEING THAT ARTIFACT THERE. I STILL CAN'T EXPLAIN THIS 36-YEAR-OLD INDIVIDUAL. SO, ANYWAY, THAT'S ONE SORT OF LIKE YOU NEED TO RUN IN TO. DATA QUALITY PROBLEMS ARE PERVASIVE AND WE NEED TO BE, YOU KNOW, ANTICIPATING THEM AS PART OF A SUCCESSFUL EXPLORATION. AFTER ABOUT A DECADE OR SO OF TEACHING VISUALIZATION AND DATA SCIENCE COURSES, I'VE ALSO NOTICED, YOU KNOW, UNDER THE STANDARD, YOU KNOW, HUMAN PREDILECTION TO INFORMATION BIAS, BLINDER VISION, AS IN LIKE STUDENTS MIGHT GET INTERESTING DATA SETS, FORMULATE SOME HYPOTHESES AND THEN DIVE INTO THEM WITHOUT A MORE SYSTEMATIC CONSIDERATION OF THE DATA AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER CONFOUNDING OR LATENT FACTORS THEY MIGHT RUN IN TO. SO WE KNOW EVEN JUST AT FIRST BLUSH THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT PITFALLS CAN ARRIVE IN THE PROCESS OF DATA ANALYSIS. SOME THAT WE TOUCHED ON INCLUDE NOW INCLUDE OVERLOOKING POTENTIAL DATA QUALITY ISSUES. OTHERS CAN BE THIS CONFIRMATION BIAS WHERE WE FIXATE ON SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS. AND REALLY, YOU KNOW, AS MANY OF YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF A NUMBER OF SO-CALLED COGNITIVE BIASES THAT MAY OTHERWISE DISTORT THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF AN ANALYSIS SESSION. SO AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT ALL OF THIS? WELL, I THINK IT'S AN ONGOING AND EXCITING ACTIVE RESEARCH AREA. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU TODAY ONE SORT OF USEFUL BABY SET IN THE DIRECTION OF TOOLS THAT BETTER NUDGE US IN THE DIRECTION OF SUCCESSFUL EXPLORATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, I'M GOING TO SHOW WITH YOU A SYSTEM BUILT BY STUDENTS AND I CALLED DATAVOYAGER. LET ME JUMP INTO THE DEMO FOR THAT. SO HERE IS THE DATAVOYAGER SYSTEM. ON THE LEFT, WE LOADED A DATA SET ABOUT CARS. AND HERE WE SEE EACH OF THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES IN THAT DATA SET. EACH OF THEM HAVE A DATA TYPE THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY. FOR EXAMPLE, IS IT NOMINAL OR QUANTITATIVE, ET CETERA. WE HAVE A SET OF VISUAL ENCODING SHELVES. THESE ARE THE ENCODING CHANNELS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT WE COULD TAKE A DATA VARIABLE AND MAP IT TO A PARTICULAR ENCODING CHANNEL TO CONSTRUCT A CHART. AND IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH POPULAR TOOLS SUCH AS TABLEAU, THIS IS A VERY SIMILAR MODEL TO AUTHORING CHARTS, YOU KNOW, AS VISUAL ANALYSIS TOOLS SUCH AS THOSE. BUT IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE NOT SPECIFIED ANYTHING. INSTEAD OF PROVIDING JUST A BLANK SCREEN, WHAT CAN WE DO THAT MIGHT NUDGE PEOPLE TOWARDS A MORE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME INCLUDING A MORE SYSTEMIC CONSIDERATION OF SHAPE AND STRUCTURE OF THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES IN THE DATA SET AND ATTENDANT DATA QUALITY ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE. SO IN THIS CASE YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE UNIT VARIANT SUMMARIES. THAT IS ONE DIMENSIONAL SUMMARIES FOR EACH COLUMN IN OUR UNDERLYING DATA TABLE. AND THIS INCLUDES THINGS LIKE I CAN SEE MOST OF THE CARS COME FROM THE U.S.A., SOME OTHERS FROM JAPAN AND EUROPE. THIS IS AN OLD DATA SET. THIS IS PRIMARILY IN THE 1970S. I CAN SEE HOW MANY CARS ARE INCLUDED FOR EACH YEAR. AND THEN I CAN SEE DISTRIBUTIONS OF QUANTITATIVE FIELDS INCLUDE ACCELERATION, DISPLACEMENT, HORSEPOWER AND MILEAGE. AND IN DOING THIS, I HOPEFULLY GET AN OVERVIEW THAT MIGHT ALERT ME IF ANY OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS DON'T LOOK THE WAY I THINK THEY SHOULD, I MIGHT BE ALERTED TO A PROBLEM OF UNDERLYING DATA. I ALSO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE DATA CONTAINS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY INFORM THE TYPES OF MEANINGFUL AND REASONABLE QUESTIONS I MIGHT ASK OF THIS DATA SET. NOW, AT THIS POINT, I MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN MILEAGE, YOU KNOW, OR FUEL EFFICIENCY AS A PARTICULAR VARIABLE. SO IF I WANT, I CAN MANUALLY CONSTRUCT CHARTS AS WELL. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF I DRAG MILES PER GALLON TO THE Y ENCODING SHELF, I GET A VISUALIZATION. AND IN THIS CASE A VARIANT OF A DOT PLOT, A STRIP PLOT, THAT SHOWS ME THE DISTRIBUTION OF ALL THE VALUES. BUT INSTEAD OF JUST SHOWING THE INDIVIDUAL CHART, I CAN ALSO GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL THINGS TO LOOK AT WITHIN AN ANALYST SEARCH FRONTIER. THAT IS, WHAT ARE USEFUL THINGS THAT ONE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT NEXT SEATED BASED ON WHAT I'M CURRENTLY OBSERVING? SO FOR EXAMPLE, I CAN LOOK AT THE HISTOGRAM, YOU KNOW, SEE THE OVERALL DISTRIBUTION OF MILEAGE SCORES, OR LOOK AT SUMMARIES SUCH AS THE AVERAGE MILEAGE. AND I CAN GO DOWN AND I CAN SEE OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL. SO WHAT ARE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER VARIABLES? SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH WEIGHT DISPLACEMENT AND HORSEPOWER, I SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE LARGELY A QUADRATIC TREND THAT MILEAGE DECREASES AS THESE OTHER ATTRIBUTES INCREASE. I SEE A MUCH MORE INTERESTING PERHAPS RELATIONSHIP WITH ACCELERATION THAT'S NOT QUITE SO CLEAR. I CAN GET CARS THAT ACCELERATE QUICKLY BUT ALSO HAVE GOOD MILEAGE. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE NEARLY ALL VOLKSWAGENS. SO I GO DOWN I MIGHT DISCOVER OTHERS THINGS AS WELL. I CAN SEE, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY HOW IT DEPENDS ON CYLINDER, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CYLINDERS IN THE ENGINE DECREASES THE MILEAGE PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY. AND IF I GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, I ACTUALLY SEE A TIME SERIES AS WELL THAT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT MILEAGE MAY BE IMPROVING OVERTIME. ALL OF THESE WERE AUTOMATICALLY SUGGESTED, ONE, BY SEARCHING OVER POSSIBLE VISUALIZATIONS GIVEN WHAT I'M LOOKING AT BUT THEN ALSO RANKING THEM ACCORDING TO PERCEPTUAL MEASURES LIKE THOSE WE SAW EARLIER. SO THIS APPLICATION ACTUALLY HAS A MODEL OF THESE RANKINGS OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR DIFFERENT PERCEPTUAL CHANNELS AND DATA TYPES AND USES THAT TO CHOOSE WHICH CHARTS TO SHOW YOU HERE. NOW IF I MOUSE OVER THIS LITTLE ICON SHOWING SHELLS IN THE UPPER RIGHT HERE, I CAN SEE THE SHELVES FOR THE ENCODING SPECIFICATION UPDATE. SO IF I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO BUILD THIS CHART, I CAN LEARN FROM THESE EXAMPLES. I CAN CLICK TO PIVOT AND MAKE THIS MY CURRENT VIEW. DOING SO, I CAN SAY, OKAY, HERE IS THE RAW DATA, OR PERHAPS I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT AVERAGE MILEAGE OVER TIME AS A USEFUL SUMMARY. IF I WANT TO, I CAN PIVOT TO THAT. AND THEN DOING SO, I CAN GET OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MIGHT INCLUDE SUBDIVIDING THE DATA BY SOME MEANINGFUL CATEGORICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS HOW DOES THIS SUBDIVIDE BY CYLINDERS OR BY ORIGIN. NOW LOOKING AT ORIGIN, I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS INTERESTING AND PERHAPS CONCERNING. APPEARS THAT AMERICAN CARS HAVE MUCH WORSE MILEAGE THIS THIS TIME PERIOD THAN CARS COMING FROM THE U.S.A. OR EUROPE. I MIGHT WANT TO PIVOT TO THIS VIEW TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY CAUSING THIS. I DON'T WANT TO LEAP TO CONCLUSIONS. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY DON'T THE DATA PROVIDE MORE INSIGHT INTO THIS APPARENT DISCREPANCY. WELL, I CAN SEE THAT ONE OF THE CHARTS HERE IS ACTUALLY TO GO FROM A COLOR ENCODING OF ORIGIN TO USING WHAT'S CALLED A SMALL MULTIPLES VIEW. SO BREAKING THIS UP INTO MULTIPLE CHARTS WHICH WOULDN'T BE VERY USEFUL IF I HAVE OCCLUSION OR SOME OF THE LINES ARE DRAWN ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. BUT SCROLLING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, I FIND ANOTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IS SHOWING A BREAKDOWN BY CYLINDERS. NOTICE WHAT WE FIND HERE. A CERTAIN REGIONS HAVE 3 AND 5 CYLINDER ENGINES THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING. IN ALSO IF I SEE 4 AND 6 CYLINDER ENGINES, ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OVERLAP. AND THE LOW MILEAGE SCORE FROM THE U.S.A. IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT'S THE ONLY REGION IN THIS DATA SET THAT HAS 8 CYLINDER CARS. THIS IS A LATENT FACTOR THAT MIGHT HAVE LED ME TO A WRONG CONCLUSION EARLIER IF I HADN'T DONE THIS AND UNDERSTOOD WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE CONTEXT FOR MAKING COMPARISONS ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT REGIONS. RELATIVELY SIMPLE EXAMPLES BUT ONES THAT HOPEFULLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THESE ISSUES OF PROMOTING A BROADER AND MORE SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF THE UNDERLYING DATA SET. SO NOW I WILL JUMP BACK TO THE SLIDES. IN ADDITION TO BUILDING AND DEPLOYING THE SYSTEMS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, WE HAVE RUN A NUMBER OF USER STUDIES AND EXPERIMENTS TO SEE -- AT LEAST GET AN INITIAL INSIGHT INTO HOW IT EFFECTS PEOPLE'S EXPLORATION PATTERNS. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND INCLUDE THAT COMPARED TO EXISTING TOOLS SUCH AS TABLEAU, PEOPLE SEE OVER FOUR TIMES MORE UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF VARIABLES AND INTERACT WITH TWO TIMES MORE THAN OTHER TOOLS. SO WE ARE SEEING LIKE THIS, PEOPLE ARE OBSERVING MORE UNIQUE COMBINATIONS WITHIN THE DATA SET. AND WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE QUALITATIVE RESULTS AS WELL. PEOPLE FOUND THAT PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS HELPED THEM ACCELERATE EXPLORATION. AND THEY ALSO SAID THEY LIKED THAT IT SHOWS FIELDS THAT YOU CAN INCLUDE IN ORDER TO SEE A SPECIFIC GRAPH. THAT THE EXAMPLES SHOWN ACTUALLY HELP TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM. SO THIS EDUCATIONAL SCAFFOLDING WAS A NICE THING THAT WE DISCOVERED AS WELL. BUT MY FAVORITE QUOTE IS THIS ONE THAT IS A BIT MORE CIRCUMSPECT THAT SAYS THAT THESE RELATED VIEWS ARE SO GOOD, IT'S ALSO SPOILING THAT I START THINKING LESS. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S REALLY A GOOD THING. AND AS I'LL END, I THINK THE NUMBER ONE TENSION AND THE SPACE OF CREATING INTERACTION TOOLS, FINDING THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN AUTOMATION AND WHILE MAINTAINING USER CONTROL. IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING TENSION AND ONE THAT I THINK YOU HAVE TO BALANCE WELL TO REALLY GET THE BENEFITS OF SCALE WITHOUT LOSING THE BENEFITS OF HUMAN DOMAIN EXPERTISE AND INTUITION. AND SO, TO WRAP UP, LET ME GIVE THIS INTERACTIVE VIEW OF DATA ANALYSIS. I'VE STARTED BY FOCUSING ON VISUALIZATION. OF COURSE, VISUALIZATION IS JUST ONE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN DEPLOY IN A LARGER PROCESS OF DATA ANALYSIS. AND THAT INCLUDES TASKS SUCH AS HOW DO WE ACQUIRE DATA, HOW DO WE CLEAN IT, HOW DO WE INTEGRATE DIVERSE DATA SETS TOGETHER, ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO MODELING AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS. AND WHILE WE MIGHT IMAGINE AN IDEAL WORLD IN WHICH ONE HAPPILY SKIPS FROM ONE PART OF THIS PROCESS TO THE OTHER, IN REALITY, THESE EXERCISES LOOK MUCH MORE LIKE THIS. THEY ARE HIGHLY ITERATIVE AND REQUIRING OF HUMAN INTERACTION AND OVERSIGHT. YOU KNOW, AS I MIGHT DISCOVER DATA QUALITIES THAT MIGHT INVALIDATE MY DATA OR LEAD ME TO CLEAN IT IN NEW WAYS. AND IF YOU'RE A PH.D. STUDENT, HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T GET ALL THE WAY TO PRESENTING YOUR RESULTS TO YOUR ADVISERS TO MAKE THEM SEND YOU BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS ANALYSIS PROCESS. AND SO THIS IS -- WHILE CERTAINLY VERY TRENCHANT IN TODAY'S AGE, IT IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A QUOTE FROM ONE OF MY INTELLECTUAL HEROS, THE STATISTICIAN JOHN TUKEY. THIS IS ACTUALLY FROM 50 YEARS AGO HE WROTE AN ARTICLE WITH HIS COLLEAGUES MARTIN WILK ON DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS IN WHICH HE WROTE, FOUR MAJOR INFLUENCES ACT ON DATA ANALYSIS TODAY. ONE, THE FORMAL THEORIES OF STATISTICS. TWO, ACCELERATING DEVELOPMENTS IN COMPUTERS AND DISPLAY DEVICES. THREE, THE CHALLENGE IN MANY FIELDS OF MORE AND LARGER BODIES OF DATA. AND FOUR, THE EMPHASIS ON QUANTIFICATION IN A WIDER VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES. AND I THINK IT'S RATHER PRESCIENT THAT BACK THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS IN WAYS THAT I THINK WELL CAPTURE WHAT WE ARE DEALING IN TODAY'S SO-CALLED BIG DATA ERA. TUKEY GOES ON TO WRITE. WHILE SOME OF THE INFLUENCES OF STATISTICAL THEORY ON DATA ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL, OTHERS HAVE NOT. PARTICULARLY EXPOSURE HIS WORD FOR VISUALIZATION, THE EFFECTIVE LAYING OPEN OF THE DATA TO DISPLAY THE UNANTICIPATED, IS TO US A MAJOR PORTION OF DATA ANALYSIS. IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THE INFORMALITY AND FLEXIBILITY APPROPRIATE TO THE EXPLORATORY CHARACTERISTIC OF EXPOSURE CAN BE FITTED INTO ANY OF THE STRUCTURES OF FORMAL STATISTICS SO FAR PROPOSED. ACCORDINGLY, BOTH APPROACHES AND TECHNIQUES NEED TO BE STRUCTURED SO AS TO FACILITATE HUMAN INVOLVEMENT AND INTERVENTION. SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS ARE, ONE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE CONVENIENCE OF INTERACTION OF PEOPLE AND INTERMEDIATE RESULTS AND, TWO, AT ALL STAGES OF DATA ANALYSIS, THE OUTPUTS NEED TO BE MATCHED TO THE CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT AND WANT IT. AND I REALLY TAKE IN THIS QUOTE REALLY SORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT FOR WHAT I DO IN MY OWN RESEARCH LAB WHEREAS IN ADDITION TO VISUALIZATION, WE LOOK UP AND DOWN THE STACK AND CREATED NEW TOOLS FOR DATA CLEANING, AND INTEGRATION AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT, FOR ASSESSING THE ROLE OF PEOPLE WITHIN INTERACTIVE MACHINE LEARNING PROCESSES WHERE THEY ADD VALUE AND WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS. SO THERE IS A RICH SPACE OF RESEARCH AS NECESSARY TO REALLY ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AND THE PRACTICE OF DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IS MOST INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS ALSO SERVES AS A PETRI DISH OR A MICROCOSM IF YOU WILL FOR WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL ENGINEERING TENSIONS OF OUR ERA. AND THAT IS AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER, THIS BALANCE BETWEEN AUTOMATION AND CONTROL. WE ARE ALREADY CYBORGS FOR USING AUTOMATION AND VARIOUS WAYS WHETHER IT'S AUTOMATING A VOICE OF VISUALIZATION OR DATA PROCESSING FACILITIES. BUT, OF COURSE, WE WANT, YOU KNOW, THE ANALYSTS OR THE EXPLORER IN THE LOOP DRIVING THIS PROCESS TOWARDS SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL GOALS. AND SO LOTS OF INTERESTING TENSIONS TO EXPLORE HERE. I WILL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH A VERY FEW CLOSING THOUGHTS ON THIS MATTER. SO ONE IS IT'S OBVIOUSLY APPARENT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO SUCCESSFULLY AUTOMATING THINGS. WE CAN HAVE A LACK OF CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT AND DOMAIN EXPERTISE, AUTOMATED METHODS THAT MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO LET UP ON THEIR OWN. AND POOR MODELS LET LOOSE IN THE WORLD CAN HAVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THE MODEL ITSELF IS POOR OR THAT THE DATA THAT WE'VE TRAINED IT ON IS INAPPROPRIATE OR INSUFFICIENTLY REPRESENTATIVE. BUT, OF COURSE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVE PLENTY OF FLAWS OF OUR OWN. SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR US TO COMMUNICATE WHAT IT IS WE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE. SO TOOLS THAT MEDIATE THAT ARE VERY VALUABLE. WE DON'T DO PARTICULARLY WELL WHEN WE HAVE TO DO THINGS REPETITIVELY PARTICULARLY ON THE ORDER OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF ELEMENTS. SO OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AN ISSUE OF SCALE THERE. AND THERE IS ALSO THESE COGNITIVE BIASES I ALLUDED TO EARLIER WHICH TAKEN HAS WHOLE OFTEN STEM FROM THE FACT THAT OUR LACK OF A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE OR GLOBAL CONTEXT CAN LEAD US TO OVERWEIGHT LOCAL INFORMATION. AND SO THEN MAKE A DECISION THAT SEEMS RIGHT IN THE MOMENT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO WORSE OUTCOMES. AND SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN BIAS AGAINST SOME OF THESE PITFALLS AND ANALYTICAL THINKING. AND SO THE GENERAL STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPLORING IS FINDING SHARED REPRESENTATIONS AND ACTIONS FOR BOTH AUTOMATED TOOLS AND INTERACTIVE USAGE. YOU SAW THIS IN THE FORM OF VOYAGER, RIGHT, WHERE WE HAVE A REPRESENTATION FOR CHARTS AND BOTH AND AN ALGORITHM CAN COLLABORATE TOGETHER IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DRIVE FORWARD AN EXPLORATION OR PRODUCTIVE WAY. WE HAVE EXPLORED THIS STRATEGY OF DIFFERENT GUISES IN MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE AS WELL. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A MAGIC ANSWER OTHER THAN THAT DESIGN AND ENGAGEMENT AND EVALUATION ARE ALL CRITICAL TO THESE PROCESSES. AND I THINK GIVEN THE CURRENT BIG DATA AND MACHINE LEARNING HYPER, WE NEED A LOT MORE THIS ACROSS THE BOARD IF WE ARE GOING TO UNDERSTAND HOW EMERGENT TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE DEPLOYED IN A WAY THAT HAS THE BENEFITS OF CREATING A WORLD WE ACTUALLY WANT TO LIVE IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE]
