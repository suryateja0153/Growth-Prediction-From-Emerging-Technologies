 this video is on how to read climate graphs a climate graph can tell you some pretty important stuff so what can use fine on a climate graph is the following months of the year the precipitation Falls as snow rather than rain the growing season the average annual temperature the maximum temperature of a month the minimum temperature of a month the temperature range the total annual precipitation the seasonal distribution of precipitation and it helps people determine where places are in Canada do not worry if you did not know what some of these things are this video is going to explain each of them as it progresses okay so let's get started what is a climate graph the climate graph is two graphs in one it is a line graph and a bar graph of an area over an entire year oh how to read a climate ground first the horizontal lines show the months of the year the vertical axis on the Left represents the temperature in degrees Celsius the vertical axes on the right represents the amount of precipitation in millimeters the average temperature for each month is displayed as a line graph the average amount of precipitation for each month is displayed as a bar graph now that you know this information let's ask some climate questions what is the average temperature for the month of July define this you would find the month of July on the horizontal axis then follow up the column to the temperature line then follow the axes to the left the number is approximately 21 degrees Celsius so this would be our answer now the next question is what is the app each monthly precipitation for july in order to find this out the game we would go to the horizontal axis to find july go up to the top of the bar graph then go to the right hand axes to find out the amount of precipitation for july in this case the number would be approximately 72 73 millimeters ok now the next question how many months of the year does Toronto receive precipitation of snow in order to answer this questions you will need to examine the temperature graph look for the point that crosses the freezing line of zero in our example it would be here and here now drop an imaginary line down from the freezing points for the horizontal axis like this now imagine a horizontal line running along the freezing line connecting the temperature line like this everything above this line to the temperature line the precipitation falls as rain everything below the freezing line Falls as snow therefore you have one month ass note two months and three months on this diagram that falls a snow therefore the answer is three months ok the next question has to do with the growing season if the growing season is 5.6 degrees Celsius how many months on average hit common grasses grow in Toronto okay in order to do this the first thing I would do is draw the growing season on my graph so it's the growing season is 5.6 degrees Celsius let's place the horizontal line on the temperature scale of 5 point 6 degrees Celsius here approximately is the growing season on the left hands verical axes the temperature line crosses 5.6 degrees Celsius here and here therefore the growing season line is approximately here now it's just simple thing to count the number months between the growing season and the temperature line so we have one month here too three four five and six months right here is half a month so the answer is 6.5 now in order to figure out the rest of the type of questions you will be asked you need to understand some terminology so here are some definitions you definitely need to know what is the average annual temperature in order to do this all you do is add together to 12 monthly temperatures and divide by 12 what is the total annual precipitation all you do is find and add all the monthly precipitations together what is the maximum temperature it's the hottest month what is the minimum temperature it's the coldest month so what is the temperature range the temperature range equals the maximum temperature minus the minimum tension temperature sounds pretty simple but lots of students get tricked on this one so let's do an example let's say that in 2016 the maximum monthly temperature is 15 degrees celsius and the minimum monthly temperature is 5 degrees celsius so how do we find the temperature range the temperature range would be 15 degrees Celsius subtract 5 degrees Celsius so the answer would be 10 degrees Celsius that was pretty easy but let's look at an example that a lot of students get wrong and explain why to get it wrong let's say that in 2017 the maximum monthly temperature was 20 degrees Celsius and the minimum monthly temperature would be minus 20 degrees Celsius lots of students suddenly showdown answer that the temperature range would be 0 but this would be wrong the temperature range would be 20 degrees Celsius subtract negative 20 degrees Celsius the answer would be 40 degrees Celsius many students forget their integers remember two negatives make a positive okay one last thing you need to know before we start putting this all together that is the seasonal distribution of precipitation the first thing you need to know is that there are only two seasons when it comes to precipitation distribution that is summer and winter there is no spring and fall the second thing you need to know is that you only look at the bar graphs and nothing else so here goes this bar graph shows that this place experiences its precipitation season in the summer how do we know this because most of the bar graphs are highest in the summer months this bar graph shows that this place experiences of precipitation in the winter how do we know this because most of the bar graphs are highest in the winter months now we would call this summer distribution and winter distribution now what happens when you get a graph that looks like this when there is no distinct precipitation season then we say the season of seasonal distribution is year-round okay so let's put some of this terminology to practice what is the average annual temperature well if you added all the monthly temperatures up and divide by 12 the answer is eight point nine degrees Celsius what is the maximum temperature of the Toronto area well if you look on the vertical axis you will discover that is 21 degrees Celsius what is the minimum temperature of Toronto well if you take a look at the left-hand vertical oxys again your discover that the minimum temperature is for negative 4 degrees Celsius so what is the temperature range well now what you do is take 21 degrees Celsius you strike subtract negative 4 degrees Celsius and that would equal 25 degrees Celsius now for anyone who got a number in the teens you forgot about your integers remember two negatives make a positive so what is the seasonal distribution of precipitation for the Toronto area if you look at this graph carefully you come to the same conclusion as I did it's year round well that's it for this video hope it helped you to understand climate graphs hope you're having a great day bye for now
