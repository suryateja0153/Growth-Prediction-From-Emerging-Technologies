 See that graph? That's the frequency response graph. What's it mean? First off, what's sound frequency? It is measured in cycles per second, or hertz (Hz), such that a higher frequency indicates sound with a higher pitch. The range that a human can hear is 20 to 20,000 Hz. Theoretically, a speaker with a frequency response that includes this range would deliver all the sounds a human is capable of hearing. This graph is designed to show you the range of frequencies that a speaker can reproduce. Sound engineers measure a speaker’s ability to reproduce sound accurately by placing it in a room with sound-absorbing fiberglass wedges, and a calibrated microphone placed directly in front of the speaker. The engineer then feeds a tone to the speaker that contains all the frequencies within its response range at equal volume. Another device records the speaker’s output and creates a graph indicating the volume of each frequency within the audio range. The plot of a theoretically perfect speaker will be a flat line. In practice, the speaker’s ability to reproduce frequencies at roughly the same volume no matter what frequency of sound is playing is sometimes more important than the frequency range itself. A speaker should not change the relative volume of tones on a recording, which can make the playback sound unnatural. For example, the midrange should not be louder than the bass or treble, otherwise voices (which are mostly in the midrange) would sound unnaturally loud compared to most other instruments.
