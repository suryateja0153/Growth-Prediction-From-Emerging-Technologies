 [Music] [Music] now let's look at it from input side okay we let's talk about we have been in a way we have been talking about profit maximization in the short-run okay let me write it again profit is going to be and this we can write it as P multiplied by Q and Q is of course a function of K and L and in short run remember what did we say for illustration purpose that we will keep the fixed cost will come from keeping the capital fixed while we can vary the labor so we can say let's say capital is fixed at k bar so it's going to be our K bar plus W l WL and here also we will get K bar fine let me write it here profit capital PI not the small PI the small PI is reserved for the maximized value the maximized value of profit that can be achieved fine so this is capital PI and what we can say what we can do we can rewrite it if we draw let's say on y-axis we put Y and on x-axis we put on Y axis we put Q and on y axis x axis we put L okay similarly you can also think of this that instead of profit maximization in the short run we are talking about profit maximization in one variable where only one input is required and that input is L you can take that it is some fixed number doesn't matter okay fine so if we rewrite it how can we write we will take this on the left hand side q will be taken on the left hand side and I can write it like pi plus just rewriting nothing fancy here fine is it clear now with this what we can get is I so profit line y is equal to zero will denote you know because we are drawing in Q ll q axis L is on x-axis Q is on y-axis so we are going to draw remember like we had drawn I so cost line how did we draw the I so cost line what we did there that RK plus WL is equal to a fixed number fine here also we can draw also profit line in the sense that profit on that line would be the same and how can we get that let's say if we put PI is equal to 0 what we will get we will get our K bar divided by P plus W P by L and this is an equation of a line and this line will give us profit is equal to 0 from here we get intercept so we can draw something like this let us say instead of taking PI is equal to 0 we take PI is equal to 1 what we will get Q is equal to 1 plus RK bar divided by P plus W P by L and what will happen just a parallel shift because slope remains the same what does change from here though from this point from this line to this line them only the intercept so there is a parallel shift and shift is equal to one by P and so similarly we get like this and we can keep doing this is it clear also of course we are talking about production in short run so Q is equal to f of k bar L you can also think of it that Q is equal to f of let's say let's use another function f of L that it is production in one variable so that also we can draw and if we allow for diminishing marginal productivity with respect to L how would it look like it would look like this so this is the maximum profit that can be achieved this one is the maximum profit that we can achieve and how much will be the production from here we can get the production here we can get the amount of L start from here we get the amount of Q star is it clear what is the idea to get as much profit as possible so what's happening let's say if you keep on increasing L let's say you start with 0 at L is equal to 0 you are not producing anything so your profit is equal to it it can't be you know it may be negative because you already have some fixed cost but if you start producing more what happens you are able to earn some revenue and of course you will be incurring some cost as long as your revenue is more than the cost you will earn a positive profit so as you move in this direction profit as we see from this these lines that in this case profit is increasing but beyond this point what is happening profit starts decreasing why can you tell me sir because beyond this point the marginal productivity of labour is so low that we won't be able to you know adding labour would not add the output by match so the idea is to produce at this point and that is the that's where you want to be fine is it clear okay now we can do it using calculus also but before that let's understand let's try to do some comparative statics what does it mean that if we vary W or if we vary L or if we vary our sorry if you vary what are the parameters here the parameters are RK are W and P so if vary one of these what happens to the optimal amount of labour and how what happens to the optimal amount of output to maximize the profit can you tell me let's say if W increases think about it think for a minute and say if output incredible u increases what happens to the optimal amount of labour used for the production and what happens to the output labour decreases and so is the device can you think you can tell both let me show you just fine let's say that this is the ISO profit line okay this is where we are correct this is where we are and here we are at Q and of course we have parallelized so profit line when W goes up what happens to the ISO profit line they become steeper so they will be like this of course these are parallel so let's say now new point is here okay so L start thus an L star - is less than L star L star corresponds to W and this correspond to W - and W - is more than W and this is the implication fine similarly can you tell me what happens to when P increases both labor and optimal amount of output will increase why because let's see here let's say earlier this is the now what's happening isoprofit lines are becoming even flatter look at this isoprofit line what will happen it will become like this if it's becoming flatter so of course this company can make more profit by increasing it will be producing at this point so earlier we were at this point so there is an increase in labour and thus output will also increase is it clear no okay [Music] [Music]
