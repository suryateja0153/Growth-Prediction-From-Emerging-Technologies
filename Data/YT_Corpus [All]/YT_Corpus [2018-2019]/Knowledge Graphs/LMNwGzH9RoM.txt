 Okay, so we actually have different ways that we can create graphs in SPSS So let's look at the three different ways that we can do graphs in SPSS One way you already saw and that's by going into analyze descriptive statistics And in frequencies we have our chart option, and I'm going to remove commute here we have the chart option, so let's for example the side of you want to do a bar chart with a bar chart and We'll leave it at frequencies. That's fine and hit continue And let's do our bar chart like we did before on race And we hit, okay We get our bar chart for race Lead like we did before now The second way to do a bar chart is to go into the graphs menu We're going to graphs and we have legacy dialogues and we go to bar Now you know here, we can see we have a simple bar chart and look at the dialogues We have a couple of other options. We could pick simple cluster those stacked. I'm going to pick a simple bar chart Click on it, and I'm going to define that bar chart And I'm gonna put in what variable I want that since I did percent in our frequencies bar chart I'm not gonna. Let it stay at end of cases I'm gonna do percent of cases so we get the exact same chart big it do n q And q % or I pick some other statistic I'm looking for race And find race in here And he put race on the category axis the x-axis so we have the race in our category axis and the height of the bar will indicate what percent if You want you can add titles? So we could say you know um Because you know We say let's see I leave it there anyone can have a subtitle and you can add footnotes Don't restrict yourself to what we're doing a video play with SPSS you cannot break it So we have our title we hit continue look at the options They'll apply to us right now, so we'll hit continue, and then we'll do okay And we have the exact same bar chart except that I change the title to ethnicity from race of respondent So Let's look at the third way to do our graph Again, we go back to graphs This time you go to chart builder And it's a pretty cool little feature that you know. I like we get this dialog box just hit OK and It brings you through this top of the dialog box here you see that we have the list of our variables Over here, we have our chart preview and here we have different tabs that we can select Let's leave it on the gallery tab keep that highlighted in yellow And you'll see that we can choose from a list of different graphs and here are the samples from the graph that we can use So we're gonna pull race again Well, then be consistent. We'll get our race variable When you use race Um I just played this because Co gonna have to go drag it, but before you can drag it we have to pick that we're gonna do a bar and Then we're gonna pick which bar we want we want this part a simple bar so when you find a bar you want The template you want you click it and you drag it to The chart preview area and you let go so now here We have our template and once you drag your template in to try preview area this element properties window will pop up Before we mess with element properties Let's look at our preview Again, this is just a sample So nothing has done yet, we have it's asking you what you're gonna put on the y-axis Were you gonna put any x-axis so now? We've go to race and we drag race to the x-axis and now you'll see that it automatically transfer to count We have white black and other for our Categories, this is not a preview of your data This is just so it's not like an exact previous you say this is just what it would look like when you do it If you look at element properties right now we have bar one highlighted and with bar one We could talk about what's that do we want to use do we want to use count um? Do you want to use percent this because stick was count to see what happens? But you do q % me median you could pick different statistics check or go on your y-axis This graph will look different because here we use percent Here, I'm gonna excuse to use count just for the fun of it So we'll leave it a count if you make any Changes to your selections you have to apply before you're able to continue Okay, but I only did that to show you that if you do anything. You must apply first if you click on where it says x-axis 1 bar 1 now we have Options that pertain to our x-axis for example the axis label Currently says race of respondent we can switch this label to say Ethnicity and Suppose we want to change the order that our categories appear in suppose. We want to make it um you know black white other We can you know we have the white highlighted, and we use these arrows to move to categories to we want them to be We made changes to this we click apply and now you see that it has reordered it to be black then white and other and It still says race, but when we actually do it. They'll say ethnicity We could do the same with the y-axis. We can change the label here from count. We can make a safe frequency If you want to if you can type which I can't If you want to change these options you could And we hit apply We're here close with you, okay, and now we have our new graph Remember we did it as frequency now. It's count we change the options So that we reordered our bars and here goes ethnicity so those are three ways that we can make any graph in SPSS using allies descriptive test frequencies or Using graphs legacy dialogues and the type of graph you want all using graphs and chop hill done
