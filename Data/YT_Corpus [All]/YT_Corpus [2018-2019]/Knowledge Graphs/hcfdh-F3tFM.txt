 In this video, we will solve a problem from Final Test Review. We will graph Exponential and Logarithmic functions in the same rectangular coordinate system. To answer this question, let's review both graphs. You can graph an exponential function by plotting points. Let's create several ordered pairs for this function and let's plot them. We will get the graph 2 in power x. As a logarithmic function is the inverse of an exponential function, graphs are symmetric over the diagonal. So, we can graph it by flipping an exponential function's graph over the diagonal. Let's look at our problem one more time. You can see that a correct answer is our middle graph. This is all for today. See you next time!
