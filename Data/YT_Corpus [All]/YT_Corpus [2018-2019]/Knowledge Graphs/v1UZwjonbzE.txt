 [Music] [Music] line graphs and edge coloring recap of previous lecture we have discussed the elementary properties of subdivision and minor of a graph guatrau squeeze theorem wagner's theorem and also proof non linearity of Peterson graph content of this lecture we will discuss the line graphs and how the line graphs are used in edge coloring and one factorization of a graph so let us see the concept of line graph and we will use it for the edge coloring so many questions about the vertices have analogies for the edges independent sets have no adjacent vertices and matchings have no adjacent edges so analogues with vertices and corresponding problem in the edges are also there with a different name if no vertices which are adjacent called independent sets then for the matching no edges are adjacent now vertex coloring partitions the vertices into independent sets we can illustrate partition the edges also into the matchings so these problems we can relate why are the line graphs here we repeat the definition emphasizing our return to the context in which the graphs may be may have the multiple edges we use line graphs because the edge graph is not a proper term now let us see the line graph line graph of a graph G is represented as L of G is a simple graph whose vertices are the edges of that graph G with the edges of line graph is nothing but when the edges of G they are meeting at a common point take this particular example if this is the graph G where we have labeled the edges with their names so for every edge there will be a vertex in the line graph now as far as the edge in a line graph says that whenever these two edges in the original graph are meeting for example D and E they meet so they will form an edge in the line graph similarly D and F they meet so D and F has an edge similarly e and f meets so e and f has an edge similarly D and G they meet so D and G they have an edge and F and H they meet so f and H they have an edge so H and G they meet so H and G they have an edge and F and G they also meet so f and G they have an edge so if we are given a graph G we can obtain a line graph of that particular graph using this concept so again we can take another example in this example we are given a graph so for a we have an vertex B we have a vertex for Evi a vertex for C we have a vertex and for D we have a vertex now a and B they are meeting a and B they are meeting so we place an edge and a they are meeting we place an edge a and C they are meeting we place an edge then B and D they are meeting B and C they are meeting so we place an edge B and D they are meeting we place an edge now C and B they are meeting so we place an edge similarly e and C they are meeting so we place an edge so this is called a line graph of this particular graph now the edge coloring problem arise when the objects being scheduled are the pairs of the underlying elements so example of ethical rings of let us say K to n so K to n when n is let us say 2 so this becomes K to n graph now we want a pair of objects to be considered as far as the xi ruling of a game is concerned then it requires an edge coloring not the vertex coloring so in the league of two and teams we want to show rule the game so that each pair of teams play a game but each team plays at most once in a week so since each team a must play to n minus 1 others the season lasts at two n minus one week so the games of each week must form a matching we can schedule the season in to n minus 1 weeks if and only if we can partition these edges into two and minus one matchings since K to n is 2 n minus 1 regular there must be a perfect matching so we can see here that having arranged the bipartite graph instead of that let us add so this becomes K to n graph so k2n graph means if you take a particular team so how many because it is 2 and minus 1 a regular graph so it can have appearing with all n minus 1 vertices so these edges will pair similarly the other edges will also have such pairings so different pairings are basically possible so we can partition these set of edges into 2 n minus 1 different matchings and how to obtain these matchings that is the pairings is called an edge basically colouring so when we obtain a paring so there is a rule that if these two are selected then the remaining pair that means this is one set of match when 1 2 3 4 when 1 & 3 is one such of matching and 2 & 4 is one matching second matching we can obtain as 1 4 & 2 3 is another matching similarly we can hire another matching like one two and three four so this particular graph has two and minus three different matchings and this will require two n minus 1 so 2 n minus 1 matchings so here 2 n minus 1 comes out to be 3 so 3 matchings we have obtained so for that you might have seen that the graph has to be a 2 n minus 1 regular and it has a perfect matching then only 2 n minus 1 different matchings are possible therefore let us see the definition ok edge coloring of a graph is the labeling of the edges with the color set s where the cardinality of s is K so that means applying K different colors we are placing the colors on these edges and K edge coloring is nothing but that particular labeling or a function so the labels are the colors the edges of one color will form the color class so K edge coloring is proper if the incident edges have different labels that is if each color class is a matching so let us understand what is the proper coloring the incident edges have different labels so take this particular graph so the incident edge on this particular vertex if this is having label let us say red so the other edge will have another label why because the incident edges should have the different labels for a proper so it's a proper two colorings to edge coloring so a graph is K edge colorable if it has a proper K edge colorings the edge chromatic that is Chi prime G of a new place graph is the least value of cases that the graph is K edge colorable example of it coloring a complete graph is basically shown over here now we call the edge chromatic number also as the chromatic index so Chi prime G is called chromatic index since the edges sharing a vertex need different colors therefore this bound on the edge chromatic number that is Chi prime G is at least the maximum degree of a particular graph missing and Gupta independently proof that Delta G plus 1 color suffice when the graph is simple so we will see that what are the conditions when the edge chromatic number of a graph that is Chi prime G is at least Delta and what are the conditions as far as weezing and Gupta theorem that this particular chromatic index will become Delta G plus 1 now a clique in the line graph is the set of pairwise intersecting edges of G because the vertices are representing the edges of graph G so if there is a clique in line graph this means that there is a set of pairwise intersecting edges of a graph when G is simple such edges from the start or a triangle in particular G for the hereditary class of line graph of a simple graph using theorem states that Chi prime H is less than or equal to Omega H plus 1 thus the line graphs are almost perfect in contrast to Kaiji multiple edges greatly affect the Kyle prime G that is chromatic index so a graph with a loop has no proper edge coloring so that is important point to be noted hence the loop less will be excluded here but multiple edges are allowed in the edge coloring so multiplicity multiple edges means between two vertices multiple edges can be there and how many edges are there that is called multiplicity so in a graph G with multiple edges we say a vertex pair XY is an edge of multiplicity M if there are M different edges with the endpoints x and y so here let us say that there are M so hence the multiplicity of M will be there now we write mu of X Y for multiplicity of a pair and we write down mu G for the maximum of the edge multiplicities in the graph so this kind of structure where multiplicities of where multiplicity of a graph or multiplicity of the pairs are allowed and this is called a fat triangle now there is a theorem which is given by conic which states that if the graph G is bipartite then I prime G is equal to Delta G so let us see the proof corollary which is stated in the previous videos three point one point one three states that that is the halls theorem states that every regular bipartite graph H has one factor so it's a it's a halls theorem about matching so one factor is nothing but a matching so every regular bipartite graph H has one factor so by induction on big Delta of H this leads a proper Delta H edge colorings it therefore suffices to show that every bipartite graph G with the maximum degree K there is a K regular bipartite graph containing G to construct such a graph we add the vertices to a smaller part I'd set of G if necessary to equalize the sizes if the resulting graph G prime is not regular then each part I set has vertices less than that degree K at that edge and thus make it as K regular for a regular graph G the proper edge coloring with big Delta G colors is equivalent to decomposition into one factor let us see through an example so let us say that this is the graph which is given a bipartite graph now here one vertex is missing we can add that vertex to a smaller part I'd set this is a smaller part I'd sets we have added one vertex to equalize the sizes now if this particular G prime is not regular then we will place an edge these edges are added extra and hence this becomes two regular or let us say it's a K regular graph now having obtained that means given any such part I'd graph we can obtain a K regular graph by these set of operations by adding vertices and by editing edges having done that now you know that the big Delta G of this particular graph is two so we can obtain an edge coloring with at most big delta-g colors so let us say that if these this H V color then we cannot color the other edge which are incident on these vertices with the same color so the other two vertices which need to be colored the other two vertices will require the same color which are not same now the remaining edges require another color so hence we are using a green color so the remaining edges we can apply the green color so every vertex which is incident having the edges of different colors how many colors that is big Delta G the colors will be required let us read again so corollary 3.1.3 states that every regular bipartite graph has one factor so that is basically the perfect matching if the graph is a regular bipartite graph now by the induction on big Delta of this particular graph this yields a proper Delta H edge colorings so we have shown that and we have also shown through this particular steps that if the graph is not K regular we can obtain it by adding the vertices or adding and edges so hence this conic we have seen the theorem that if graph G is bipartite then Chi prime G is equal to big Delta G that is for bipartite graphs so for bipartite graph this particular bound holds according to the connect theorem let us see one factorization is nothing but the matchings the decomposition of a regular graph into one factor is the one factorization of a graph G so graph with one factorization is called one factorable so an odd cycle is not one factorable so take an odd cycle this is c5 so not cycle it is not one factorable why because if you can select this edge then this edge cannot be selected this edge to put is selected this vertex will be unsaturated hence this is not the perfect matching hence it's not one factorable similarly if an even cycle we can take so we can factorize we can obtain the one factor in the following way so this is these are all called one factors of this particular graph 1 2 3 4 there is another one factor you can obtain between 1 3 & 2 4 so this is one factorable so the Peterson graph also requires an extra color but only one extra color that is the important point or not so that means the Peterson graph is three regular but it requires how many colors Kyle prime of Peterson is equal to four that means it requires big Delta G is equal to three plus one more so Peterson graph is is an example where Kyle prime G becomes plus 1 so Peterson graph is for edge chromatic so Peterson graph is three regular three edge colorable T requires one factorization deleting a perfect matching leaves two factors all components are cycle here we can see if we delete it this is a perfect matching so we will obtain two different cycles which I will show you through this is one cycle c5 and this is another cycle so two cycles to see five cycles we will obtain all component cycles the one factorization can be completed only if these are all even cycles thus it suffices to show that every two factor is isomorphic to to c5 so here we have seen that consider the drawings of to c5 and a matching the cross edges between them we consider the cases by a number of classes are used so every cycle uses an even number of cross edges so a two factor H has an even number of cross edges if m is equal to 0 then H is equal to then H is equal to 2 c5 now when M is equal to two so here we can see that this is one and two then the two cross edges have non adjacent endpoints on the inner circle or the outer circle on the cycle where their endpoints are non adjacent the remaining three vertices Falls all five edges of that cycle into H which violates the two factor requirement so when M is equal to four one two three four then the cycle edges fold into H by unused cross edge form a two piece this is one P and this is another P whose only completion to to factor in H is to cease note that since C five has three edge colorable the graph is for edge colorable missing theorem missing and Gupta has given a theorem which says that if G is a simple graph then Chi prime G is less than or equal to big Delta G plus one big Delta G means the max degree of particular graph is one now if we correlate with the previous discussion that we have seen that bipartite graph is having Chi prime G equal to big Delta that also is included into it so with this we include the definition a simple graph G is class 1 if Chi prime G is equal to big Delta it is called class - if Chi prime G is equal to big Delta G plus 1 so the example here is a bipartite graph by conics theorem we have seen this and this becomes valid for a Peterson graph hence the bipartite graph is class 1 graph and Peterson graph is class 2 graph determining whether a graph is class 1 or class 2 is generally hard thus we seek the conditions that forbid or guarantees big Delta G edge color ability so conclusion in this lecture we have discussed the characterization of a line graphs edge colorings chromatic index multiplicity and 1 factorization thank you [Music] [Music]
