 when I miss Alexander I'm coming from the German Centre for diabetes research in Germany and the head office in Munich and today I'll talk a little bit about our graph database and how we fight diabetes with graphs let's start with evolution in the times of the dinosaurs and when there was no supermarket around humans had the advantage to store energy when there was food and they could store this energy as fat for the bad times and this advantage turned out to be a disadvantage today where we have supermarkets all over and we have abundance of food and we still eat a lot and this fat got stored and stored and we got overweight and obese and this obesity is a problem because this mainly causes diabetes so what is diabetes diabetes is a metabolic disease where either insulin production in our pancreas is dramatically reduced or the body pulley responds on insulin just to keep you in mind insulin is the hormone it's a protein that your body needs to get the sugar out of your bloodstream and consequences of this sugar in your blood is that the sugar is less absorbed into your muscle cells or liver cells and the sugar stays in the blood vessels and this is called hypoglycemia and it's not stored and in the cells as I said the adidas has tremendous complications I will come to that later and currently it's not curable it's only treatable when we talk about diabetes we mainly have the four different kinds of diabetes type 1 diabetes come to that later type 2 gustation of diabetes which is diabetes and pregnant women and we have some special forms that we are currently studying on the right side you see a picture here so this is the the healthy body in your pancreas there are some cells that produce insulin here these little green dots and this is your stomach and you you get you get your sugar into the blood vessels and then insulin comes to it and if they both come together you get your sugar to the liver or to the muscle cells and in type 1 diabetes which is roughly 5% of the patients these insulin producing cells get destroyed by your own immune system and this is independent from any from from any lifestyle and it's a gene defect and people are dependent on an external insulin source throughout their lives and there are 20 genes roughly 20 genes that are involved in this process and yeah it's not curable on the other hand type 2 diabetes roughly 90 percent to 95 percent depending on the country there is a little different picture these cells are producing insulin but there's an insulin resistance so the production is still going on but the body doesn't react on that normally people don't don't realize that that they suffer from diabetes more than 150 genes are involved in this process which increase the risk to get diabetes and as I term at the cocktail of evil if yes that you have a genetic predisposition you're you have overweight and physical inactivity just to show you some numbers here worldwide we have more than 5 400 million people suffering from diabetes and it was thought that this was a disease from other people but actually 2/3 of the people are in their working age we got another 200 million diabetics who undiagnosed this is very problematic thing we have more than 1 million children suffering from from diabetes is mostly type 1 diabetes and 12% of all their health care costs are caused by diabetes so it's a severe problem we have to deal with this when we go to the u.s. just to have some numbers here 30 million are our diabetes patients in in the US every year there's one and a half million coming to it and we got 85 million of pre-diabetes patients and when we look at this number here down there we got 90 billion dollars per year that come from the reduced productivity of the people suffering from it this is a chart which summarizes 1985 to 2009 so almost 20 years and you see there the people that are obese here in the different states and see that this number is growing and growing so even more people get diabetes and suffer from that complications lots of complications a cure on diabetes so diabetes itself is not the the real issue but people are dying from from the complications namely stroke or heart attack like one-third of all the heart attacks is caused by diabetes and nerves are blood vessels are degraded in in your extremities and some of you have maybe heard about the diabetic feet that have to be amputee and putative for that of course you get renal problems in your kidney yeah diabetes is a complex disease it's in your metabolism here's the pancreas and it's a cellular process that is dependent on your environment or your lifestyle but also on the genetics or epigenetics I come to that in a second and the problem on this is that on your environment and what in your lifestyle you inherit your lifestyle to the next generation when we see this mice here oops this mice here or these human they are twins actually they are genetically identical but the epigenetics which are these little labels here on the DNA they are different on that level and this causes diabetes and this on this level you can inherit diabetes to the next generation and a group of our researchers had some experiment in mice where you have different diets so here these mice get a normal diet and these ones get a high-fat diet and then you have an in vitro fertilization and you see that the the offsprings of the next generation gets diabetes it get gets overweight and with this overweight the risk of diabetes is dramatically increased so we are the German Centre for diabetes research we are a federal institute or organization that is academic and nonprofit we are funded by the Federal Ministry of Education at research and by the states we consist of five main partners depicted here in Munich tubing in Dusseldorf Berlin Potsdam and Andreasen we got some associated partners and overall we got roughly 400 researchers from different disciplines from basic research and from university hospitals and our research areas our nutrition we got patients in the clinics we do prevention we do genetics and cohort studies in basic research and our main goals is to prevent diabetes to treat diabetes get new treatment for patients and to prevent these complications that I showed you talking about prevention we want to prevent diabetes and these subtypes let's say type 1 type 2 or some other new types that we currently under investigation and we want to identify them with some intelligent algorithms and we want to treat them individualized now how do we fight diabetes so the typical researcher it's everyday business and they are looking for information they are looking for data within our organization and this is like yeah looking for the needle in the haystack and unfortunately we have got a lot of haystacks in the clinics and basic research and usually these are easy questions like what blood samples do we have or what did we measure in the liver and turned out that these answers are not so easy to answer so it's a complex query and in this originate because we usually were three different businesses hospitals as I said basic research and some bioinformaticians and we all used to work for the same customer the diabetic patient but everybody of this researcher saw this diabetic patient a little bit differently some see it as animal models some look at microscopy pictures and some look on the metabolites and so on and so forth but now we have to look in a new way to our customer to combine different types of data and that means that we have to share data we have to look from as many perspectives as possible and that means we have to connect the data together there are two options so one option would be to develop all the databases separately from each other but this is not such a good idea we want to build a new layer so connected data and that's why we are here and this is what we call DCD Connect it's a new - new for a graph database and now this graph database helps us or helps our researchers to answer biomedical questions these questions can be answered across the locations as I said we have more than 10 different locations in Germany we can answer questions across disciplines and across species this database should be extendable scalable and this is one of the main features why would like graph databases so much we have a visualization coming with it when we have a look now to the data we have homogeneous data here depicted in these similar icons we have had a genius and homogeneous data for the time being we don't touch the raw data because of data security and we classify this data at the different locations we give them labels and now we collect the labels so that we have the patient data connected to each other but in the end of course we reduce it to two single labels and this is how you see it's getting to a graph model why do we do graph databases at all well the first answer is biological biology is connected anyway so all the data and biology is connected our researchers like it because it's so easy to understand the data model is like human readable even for non computer scientists it's easy to query I think it's much easier to query then than normal SQL it's scalable and adaptable so when we have a new field of new discipline or new location we can easily adopt the graph model and we can extend it and as I said we have a very nice visualization so these are the main reasons when I talk about data currently we include a metadata this is our preliminary data model here very big Harpe is an experiment because we are researchers we do a lot of experiments and in these experiments we measure different parameters with different techniques or devices in some of our experiments we collect bio samples like blood urine liver whatever you like and we also include data from from publications from scientific peer-reviewed publications and these all are connected in our data model so examples for for for metadata can be we have microscopic images you can you can store the dimensions what you see on the pictures for parameters we store the parameter name the units how its measured we have a biosample database where we store our bio samples on liquid nitrogen and we want to extend this graph so there are different possibilities how we can extend it other diseases we can extend it by other diseases like cardiovascular diseases or Alzheimer's there are a lot of literature databases publicly available we will include electronic lab notebook data or protein database data and here in the bottom this is a special case where we enter the world of genes proteins and metabolites there are measured here in these experiments and now we focus on that this is a very nice poster by Rush it's publicly available and what you see here is all the metabolic the metabolic pathways in your body summed up together now we are focusing just here on this blue box and this is the zoom and you see it's getting complicated and if we zoom more in this you see here that there are metabolites that are metabolized by enzymes and they are regulated by other metabolites and so on and so forth and this data base is very and very huge and startup company from the hammer Center in Munich called knowing health they deal with this problem and this is their data model also near for Jane and they connect these different worlds of genes transcripts and proteins and their new Forge a database is it's very large 800 million nodes and relationships and we can include this database in our database another example how we extend our graph is yonk rooms like here in the audience he is now assistant professor at Cornell and he's dealing with very rich data sources and these data sources of metabolites are associated with phenotype data in summary we can say we build meta database with graph technology having different disciplines different locations and they are connected to each other now let's come to the examples one example is that many of the medical doctors asked so how many bio samples were acquired in visit 17 in our clinical study this clinical study is called a pre diabetes lifestyle intervention study and they are interested in these bio samples and what did they measure on that and this question is not so easy to answer for this we build a special data model we have a clinical study here and in this study the patients come in different visits and in these visits then the doctors make a different experiment and they measure parameters and in some of the visits they acquire some bio samples that they store and measure the data on that and now our medical doctors can go to our new forge a graph database they can they can get their clinical study here then they can extend they see the visits here okay and then they can browse to visit 17 and now you see that it's easily getting complicated we have many different experiments here in pink where we have the parameters in in gray and the bio samples in yellow and that's why it's so complicated to answer this question second is example is something completely different here we want to connect data from different species namely from human and our pre diabetic pig model and we ask the question can human type 2 diabetes genes can they be studied in in our animal model to answer this question you have to know that all these areas here are different research areas and where many many people do research on that and we have to connect them you see here the data model we connect them with knowing and we have a set of genes here on top that are annotated for diabetes these genes are mapped through the different databases publicly available databases into enzymes and these enzymes metabolize different compounds and so this is the human part of the data now we have the pre diabetic pic where we have a targeted metabolomics si we measure 16 different metabolites and in the public database these 16 metabolites are 31 identifiers and then we have a union of these sets and we come to the result that seven compounds between the animal model and the human data could be identified and now our researchers are looking into these metabolites in order to get new insights for diabetes what's the outlook we want to extend our graph by literature data that is publicly available we have here peer-reviewed articles in a very large database called PubMed there are as I heard 30 million 30 million texts in it and about all the different basic research areas and nobody can read all the texts anymore and when you're looking for diabetes you know it's the bottleneck that you can read or that you can read slowly and we want to do an automatically learning algorithms on these texts here too to learn gene names or to learn diseases here are some specific terms for it - you see it and in the end we want to do that for many many texts and see what are the connections between the texts so every purple node here is a text that is analyzed by a natural language processing procedure by graph aware and then we see the overlap between different research texts and we want to find these connections not only in the diabetes world we also want to find connections between cardiovascular effects or Alzheimer's diseases cancer infectious diseases and lung diseases and these orange dots here are all organizations like ours like the German Centre for diabetes research in Germany and we want to connect with each other to fight diabetes or to fight these other diseases and this should summarize it again so we have our our people here that have different subtypes of diabetes or other diseases and we have the expert knowledge because we have the researchers here and the the medical doctors in the clinics and we combined it now with graft technology and we are on the way to better identify or cluster new subtypes of diabetes to have an individualized treatment or have an individualized prevention of them and this should be a new center coming soon called the digital diabetes prevention center we want to do pattern recognition on on huge amounts of data that people from the society give us we want to do supervisor unsupervised machine learning techniques in order to give back a benefit for the people who gave the data and of course the benefit for the whole society in my opinion graph technology enables us to have a new level of diabetes prevention and treatment we see events that we couldn't have seen with relational databases and this is again because we can connect different disciplines different locations and different species with this I want to acknowledge the the funders here the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the States I want to thank all the scientists of the DCD and I want to thank the organizers here and the organizer team for such a smooth organization and such a nice conference and I'm happy to take questions yes so currently we are not storing regulations or like values we are storing metadata but in the future we want to do that and well I don't know if we start in properties or in nodes not yet true I guess it's a performance issue I would tend to put it in note yes and because this comes from from a bio sample you can linked it to a bio sample guess it makes sense to put it in a node yes yeah so there are many answers for that so one is cipher queries second is I would let's say like this do you have two nodes that are that you're interested in like there's a gene and the animal model and there's a gene in in human and you want to know if there's a connection between it and so you have predefined graph algorithms find me the shortest path should I find all the passes find me a path with the lengths of I don't know ten ten different other nodes I guess there will be there will be some algorithms solving that problem well I sit there with the with the medical doctor and we go through the data model I mean our graph is not so big currently I mean they are much bigger graphs out there and we go through these different nodes and we you know like on the on the fly we say can we answer these questions but this yeah I guess it's a mixture between trying out and clicking and cipher and algorithms and training yeah it's tough question yeah the question yeah yeah yeah by graphing we're the guys that are out there having a booth well these are the consultants correct me if I'm wrong these are consultants on neo4j technology I used the the publicly available version of it and I analyzed some tanks and looked and looked to some connections between different kinds of literature data yeah and it was pretty easy I must say other questions yeah not yet other questions yeah say it again so this project is only 18 months old we had some prototypes and the one that I showed it with the metabolites between the pre-diabetic Pig and human and we have to investigate that now yeah hopefully we have some new insights but I'm sure the more data we import the more we can answer a lot more new insights or biomarkers we find yeah yeah [Music] not so easy to answer this question and first this is available for our researchers because it's the the data that our organization has main problem here is that we have also patients data and we can't give that out when we think about collaborations and we are talking about academic collaborations mostly of that I guess it could be possible there's a use and access committee dealing with this so yes and no yes yes yes I guess there's more research going on on type 2 because there are more people and affected to that but we also do do type 1 diabetes well it's I wouldn't say I mean they are related because it's somehow a metabolic disease but these are not the common not so many common genes to that I would say it's different yeah and there are some new subtypes that we see so we have we have obese or with overweight people that are totally happy don't have diabetes and the other way around so we have to see what's going on there to define new types or subtypes of diabetes my profession I'm bound phonetics say it again yeah so I'm the interface yeah I'm understanding I hope I can understand our clinicians and our researchers yeah and to translate it into IT the question was so we have we have high fat diet mouse and normal diet Mouse and when you and vitro fertilizer [Music] the new generation gets fed and this is because of epigenetics this because of your lifestyle and not about your genes and the question was is this is this model also true in in human and this is exactly what interests us and are these the same metabolic pathways are these the same genes involved are these the same let's say lifestyle or or environmental and factors so this what we are currently investigating okay any more questions then thank you for your attention and have a nice afternoon [Applause]
