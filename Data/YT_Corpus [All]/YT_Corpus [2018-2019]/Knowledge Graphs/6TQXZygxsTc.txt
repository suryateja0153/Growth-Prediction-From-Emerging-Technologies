 good morning previously we derived equations for position velocity and acceleration of an object moving in simple harmonic motion now we are going to look at graphs of those equations and demonstrate them using a simple harmonic motion projection from circular motion oh that makes sense these are the three equations we derived previously Billy what are Amiga and Phi Phi is the phase constant which phase shifts the curve along the horizontal axis and Omega is the angular frequency which we derived by using the equation angular velocity equals the angular displacement over change in time and if the object experiences one full revolution or cycle then the change in time equals the period and the change in angular position equals 2pi radians and we know frequency equals the inverse of period therefore angular frequency Omega equals 2pi times frequency Thank You Billy now for simplicity's sake we're going to assume Phi is zero for all of the functions we are about to graph and demonstrate okay let's look at the circular motion of a yellow marker cap on a turntable along with a motion tract dots on top of a cap and a dot motion tract in just the vertical direction that shows the relationship between simple harmonic motion and circular motion and let's add a vertical mass spring system for just a bit to show that it truly is simple harmonic motion okay the dot that is motion tracked to the marker cap but only in the vertical direction moves just like the vertical mass spring system it really is simple harmonic motion thanks yes yes it is let's go back to just the dot because it has a more precisely identified location notice if we look at where the dot is located as a function of time the dot specifically follows the equation we derived position equals amplitude times cosine of angular frequency times time unlike last time where we graphed the x position as a function of time in this example we are graphing the Y position as a function of time and if you are paying careful attention you will notice we have set the initial time for the Y position graph after the turntable is rotated 90 degrees relative to the circular motion for the x position graph this makes it so we end up having the same position equation we had before this is because sine and cosine curves are phase shifted for one another by 90 degrees okay now let's look at where our three simple harmonic motion positions are on the graph positions one and three are at the maximum magnitude displacements from rest position which means their distance from equilibrium position equals amplitude and position two is at rest position which you can also see on the graph now let's look at the velocity graph this is the velocity of the dot moving in simple harmonic motion I have also added the tangential velocity of the yellow marker cap to the circular motion and the velocity of the motion track dots moving in simple harmonic motion as we derived before this graph is the velocity equals the negative of amplitude times the sign of angular frequency times time watch how the velocity of simple harmonic motion is represented by the graph and how the velocity of simple harmonic motion is the vertical component of the tangential velocity of the yellow marker cap moving in circular motion what was that about the vertical component okay let's pause everything for a moment so I can illustrate that better do you see how the velocity of the object in simple harmonic motion is the vertical component of the tangential velocity of the yellow marker cap moving in circular motion oh sure good that doesn't make sense and you can see how the velocity has a value of zero at positions one and three and the velocity has its maximum magnitude at position two oh and the velocities maximum magnitude must equal amplitude times angular frequency that's pretty cool yes I agree that it is pretty cool now let's switch to acceleration remember in our example acceleration equals negative amplitude times angular frequency squared times the cosine of angular frequency times time I have added the centripetal acceleration of the yellow marker cap to the circular motion and the acceleration of the motion track dot moving in simple harmonic motion again watch how the acceleration of harmonic motion is represented by the graph and how the acceleration of the simple harmonic motion is the vertical component of the centripetal acceleration of the yellow marker cap moving in circular motion could you pause it again sure the acceleration of the object in simple harmonic motion is the vertical component of the centripetal acceleration of the yellow marker cap moving in circular motion and again you can see how the acceleration has its maximum magnitude at positions one and three and the acceleration is zero at position two and the accelerations maximum magnitude must equal amplitude times angular frequency squared it's pretty cool absolutely now I don't think I have anything more to add mr. P yes Bobby I hate to bring it up but I'm really confused I mean we did these derivations of velocity and acceleration as a function of time for a simple harmonic motion last time and we're doing the graphs this time but I don't see where the equations come from and the graph say I don't I don't I'm just not getting it sure we can try to clarify this anybody have any ideas we could use the derivative I don't know calculus but the derivative represents the slope of the line and you know slope right oh yeah so the slope of position as a function of time is velocity could can we use the slope to go from the position graph to the velocity graph that is a great idea I actually don't know why we did not do that in the first place Billy could you please oh good we get to use the magic tangent line finder let's start at position 1 the slope of the position graph at 1 is 0 which is why the velocity graph is 0 at 1 as you go from one to the first to the slope of the tangent line becomes negative and slowly becomes more negative until we get to 2 which is why the velocity is negative between 1 and 2 and becomes more we go from one to two oh but the slope of the position as a function of time graphs starts to increase after we pass by 2 and the slope eventually goes back to 0 at 3 which is why the velocity has its largest negative value at the first position - and then increases to 0 at position 3 and then the slope is positive and increasing from 3 to 2 reaches a maximum value of 2 and then the slope decreases to 0 at 1 which is why the velocity increases from 0 at 1 to its maximum value at 2 and then decreases to 0 from 2 to 1 yeah these graphs show that the slope of the position graph is the velocity graph very nice Billy Bobby could you please do the same thing with the velocity and acceleration graphs well we know the slope of a velocity as a function of time graph is acceleration starting at position 1 the magic tangent line finder shows us that the slope of the velocity curve is negative there and as we go from 1 to 2 the slope increases in value to 0 at position 2 that is why the acceleration at position 1 has its largest negative value and then increases to 0 at 2 from 2 to 3 the slope of the velocity curve is positive and increases to its maximum value at 3 that is why the acceleration is positive and increasing from 2 to 3 and has its maximum value at 3 from 3 to 2 the slope of the velocity curve is positive but decreases to 0 at 2 that is why the acceleration is positive and decreases to 0 from 3 to 2 from 2 to 1 the slope of the velocity curve starts at 0 becomes negative and reaches the same maximum magnitude negative value it had back at the original position 1 that is why the acceleration is 0 at position 2 becomes negative from 2 to 3 and increases in magnitude to its maximum negative value at position 1 okay yeah that that really helps thanks Bobby you are welcome thank you very much for learning with me today I'm you're learning with you
