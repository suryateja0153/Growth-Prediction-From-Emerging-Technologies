 I'm gonna show you how to make a multiple baseline design graph in this video before I get started on making that multiple baseline design graph I want to talk to you about different versions of excel as I have created single case designed graphs I've done it across several different versions of Excel now and the one thing to note is that regardless of which version of Excel you use the names of the buttons have remained the same but they had been placed in in different places which can be kind of frustrating as you go through and try to use Excel if you if you've changed versions or if you're viewing this and you don't have the newest version of Excel which is what I'm using yours may look a little bit different but if you attend to the names of the buttons that I'm using generally they're mostly on the same tabs and so hopefully I'm using the tabs and/or searching for the names of the buttons through the help design on Excel will help you to complete this graph even if you do have a different version the other thing that I understand is that the newest version of Excel is the same in PCs and in Macs and so that's a good thing hopefully that will cause less confusion on on anyone's part as you view this video to develop a graph so the first thing I'm going to do is insert a chart I am actually I'm going to go and start a new tab I'm gonna go to b3 I like to go to b3 the the chart is now got on line with the B column when it gets inserted so I'm gonna go over here to insert I'm going to select this button there's two different types of lines there's line graphs and what they call an XY or a scatter graph and you want to select the scatter graph and then the scatter with straight lines and markers this is the one we typically use when we make single case design graphs okay so now I have this chart there's nothing in it it didn't go exactly where I want it to go so I'm going to put it right over here lined up on these grid lines with b3 and I like my graphs to be a little bit bigger so I'm gonna resize it somewhat what you generally want to do proportionate proportionally is is that the y-axis is about a ratio of 3 to 4 to the x axis ok now I'm going to right click on here and I'm going to select data okay and up pops this screen so the first thing I want to do is I need to add some new data I'm gonna name the new data baseline because I want to enter baseline data first and then here where it says Y values I'm going to click on this little icon on the right hand side and it pops up like this this helps me it doesn't take up as much space and then I can see the data that I want to select a little bit better now I have to decide which data would be in my top tier and the way that you do that is you always put at the very top tier the individual who started intervention first okay so if I look at my data we can tell that this individual started based intervention on 11:6 which is the first time that anyone started intervention so this is the individual or the tier that I want to be my top tier okay and first I'm going to enter in the baseline I want to delete this in a I'm going to clear the contents of that cell because it might confuse the program it's actually not letting me do that because I didn't do it before I went to select data so I'm going to cancel selecting the data I'm going to come back over here to this tab and clear the contents of this cell now I'm going to go back to my chart clicking in the the chart area right click and select data ok so again I want to create some baseline data I want to select the baseline data I'm gonna add actually here I should have clipped this area first we're going to click plus base lon and again I'm going to click on this icon here all right now let's go back to sheet 1 and again we know who is going to be in the top tier because it's this person who started intervention first my graph is a multiple baseline across participants graph so I've selected the data for the full range of the intervention here okay all of these cells are important that I highlight them because it's going to ensure that the the range is correct as far as the number of sessions that occurred on this graph ok so I've selected this I'm going to press this down arrow and hit OK and it takes me back to my graph ok so now I have these data all of those were the number 3 there were five data points at number three and they're here on the graph now when I click here again I want to select some more data so I'm clicking on the area I'm right clicking select data again this window pops up I'm going to click plus here I want to add a second series and I'm going to name that series intervention you don't actually have to name them they can stay at series 1 series 2 I like to name them it just helps me to feel a little bit more clear on what what it is I'm doing so again I clicked on this arrow now I'm going to go back to this other tab and select the intervention column again starting with the first day of intervention all the way through to the last day of intervention you see this person was absent but remember we're developing a time series graph where it's critical when we do a visual analysis of our data that they are lined up in the exact alignment so that any session is the same day so I need to see if I see us this second zero here it would be the first three for this person which was on 1029 if there's nothing here I assume that that individual had no session or was absent and then on this same day this person had one okay so if hi I've selected all that data in the intervention and I'm going to press the down arrow and click OK okay so now we have our data right it ranges from three to about 29 and usually let's say for example you were using percentage sometimes if you have 99 or 100 percent the graph will automatically take it up to 110 but there's no such thing as 110 percent so you wouldn't want to change the axis to say 100 I'm going to change the axis here to say 30 I happen to know that none of the data of any of the participants got higher than 30 so I've clicked on again these numbers and I want to format the axis I'm formatting the y-axis okay and in older versions of Excel a window will pop up in the newer version of Excel instead of a window it's a side tab like this okay and we have the axis options and it talks about minimum and maximum the minimum is zero which is right here on the graph currently the maximum is 35 which corresponds to this number here I want it to be 30 I think that will give a better display of my data okay and you see that it's changed here to 30 now so I finished with that now I want to adjust the graph to fit the conventions of making a single case design graph so the first thing I'm going to do is we need to remove all of these gridlines I clicked on this second grid line and what happened is you see all these dots popped up which means I've highlighted all the gridlines and now I'm going to right-click and select delete okay and said those horizontal gridlines have disappeared now I want to get rid of these vertical gridlines so I clicked on it I'm going to right-click and select delete okay now all of the horizontal and vertical gridlines that have been erased the other thing that I see is that these and this is just because it's a newer version I've been to Civic cell they tend to make the lines a light gray instead of a black which can be difficult to show up if we cut and paste this and put it into Microsoft Word and then print it off so I want all of this to be black so I'm going to click on this axis here and because my window was already opened it already shows it here but if I were to close it I click on this axis I right click and say format axis and up comes this and again if you were in an older version a window would have popped up and I want to change the lines and so here I've clicked on this paint icon it may be somewhere slightly different within the if it's in the windows I feel like you see these different things like fill and line and text and other things like that so I want a solid line I don't want it to be the automatic line they've created I want it to be black okay the width and everything else the same also these numerals here need to be changed so I'm going to click here on these numerals and I want the text to be a solid black but that's the text outline I don't want that text fill let's see if that's a solid fill there it is it's this sort of grey color so I want to click on black and make the the text black see if we pull away now you can see a slightly different color between these and these and it just shows up a bit more clearly on the graph I'm going to do the same thing on this axis I'm going to right click I am going to select format access come over here click on this paint button I need that line to be a solid black line and in fact well I'm going to go ahead and change that go to the text select text fill solid fill and instead of this grayish color I'm going to make it black as well but this is my top tier and one of the conventions of developing single cases on graphs is that we do not have the numerals at the bottom of any of the tiers except the bottom most tier on the x axis on the y axis we do keep all of the numerals displayed but not on the x-axis so I'm going to click again on the x-axis right click format access and come over here to text options and I want my text I could select no fill or if you didn't have the option for no fill you could select white and make the text white so either is fine I'm going to put it on no fill and so now we see that there are no the the numerals are not showing I'm a little unsure as to whether or not I formatted the access line so we're going to check that just real quick and I oops that was the fill of the text option so let me click undo text access access options lime solid lines like it is correct okay now the other thing that we want to do with our access options are to display tick marks ok so again just clicking through here I'm looking for some place that it says tick marks and I notice here this down here tick marks we just want to have the major type of tick mark show up okay and generally I have them ship on the outside and these were counting by 5's and counting by 5's may make it a little bit difficult for me to know what's number if I was trying to explain it was number 18 so actually I'm going to make the major units instead of 5 I'm gonna make them by 2 on this axis and so now we have tick marks a little bit more consistently developed which will make it easier to see I think that by 5's here is just fine on the 30 but you might decide that you want it to be by 3 or something like that so you would do the same thing where you click on the axis right-click select format axis and go in and change that the major units which are the unit numbers that are going to show up on the graph okay so we formatted that another thing is that there I happen to know this just because I'm used to developing the graphs there's a border around the outside of this chart if we go to view and check this gridlines box it removes the gridlines and we're going to do this later when we get the data ready to display into cut and paste into the Microsoft Word document but for now it just helps to show me that there is indeed a border so I want to click on the outside of the border right click format chart area and it pops up in here it happened to just buy me clicking on it a couple times pop up on the side but if you were again using an older version of word you would want to click on it right click and then format the chart area okay and what we want is to the this border to have no line so I've clicked no line I can't tell if I've removed it because it's still highlighted so I'm going to click over somewhere else and we could see that there's no longer a border so we've we've fixed that component of developing the graph okay I'm gonna put the gridlines back because when we go to put in the next few tears I want to be sure that they're all well aligned and again I'm just gonna make sure this one is aligned right in that corner of the b3 cell okay now these data all need to be the same color these are the same dependent variable that each data point displays the exact same behavior the behaviors just occurring at a different level okay so we need it to be all the same but before I go in and change that I want to go ahead and put in my face change and if you remember the baseline data were these data here okay so in order to demonstrate on the single-case design that it's a phase change we need to put a line and conventions tell us that that line needs to be a dashed line okay so I'm gonna go to insert in some versions you might need to go to home but wherever it is you go to insert and then shapes it used to be called drawl and now it's shapes and I'm gonna insert this line shape here okay now I've selected the line I'm gonna click my shift key and by doing that it keeps my line perpendicular now I find real exaggerated I can get it to a 45 degree angle or to a horizontal angle but the nice thing is those are the only options that it gives and I can keep my line nice and straight by holding the shift key down until I get it exactly where I want it and then I'll let go of the shift key oh it's not quite where I wanted it so now I'm just gonna click and drag and bring it over it needs to be black and it also needs to be dashed and it also looks like there's a bit of a shadow to it I find that these new versions often show a shadow and sometimes that even indicates that there is no shadow when in fact there is a shadow so I want to format my shape a box might pop up on an older version but here it's on the right hand side and if I click on these here's the shadow and if I click on the presets it indicates that there is no shadow but I've found that for some reason the shadows showing up so I'll do it as if I want to shadow and then I go back and click on no shadow and then there's clearly not a shadow on that line anymore that's just a trick I've figured out just by playing around with it a little bit now I can change the line here in the older versions you often have this shape format thing that comes up just like in this newer version so I can go here to change my line and say that I want my line to be black and that I'd like it to be dashed I'd also like the weight of my line to be one point typically all the lines including this and the data series I make one point the reason to make it smaller is that if the data we're super close together then the smaller the line the more likely you are to get it to show up between the two data points the there okay the other option I could have done was the same thing over here where I select the line color and I determine the dash type and the width of one point so I did it here but I could have also done on this side again that's why it's more critical that you just know the names of the things that I'm doing because there's several different ways to go about doing it so we have our phase change line now let's go ahead and change the state I'm going to click on this first series I'm going to right click and select format data series and it comes up over here I would like my line to be a solid line and to be black and currently it's at 1.5 points and I want it to be one point so I've done that now we're getting over to the marker series I want them the marker series to have a solid fill and be black if it's very difficult to tell but if you if I were to see me to see that there's a light blue border that corresponds with this color around the edge of the marker we want that to be a solid line and to be black also okay then you get to the marker options section sometimes when you create these different series you they come up as this would be squares and this would be circles but again as I said they're measuring the same thing so we need them to be represented the same way throughout this chart and so we want to be sure that we make them the same so I went to marker options circle is what I want in size 5 somewhere between size 5 and size 7 I'll show you if you go up to large the the markers can get really quite big so you see how big these markers are which is fine here because there's enough there's not too much data on this axis if this axis went to up to a hundred these would be overlapped again conventions hold to have it between 5 & 7 usually and I tend to go on the smaller side with 5 we're going to go ahead and do the same thing here so I'm going to right click format my data series come over here I'll first change to a solid line black and I'd like it to be one point I'm gonna go to my marker the marker shape is fine but that's where these marker options are if I needed to change those and then I'm going to have the fill be a solid fill but I'd like it to be black the border to be a solid border also black okay so now I have developed the data series for this graph okay but we have three more tiers to go there are some other things that I need to do though I haven't added the tick marks on this side so let's see that first so again I click on this axis series usually you select find a numeral to select right click format access we're on the correct tab I want to get a tick marks and I would like my major tip mark tick mark to be inside I mean outside sorry the graph and so here we have this first tier completed I haven't labeled the phases I'll do that in a few minutes off so haven't labeled the individual and I will actually go ahead and do that so let me get it insert I'm gonna insert a text box insert and there it is over here on the right hand side text box and I'll say this individuals name was Hugh okay put it right here so we've got I believe everything that we need right now I'll go back and double check everything at the end to be sure that I've not left anything yet but we've got this first here and here's the major trick for creating multiple baseline designs and that is that you can copy and paste this chart for all the rest of the participants and then just go in and change the selection of the series and type in the new name so that's what I'm gonna do right now for the other two tiers okay so I've selected the chart I'm going to right-click and copy it I'm going to select this cell just below that chart I'm gonna right-click on it and click paste and by pasting it in there it makes it line again with this beam column and everything should be aligned between these two graphs because they've been pasted directly below each other I'm gonna go ahead and do it with the next tier as well click paste and you didn't come along with it but that's okay because I did just select the chart area we can fix that so we have Hugh he's he's completed now we need to do the next tier okay so I'm going to select this data series right here I'm gonna right-click and click select data okay and here's the window again that pops up you can see in the background here here these are the data that are currently selected for that duplicate chart but I need to find the next individual that entered intervention so I've closed that side thing there and I'm moving this window it's out of your range of sight at the moment that's just to help me determine who's next and intervention and I can see that it's this person in the B and C columns this participant is the one that has next entered intervention on 1117 so those are the data that I want to enter into the second to your chart okay so I'm gonna click on baseline and then it often does this it pops you to the original sheet I'm gonna click on this arrow button here and pop it up and now it brings me back to the other sheet don't be disconcerted if that happens and now I want to select the four inch of data in the baseline column and so I'm doing that now and then I press the down arrow and I have selected the baseline I'm gonna go ahead and click on intervention and select those data and I just go right here press the down arrow and click okay and so now you see that our data have changed and let's see do they course once it the first student was at a level of 3 it says that this student or this participant is at a level of zero or there's the ones I highlighted yes they are okay I'm gonna go over here and now what we need to do is to change these lines you can see it kept some of the formatting not all of the formatting sticks and so we need to change the line color to be black I clicked on select data which I did not intend to do I want to right click here and format my data series so I'm gonna come over here click on this paint and I want my life to be a solid black line and again as I said I typically make it one point now we'll do the same thing with this data series I clicked on it I right click format data series go to the paint box click on the solid line make it black make it one point enter okay now I happen to know that this is where my phase change line is I might have wanted to taking care of that before changing the colors but it's okay I can tell pretty obviously where it is what I've just done here is I've clicked here and then I've clicked command C you can also right click and copy okay command C or it might be alt C if you use a PC but command C and command V command C is copy command V is paste so I just clicked command V and made it paste I could have right clicked and told it to paste now I've drawn these lines they are going to need to be connected later to show that sort of tiered or stair-step that you develop but we'll do that last after I've format at all three tiers so we need to make sure we label this participant so I need to insert a text box again here insert oops I made the insert go away text box I'm going to right click here and oh I didn't mean to right click I should have just regular click tape and there's my text box and this is Johnny okay we typically put the names of the individuals down in the bottom right hand corner unless that's going to overlap with the data and then we would skewed it up but otherwise consistently putting in the bottom right hand corner some journals want you to have your text box to have an outline and some do not I tend to leave it without the outline unless I'm told otherwise okay so now we're going to go and select the data series for this third one so what do I do click on the data I right-click and select data and a window pops up I want to work on my baseline first so I'm clicked baseline press that up arrow I come over to this last participant who I have not enter data for select all the data back click on intervention press the up arrow come over here to the third participant select the whole range dates including the intervention data and now I'm going to click OK all right so there we have the third tiers data but again we need to fix the line so I'm going to right click here I get a solid black line at one point I'm gonna right click here on these data format the data series solid line black one point okay I know that right here it's the break between baseline and intervention so I'm going to select that line that's already been created copy it moved my chart a bit you don't want that to happen because then that can mess with your visual analysis everything has to be aligned perfectly because of the fact that we use visual analysis of data and if anything isn't aligned properly then that can cause real issues with our ability to determine whether or not there's a functional relation between the the intervention and the change in the behavior okay now I'm gonna right click and it's not let me paste let's try this again right click copy right click that's not gonna let me pay so I'm gonna do my ctrl-c ctrl-v again there's different quirks that that happen with these things move to the chart again and I don't always know why that is and that's where you just have to sort of play around there's a lot of precision involved in tedium involved in developing graphs but it pays off in the long run when you when you develop them appropriately okay so we need to go ahead and label this third third individual so I'm going to go to insert a text box right click not right click just click and Jose okay again I'll just put Jose's name they are down in the bottom corner alright so we have our three individuals with all the tears we remove the numbers from the two tears the topmost in the middle tier but this is the bottom most here so we do need to see the numbers labeled here so I've clicked on this axis if I right click and click format access and an old version the window would pop up and then you version it just shows here we want to look at the text options and it's currently at no fill and we'd like it to be a solid fill and by doing that the numbers are now displayed okay the next thing that we need to do is to connect these dashed lines to look almost like a stair-stepped approach so I've got this line I'm gonna hold shift down again to keep my line straight and I'm gonna pull it down until it appears to be parallel with this other graphic what looks like has happened is it's gone behind my chart okay so when that happens you click on the shape that you if you think of everything as a layer like if you're relying pieces of paper down on each other it's the same thing within Excel so I'm clicking on the shape and I want this to be the top piece on my chart so I'm going to tell it to be brought to the front bring to front and now what's happened is I had pulled it all the way down there now it shows up it's now on top of instead of underneath this chart but we need a parallel dashed line connecting these two lines here okay and I'm just gonna insert a line you could copy this and then change it but for some reason I find it easier just to create a new line again I'm going to press that shift button and I start right here on the corner and I'm gonna pull it straight across okay and so there it is and we need to go through the process of changing the color and I double clicked on it that's another way to have the tabs tab show AB show watch show up I would like it to have a weight of one and I would like it to be dashed it also appears to me currently that it is as a shadow I'm going to come over here to this format shape window and find out where I handle shadows which i think is here yep there's shadow presets I'm going to tell it to have a shadow and now I'm gonna tell it to have no shadow oh and as I see here it looks like in order to make it in a shadow you just pull all of those over no in the future but look we have this kind of t-junction going on here and you know we want things to look as neat as possible so you don't have to get too crazy obsessive with making it if you turned that into me it would be fine I wouldn't make a big deal of it but if you wanted to publish it or show it off in some sort of fashion you would want it to look as nice as possible so what I have done while I was talking to you was I have zoomed in because that's gonna help me with seeing better how I can have how I can make these not cross over as much I'm going to zoom in a little bit more okay the first thing I'm going to do I'm gonna click on this line and make it a little bit shorter I'm now gonna click on this line and just bring it in so it aligns with that one and now if we go back out to what we would typically view it at I'm gonna keep it about 150 just for now it looks great alright so that one's done now we need to do the next one again I'm gonna grab click on this line I'm holding my shift button and now I'm clicking on the bottom square of that line and bringing it down till it seems like it's close to touching the top of the line on the right if they had happened to be just above each other I'm let go but when I click off I see that the line isn't showing up but it's behind technically behind that other one so I'm gonna right-click and bring it to the front and let's see if that helps so what's happened here is that this line is when I put it in my chart it put it inside the shape of the chart whereas this one for some reason is just lying on top so if you again we think about these pieces of paper laid on top of each other this is a separate piece of paper this is a separate piece of paper this one is drawn on the same piece of paper that the dots are drawn on it's not a separate piece of paper that I've laid on top which means it's not going to let me stretch it outside or beyond the confines of this chart so what I'm going to do instead is see if I can pull this shape up some clicking shift and I'm going to pull it up so that it aligns with that one and close it and I think we're going to be ok because they're so close together these are just some of the sort of irritating things that can happen when you're developing lines to solve it another thing I could do is draw a line over here bring it over here and then it would be lying on top of both of the charts but I think I've resolved it this way now I need to insert another line which I will have to connect those two lines together so I'm gonna click the shift key again because I want to be sure that it remains parallel and I have my line but I'd like it to be black at one point one point and dashed and I'm gonna go over here to where it says format shapes and I want it to have no shadow like it did earlier okay and that one looks pretty good so I'm not gonna worry about it okay so let me zoom out a bit so you can see these that was way too far there you go so you can see the three tiers so what do we need next we need to label here what the x-axis represents we need to label here what that y-axis represents we need to label the phases okay so that's just developing a bunch of text boxes now you might be tempted to click on this chart and use the chart labeling system but don't do that instead use insert text boxes it's going to give you a little bit more control as far as how and where you can put the text boxes to ensure that they're placed in the right place so here's this text box we're going to go ahead and start first with labeling these faces so this is baseline I'm going to align it towards the top and then to Center it I'm going to pull the edge of the box from the y axis to the first phase changed line then I'm going to go home and tell it to Center that word and now I know that baseline is centered across this phase the next phase I want to insert another text box for it's not a shape this is a text box so I'll click here I'm gonna write and normally we don't write the word intervention we write what the intervention is called so we might say that this is a token economy system that I've been working on so it's the intervention that I implemented right token economy I want to grab the box and pull it to the top so it's parallel with the baseline word and again I'm gonna Center it by bringing it over to the phase-change line and then all the way over to the edge of the graph going home and clicking on center and now we've labeled both of our our phases okay and the next thing that we're going to do is label this area so many of you might want to put dates here and that's absolutely fine I prefer sessions they just they're smaller they take up less space and so I generally use sessions and but they do happen to represent days so I could type the word sessions here or I can type the word today is here just depends on your preference the level of precision that you're using sessions is if you had multiple sessions per day it would be better to do sessions or if it wasn't consecutive days then it would likely be better to write sessions I'm gonna write sessions for mine so I'm gonna go to insert text box click here sessions and then I'm going to do the same thing so that it's centered across the bottom I'm going to align it with the y-axis and right hand side of the x-axis and then Center the text within that text box and we have sessions I need to do the same thing on this side many of you also have labels beside each of the tiers but we actually only want one label that's centered across all three tiers and that is whatever that the behavior is that we're collecting and so this is let's say number of math problems completed per day okay or number of math problems completed per session and so I'm gonna insert a text box and I'm going to just click here first and write number of math we capitalize it as if it were a title math problems completed and make sure there's no spelling capitalization here's and then we just I'm gonna use this little circle thing that I'll pull here and make it turn the other thing that you can often do is format the shape if I clicked on it I could right here I could rotate the shape by the 45-degree angles to make sure that it's accurately your 90-degree angles so here's here's the thing but again just to make sure that it's centered I'm gonna pull the edges of the text box up to the top of the first chart all the way to the bottom of the third tier and Center it okay and now we have our chart we've got all our tick marks if all our phase change lines everything's labeled we we're gonna put this inward and inward is where I would label the figure and I believe and I was confused actually gonna look it up we're not entering in a figure and this is considered a figure and not a table we label figures on the bottom so it would be figure X or whatever the number of the figure is figure 1 and then we would give the title of the figure but you would do that in Word okay so what we want to do now is to get this out of Word and are out of Excel and in toward and the easiest way that I suggest for you to do that is to take a screenshot of this but you don't want to have the background of these grid lines so we're going to go over here to view I'm going to remove the gridlines and now we have a picture of this and generally the other thing in order to make sure that the picture shows up its best quality is to make it as big as possible on the page where you take the screen so I'm just increasing the I'm zooming to make it a bit bigger let's bring it over so now we've got quite a nice view of this graph and I am gonna take a picture do a screenshot I don't know how you do it in PC I used to because I used to have a PC but you can just Google how do I take a screenshot in PC let's see I think it shift command 4 yes that's right so shift command 4 if you're using a Mac to take a picture and actually I didn't I'm not taking a screenshot I'm actually selecting the area that I want to take I'm not sure if you can do that in a PC or you'd have to do a full screenshot so when I click on that it makes a little camera sound and it has now saved it to my desktop and all I would have to do now is go into my word document select insert picture and insert this as a picture and it will show up quite nicely in a Word document other things that you can do is you can right-click on each chart copy the chart and then go into Microsoft and paste it that's going to require you to line everything up again it possibly won't transfer some of the lines which you would have to go in and draw again sometimes because a picture doesn't show up as clearly as you'd like people will do that for the purposes of this class if you take a picture of the graph in excel and then place it into the word document if I can read the words and I can do a visual analysis of the data that I'm more than happy with it even if it's a tiny bit blurry so that is the end of this presentation I hope you found it helpful feel free to contact me if you have any further questions about developing multiple baseline design graph thank you
