 this episode is supported by Skillshare hi guys Jade here today I wanted to talk about a really interesting problem called the for color map theorem it's really cool because it was the first beta theorem to be proven with the help of a computer it caused a lot of controversy because basically no one could understand it this raised a lot of questions about the nature of mathematics and what really counts as a proof it also shines a big uncomfortable light on the limits we may have as humans and asks whether computers may be necessary for the future of mathematics the story has it that in 1852 a mathematician named Frances Guthrie was coloring the maps of counties of England don't ask me why but anyway he noticed that he only needed to use four colors so that no two touching counties were the same color he wondered whether this was the case with all maps and if so what was the reason he sent a message to his brother Frederick also a mathematician he told him about his four color map theorem and wondered if it was a known thing and if so why little did he know that his questions would go unanswered for over a hundred years what's interesting is that the question itself is pretty straightforward so it seems odd that the solution would be so complicated to understand why let's first try to prove an easier problem the five color theorem it's pretty much exactly the same as the four colors theorem just with five colors formally it states given a plane separated into regions the regions may be colored using no more than five colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions received the same color so when proving a theorem three techniques that mathematicians often use our induction contradictions and invariants luckily for us this proof involves all three so let's briefly go through what they all mean before we start proof by induction is just showing that as long as you can take the first step you can take every step after that then you want to prove that you can climb to the top of this ladder there are only two things you need to do one prove you can get on the first and to prove that you can get to the next one from whatever rung you're on then it follows that if your proof holds for any step in it'll hold for any step and plus one so no matter where the top is you'll eventually get there then there's proof by contradiction this is a fun one a couple of weeks ago I made a video about one of the most fascinating proofs by contradiction the halting problem but briefly instead of directly proving the thing you're trying to prove you assume the opposite is true and show that it results in a contradiction for example if you wanted to prove that there is no biggest number assume that the opposite is true that there is the biggest number let's call it a bajillion jillion but say your friend John comes along with the question what about a bajillion jillion plus one so you claim that a bajillion jillion is greater than a bajillion jillion plus one but if we minus a bajillion jillion from both sides we're left with zero is greater than one which is a contradiction this argument could be used for any number therefore no biggest number exists the third technique is invariant an invariant is the property that stays the same even when other things in your system change for example in Euclidean geometry the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees you can do whatever you like to the lengths of the sides or the angles within the triangle but the 180 degree rule never changes it's invariant cool so equipped with these three tools of mathematical deduction let's make a start on this proof prove that you only need five colors to color any map so that no two countries sharing a border are the same color this is gonna be fun so the first step when solving any mathematical problem is to get rid of any unnecessary information here there's a lot of unnecessary information we don't care that Italy's shaped like a boot or that Paris is the capital of France well someone doesn't care about basic geography I'm not aware of this concept what's going on here guys this is my friend Willie from the YouTube channel cannabis he's pretty obsessed with geography and he's made a video about maps to which I've linked in the description now Willie I'm not saying that I really don't care about what the capital of France is even though I kind of don't it just makes this problem easier for us to solve okay if it makes the calculations easier oh let it slide cool as I was saying we only care about two things how many countries and the borders that connect them so let's transform this map into what's called a graph we can replace all the countries with dots or vertices as they say and all the borders with lines that we're going to call edges when the edges and vertices form a closed loop this is called a face we may as well talk like graph theorists if we're going to be proving one of the hardest theorems in graph theory this is what's called a planar graph meaning that you can draw it on a piece of paper without any of the edges crossing each other this is going to be important later so now if we can color all the vertices of a planar graph using only five colors so that no two vertices sharing an edge of the same color we've solved the five color theorem this is exactly the same model as the map from before just in a nice neat little package of dots and lines and no delicious baguettes or pizza to distract us so it's time to break out our first tool induction proving that every graph is five colorable is pretty ambitious but the first step of induction is simply showing that you can get on the ladder in our case that would be showing that graphs with one vertex can be colored using five colors right well that's step one done step two prove that whatever round you're on you can always get to the next one so in our case that would be assuming that a graph with n amount of vertices is five colorable prove that a graph with n plus 1 number of vertices is still 5 colorable step two is a bit hotter than step one so here's a graph and let's say it has n plus 1 number of vertices it doesn't matter about the actual number of vertices since the rule is supposed to apply to any graph if we go back to the latter analogy it's just like saying it doesn't matter what rung you're on as long as you show you can get to the next one so now if we assume that graphs that have n number of vertices of 5 colorable let's show we can make the jump to graphs of n plus 1 vertices if we remove a vertex from this path it becomes a graph with n vertices right and we assumed that graphs with n vertices can be colored with just 5 colors so now let's see if we can color this graph in such a way that when we add the vertex back it's still 5 colorable then we'll have proven that if a graph with n vertices is colorable we can always make the jump to n plus 1 but how can we make sure that we can add a fifth color it'd be good if we could find a vertex with four neighbors then we'd be guaranteed to have a fifth color free unfortunately some grads don't have a vertex with just four neighbors but we're going to show in a bit that all graphs have a vertex with five neighbors and that's good enough this one has five so let's take it out the remaining graph with n number of vertices is five colorable according to our assumption now here comes the fiddly putt so pay close attention we're going to be dealing with the five neighbors our removed vertex was connected to let's call it V will number them in a cyclic manner one two three four five right now all the numbered vertices are taking up all five colors green red yellow blue and purple and so we can't bring our remove vertex V back without breaking the point color theorem we've got to somehow arrange them so that they only take out four colors to do this let's look at one and three and highlight all the vertices the same color as them green and yellow we can see that vertex 1 isn't connected to any yellows so we can change it to yellow now all the neighbors only take up 4 colors without breaking the rule so we can bring back our remove 2 node V and give it the 5th color this grass n plus 1 is still 5 colorable case closed but not really this won't always work take this graph for example it's the same one as before but some of the colors have swapped around so let's try the same trick as before highlight 1 and 3 and mark all the vertices with those colors but now when we try the old Swampert Rooney we find we can't get rid of many colors without having two connected vertices the same color this is because we have this path of yellows and greens from vertex 1 2 3 that we didn't have in our last example so is the my t5 color theorem broken then not quite let's look at vertices 2 & 4 1 & 3 form a path blocking two and 4 from connecting so I can just play the old swap arewe with one of them instead again the five vertices only take up four colors so we can bring back B and color it in with a fifth color and the five color theorem is saved you will always be able to do this with any vertex that has five or less neighbors so how do we know we can always find such a vertex well now it's time for our last proof technique invariants let's bring in an invariant called the Euler characteristic the Euler characteristic is a rule that for every connected planar graph the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces is always equal to 2 if we start with a vertex on the outer face we have one vertex and one face we can do two things to build upon our graph add another vertex and connect them by an edge or connect to existing vertices with an edge as you can see no matter how big we build our graph the Euler characteristic will always equal two so equipped with our invariant let's try out the one remaining proof Niq contradictions let's assume that in fact every vertex needs to have a minimum of six neighbors and there can't be any with five or less there needs to be at least three times the number of edges as vertices because every edge is shared between two vertices now we're going to try and prove that this assumption results in a contradiction let's go back to Oilers characteristic for a sec every face is made of at least three edges right and every edge is shared between two faces remember we count the outer face to so then the number of faces is less than or equal to two-thirds the number of edges so if we plug this inequality into Euler's characteristic we get that the number of vertices minus edges plus two-thirds the number of edges is greater than or equal to two if we simplify x three and rearrange we get that the number of edges is less than or equal to three times the number of vertices minus six all right now let's compare this with our assumption the turkey minus 3v on the left is the same so we can write these two equations as one inequality so then we get that the number of edges minus three times the number of vertices must be smaller than minus six from our theorem but must be greater than zero from our sumption this is a contradiction therefore our assumption that the minimum number of neighbors is six is wrong the vertex with the minimum number of neighbors is five or less so that means our proof by induction is safe so to recap we used proof by induction to show that if a graph with n number of vertices is 5 colorable a graph of n plus 1 is also 5 colorable therefore any planar graph can be 5 colorable however this is only possible if there is always at least one vertex with 5 neighbors or less we prove that by assuming that the opposite was true and showing that it contradicts with the Euler characteristic because the vertices edges and faces were all just standings for countries and their borders we proved that yes any map can be colored using only 5 colors with no two adjacent countries being the same color so the 5 color theorem is true for a so we can finally answer Guthrie's question oh hey no con he's for colors but can we extend our proof to four colors then well the reason this proof works so well is because of the fact that we can always find a vertex with five or less neighbors but this doesn't help us for the four color case we need four neighbors or less which we can't guarantee the four color proof actually went unsolved for over a hundred years until two mathematicians Appel and Haken announced that they'd at last found a proof the only problem was no one could understand it not even them this is where the computer comes into the story I won't go into the full details of the proof because their paper was 60 pages long but basically imagine that graphs are separated into two categories ones that can be colored with four colors or less and ones that need five colors we already showed that all maps need a minimum of five colors and it's obvious that some maps can be colored with just four colors so what Appel and Haken needed to do was show that all graphs exist on this side of the line they did this by proof of contradiction they needed to show that all graphs have a certain property guaranteeing that you can reduce them in size without ever crossing this line basically it means if they start with five colors you can always make the number of vertices smaller while still needing five colors but of course if you keep making the graph smaller you'll eventually end up with a graph with four or less and therefore for colorable which would be on this side of the line so that means that if all these graphs did in fact have this special property of reducibility they would all have to have started on this side of the line the hard part was proving that all graphs on the five color side do indeed have this special property the strategy that they used which is sure that every graph on this side of the line would have to contain one of 2,000 configurations guaranteeing the property checking them by hand would have been very time-consuming it would have taken months if not years of time spent tediously coloring in graphs they needed a computer to do it and after over a thousand hours of computation we finally had our answer that yes Bowl graphs on the five color side did have this special property meaning they simply couldn't exist without inducing a contradiction all maps are deep for colorable so there you have it Guthrie there's your answer but this feels very different to the proof of the fine color theorem we don't really know why it works the computer could have just as easily returned to no and we wouldn't have learnt anything different the mathematics community had a lot of trouble accepting this as a proof the mathematician Paul how must it I do not find it easy to say what we have learned from all that and Daniel Cohen said the mission of mathematics is understanding admitting these computer shenanigans to the ranks of mathematics would only leave us intellectually unfulfilled and you have to admit they're kind of right but this raises some very interesting questions about the nature of mathematics who judges whether or not something is a proof are we being arrogant and assuming that math should abide by human understanding in an Apple said the computer was much more successful because it was not thinking like a mathematician since then many more mathematical proofs have been provided by computers recently the boolean Pythagorean triple problem was solved by a computer running for four years generating a 200 terabyte proof which was later compressed to 68 gigabytes just enough for a lifetime of reading this problem started off with someone in maths but we spent the whole time talking about graphs that's because all of the information we needed was captured much more effectively in a crap different representations can be useful for different things my friend Willy has made a video all about it Willy why don't you give us the lowdown thanks Jade wait hang on I don't think I can animate myself like this one second yeah that works now I've always been into maps in geography but one important thing to realize about just about all maps is that they're all lying to you in some way or another even the most accurate honest maps are hiding exaggerating or misrepresenting something on it but this is actually so that they could do a better job at showing what they're actually trying to show you this is why even the most well-designed metro maps are terrible as walking guides if you're interested since this video is made as part of a collaboration head over to my channel cannabis to find out more I've linked that video in the description so make sure to check it out right after this the for color map theorem would never have been solved if it wasn't for the clever methods of thinking us humans have developed

may have noticed that this video was a bit longer and more in-depth than my usual videos and that's because a few weeks ago I posted a poll in the YouTube community tab asking whether you guys did want more in-depth videos and the majority of you said yes so let me know what you thought about this video was it in-depth enough was it too in-depth I hope it wasn't depths enough because I don't think I could make more in depth videos than this but anyway feedback is always appreciated um that's it for me bye [Music]
