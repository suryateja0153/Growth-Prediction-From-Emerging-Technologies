 EquatIO lets you create and insert graphs using the Graphing tool powered by Desmos. To use, open up EquatIO on your preferred platform, and click the Graph button. In the graphing window, add your equations to the lefthand column. You can even use prediction here to insert symbols like exponents, fractions and more. You can customize the color and line of the graph by pressing and holding on the circle icon next to your equation. You can also use additional variables to your equation, and add a slider to show what the graph looks like as the values change. You can add multiple graphs, and ordered pairs as well. In the settings menu, you can switch between radians and degrees or adjust your x and y axes. Once you’ve created a graph, just click the Insert Graph button to add it to your work. You can use the Graphing feature on any platform, whether you’re in the EquatIO mathspace, EquatIO for Windows or Mac in Word, Or EquatIO for Google in Docs, Forms, Slides, Sheets and Drawings.
