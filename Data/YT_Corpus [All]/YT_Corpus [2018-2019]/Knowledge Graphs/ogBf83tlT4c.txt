 rest of find the equation of the quadratic function in the form f of X equals a times the quantity X minus H squared plus K based upon the graph we will also find the equation in the form f of X equals ax squared plus BX plus C as well for this form of a quadratic function H comma K is the vertex so looking at the graph notice how the vertex because the parabola opens down is the highest point on the graph this point here where the ordered pair is negative 2 comma 4 so because the vertex is negative 2 comma 4 we know that H is equal to negative 2 and K is equal to positive 4 performing the substitution gives us f of x equals a times the quantity X minus negative 2 squared plus K which gives us plus 4 and X minus negative 2 simplifies to X plus 2 so we have f of X equals a times the quantity X plus 2 squared plus 4 and now we need to find another point on the graph and perform substitution to determine the value of a notice how this parabola has two convenient horizontal intercepts it passes through the origin or the ordered pair 0 comma 0 as well as this point here with the ordered pair negative 4 comma 0 let's see who's this ordered pair and perform substitution to find the value of a if the point negative 4 comma 0 is on the graph of the function then we know F of negative 4 must equal 0 so we can substitute negative 4 for X and 0 for the function value and then solve for a performing the substitution gives us 0 equals a times the quantity negative 4 plus 2 squared plus 4 and now simplifying negative 4 plus 2 is negative 2 the square of negative 2 is positive 4 and positive 4 times a is 4a giving us 0 equals 4a plus 4 and now to solve for a we subtract 4 on both sides which gives us negative 4 equals 4a and then we divide both sides by four simplifying we have a is equal to negative 1 and therefore the function must be f of X equals a which is negative 1 times the quantity X plus 2 squared plus 4 sometimes instead of a negative 1 though we'll just see a negative we can also write f of X as f of X equals negative or the opposite of the quantity X plus 2 squared plus 4 now that we have the function in this form let's also write the function in the form f of X equals ax squared plus BX plus C to do this we'll have to square the binomial take the opposite and then add four and there's no shortcuts to scoring the binomial we have two factors of X plus 2 when multiplying two binomials we have four products we distribute the X and we distribute the two so we have f of X equals the opposite of the quantity x times X is x squared the next times two gives us 2x but then the next product is 2 times X which is also 2x 2x plus 2x gives us plus 4x and then 2 times 2 is 4 giving us plus 4 and then we still have plus 4 outside the parentheses and now to clear the parenthesis here we can distribute the negative or if itself will think of distributing a negative 1 which gives us F of x equals negative x squared minus 4x minus 4 plus 4 and negative 4 plus 4 is equal to 0 giving us f of x equals negative x squared minus 4x so now we have the equation of the function in both forms of a quadratic function this first form is often called vertex form and this last formula sometimes called standard form or general form I hope you found this helpful you
