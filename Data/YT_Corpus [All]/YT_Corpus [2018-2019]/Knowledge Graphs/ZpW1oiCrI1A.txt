 this example will quickly review some of the basics of using the slope-intercept form to graph linear equations in two variables on Part A we want to graph the equation y equals negative 2/3 X plus 4 to begin with we need to draw the axes we need to then draw arrows on at least the positive ends of the axes and label them as well the final step of setting up the axes is to put a scale on each axis please check with your instructor to determine the requirements for this in your class in this first example I will simply put a scale of 1 to 3 on the x axis and 1 to 3 on the y axis before we begin graphing this particular equation we should remind ourselves what the slope-intercept form is in general we write the slope-intercept form as the equation y equals MX plus B the B is a reference to the y-intercept specifically the y-intercept is the point 0 comma B the M tells us what the slope of our line is we want to remind ourselves that the slope is usually described as the rise over the run so in our particular example we know that the y-intercept will be the point 0 comma 4 and the M the slope in this particular case is negative 2/3 so we'll begin by plotting the point at 0 comma 4 on the y axis and from there we will use a slope of a negative 2/3 to move down 2 and to the right 3 to get another point of the line separately we could also move up 2 and left 3 to get a third point on our line we want to remind ourselves a negative slope should be a slope that goes downhill from left to right now that we have three points on our line we can finish by lining up our ruler and graphing the line itself we should finish our work by drawing the arrows on both ends of the line to indicate that this line goes on forever in both directions Part A was given in slope-intercept form in Part B we also want to graph this equation using the slope-intercept form but our first step is going to be to solve it for that form so we'll begin by taking our equation 3x minus 4y equals 8 the first thing we need to do to solve this for y is to subtract 3x from both sides subtracting 3x from both sides would give us negative 4y equals negative 3x plus 8 and then the final step is to divide everything on both sides of the equation by negative 4 that will leave us with y equals a positive 3/4 X minus 2 now that the equation is in slope-intercept form we can begin again by first setting up our axes we'll begin by drawing both axes with a ruler putting arrows on at least the positive ends of the axes and labeling them x and y respectively we'll then pick a scale to put on each axis another way to draw the scale of 1 to 3 on each axis would be to do 2 4 & 6 on each axis notice that is actually the same scale that we had used before we're simply identifying it slightly differently now to graph this line we'll recognize that the y-intercept indicated by the equation is 0 negative 2 so we'll begin at 0 negative 2 on the y axis and from there we see from our equation that the slope is positive 3/4 so from this y-intercept I will either go up 3 1 2 3 to the right 4 or I will go down 3 and to the left 4 either way with a positive slope we should have an uphill line going from left to right again the final step is simply drawing in the line by connecting the dots with our ruler and as always we will add arrows to both ends of the line to give our indication that this does extend forever in both directions
