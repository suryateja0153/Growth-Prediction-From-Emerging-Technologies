 hi guys today we're gonna see how one can use linear algebra to describe graphs and networks in particular we'll do the following problem we're given this very simple graph here with five nodes and six edges we've already labeled them and we've put directions on the edges and we are asked to write down the incidence matrix a and then to compute its kernel and the kernel of a transpose and finally we're asked to compute the trace of a transpose a I'll give you a few moments to try the problem on your own and then you'll see my take on it hello again okay so let's first recall what an incidence matrix a is so in essence matrix is supposed to encode how the nodes connect to the edges in particular it has as many rows as there are edges and as many columns as there are nodes and we fill in we're gonna feel filling the rows and we will fill them out as follows so we're going to use only negative 1 1 and 0 and we're going to put a negative 1 in entry I and 1 in entry J if the edge will be the corresponding edge connects node I to node J ok let me just do it concretely so let's look at edge number 1 so it corresponds to the first row it connects 1 to 2 so we have a negative 1 and a 1 then edge number 2 it connects node 2 to 3 so negative 1 1 edge number 3 connects node 1 to 3 so negative 1 1 and I believe you get the picture right so I'm just gonna fill out the rest rest the entries right 4 is negative 2 1 5 is well 1 here and 6 is okay so with we've constructed in the matrix a now we'll compute it it's no space and we're going to do it without performing any row operations whatsoever so in order to do this it it's helpful to look at the graph as an electric circuit and to assign to ever to each of the nodes an electric potential if we collect all the electric potentials in a vector X then a times X is a vector who with as many entries as there are edges and gives precisely the potential differences across the edges of the graph ok so then if ax is to be 0 this means that across the graph like across all the edges of the graph all potential differences are 0 therefore all the potentials at at each yeah it's all the nodes needs to be cool need to be equal to a constant number so therefore we conclude that the null space of a is spanned by constant okay there are five ones here corresponding to the five notes now what about the null space of a transpose adopt this this analogy with electric circuits but this time we're going to look at currents flowing across the edges of the graph so oh and with we're going to adopt the following convention for the currents so a current is going to be positive if it's if it's if it flows in the direction of the edge and negative if it flows in the opposite direction right so then what is a transpose Y where Y is a vector with which which each of whose entry is a current on the edge well it's precisely the entries of a transpose Y are precisely equal to the total current flowing through each of the nodes of the graph so a transpose Y being equal to zero means that there is a balance in the circuit that the currents that flow through into each node equal the current currents that flow out of it right and it's fairly easy to find such configuration as of currents that's like that satisfied is this about like this balance equation we do it by flowing around loops of the graph so you see this this graph has three loops the first one is this triangle up there the second one is the square and I'm just by this this curled direction I'm signifying which in which way I'm gonna take I'm gonna trace the loop and there is a third loop is along the outer contour of the graph but in fact the third one can be thought of as a superposition of these two and I'll explain why in a second so let's let's figure out we are the configuration of currents that balance these loops so if we flow a current one from one to two and then flow a current of one along edge 2 from 2 to 3 and then we flow a current of negative 1 minded the direction is opposite to the direction of the loop then we're gonna have a balanced configuration of currents so let me write it this down following configuration so 1 along edge 1 1 along edge 2 and negative 1 along edge 3 and the rest 0 a the solution to edge a transpose Y let's see what solution we get by flowing around the loop in this square well we get a 1 along we flow a current of 1 along edge for current of 1 along h5 current of 1 along h6 and current of negative 1 along edge - so let's be careful so there was 0 then along the edge - was negative 1 3 is 0 along for one five one six one now we can do the same thing with the big loop and produce a vector corresponding to it and I I promptly to do it but what you'll see is that the vector that you get is precisely a sum of these two vectors it's a superposition if in a way the big loop is a superposition of the small loops okay so we figured out what the null space of a transpose is and now let's concentrate our attention on finding the trace of a transpose a I'm going to do it right here so the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries and let's and we've seen this many times already that the diagonal entry of the diagonal entries of a transpose a are precisely the magnitude squared of the columns of a okay so the one one entry is the magnitude squared of the first column the to two entry is the magnitude squared in the second column and so on now what is the magnitude squared of a column of an incidence matrix well each column of the incidence matrix is either well so each entry in a column of an incidence matrix is either 1 negative 1 or 0 so when we square these entries we get what ones or zeros and we add them when we add them up we get precisely a number which is the non-trivial entries in that column ok so the magnitude squared of the column is the number of non-trivial entries in it but if we go back to the matrix a and we count the number of nonzero entries these are precise this this is precisely the number of edges that connect with the node okay so the number of edges that connects with each node is called the degree of the node in this way trace of a transpose a will be just the sum of the degrees of the graph in the picture so we have one connects one there are two edges connecting to one two plus two edges connecting to two plus two I sorry three edges connecting to two three edges connecting to three and I got a two for the number of edges connecting to four and two for the number of edges connecting to five so altogether we have we get 12 right so you see we in this problem we computed certain linear algebra objects without performing the usual algebraic operations but just by looking at at the graph and seeing how the linear algebra is encoded in it I hope it was the most illuminating I'll see you next time
