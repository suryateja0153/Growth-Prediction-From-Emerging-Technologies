 [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to MIT jeff rick here with the cue we are taking a short break from the madness of the conference season to do some cute conversations here in the palo alto studio which we always like to do and meet new people and hear new stories learn about new companies and today we've got a new company we've never had them on the queue before it's evan kaplan he's a CEO of in flex data evan great to see you yeah thanks for having me absolutely so for people aren't familiar with the company and give them kind of the 101 on in flex yeah so influx influx data is an open source platform for collecting metrics and events at scale companies about almost 4 years old has a large selection of Tier one customers is broadly accepted by developers as the number one time series platform out there right so a lot of people talk about collecting data right so we we've been doing Splunk since 2012 and you know they really really found something interesting on log files and took it a whole nother level so there's a lot of people that are capturing event so what do you guys do that's a little bit different how are you how are you slicing and dicing this this opportunity yeah I mean to put this anything in the broader context of you know what we're looking at is the 20 year breakup of the Oracle db2 and form X franchise that dominated the relational databases where they answered all problems and so if you look at a company like Splunk working on logs they they optimize a platform for those logs for that data set elastic also really interesting space I think our innovation has been as saying hey where the world's going where all of these complex systems are going particularly IOT is to real-time view of the data and so rather than collect for both logs historical views of the data and things like that real system operators real developers and builders want to instrument their applications their infrastructure so you can view them in real time the place the place where the rubber hits the road is IOT right sensors spit out metrics and events period full stop and so if you want to be performing and how you handle your instrumentation of the physical world and how you do your machine learning and how you want to do and you want to manage these systems you use a fundamentally a time series based database right as opposed to Splunk or elastic or which are primary search databases and are you primarily capturing and standardizing the data to feed other analytics tools or do you have the whole suite were you doing doing some of the anal yes so the fundamental platform is called the tick stack and it stands for Telegraph which is a collector which has about 200 different 200 different collectors that sit out there in the world and collect everything from SNMP data to Oracle data to application to micro service data to kubernetes to that sort of stuff there's in flux which is the DB which is highly optimized for millions and millions of writes a second so collecting data points at samples there's chronograph which is the visualization engine and so it allows you as soon as the data comes input you can see how it's graphed see it's time series oriented graphing and then there's capacitor which takes action on the data what we don't do is a super high sophisticated analytics or lots of companies in Silicon Valley who take our data pump it up and then we put it back on the platform to build a control loop right so within the capacitor so then you does your application then take action on those things yeah so do everything from alerting to sending out another machine request to spinning up a new kubernetes pod to basically scaling application self self-healing right does it fit in between a lot of those other types of applications that are sending off notifications yes and those types of instrumented the way the standard developer or C or an architect or CTO does is they look at a complex application or a complex set of sensors they instrument within flux and telegraph they collect that data they view it in real-time and then they build controllers automation loops to make to make that easier so when you see a problem that's had a tolerance you can self adjust for it right it's the beginning of a kind of a self-healing system ok and I know the Telegraph is the open is definitely open source are the other three or four opens all for open source everything you know in our world everything for a developer is free okay so and a single mode of influx a couple of million rights a second which is really really performant to run in production where our business model is where we make money is our close source clustering sharding distributing the database if you decide you want to learn highly available in a production environment you would buy our closer stuff we have about four hundred and thirty customers who run our closed source stuff on top of the open source so so so is it kind of like say a map R to Hadoop if you will where you know it's built on built on the open source and then they've got their proprietary stuff kind of wrapped around almost like an open core or it's a little bit different than the normal Hadoop stuff one is our stuff doesn't have any external dependencies it can work with other third party product but just it's a platform into itself there are 25 projects there are 4 different projects we own them all they come across as a single binary ok it's not part of us they're integrated so it yeah the tick is the full tip yes and then you put the clustering on top so there's some similarity but ok not being part of Apache we can control and keep clean what those what that experience is and we're about the thing that's been most successful for us is Paul our founder who's my partner is called time to awesome the idea there's a developer in 10 minutes can very quickly be up and instrumenting an application or a set of sensors and see that data pouring in within 10 minutes right from from going to the site and downloading the open source so it's interesting that the giant opportunity is really around IOT just in terms of the explosion of the sensor data and we see that coming and we're at AT&T show a couple weeks ago talking about 5g which is you know slowly coming down the road they got the standards fixed but in terms of this you said the shorter term now nobody has budget I was like to jugg nobody has budget for a new platform they do have budget for new applications because they got real problems so you said you're seeing your main success now your go-to-market application is around application monitoring is would that be accurate or what is considered there are two broad broad things and they're both very similar technologies but service one is the central monitoring stuff so Tesla's power walls Siemens windmills a variety of solar companies built Telegraph into their platforms and then using flux data to collect and store that information and analyze it on the software side people like IBM's cloud service running their network and their fabric SP with a RIBA Cisco with all their collaboration stuff they increment their software applications and see idea it's a general purpose platform for collecting and instrumenting instrumenting the applications or their sensors or anyone ok and so what are you guys working on now what's next got to raise the profile get some new stuff that's the only thing it completely explodes we're not quite there yet but it's but we're starting to see it really happen so that's really exciting for us and this is I mean this is just a really really big market it's certainly a superset of the log market it's ubi it's we and you think about just the instrumentation of the physical world how much instrumentation is going on your clothes your cars your home your industrial devices you know right you know my watch how much sensor data there is we think this is a tremendously large market so we're doing a couple of things one is we're about to introduce a new language for querying these kinds of time series data that's going to be open source that a bunch of other people can use with were there data stores we're rolling out a new API driven service so that people could store these things directly in the cloud natively all they have to do is know our API and so we're really trying to push the from the technology limit we're a product driven company right and so an open-source driven company so we're trying to push that that community is super important to us it's so wild to me the opportunity to have a closed feedback loop between someone's product back to the barn and you know you're barely starting to see a test obviously is a good example they're slowly seeing it in other places but you know what a fundamental change in manufacturing from building a product making some assumptions about use shipping that product to your distribution and then you know maybe you get some feedback now then versus actually monitoring the way that that thing is actually used by your end user whether it's a product like a car or you a software application as you're rolling at all these different apps and features in the apps how are people using it are they using it or do you double down or do you back off and that loop is not really yeah no it's just starting to open up and that whole notion of product telemetry you know my prediction is is that you know as as development teams grow and things like that you're gonna have to lemon tree experts people are gonna be specialized in how do you instrument these products so you get maximum engagement and usage and things like that right I think that's pretty insightful on your part yeah if you think about it from a systems point of view right instrumentation is first you can't do anything till you instrument whether it's telemetry from a product to see engagement or that's so instrumentation is first visibility in real time is second so observability is the big flawed in systems application and building now this notion of observing your system in real time because you don't know you don't a priori it's impossible to know a complex system how it's going to behave then it's automation right so like okay now I can see these behaviors how do I automate something that makes the experience for you the user better but lastly you know we can see this with self-driving cars it's you know it's autonomy it's the idea that the system becomes self-healing and AI and those sorts of things but that's kind of the last step there's a lot of learning in that process too right there it has to be automated because at scale there's no way for people to keep up with the stuff and then how do you separately go from noise and and and how do you know what to do so you got on made a whole bunch and you know and if we had an aspiration it would be we're not gonna write the application of the do these things but what we want to do is be that system of record so that people have a really efficient effective metrics and a mentor so they can really track and keep track of all that engagement right and you know timestamp data for lack of better ways hat it sounds like you're in a pretty good space Evan we're pretty excited thank you thanks for saying that yeah we're pretty excited all right well thanks for taking a few minutes out of your day and and sharing the story we learn to watch in the trash yeah thanks man all right all right he's ever done Jeff you're watching the cube we're having a cute conversation of Palo Alto we'll see you next time thanks for watching [Music] you
