 so now after we talked about all of the different symptoms that may come from anxiety they might come from autism and how the different chemicals that are in our body in our brain can kind of create this loop the good news is that the good stuff can create a feedback loop as well and so we're going to talk about the positive feedback loop and why progress snowballs the positive feedback loop and why progress snowballs the positive feedback snowball is an exciting part of this any change in the right direction is a change that can help everything improve over time this is how progress progress can snowball reduction and inflammation allows the gut to absorb more nutrients from the food you eat from these nutrients hormones and chemicals that make their way to their brain are better processed and distribute distributed rejection and inflammation of the brain both allows these chemicals to better be absorbed and shows behavior and physical changes such as less aggression less headaches and better sleep and this is all from just reducing the inflammation in your body and therefore reducing the inflammation in your brain when sleep is better the whole body has time to heal and the energy to heal itself which further reduces inflammation increases energy and provides a positive feedback loop of a better mood who and a person in a better mood is more likely to stick with a healing program the person that's sticking with the healing program has more feel-good chemicals in the brain the person with more feel-good chemicals in their brain is going to exercise more and in turn that exercise is going to create better sleep and thus no this kind of snowball just keeps snowballing up in a positive direction and so that's what I wanted to share so the whole idea that autism might actually be a trauma to the brain can kind of be maybe upsetting or a little jarring to you but the good news is that the stuff that helps brain injury and there's tons and tons of stuff like if you click the link below I'm going to show you I've sourced this to all peer-reviewed medical journals they know what helps the brain they know what like they've done tons and tons of trials there's not a shortage of people with brain injuries sadly in the United States and there's plenty of animal trials as well that which then have been after they shown promise on animals then they show promise in people as well and so this isn't something that hasn't been studied your doctor like your primary care physician problem has not studied it personally but that's why as a mom or as a parent or as someone that loves someone with a brain injury this is something that we can do to help them and so the good news is there is help there's the good news is that once you start a healing protocol it's likely it's going to start getting easier instead of getting harder I know it's overwhelming to start but I encourage you to try thanks for joining me I'm Kara from health home and happiness I'm super glad you're here if you have comments leave them below don't forget to check out the links that I've linked to and if you want to like I would love that and if you would like to subscribe I would love that as well I try to provide as much content on my channel as possible thanks and we'll see you soon
