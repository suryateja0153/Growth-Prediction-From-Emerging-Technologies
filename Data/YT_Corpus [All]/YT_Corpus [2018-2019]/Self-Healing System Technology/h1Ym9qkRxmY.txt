 from the silicon angle media office in Boston Massachusetts it's the queue now here's your host stool minimun hi I'm Stu minimun and you're watching the cubes Boston area studio happy to welcome back to the program Randy Garson oh and Steve Kennison back absolutely how can I miss you if you don't go away Oh gentlemen thank you so much we've been talking we do you know storage and SDI which of course is software-defined infrastructure essentials we're gonna dig inside Steve let's start with you know we sometimes we argue over definitional things and when you hear you know software-defined oh it's about software and especially you know when you talk about the storage world it's like wait there's always been software when we talk about storage explain why it's a little bit different now than than what we were doing you know even five years ago sure things do I think I think one of the number one things that we run into a lot of that we hear you know conversationally it's it's it's it's storage and it's software and now we're hearing a lot more about data services right the ability to connect data so forget forget the the physical storage for a second connect the data to the people right because as we've been talking all along today right this evolutionary platform is being able to provide more people access to more data than they've ever had before in a very secure way right such that they can actually not only get their jobs done get them done better get them done stronger get them done faster without all the as my boss likes to say booga-booga dealing with having to get at that data so if I look at before and after right if I look at the before aspect that that dealt with you know how do I get to my data right how do I get access to that data if I'm a developer of five years ago right it ends up being and you can attest to this and please do write a conversation between the developer and IT and then it becomes a myriad of questions back and forth about why do you need what do you need it for how much do you need where does it need to live how fast is it need to be all of the things that you can did today program right into a programmable infrastructure and just say click let me provide that to you right so before it was all these conversations and then I got to buy it then I got to picture it then I got to secure it and then I got to know how many Lunz you need I know how fast it is and I got a and then I got a provision that out to you right I go ok and then you say well now I need that and then the next conversation is well I can't get to with this application which is on this server which is and now it's another hole you know but before a developer can start working it could be a month whereas afterwards it it should be if you have a good programmable infrastructure I have my application like a chef or a pop or door and ansible and I push a button and it says ok I need this particular data set and they used to have these set of services it needs to be this available needs to perform this fast I need to be able to make these types of copies click go right that's kind of where we're at today with what we're hoping the software can do for you yeah I always worry sometimes we try to oversimplify things and we miss kind of the why so one of my favorite jokes we all had is you know there is no cloud it's just a computer somewhere else because it was like no no wait there's still gear underneath it but it missed thee but why does that matter it's like oh wait now I've got order of magnitude more you know that I can access for short periods of time and therefore I can do things that I couldn't do before when I think about data it's you know you know big data you know massive data things like no no it's what I it's not just storing a bunch of bits somewhere in case I need them for a regulatory thing because yeah I got to do governance compliance blah blah blah and everything but it's like wow do you know data is you know driver for business and therefore you know data services that allow me to protect and secure and access all those data is so super important absolutely and and there's another another analog I think is its if you think about data services as we're talking about it right now it's becoming more of and the self-service metaphor is a very important one I think because Steve's earlier point in the old world you know you used to have to go through this complicated workflow and checkpoints and sign offs and all these procedural you know loopholes he'd have to jump through in order to provision something which by the time it became available to you was probably outdated right so so you were constantly behind right now at the pace of global business and digital business and the importance of data as a driver of global business you just don't have that luxury and where you can't afford to be waiting on the availability of that piece of information so not only does the immediacy of it improve the actual value of the data because there's always a temporal element of value for that data and every second you waste is potentially value that's diminished from data so not only do we now reduce that kind of latency we also provide much better reuse so we talked about this idea of incremental value right so you can take the same data element or data construct and now instantaneously repurpose it in multiple ways to extract additional may be unforeseen value from it right so we've get we've gotten away from the the concept of these kind of siloed systems that are you know this is my production system this is my OLAP system my reporting system we now have this convergence and cross-pollination of data that flows between and among all these systems which can now be made available via something like a data services platform or a you know fill in the blank as a service type platform in a self-service mode where it can be used by any number of different applications and users for any number of different purposes yeah and what I like about it want to hear from customers is it used to be you had to have the budget of a nation or a team of PhDs to try to figure this out and as you say we're this cross-pollination when I get the data versus when I'm going to need the data yes there's the temporal piece but sometimes it's you know I might be doing it for a different purpose or I'm not sure and things are changing all the time so that that going back to our initial conversation that agility and flexibility be able to you know access and you know tie into that data and have the right services is so critically important well that's a good comment right you need to have a budget of a nation in order to do this and then how long came all the cloud providers and said no you don't swipe your credit card and start working right the tricky part for for me the consumer of of that great now I've got the processing power I need but I need my data to build my particular application and I love sort of to finish that all right in order to build the right application to make sure it works for what I'm going to do because at some point right and I know Dave likes to talk about this a lot I need to be able to integrate it into my existing systems and and if the performance isn't the same that's what I'm gonna probably run into a lot of buggy stuff over here right so I need to be I need to be careful with that so I what I think is interesting is and I'd love to use the analogy think of the first credit the first bank that came up with the application where I could snap a picture of my of my cheque right I bet the CE CIO of the competitive company went to his development team the next morning after seeing that commercial said I want one of those do you think I mean we if you broke and I I don't like always like to use particular verticals right because I think this this conversation extends across all applications but do you if you had to break down what does one banking customer cost the bank over time right and then you said for every day I'm late I lose five customers and you had to go through that whole lengthy process just to get started for the development team to start working on something like that with their data rate I gotta make sure that the data fits into how does the deposit work how does it how does it translate how does it show when does it show all those stuff mattered to my data right I need to put that underneath but now now I can do it if I can do it programmatically or provide the infrastructure as a service hit a button and and I don't have to be a rocket scientist right I can just do it for my application now I'm off and running well and and and flipping it and looking at it from the providers perspective so if I'm the consumer of those data services it's great for me if I'm the provider of those services it's also very beneficial to me because now having that elasticity and that fractional consumption model where I can offer you exactly as much compute or storage or or you know analytic horsepower you need for your particular use case an environment for as long as you need it that gives me a tremendous value proposition that I can then provide to you so it's really mutually beneficial on both the supply and the demand yeah actually so David flyer from our team had done lots of research talking about just real business value that can be driven back when I can like leverage that data it's like oh wait now I have things like flash that allow me you know very fast to make snaps and then wait I have real this is the actual data and then I can test on that and then how fast can I get that back into production if I need B there's a lot of things we can do now that just those enablers of the new technology at scale well and I also think it's pretty interesting we talked earlier about our three patterns right the modernized transform in the next gen if you think about the next gen right that's now what I want to do is a corporation is I want to bring on new people and I want to do some data analytics that data analytics is gonna allow me to learn stuff about my business and I'm gonna want to start to do stuff in a new way I'm gonna want to stuff to do stuff in a new way today right I don't want to wait and say ok now that I know I think what I want to do is X and wait six months for the infrastructure to be there to start programming against it no I want to make real-time decisions that I want to do real-time things today that's that's how that evolution starts to happen and it needs to be fast for those yeah well that one of the the promises is you know right cloud computing when I need it it's there I don't need to worry about what's available talk to me about what what what does scale and you know that speed mean to your customers what kind of architectures do they need to go to to be able to you know have that kind of experience no matter where they are yeah I think you're starting to boil it down into products and and and and while that's that's good right new technologies and new capabilities like flash and nvme and that sort of thing that's just the raw performance that's the engine of the car right but you start thinking about all the telemetry data that race racers collect to then tweak the car not just the engine but the car and the foils and that sort of thing in order to get the maximum amount of speed out of the car that's really the performance stuff that we're talking about and that's all the instrumentation around the different products and that sort of thing that's it within the portfolio that enable things like self-service it enables things like which is which is speed in its own way right it's data protection and it's faster rpoS and RTOS different type of protections sets of services its disaster recovery faster replication location to the cloud lower-cost right replication into the cloud maybe not necessarily another data center all of those things in the portfolio equal speed weather speed be raw performance getting from A to B or speed of business which means I can be I could be doing whatever that thing is that makes me more competitive quicker than the other guy can do it yeah and when you have these services which are much more encapsulated and kind of you know to use a very old term kind of self documenting in a way if you think about taking a data element or a data structure or some piece of knowledge or information that we're gonna do some kind of processing on and you load that with as many definitional characteristics as you can without a slowing it down or be making it too expensive then you inherently improve the value of that thing whatever that is right so you know great there's a million examples the the picture of the check is a good one you know telemetry coming from delivery trucks for FedEx or UPS there's a million examples where the ability to gather data which would be gathered anyway and used for some other purpose but now you layer on some of these additional service and characteristics and dimensions to it and it becomes a whole new entity that now has a whole other set of values that can be expanded upon so it's really this multiplicative effect that we see that allows you to take your data which is our most valuable asset typically and leverage it across multiple use cases and in multiple dimensions yeah so Steve when I think about data services you know if I think if the old world was rather fixed and the new world is you know where are we today and what's kind of a near future looked like helped us walk through that a little bit yeah I think I think I think you painted it very well to be anyway we always like to look out front and say this is utopia this is where we're going where are people today I think there are a lot of technologies out there that if you're starting to modernize and I think I think we're in that modernization trend right now where a lot of the newer technologies or even some of the older technologies that you might have installed in your environment are building out a robust API set because the new the new stuff is all API driven so if I'm an incumbent and I'm in a data center and I want to maintain my whole to my footprint I need to start working with other things newer versions of a lot of the incumbent Tecna building in restful api now you're bringing in newer technologies maybe a chef or puppet sitting on top of your infrastructure that has restful api s the trick for the infrastructure for the IT team is to slowly evolve into that infrastructure developer that we talked about now they're learning how to connect those two right as I'm learning how to connect those two I'm also learning about how to make that data available in other locations or how to make those applications talk in other locations that don't import impact my production right so where are we today I think we're slowly starting to understand what these Abele API connectivities are and if there isn't that connectivity I think folks are really starting to look at what what what do I replace that incumbent with to make sure that I'm getting that out of what I'm gonna need for the future so I'd say we're 20% down the road right but but things are moving fast I mean the as time moves forward it goes faster and faster and faster and you know a year from today we might be at 50% right or 60 yeah and I would just add that that the the level of integration that exists between the products in the spectrum portfolio is is very foundational and very you know it's a very intricate structure right so as we evolve products and solutions you know we just had an announcement this week of the new flash platform on the hardware side so there's as these things become available they start to then elevate the value and improve the capabilities of other parts of the portfolio as well so there's this kind of platform story that you start to be able to tell and that's really what these this series has been about and what the follow-on sessions will be about drilling into specific solutions at a lower level of detail is is how do we build you know the information platform of the future for our clients yeah great and I know there's more coming in the future but last thing I wanted to ask you here is we had a while that we were saying well we're just gonna simplify everything well public cloud is cheap and easy and you know hyper-converged is gonna boil everything down and it's just like this one box well and if you look at both of those spaces that they've evolved that now the line I've used I think if I was going to you know build compute in Amazon or go buy a server from pick your favorite om of choice you know the cloud probably has more options and is more complicated to buy you know we'll figure out how the pricing is depending on whether you buy the three years reserved instances or anything like that but you know like customers that the paradox of choices is really tough for people as they do so how do you balance that flexibility but still trying to commit to make it easier because you know the you know staffing you know I can't have you know engineers dedicated to you know helping to try to figure this out and oh the next release comes out in a month and everything I learned is already old well I I appreciate your input and feedback on that because what I'm about to say is is I think easy is relative right and it's relative to the person who needs to access the the systems of the data or the equipment or that sort of thing right so if I'm a if I'm someone who's graduated from college and looking to join the IT workforce today or in the next few years right to me simple means right a myriad of things right and I might have been trained on and educated on but but I'm gonna stay in that world what why do you continually buy an iPhone and I'll switch over to Android why why why does ecosystem right why does someone do it the other way right it doesn't matter you pick one and that's what you know and that becomes easy for you right and then as you're learning so let's say I pick AWS right as I start to continue to learn and they come out with new things and that's why I pay attention to I find these new things that plug in right and it's only when vendors come to you and talk about not just not just hey I've got this new this new fidget spinner right or whiz-bang technology it's it's I know how to integrate with your platforms to make your life easier those are the conversations that actually pick Beals head up and go okay that does make my life easier yeah that's exactly I was just gonna say we talked earlier about this whole concept of kind of integration integrating automated versus rip and replace you know innovate is supposed to institutionalize so this is exactly that this is we has trusted advisors and integrators that effect are able to go to our clients and say look you have typically a complex environment that has multiple different platforms and stacks that you're working with you may be able to standardize on a common you know model or a common foreign portfolio structure for everything not likely though you're probably going to continue to have you know different different pieces of the puzzle we it's our job in our sellers job and our partners job to develop an integration strategy and an automation strategy that exploits each of those that are in place to the best of their current ability and provides a path forward so to your point eventually we'll all things live in the cloud and we'll the cloud become you know so so self-aware and so sophisticated that it's able to provision itself and manage itself and write your apps for you perhaps you know probably not in our lifetime so in the meantime large organizations and small organizations still have to get from point A to point B they have to run their business they can't afford to spend you know a king's ransom on IT but they also can't have to be secure and reliable and perform etc so we provide a portfolio of solutions that plugs into existing infrastructure augments it maybe replaces it but not necessarily and helps our clients get between here and there and provides them the Headroom to grow into the future as well what do you what's your answer to the simple and easy yeah well first of all right yeah I think it just on the definitional piece you know we'll all be living in the cloud when we've just redefine that means it's it's hooked up to the internet that it's cloud because everything is um and here's the challenge of the day no one can keep up on everything you know I've had the pleasure to talk to some of the smartest dang people in this industry and thank the ones you know absolutely but the the people that you know are creating new stuff and you know whatever it is they're like I can't keep up with my own firm I don't have time you know it's like you know I they say you know the doctor would need you know every week would need a thousand hours to read up on everything in their specialty but it doesn't mean that we're out of jobs actually we've got lots of new jobs because we love we've done some events with MIT where it's you know racing with machines it's people plus machines you know automation does not get rid of your job what it hopefully gets rid of is the crap you didn't want to deal with anyway um we thought for a while we wanted to get rid of different undifferentiated heavy lifting well what that you know as as talk to the IT people it's like the thing that you look at every month until like oh god I have to do that well can't you automate that piece of it and it actually raises a really interesting point and we haven't touched on it I don't think up to this point but this is another one of the areas where IBM is is uniquely positioned in this discussion and in this space to bring to bear a level of sophistication and advanced artificial intelligence cognitive capability machine learning we are today delivering the world's most sophisticated powerful capable solutions in that space and not surprisingly that technology is imbuing everything that we do so our entire portfolio is interspersed with very sophisticated AI capabilities analytic capabilities for self adaptation you know self learning self-healing so it gives us again a competitive advantage I think as we take these solutions to market that they are imbued with this very sophisticated level of advanced process yeah and the other thing I'd say and if Steve you brought it up in one of our discussions there IBM's a lot of partners I I never look at IBM saying we're the only one we're the be-all and end-all of everything know that the CIS and the MSPs and the CSPs and you know software partners and everything like that you mentioned competitive environment I think the first time I heard the word cooperative was it was almost always about IBM because yes IBM probably as a product that does something along those lines but they know they're not the only ones and they're they'll continue to to partner to make sure that customers get the solutions they need right all right if final words you want to leave on on this segment gentlemen I want to thank you very much for hosting us for this event indeed yeah thank you for your insights do we appreciate it I you know it's always important for us to not not RER own press clippings too much it's important to get the external viewpoint and get the outside perspective so we appreciate your hey and thank you so much for bringing both of you we've worked with you for for many years always appreciate your viewpoints and look forward to continuing the conversation all right and thank you so much always give us any feedback if you have check out the cube net for all the websites randy arson on steve Kennison I'm Stu minimun thanks for watching the cube
