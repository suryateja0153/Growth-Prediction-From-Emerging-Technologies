 welcome to TTI welcome to a whole new world of science do you love to criticize your government if yes then I will give you more reasons to criticize them for road constructions so that your tax money would be utilized correctly and efficiently so sit back relax and start criticizing number one rolling barriers accidents are the biggest problem faced by humanity to minimize the impact of crashes a us-based company ETI has developed a product that reduces the damages that occur due to harsh impacts against guardrails these rolling barriers reduce the fatality rate up to 70% and ensure maximum safety on the road are you curious to know how it works these barrels are made up of highly elastic and shock absorbing materials such as ethyl vinyl acetate and their cores are made up of urethane when the vehicle hits the guardrail the rotating barrel converts shock energy to rotational energy and guides the cars in the moving direction furthermore its height prevents the vehicle from leaving the roadway in addition they are easy to install and their maintenance is a piece of cake currently they are used in some Asian countries probably your country might get these in the future if you're truly fortunate number 2 thirsty concrete how much water can you drink in just 60 seconds you might say that one liter or a maximum of 1.5 liters meet thirsty concrete an innovative concrete developed by lafarge tarmac this concrete can drink 880 gallons of water or 4000 litres in just 60 seconds definitely you can't win this thirsty Monster is made up of a reformulated and durable material called top a mix permeable which has absorbent porous surface the rainwater flows through the porous layer of concrete to a drainage system of rocks and pebble where it can reenter the groundwater indirectly preventing the floods and puddles in urban areas and acts as a reservoir although the roads become safer in the rain this material is still infeasible in cold weather because of freezing number three smart roads are enriched with the most futuristic technologies the first example of smart road is smart crossing the world's first smart crosswalk developed by direct line and which is displayed for the first time at mitchum in London it is a prototype responsive road crossing powered by cameras computer programming and a massive LED screen and planted into the road thanks to its computer vision it can differentiate between pedestrians bicycles and motorists moreover and automatically widens the zebra crossing for large group crossings another example of a smart road is the solar roadway it consists of smart micro processing solar units and covered with the new tempered glass material which is designed and tested to meet all impact load and traction requirements if you are environmentally cautious then good news for you these solar units are made up of recycling materials at the same time they generate neat and clean electricity from sunlight and they pay for themselves which means governments around the world don't have any reason to waste taxpayers money other than that it can produce heat to melt ice and snow and may evaporate water on the roads and at the same time it can differentiate between humans animals and machines on the road with the help of pressure-sensitive panels it promotes safer driving at night reduces traffic's delays and accidents on the road the cool thing about this is that it's every panel has a series of LED lights on the circuit board that can forecast to the various types of standard road signs maybe you want to play games miraculously it can convert itself from an ordinary ground into another kind of playground such as basketball hops watch hockey and more besides this futuristic road has its own cable corridor that runs alongside the roadway hence it replaces the need for a telephone poles and hanging wires which may be extremely dangerous whenever the cables fall live upon a human number forms the road cleaners the first example of a road cleaner is the Spartan leafpro which is a quick way to clean up the leaves during autumn and developed by an innovative road cleaning company Bonnell industries the machine is equipped with a 35 gallon fuel tank and 99 horse powered Kubota V 3800 T engine a 12-volt 1200 ampere battery a 15-yard collection body and a powerful fan this machine is primarily designed for municipal use to clean public areas also it is available in a remote-controlled variant which may be expensive but at the same time it would clean snow too the second example of the road cleaner is escas cleaning machine the escas event cleaning is a company specialized in cleaning event areas the machine is a hybrid of a truck and a vacuum cleaner with the large volume capacity its operational speed is 10 miles per hour which might be enough speed to clean the given area and less time in front of the machine there are two massive suction tubes which allowed the waste collection of various sizes and shapes furthermore the unloading process of collected trash can be done in a matter of seconds and it can be controlled from the driver's cabin also this machine can be used to clean fallen leaves on the streets to asphalt repairs Swiss researchers developed the sticky viscous black goop which could prevent potholes by self-healing process similar to Wolverine it's a mixture of iron oxide nanoparticles and bitumen generally the asphalt can crack like regular roads but in this case a magnet can be used for healing the cracks how does it work well it's pretty straightforward whenever you apply a magnetic field on this nanoparticle base to black binder it starts melting and then its liquid form flows inside the micro cracks when the process is repeated the lifespan of the road increases exponentially without wasting tax money number 6 Road painter these machines are used to paint erodes markings developed by a company Tim from Belarus it sprays a special paint which consists of a thermoplastic material and the reflective glass beads which makes them last longer and provides greater visibility at night the company produces various Road painting machines the notch are 700 TPK model variant can even be used as a driverless moreover the schmell 12-8 is much larger Road painter built to paint roads markings on long and busy highways while the contour 100 is a much smaller variant that's constructed especially for busy areas like cities RPS 60 Road printer although we are living in the 21st century still road construction is back-breaking expensive and time-consuming well not anymore get ready for the road printer from Rp systems it looks like a dream coming true when it prints out the brick road in real time the workers have the total freedom to load bricks randomly as long as this hungry machine is being fed continuously it always provides you the road with precise and perfect order in addition the RP system also manufactures eco printer a lightweight all-electric version which works on the lithium-ion batteries furthermore this is another Road printing machine called as tiger stone from a Dutch company van kieu it is a self-propelled machine 20 feet wide and covers up to 300 square metres of Road per day at a speed of 13 feet per minute number eight the road zipper today traffic on the roads is one of the primary reasons for inconvenience of drivers now we have the road zipper this machine can increase the roads capacity by decreasing the bottlenecks thanks to these machines now making barrier walls on the road is much more comfortable faster and most effective apparently on old roads the widening process is much cheaper and budget-friendly this road construction technology is used to create the safe and dynamic full of vehicles on the roads because it can change the configuration of the necessary guardrails in real time thus this technology is best to change the number of lanes or to adjust the roads thickness according to city traffic MGM s trackway in many developing countries we don't even find good roads but don't worry now we have these temporary modular roads thanks to the medium ground mobility solution from Fon trackway this machine can deploy roads in the manner we have never seen before it can provide you a road in the forest in the field or any geographically difficult areas its primary mission is to make better roads and even the worst conditions for making accessible to heavy military vehicles or for men and machines and their vital resources these roads are made up of lightweight aluminum panels which can be coiled around a metallic spool and situates at the back side of the vehicle the vehicle is good enough to carry five tons of the coiled aluminum even to trained men can deploy 32 metres of trackway in less than six minutes and it can also withstand repeated loads of up to 30 tons Road bitsu menacing machine the Shire of Mora releases this video from Australia that shows how a road is surfaced a total of four point nine kilometers were completed over a two-day period the upgrading mission of airstrip road is accomplished just by spending half a million dollars four hundred forty three thousand to be exact the road bits Immunization is a process of spreading bitumen for surfacing and roofing while bitumen is a black viscous mixture of hydrocarbons I think they're using C 117 bitumen this process looks like black magic and has also known as chip and seal in the u.s. or spray seal or seal coating furthermore experts say that these types of roads are best suitable for lightweight vehicle and low traffic situations like in rural areas you can subscribe to TTI for more awesome content I'll see you guys in my next episode peace
