 hey guys hope you guys are doing great today's topic is going to be about blockchain security. I'll be sharing with you my thoughts on the blockchain X.0 , different phases cars gonna go through so moving right Tthe topics of today's discussion are gonna be, blockchain background, the use-cases, blockchain x.0, smart contracts,  the weakest link, security considerations Blockchain deployments have been discussed for a while now and in my eyes there are pretty much three deployment types of blockchains, the public, private, and hybrid and most of the deployments have been on the public side and they are pretty much the Bitcoin, ethereum,  litecoin etc discussed for for a while now and in my eyes there are pretty much three deployment types of block chains the public private and hybrid and all the use cases of the public blockchain have been in the area of cryptocurrencies besides the cryptocurrencies there has been and no major uptake of the private deployment of the blockchain by the enterprises anywhere I go these days the the discussion ology evolves around and a lot of people are talking about blockchain as a godsend it is a cure for all problems is gonna solve all issues and you know it's gonna solve for world hunger and you know world's gonna be a pretty place once everybody starts using blockchain so so the truth is blockchain technology was introduced in 2009 and since then there has been no other massive use of it them , besides the  cryptocurrencies as I said in the in the previous slide it is it's only use case has been cryptocurrencies anywhere else everybody just trying to see what it is but a snake oil salesmen are pretty much trying to sell it for anything and everything so it is key that before you embrace the blockchain technology and you look at what use what requirement is it addressing is there a requirement for you to go to blockchain at all so don't just go into it just for the sake of it there are enterprises who are conducting proof of concepts on blockchain and which is okay they they can do what they want but right now the industry is looking at pretty much blockchain is like a hammer and everything looks like a nail so anything and everything you know blockchain is gonna solve blockchain xro in this slide I talk about the evolution of the blockchain technology since its inception so if you look at the table in the slide number five blockchain one auto I call these Bitcoin litecoin those coins so these were the first incarnations of blockchain and the main use case of block chain or the cryptocurrencies hence the Bitcoin icon and dogecoin the next phase i would call it as a blockchain 1.5 which improved on the blockchain 1.0 technologies by introducing privacy into the into the mix because in doctrine one dot o everything was transparent although people said they transactions on on the cryptocurrencies were anonymous they were not really anonymous they were synonymous where if somebody knew the public address of someone then they could pretty much track where they were sending money when they were pretty receive money from but even in in that blocked in minato era if you were not using the same address all the time then you could pretty much obfuscate that activity but the key was that you had to make sure that you used new address for every transaction the introduction of the blockchain 1.5 technologies such as malaria of Z cash Z coin they introduced the ability to anonymize the transactions at the blockchain l also a lot of formation was available then came blockchain 2.0 and ethereum is is in improvement on all it's pretty much an improvement on the blockchain one dot o technologies where it said instead of creating a new cryptocurrency every time you had to fork an existing blockchain and introduce some additional code into it what aetherium meant to do was they said they will introduce a platform which would allow creation of cryptocurrencies programmatically and to do this they introduced a concept of smart contracts which would be the code that you could write to implement your cryptocurrency without worrying about the the nodes the mining and all that complicated stuff but if you look at it going from 1.5 to 2.0 still does not have any implementation of privacy in it the new version of ethereum is going to have have that implemented in it and I think ethereum is going for the ZK snarks but that is yet to be found out when they do implement it the next phase of blockchain as I call 3.0 would be as you can see in the list EOS neo Hyper ledger so these are an improvement over ethereum where they theorem introduced its own programming language called solidity which has its own issues but eos and neo said okay we will allow a whole bunch of existing smart contract languages to be used such as c-sharp Java JavaScript or whatever you want to use oho so Yas has has a bunch of language supports out of the box there's some that that have being worked on same thing with neo and same thing with the hyper ledger the next evolution in my eyes is the blockchain 4.0 where we have technologies like polkadot dfinity, Tezos which are pretty much introducing more concepts on on the platforms that blockchain 3.0 has already introduced so in trouble our cheney operability consensus mechanisms where if you wanted to change certain aspects of the blockchain and you would have to go through a consensus mechanism and only through through that you could have those changes implemented into the blockchain one of the key and and when I talk about this I'm talking about tezo's which is planning on introducing that hopefully sometime in summer they should go live smart contracts were introduced by ethereumin 2015 this was again as I said in the previous slide the mechanisms for automating and making a platform that allowed people to create their own cryptocurrencies with the whole bunch of logic in it but it is not to be construed as a legal contract the word the usage of the word smart contract came about when Vitalik  Buterin was doing some work on on another fork of a blockchain for and they had to write some code for that and they said we call it a smart contract because it was pretty much automating some activity and hence the name smart contract was coined and it struct that way but what what's confusing is that people seem to be thinking of a smart contract equivalent to a legal contract no both of these are not equal if you went to a lawyer lawyers don't speak smart contract language they speak their legalese and they will only talk about their stuff and they would not sign off on any smart contracts so just be aware of that and and they and coming along to the theme of this show today is security the fact that you can write a bunch of code to do certain activities for you introduces inherent risks because because it is code it is written by human beings and there have to be sooner or later there are going to be some bugs in it and when something has bugs in it those bugs can be exploited by people and bad things will happen such as the DAO hack that happened in 2016 where a a smart contract was had some code issues in it and somebody found that that hole and they exploited it and they ran away with about 150 million dollars worth of ether the weakest link in this whole equation so far has been in the smart contract which is not really the blockchain yourself blockchain inherently is very secure no one has been able to hack it or change it or crack it so so it is it is a secure technology but what happens is people who are using the blockchain they have their mechanisms to use the blockchain and this mechanism at this point of time because cryptocurrencies are prevalent right now is the wallet and when you are writing stuff to the blockchain blockchain says you have to make sure that there's a private key and a public key exchange and you as what owner should have the private key and public you can give to anybody else but if the wallet owner as such does not protect the private key or the secret to the private key then they might be susceptible to phishing attacks so all the all the hacks all the losses that have been incurred so far have been due to the fact that the wallet mechanisms are pretty complicated and people forget their keys people lose their keys and and people don't protect the keys intelligently and that's what makes them lose their their cryptocurrencies but in a real use case what one has to look for in a blockchain from security perspective are some of the things that that any security practitioner would be looking at in any kind of a deployment so as the black blockchain platform get more complex the threat vectors also increase exponentially so we need to focus on on these areas as I've listed below cryptography cryptography is the key the consensus algorithms the identity authentication authorization code development practices data integrity encryption mechanisms in certain response so coming to key management as I said before your wallet when you are using your wallet your keys are very important so you have to protect your private keys the other piece is when you are creating the blockchain yourself there's a key sermon you required for that to generate keys for the blocked in yourself and if that mechanism is weak then you're gonna have issues what kind of encryption are using in in in the in the in the blockchain that is key as well what kind of hashing functions you are using in it and all this is tied up together a nice package via the consensus algorithm so if the consensus algorithm has flaws in it then everything else is gonna get messed up as well so so you have to make sure the consensus algorithm that you you you select you do your due diligence in selecting the consensus algorithm and an implementation so again consider consensus algorithm in its own right is a piece of code which needs secure development practices such as you know code review code testing black box testing white box testing all kinds of stuff that that goes up with any code so you have to make sure that you have that full approved the next piece is identity as the blockchain platforms advance and they become more complicated and this is not really an issue at this point of time in any aetherium but eoz and and then the new platforms are introducing it and the the idea about authentication so the machines or the users need to need to have authentication implemented and again you have to make sure the authentication is a strong authentication you don't lose credentials easily the authorization piece to what level of access are you providing once somebody's authenticated into the into this blockchain environment then what is this actor able to do is it hard to be able to modify things or aren't able to read stuff so authorization is important as well so you need to have keep an eye on the authorization mechanisms I already spoke about code development practices data integrity is if you are writing pieces of code into the blockchain you have to make sure that data that is being written to the blockchain and being read out of it it's entering integrity is maintained currently in blockchains you can't write a whole lot of data you can only write very small piece of data to it but it is it is a repository where you can make references to to data in other repositories so so that's that's one area that you need to look at I encryption mechanisms as I've said before that is that is key you have to make sure you're not using weak encryption at all and finally the incident response so whatever infrastructure you deploy for your blockchain that is if you do use blockchain for your organization you have to make sure that you take you have documented processes for incident response and monitoring for incidents so the whole infrastructure that this block team is going to be sitting on make sure you have the proper monitoring in place you have documented procedures for responding to incidents you will have intrusion detection intrusion prevention mechanisms so as you can see the blockchain is not different from deploying any software in your or any platform in your environment as long as your requirements are clear you understand what what your needs are what you're going to be implementing it for then use those same delivery methodologies the fact that you are deploying blockchain shouldn't really change anything for you if you have strong security practices being practiced in your organization then looking at blockchain deploying a blockchain technology should not be rocket science it should be just following the regular for the delivery methodology taking care of the regular security requirements hey everybody hope
