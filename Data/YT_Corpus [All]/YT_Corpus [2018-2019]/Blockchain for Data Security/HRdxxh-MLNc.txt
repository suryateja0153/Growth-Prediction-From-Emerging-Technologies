 hey guys today's show is about blockchain security tools I had another show on 8th of April in which I spoke about blockchain security and what are the security impacts of blockchain and how they should be addressed in this show I will be delving deeper into what other mechanisms are available to improve the security of the blockchain as you guys are aware blockchain is an environment where currently most of the deployments are on the public side which means there are nodes that are owned by anybody and everybody and the blockchain is sitting on those nodes and so far none of that environment has been compromised no one has been able to modify the blockchain because of the net of the network effect and that's what's keeping the whole blockchain environment going without any requirement for for extra security whereby you know you don't need to have a secure session to the blockchain when you're transferring it right all happens over HTTP octane has not been hacked all all the issues have come from the wallets or are the other other pieces away on top of it and that's why to make it a bit more easier to explain I have broken down the typical blockchain ecosystem into four layers looking at layer number one this is what I call the cryptographic functions and consensus so as you as you know a blockchain is a chain of blocks that are now using a cryptographic function of hashing and that's how they're linked to each other so you cannot go and modify a block that has already been committed via consensus to the blockchain because there's there's so many other copies available of it you will not be able to successfully change that that block and the next level up is the layer 2 where the the code of in a particular block chain gets executed so these these are these are the this is the the world computer as they as they call it which is sitting on every node that is supporting that particular blockchain ecosystem on top of that and sorry before we go to the third layer layer 2 would be pieces such as the etherium EVM that runs the the smart contracts written in solidity and for the Bitcoin blockchain this would be the code that's written in the script and and this is what this way it would be executing on the next piece is layer 3 up above that the API this is the interface that allows external parties to communicate with the blockchain the main users are the wallets which are communicating to the blockchain and sending transactions back and forth and the next piece are they smart contract so people develop smart contracts let's say let's talk about it cerium again solidity so once you write the code in solidity it goes to the API gets converted into bytecode which then gets added to the blockchain for execution in the EVM and then there's this other uses as well where you know but people are using this similar API for walking through the blockchain which are called blockchain explorers to identify transactions as to who's sending what sending what where that kind of stuff so as you can see the biggest issue over here is this layer for the layer three two and one are pretty protected they have never been compromised ever although blockchain runs runs in in care the communications are all in clear the the only thing different people are doing to make make this environment secure layer one two and three is that let's say Bitcoin blockchain uses script programs that run but script programs are not turing-complete what that means is they don't have any affairs conditions that could cause risk conditions and which might cause the the machine the world computer to crash so so that's how Bitcoin blockchain is protecting their environment for etherium the way they are protecting is their code the solidity code is turing-complete what that means is it has if then closet is able to make decisions and and the way etherium addresses that issue is that if you want to execute this code you got to pay some some money which is gas so as long as you you keep putting gas in into your material code your code will it continue running no matter what conditions you have in it so you you are the one who gets penalized for it so that's that's the protection mechanism that blockchain has so moving right along some of the solutions that are available to address the weakest link is the piece where any of the environments for blockchain that have come up they have introduced their own programming language in terms of etherium they've introduced solidity blockchain has introduced script so the biggest issue is these both these languages are pretty new to the developers the developers currently are familiar with with the regular programming languages you know C C sharp C plus Java JavaScript gold language which with Google introduced and as a result of the network effect that these languages have behind them people have been able to produce tools to to to implement secure coding practices there are tools available to do code reviews there are tools available to to do penetration testing from outside to make sure you know certain aspects off of the of the code don't get exploited the coding constructs are all secure they're all hacker-proof so so in spite of the fact that these well-established programming languages have all these tools available we still find issues with them there's still vulnerabilities that get identified and people exploit them so imagine something like something that is as new as you know solidity and script not a lot of people have experience in them plus there's no tools that support them or or understand them so so there's some tools that some some enterprising groups individuals who are dedicated to this cause have come up with one of them is open Zeppelin which introduces some libraries that you can include a new solidity code to check for data import and data manipulation issues so this is readily available to anybody who wants to use it so I'll just include these libraries in your soluti code and execute and it takes care of all the legwork avoid you from writing code to check what's being input and what kind of output you're getting the next team that I want to talk about is a trail of bits these guys by far have had the most input into this secure ecosystem of of blockchain they have come up with a lot of tools you can go to this link over here that will take you to their to their webpage and and they'll walk you through all the all the tools that they have everything that they that they do I won't go through the details of each of these tools but you know they have tools which do static code analysis on on solidity they have a repository that that has all kinds of gotchas that they've come across too that people can learn from and implement in their code there is these two programs that are available that allow you to test your code as you are compiling it as you are according it and create test cases in different scenarios trail of bits also has a tool that allows you to reverse engineer the solidity code from the bytecode as you know when you publish solidity code to to the etherium ecosystem it goes in and it gets converted from solidity solidity into bytecode which is again available on blockchain Explorer if you wanted to but it's not human readable so they have created a tool that that that and they have a bunch of other tools as well again available at the site you can go further and and investigate and check it out the next bunch of tools I might call it is coming from the NCC group and these guys have come up with a with the list they call decentralized application security project top ten lists so this this one again is it's talking about just like trail of bitch has a repository of issues that they've encountered and they would like people to to keep an eye out for these guys the NCC group have done a similar thing where they've made a top ten list just like the Oh ASP top ten list and they've come up with this with this list where would they identify issues examples and and how to address them so if you are putting something together make sure you you do you take a look at this the next tool is called porosity which is again a decompiler just like what trail of bitch has produced it does exactly the same thing it goes in picks up the byte code and you know decompose it into solidity code which you can which you can read and and figure out for yourself so so it makes it easy for somebody to understand what the code is doing rather than relying totally on on github repositories then that was it from the tools perspective the other approaches that some people are taking are I call them shims which is pretty much trying to improve or trying to address the gaps that existing environments pose Ivy is again a language which which is gonna provide Bitcoin script developers with some some high-level better tooling for for coding the next one is is simplicity which has been released by block stream again it is it is one of those similar to similar to Ivy but it provides you that that additional support for assumes EVM then there's there are other approaches where there's digital as a modeling language by elephants which is a financial service industry focus smart contract language and so so there is this niches which which are coming up to support different environments also Microsoft cocoa framework is the one that's trying to introduce governance in in there into the blockchain ecosystem and they're also saying that they they will provide a a network which allows a typical blockchain to scale scale further so Microsoft is also trying to dip their tip to dip their toes into this blockchain ecosystem let's see how far they go and with that guys that's all I had in terms of the blockchain tools I will keep updating this this block pose and maybe I will also make another post with more details as f as I find out in the coming weeks I will also be posting a discussion with with one of my buddies about how you look at blockchain security so we will be presenting two different views one of them would be my view you know things things are normal as they're progressing just what I had written on my blog post on the 8th of April and his view point is going to be the other side of the thing like security impacts on the blockchain what we should be looking out for you know all the other size so it it's gonna make a good good discussion point something good to to listen to and as usual feedback is welcome thank you very much have a nice day bye bye please like subscribe and share the content in your social circles if you want to contact me my contact details are on my website secunoid.com the address is also at the bottom left-hand corner of this the slide deck and finally the information I have shared should not be abused as financial advice so play the cryptocurrency investment game at your own risk and lastly thank you for your time and talk to you soon bye bye
