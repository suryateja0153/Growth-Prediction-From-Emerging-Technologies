 3d printing has gotten pretty popular recently and now some genius has figured out how to 3d print edible sushi yeah they say you can eat that stuff open meal showed off a pixel food printer at South by Southwest and this is what it looks like the company says its digital platform stores precise measurements of different foods like flavor shape color nutrients and even texture I don't know the texture does not look correct there then the custom robotic arm those little pixels and then turns it into this edible gel and then you're supposedly able to eat this I don't think it looks very good but apparently the people who created this say that it doesn't taste was reading an article and they say they haven't quite mastered exactly to get the the precise taste plus it's this gel so the texture as much as they say that robotic arm can recreate the texture it's not exactly gonna be the same of all things you're gonna start off with sushi is a little bit difficult to try to recreate this go with something bit easier a mean quite high marry it exactly like a simple flavor not like multiple flavors mixed together but I say it makes her cool pictures so you know like all those people who post their food on Instagram they'll want to do this for sure Instagram will take we're posting cool photos and videos all day long in our CBS Miami Facebook page
