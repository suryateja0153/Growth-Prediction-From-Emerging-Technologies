 hello and welcome to the first of a series of videos in which I'll be talking you through the basics of a programming language called Python Python is a programming language which boasts simplicity of its instructions and readability of its scripts but forget about all that I picked it because it's easy Pisan has been used in a variety of ways but more notably it's been used for Disney's toontown online doki-doki literature Club read its back end as of 2005 and something to do with NASA you can code in Python using the programming environment called idle this can be downloaded from the Python web site and the best part it's free idle has two ways which we can interact with it script mode in shell mode shell mode allows us to run individual instructions which allows to test out the code or ensure of script mode allows us to chain together multiple instructions as well as save our programs as we develop them you'll get to see us using both of these in this first episode every program - a few weird ones will follow the same basic pattern someday I'll be input the date will be processed and stored and then finally something will be output will start kind of counter intuitively with the output informations given out the program using the print command we can use it like so see those quotes there we'll get to why those are necessary in a future episode for now success without put some information now the input or in Python the put we use this command to gather information from the user of our programs we do it like so straightaway there's a problem here with what we've just done which we'll fix later great we've gathered information from the user but where did I actually go well with the command we've just used the information he was just printed back to the screen to us it wasn't actually stored anywhere this is a bit useless to us because it doesn't actually give us anything to work with programming languages make use of something called variables the tiny little points of memory which we can save information to to create a variable we give it a name and set it using an equals operator we then follow that equals operator with a bit of data that we want to stick inside it on screen now we're creating a variable called name with the information Amba inside it great we can now use this information later on in our program try using this variable with the print statement that we saw before you'll notice that what's printed out isn't actually the name of the variable rather the data that's inside it we now have all the basic information that we need to create a simple program let's move over to script mode and we'll write your own program from scratch just a couple of notes on script mode before we get started each instruction you write will be on its own line you can leave blank lines if you want if it helps you read your code better in order to run your program you can hit f5 or you can go to run at the top this will save any of the work you've done so far and the output will appear in the shell window right under our first program the goal here is to create a program that ask the user for their name and we're to output this information back to them with a little greeting message if you think you know what you're doing and you want to have a go this on your own pause the video now otherwise let's get started now the first thing we'll want to do in this program is ask the user for their name we can do that using the input statement that we looked at before now one thing that we didn't look at before restoring data into a variable from this input statement in order to do this we create our variable as we've done before and then follow it with an equals operator but then we can follow it with the input command what happens here is whatever the user types in will then be passed into our variable because we now have that information stored we can then show it back to them with a little greeting message what we can do here is then print out the message hello and follow that as a plus and then what the plus does is it connects the two messages hello and then whatever they've typed in for their name together now it looks like we're all done we can hit f5 to run it or we can go to the top and select run now this is the part that gets a bit frustrating some of you might be faced with a block of red text this is an error and it's important that you read and understand what each one means as the messages will help you fix any issues in your code each error is made up of a message as well as the line that the error is from the general rule of thumb is that very few decent-size programs will run successfully on the first time and this is fine it's all part of the software development cycle it's very easy to become disheartened but the first step to overcoming these issues is knowing what those error messages mean there are three very common mistakes that most programmers make these are the name error when you've misspelled a function or a variable name remember everything is case-sensitive an EO F or AOL error you haven't closed off a bracket or a quote somewhere and an indentation error Python uses indents determine scope you don't need to know what that means now we'll get to that in a future episode but for now remember to make sure that you haven't added a tab or a space before each of your lines of code with that in mind you should be able to find what's wrong with your code and you'll know how to fix it once you've got your code working try run it again [Music] and there we have it we've created a very simple program using the print command the input command and a variable along the way in the next episode we'll be looking at different types of variables and how they interact with one another but until then remember to practice the skills you've learnt and if you want to do some further reading and head to the one over the websites that I've put on screen the links are also in the description feel free to leave any criticisms or comments that you might have in the comment section below otherwise that's pretty much it thank you all for watching and I'll see you next time [Music]
