 [music plays throughout] The Wyss Institute has developed an innovative approach to fighting cancer. This approach was developed in collaboration with biologists, clinicians, and researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Cancer is able to grow because tumors are made of the patient's own cells which the immune system does not recognize as a threat. The Wyss cancer vaccine technology reprogrammed the immune system to reject these tumor cells. The vaccine  is a spongy porous matrix, approximately the size of a standard aspirin tablet, and is implanted directly under the skin near a lymph node. The vaccine is designed to quickly release the protein granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor into the surrounding tissue, which attracts dendritic cells – a specific type of immune cell – into the vaccine. These immune cells are then re-programmed with fragments  of the tumor cells, along with a signal  mimicking an infection. These activated immune cells then hone to the nearest lymph node, where they train other cells of the immune system to recognize the tumor cells as something dangerous that should be destroyed. Specifically in the lymph node, the activated dendritic cells present tumor cell fragments to certain T-cells of the immune system. These trained T-cells then proliferate. These cytotoxic T-cells circulate throughout the body looking for any of these same tumor cells to attack and destroy. The vaccination  not only could destroy tumor cells, but it could also create  immune memory, which could provide a long-term protection against tumor reoccurence. The vaccine safely degrades over time and is then excreted by the body. With this new technology, we can potentially revolutionize cancer care. [music ends]
