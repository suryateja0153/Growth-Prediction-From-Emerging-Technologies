 It's incredibly important right now for us as a nation to continue to have discussions and debate about numerous issues including public health issues. How do you begin those conversations? How do you begin those debates? Well, you begin by providing people an opportunity to come together in a way that's comfortable for them to interact. For some people that means sitting in a classroom being asked questions, for other people it means going to an art gallery and looking at art. We partnered with Mason Gross to put on this exhibit of public health art because we wanted to demonstrate that we could affect change that is normally done in public health through interventions and programs through art. My piece is inspired by a relative of mine. She had cancer and made me think a lot about health issues and the purpose of my painting is to remind audience that everyone has a choice in lifestyle. My piece is a set of black and white photographs. I like when the subject is looking towards the camera and not off in the distance. It makes them relate to the subject and I think that's like a big important part and reflect on themselves too and about their own family and their grandparents. When we think about how we initiate dialogue, often art provides a very powerful way and sometimes a very safe way for beginning to have very challenging conversations.
