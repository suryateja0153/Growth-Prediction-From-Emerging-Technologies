 Here's the difference between a plain box and a box sealed with Sticker Mule's custom packaging tape. Both hold the same product and serve the same basic purpose. But for an extra $0.10 per box, branded packaging can make a huge impression on your deliveries. Wait, how much? It's around $0.10 extra per box to make full-color, branded packaging over the price of using standard clear, tape. Another benefit of Sticker Mule's custom tape is security. You want whatever you're shipping to stay in its package until it's opened. It typically takes several strips of clear packaging tape to properly secure a box. Meanwhile, our water-activated packaging tape creates a strong bond to your box in just a single pass. And even with multiple strips of standard packaging tape, boxes are still susceptible to theft, while boxes that use our water-activated tape remain tightly sealed. Finally, you need to consider the brand impact. While this is hard to quantify, it's obvious that an unbranded package like this won't have the same impact as a branded package like this. Branding your packaging gives you the chance to make an impression on anyone who sees your box. And if it's done right, your packaging can help add to that sense of joy a customer gets when their order arrives. If you're interested in trying custom packaging tape for your business, you can orders a small, two foot sample for $4 to see and feel the quality in real life. And when you're ready to place a larger order, you can order full-sized rolls using the same artwork with just a few clicks. With easy ordering and fast delivery, Sticker Mule is the internet's favorite place to get custom packaging tape.
