 smallpox was an infectious disease caused by one of two virus variants variola major and variola minor the last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977 and the World Health Organization certified the global eradication of the disease in 1980 the risk of death following contracting the disease was about 30 percent with higher rates among babies often those who survived had extensive scarring of their skin and some were left blind the initial symptoms of the disease included fever and vomiting this was followed by formation of sores in the mouth and a skin rash over a number of days the skin rash turned into characteristic fluid-filled bumps with a dent in the center the bumps then scabbed over and fell off leaving scars the disease used to spread between people or via contaminated objects prevention was by the smallpox vaccine once the disease had developed certain antiviral medication may have helped the origin of smallpox as unknown the earliest evidence of the disease dates back to the 3rd century BC in Egyptian mummies the disease historically occurred in outbreaks in 18th century Europe it is estimated 400,000 people per year died from the disease and one-third of the cases resulted in blindness these deaths included those of four reigning monarchs and a queen consort in the 20th century it is estimated that smallpox resulted in 300 to 500 million deaths as recently as 1967 15 million cases occurred a year Edward Jenner discovered in 1798 that vaccination could prevent smallpox in 1967 the World Health Organization intensified efforts to eliminate the disease smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated the other being rinderpest in 2011 the term smallpox was first used in Britain in the 15th century to distinguish the disease from syphilis which was then known as the great pox other historical names for the disease include pox speckled monster and red plague topic classification there were two clinical forms of smallpox variola major was the severe and most common form with a more extensive rash and higher fever variola minor was a less common presentation and a much less severe disease with historical death rates of 1% or less subclinical asymptomatic infections with variola virus were noted but were not common in addition a form called variola sign erupted young smallpox without rash was seen generally in vaccinated persons this form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or rarely by virus isolation topic signs and symptoms the incubation period between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease was around 12 days once inhaled variola major virus invaded the oral pharyngeal mouth and throat or the respiratory mucosa migrated to regional lymph nodes and began to multiply in the initial growth phase the virus seemed to move from cell to cell but around the 12th day lysis of many infected cells occurred and the virus was found in the bloodstream in large numbers this is called viremia and a second wave of multiplication occurred in the spleen bone marrow and lymph nodes the initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold fever of at least 38 point three degrees Celsius 101 degrees Fahrenheit muscle pain malaise headache and prostration as the digestive tract was commonly involved Masha and vomiting and backache often occurred the prodrome or pre rup t'v stage usually lasted two to four days by days 12 to 15 the first visible lesions small reddish spots called an anthem appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth tongue palate and throat and temperature fell to near normal these lesions rapidly enlarged and ruptured releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva smallpox virus preferentially attacked skin cells causing the characteristic pimples called macules associated with the disease a rash developed on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appeared typically the macules first appeared on the forehead then rapidly spread to the whole face proximal portions of extremities the trunk and lastly to distal portions of extremities the process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours after which no new lesions appear at this point variola major infection could take several very different courses resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the route classification ordinary modified malignant or flat and hemorrhagic historically smallpox had an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent the malignant and hemorrhagic forms were usually fatal topic ordinary 90% or more of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type in this form of the disease by the second day of the rash the macules became raised papules by the third or fourth day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles this fluid became opaque and turbid within 24 to 48 hours giving them the appearance of pustules the so called pustules were filled with tissue debris not pus by the 6th or 7th day all the skin lesions have become pustules between 7 and 10 days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size the pustules were sharply raised typically round tense and firm to the touch the pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin fluids slowly leaked from the pustules and by the end of the second week the pustules deflated and started to dry up forming crusts or scabs by day 16 to 20 scabs had formed over all the lesions which had started to flake off leaving Depok mented scars ordinary smallpox generally produced a discrete rash in which the pustules stood out on the skin separately the distribution of the rash was densest on the face denser on the extremities than on the trunk and on the extremities denser on the distal parts than on the proximal the palms of the hands and soles of the feet were involved in the majority of cases sometimes the blisters merged into sheets forming a confluent rash which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh patients with confluence smallpox often remained ill even after scabs had formed overall the lesions in one case series the case fatality rate in confluence smallpox was 62% topic modified referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people in this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may have been less severe than in the ordinary type there was usually no fever during evolution of the rash the skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolved more quickly were more superficial and may not have shown the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox modified smallpox was rarely if ever fatal this form of variola major was more easily confused with chickenpox topic malignant in malignant type smallpox also called flat smallpox the lesions remained almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles would have formed in the ordinary type it is unknown why some people develop this type historically it accounted for five to ten percent of cases and the majority 72% were children malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted three to four days prolonged high fever and severe symptoms of toxemia the rash on the tongue and palate was extensive skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin unlike ordinary type smallpox the vesicles contained little fluid were soft and velvety to the touch and may have contained hemorrhages malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal hemorrhagic hemorrhagic smallpox was a severe form accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract this form developed in approximately 2% of infections and occurred mostly in adults in hemorrhagic smallpox the skin did not blister but remained smooth instead bleeding occurred under the skin making it look charred and black hence this form of the disease was also known as black pox in the early or fulminating form hemorrhaging appeared on the second or third day as subconjunctival bleeding turned the whites of the eyes deep red hemorrhagic smallpox also produced a dusky erythema petechiae and hemorrhages in the spleen kidney serosa muscle and rarely the epicardium liver testes ovaries in bladder death often occurred suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness when only a few insignificant skin lesions were present a later form of the disease occurred in patients who survived for eight to ten days the hemorrhages appeared in the early eruptive period and the rash was flat and did not progress beyond the vesicular stage patients in the early stage of disease showed a decrease in coagulation factors eg platelets prothrombin and globulin and an increase in circulating antithrombin patients in the late stage had significant thrombocytopenia deficiency of coagulation factors was less severe some in the late stage also showed increased antithrombin this form of smallpox occurred in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the small pox strain hemorrhagic smallpox was usually fatal topic caused smallpox was caused by infection with variola virus which belongs to the genus orthopox virus the family pox for a day and subfamily Korda pox Verena topic evolution the date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled it most likely evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between sixty eight thousand and sixteen thousand years ago the wide range of dates as due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock one clade was the variola major strains the more clinically severe form of smallpox which spread from Asia between 400 and 1600 years ago a second clade included both a lustrum minor a phenotypically mild smallpox described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between one thousand four hundred and six thousand three hundred years before present this clade further diverged into two subclades at least eight hundred years ago a second estimate has placed the separation of very Ola from Tottori pox at three thousand to four thousand years ago this is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding the appearance of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin if the mutation rate is assumed to be similar to that of the herpesviruses the divergence date between variola from Tottori pox has been estimated to be fifty thousand years ago while this is consistent with the other published estimates it suggests that the archaeological and historical evidence is very incomplete better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed examination of a strain that dates from tilde 1650 found that this strain was basal to the other presently sequenced strains the mutation rate of this virus is well modeled by a molecular clock diversification of strains only occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries topic virology variola is a large brick shaped virus measuring approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270 nanometers with a single linear double-stranded DNA genome 186 Killa base pairs kbp in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end the two classic varieties of smallpox are very Ola major and variola minor for orthopox viruses cause infection in humans variola vicini ax kal pox and monkey pox variola virus infects only humans in nature although primates and other animals have been infected in a laboratory setting the Chi Mia cow pox and monkey pox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature the life cycle of Puck's viruses is complicated by having multiple infectious forms with differing mechanisms of cell entry Puck's viruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell rather than in the nucleus in order to replicate Puck's viruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses the most important of which is a viral associated DNA dependent RNA polymerase both enveloped and uninvolved variants are infectious the viral envelope is made of modified Golgi membranes containing viral specific polypeptides including hemagglutinin infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other topic transmission you transmission occurred through inhalation of airborne variola virus usually droplets expressed from the oral nasal or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person it was transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person usually within a distance of 1.8 meters 6 feet but could also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects fomites such as bedding or clothing rarely smallpox was spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings buses and trains the virus can cross the placenta but the incidence of congenital smallpox was relatively low smallpox was not notably infectious in the prodromal period and viral shedding was usually delayed until the appearance of the rash which was often accompanied by lesions in the mouth and pharynx the virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness but this happened most frequently during the first week of the rash when most of the skin lesions were intact infectivity waned in seven to ten days when scabs formed over the lesions but the infected person was contagious until the last smallpox scab fell off smallpox was highly contagious but generally spread more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases perhaps because transmission required close contact and occurred after the onset of the rash the overall rate of infection was also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage in temperate areas the number of smallpox infections was highest during the winter and spring in tropical areas seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year age distribution of smallpox infections depended on acquired immunity vaccination immunity declined over time and was probably lost within 30 years smallpox was not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there was no asymptomatic carrier State topic diagnosis the clinical definition of smallpox as an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than 38 3 degrees Celsius 101 degrees Fahrenheit followed by a rash characterized by firm deep-seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause when a clinical case was observed smallpox was confirmed using laboratory tests microscopically Puck's viruses produced characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions the most important of which are known as Granero bodies and are the sites of viral replication Granero bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin and appear as pink blobs they are found in virtually all pox virus infections but the absence of Granero bodies could not be used to rule out smallpox the diagnosis of an orthopox virus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs all orthopox viruses exhibit identical brick-shaped variants by electron microscopy if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopox virus infections definitive laboratory identification of variola virus involved growing the virus on Koryo alan TOEIC membrane part of a chicken embryo and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions strains were characterized by polymerase chain reaction PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis serologic tests an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay x' elisa which measured variola virus specific immunoglobulin and antigen were also developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection chicken pox was commonly confused with smallpox in the immediate post eradication era chicken pox and smallpox could be distinguished by several methods unlike smallpox chicken pox does not usually affect the palms and soles additionally chicken pox pustules are a varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption small pox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progress is more uniformly a variety of laboratory methods were available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases topic prevention the earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was inoculation known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion which likely occurred in India Africa and China well before the practice arrived in Europe the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century during the Ming Dynasty if successful inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox because the person was infected with variola virus a severe infection could result and the person could transmit smallpox to others variolation had a 0.5 to 2 percent mortality rate considerably less than that 20 to 30 percent mortality rate of the disease two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1701 by dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers Lady Mary Wortley Montagu observed smallpox inoculation during her stay in the Ottoman Empire writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in 1718 in 1721 Cotton Mather and colleagues provoked controversy in Boston by inoculating hundreds in 1796 Edward Jenner a doctor in Berkeley Gloucestershire rural England discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a cow pox lesion cow pox is a pox virus in the same family as variola Jenner called the material used for inoculation vaccine from the root word vaca which is Latin for cow the procedure was much safer than variolation and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world during the 19th century the cow pox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by vicini a virus Virginia is in the same family as cow pox in variola but as genetically distinct from the origin of vicini a virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known according to Voltaire 1740 to the Turks derived their use of inoculation from neighbouring Circassia Voltaire does not speculate on where the circassians derived their technique from though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it these hundred years the current formulation of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vicini a virus the vaccine is given using a bifurcated two pronged needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution the needle is used to prick the skin usually the upper arm a number of times in a few seconds if successful a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days in the first week the bump becomes a large blister called a Jenner and vesicle which fills with pus and begins to drain during the second week the blister begins to dry up into scab forms the scab falls off in the third week leaving a small scar the antibody is induced by Virginia vaccine our cross protective for other orthopox viruses such as monkey pox cow pox and variola smallpox viruses neutralizing antibodies are detectable ten days after first time vaccination and seven days after revaccination historically the vaccine has been effective in preventing smallpox infection in 95% of those vaccinated smallpox vaccination provides a high level of immunity for three to five years in decreasing immunity thereafter if a person is vaccinated again later immunity lasts even longer studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than ten years before exposure was 1.3 percent it was 7 percent among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior and 11 percent among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection by contrast 52 percent of unvaccinated persons died there are side effects and risks associated with the smallpox vaccine in the past about 1 out of 1000 people vaccinated for the first time experienced serious but non-life-threatening reactions including toxic or allergic reaction at the site of the vaccination erythema multiforme spread of the Virginia virus to other parts of the body and to other individuals potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time based on past experience it is estimated that one or two people in million zero point zero zero zero one nine eight percent who received the vaccine may die as a result most often the result of post vicini encephalitis are severe necrosis in the area of vaccination called progressive vicini a' given these risks as smallpox became effectively eradicated and the number of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine induced illnesses and deaths routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the united states in 1972 and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s routine vaccination of health care workers was discontinued in the u.s. in 1976 and among military recruits in 1990 although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the vaccination by 1986 routine vaccinations had ceased in all countries it is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure topic treatment smallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people vaccinations four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease other than vaccination treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive such as wound care and infection control fluid therapy and possible ventilator assistance flattened hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock such as fluid resuscitation people with semi confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns in July 2018 the Food and Drug Administration approved Tico Vermont the first drug approved for treatment of smallpox antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics and studies suggest that the antiviral drug side off of ear might be useful as a therapeutic agent the drug must be administered intravenously and may cause serious kidney toxicity acam2000 as a smallpox vaccine developed by a canvas it was approved for use in the United States by the US FDA on August 31st 2007 it contains live vicini a virus cloned from the same strain used in an earlier vaccine dryvax while the dryvax virus was cultured in the skin of calves and freeze-dried a camp 2000s viruses cultured in kidney epithelial cells vero cells from an African green monkey efficacy and adverse reaction incidents are similar to dr axe the vaccine is not routinely available to the US public it is however used in the military and maintained in the strategic national stockpile topic prognosis the overall case fatality rate for ordinary type smallpox as about 30 percent but varies by Pok distribution ordinary type confluent has fatal about 50 to 75 percent of the time ordinary type semi confluent about 25 to 50 percent of the time in cases where the rash is discrete the case fatality rate is less than 10 percent the overall fatality rate for children younger than one year of age is 40 to 50 percent hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates the fatality rate for flat type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox the case fatality rate for variola minor as 1% or less there is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus in fatal cases of ordinary smallpox death usually occurs between the 10th and 16th days of the illness the cause of death from smallpox is not clear but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs circulating immune complexes overwhelming viremia or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors in early hemorrhagic smallpox death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema in late hemorrhagic cases high and sustained viremia severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death in flat smallpox modes of death are similar to those in burns with loss of fluid protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire in fulminating sepsis topic complications complications of smallpox arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox when this occurs the fever usually remains elevated other complications include encephalitis one in 500 patients which is more common in adults and may cause temporary disability permanent pitted scars most notably on the face and complications involving the eyes 2% of all cases pustules can form on the eyelid conjunctiva and cornea leading to complications such as conjunctivitis keratitis corneal ulcer iritis irid osa cleitus and optic atrophy blindness results in approximately 35% to 40% of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages in two to five percent of young children with smallpox variants reached the joints and bone causing osteomyelitis varial OSA lesions are symmetrical most common in the elbows tibia and fibula and characteristically caused separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions swollen joints limit movement and arthritis may lead to limb deformities ankylosis malformed bones flail joints and stubby fingers topic history topic disease emergence the earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is found in the smallpox like disease in medical writings from ancient India as early as 1500 BC Egyptian mummy of Ramses v who died more than three thousand years ago 1145 BC in China 1122 BC it has been speculated that Egyptian traders brought smallpox to India during the first millennium BC where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least 2,000 years smallpox was probably introduced into China during the 1st century AD from the southwest and in the 6th century was carried from China to Japan in Japan the epidemic of 735 to 745 teen 88 ad and the earlier reported cases were incorrectly identified as smallpox the timing of the arrival of smallpox in Europe and southwestern Asia is less clear smallpox is not clearly described in either the old or New Testaments of the Bible or in the literature of the Greeks or Romans while some have identified the plague of Athens which was said to have originated in Ethiopia and Egypt or the plague that lifted Carthage's 396 BC siege of Syracuse with smallpox many scholars agree it is very unlikely such as serious disease as variola major would have escaped being described by Hippocrates if it had existed in the Mediterranean region during his lifetime while the Antonine plague that swept through the Roman Empire in AD 165 to 180 may have been caused by smallpox Saint Nick asius of Reims became the patron saint of smallpox victims for having supposedly survived about in 450 and st. Gregory of Tours recorded a similar outbreak in France and Italy in 580 the first use of the term variola other historians speculate that Arab armies first carried smallpox from Africa into southwestern Europe during the 7th and 8th centuries in the 9th century Persian physician raises provided one of the most definitive descriptions of smallpox and was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his kitab theology dari wa al hasma the book of smallpox and measles during the Middle Ages smallpox made periodic incursions into Europe but did not become established there until the population increased and population movement became more active during the era of the Crusades by the 16th century smallpox had become well established across most of Europe with its introduction into populated areas in India China and Europe smallpox affected mainly children with periodic epidemics that killed as many as 30 percent of those infected the settled existence of smallpox in Europe was of particular historical importance since successive waves of exploration and colonization by Europeans tended to spread the disease to other parts of the world by the 16th century it had become an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world there are no credible descriptions of smallpox like disease in the Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century ad smallpox was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1509 and into the mainland in 1520 when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico bringing smallpox with them smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was an important factor in the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards settlement of the east coast of North America in 1633 in Plymouth Massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox among Native American populations and subsequently among the native-born colonists case fatality rates during outbreaks in Native American populations were as high as 80 to 90 percent smallpox was introduced into Australia in 1789 and again in 1829 although the disease was never endemic on the continent it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870 by the mid 18th century smallpox was a major endemic disease everywhere in the world except in Australia and in several small islands in Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year up to 10% of Swedish infants died of smallpox each year and the death rate of infants in Russia may have been even higher the widespread use of variolation in a few countries notably Great Britain it's North American colonies and China somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during the latter part of the 18th century but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccinations became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century improved vaccines and the practice of revaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America but smallpox remained almost unchanged or form of smallpox variola minor was recognized just before the close of the 19th century by the mid 20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major in varying proportions in many parts of Africa patients with variola minor experienced only a mild systemic illness are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease and are therefore able to more easily spread disease infection with V minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form thus is V minor spread all over the USA into Canada the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox further reducing mortality rates topic eradication the English physician Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of cow pox to protect humans from smallpox in 1796 after which various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale in Russia in 1796 the first child to receive this treatment was bestowed the name vaccine off by Catherine the Great and was educated at the expense of the nation the introduction of the vaccine to the new world took place in Trinity Newfoundland in 1800 by dr. John clinch boyhood friend and medical colleague of Jenner as early as 1803 the Spanish crown organized the bommies expedition to transport the vaccine to the Spanish colonies in the Americas and the Philippines and establish mass vaccination programs there the US Congress passed the vaccine Act of 1813 to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the American public by about 1817 a very solid state vaccination program existed in the Dutch East Indies in British India a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination through Indian vaccinators under the supervision of European officials nevertheless British vaccination efforts in India and in Burma in particular were hampered by stubborn indigenous preference for inoculation and distrust of vaccination despite tough legislation improvements in the local efficacy of the vaccine and vaccine preservative and education efforts by 1832 the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans in 1842 the United Kingdom banned inoculation later progressing to mandatory vaccinations the British government introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination by an Act of Parliament in 1853 in the United States from 1843 to 1855 first Massachusetts and then other states required smallpox vaccination although some disliked these measures coordinated efforts against smallpox went on and the disease continued to diminish in the wealthy countries in Northern Europe a number of countries had eliminated smallpox by 1900 and by 1914 the incidence in most industrialized countries had decreased to comparatively low levels vaccinations continued in industrialized countries until the mid-to-late 1970s as protection against reintroduction Australia and New Zealand are two notable exceptions neither experienced endemic smallpox and never vaccinated widely relying instead on protection by distance and strict quarantine the first hemisphere wide effort to eradicate smallpox was made in 1950 by the pan-american Health Organization the campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from All American countries except Argentina Brazil Colombia and Ecuador in 1958 professor Victor's addendum Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox the proposal resolution WH a 11.5 for was accepted in 1959 at this point two million people were dying from smallpox every year overall the progress towards eradication was disappointing especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent in 1966 an international team the smallpox eradication unit was formed under the leadership of an American Donald Henderson in 1967 the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing 2.4 million dollars annually to the effort and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech epidemiologist Karol rasca in the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year to eradicate smallpox each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by this process is known as ring vaccination the key to this strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community known as surveillance and containment the initial problem that w-h-o team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities the fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection and that carriers did not exist played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox the w-h-o established a network of consultants who assisted countries in surveillance and containment activities early on donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union in the United States but by 1973 more than 80% of all vaccine was produced in developing countries the last major European outbreak of smallpox was in 1972 in Yugoslavia after a pilgrim from Kosovo returned from the Middle East where he had contracted the virus the epidemic infected 175 people causing 35 deaths authorities declared martial law enforced quarantine and undertook widespread revaccination of the population enlisting the help of the WHL in two months the outbreak was over prior to this there had been a smallpox outbreak in May to July 1963 in Stockholm Sweden brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population by the end of 1975 smallpox persisted only in the Horn of Africa conditions were very difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia where there were few roads civil war famine and refugees made the task even more difficult an intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1972 the direction of Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner as the campaign neared its goal Fenner and his team played an important role in verifying eradication the last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox variola minor was diagnosed in a Lee mal Mullen a hospital cook in America Somalia on the 26th of October 1977 the last naturally occurring case of the more deadly variola major had been detected in october 1975 in a two year-old Bangladeshi girl Rehema Banu the global eradication of smallpox was certified based on intense verification activities in countries by a commission of eminent scientists on the 9th of December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly on the 8th of May 1980 the first two sentences of the resolution read having considered the development and results of the global program on smallpox eradication initiated by w-h-o in 19:58 and intensified since 1967 declares solemnly that the world in its peoples have won freedom from smallpox which was a most devastating disease sweeping an epidemic form through many countries since earliest time leaving death blindness and disfigurement in its wake in which only a decade ago was rampant in Africa Asia and South America topic post eradication the last cases of smallpox in the world occurred in an outbreak of two cases one of which was fatal in Birmingham United Kingdom in 1978 a medical photographer Janet Parker contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on the 11th of September 1978 Professor Henry Benson the scientist responsible for smallpox research at the University killed himself all known stocks of smallpox were subsequently destroyed or transferred to to w-h-o designated reference laboratories with bsl-4 facilities the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Russia's state research center of vie Rolla G and biotechnology vector WH o first recommended destruction of the virus in 1986 and later set the date of destruction to be the 30th of December 1993 this was postponed to the 30th of June 1999 due to resistance from the US and Russia in 2002 the World Health Assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research the stocks are not needed to respond to a smallpox outbreak some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines antiviral drugs and diagnostic tests a 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by w-h-o concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the US and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks the latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community particularly among veterans of the w-h-o smallpox eradication program in March 2004 smallpox scabs were found inside an envelope in a book on civil war medicine in Santa Fe New Mexico the envelope was labeled as containing scabs from a vaccination and gave scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and opportunity to study the history of smallpox vaccination in the United States on July 1st 2014 six sealed glass vials of smallpox dated 1954 along with sample vials of other pathogens were discovered in a cold storage room in an FDA laboratory at the National Institutes of health location in Bethesda Maryland the smallpox vials were subsequently transferred to the custody of the CDC in Atlanta where virus taken from at least two vials proved viable in culture after studies were conducted the CDC destroyed the virus under w-h-o observation on February 24 2015 in 2017 Canadian scientists recreated an extinct horse pox virus to demonstrate that the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab at a cost of about one hundred thousand dollars by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge this makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox is history the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized leading to new regulation questions topic society and culture topic biological warfare the British used smallpox as a biological warfare agent at the siege of Fort Pitt during the French and Indian Wars 1754 to 1763 against France and it's Native American allies the actual use of smallpox had official sanction British officers including the top British commanding generals ordered sanctioned paid for and conducted the use of smallpox against the Native Americans as described by historians there is no doubt that British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy and it was deliberate British policy to infect the Indians with smallpox on the 24th of June 1763 William Trent a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia wrote out of our regard for them we gave them two blankets and an handkerchief out of the smallpox Hospital I hope it will have the desired effect the effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown there are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War 1775 to 1783 according to a theory put forward in Journal of Australian studies Jass by an independent researcher in 1789 British Marines used smallpox against indigenous tribes in New South Wales this occasion was also discussed earlier in Bulletin of the history of Medicine and by David Day in his book claiming a continent a new history of Australia prior to the Jass article this theory was disputed by some academics Jack Carmody claimed the cause of the outbreak in question was more likely due to chickenpox which at the time was sometimes identified as a mild form of smallpox while it was noted that in the eight-month voyage of the First Fleet in the following 14 months there were no reports of smallpox amongst the colonists and that as smallpox has an incubation period of 10 to 12 days it is unlikely it was present in the first fleet it is now known that the likely source was bottles of smallpox virus possessed by First Fleet surgeons and there actually was a report of smallpox amongst the colonists a seaman Jeffries there is circumstantial evidence that smallpox was deliberately introduced to Aboriginal population during World or two scientists from the United Kingdom United States and Japan unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese army were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox plans of large-scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not be very effective due to the wide scale availability of a vaccine in 1947 the Soviet Union established a smallpox weapons Factory in the city of Zagorski 75 kilometers to the northeast of Moscow an outbreak of weaponized smallpox occurred during testing at a facility on an island in the ROC in 1971 general professor peter berg asif former chief sanitary physician of the soviet army and a senior researcher within the soviet program of biological weapons described the incident on Basra's denia island in the RLC the strongest recipes of smallpox were tested suddenly I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in a rash a research ship of the aural fleet came to within 15 kilometers of the island it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 kilometers the lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck the smallpox formulation 400 gr of which was exploded on the island got her and she became infected after returning home to her ouch she infected several people including children all of them died I suspected the reason for this and called the chief of general staff of Ministry of Defence and requested to forbid the stop of the alma mater Moscow train in a rush as a result the epidemic around the country was prevented I called Andropov who at that time was chief of KGB and informed him of the exclusive recipe of smallpox obtained on vas raised in the island others contend that the first patient may have contracted the disease while visiting Julie or come so much on duster to cities where the boat docked responding to international pressures in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint u.s. British inspection team to tour four of its main weapons facilities at bio preparada the inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the Soviet scientists and were eventually ordered out of the facility in 1992 Soviet defector Ken a Lebec alleged that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorski had produced a large stockpile as much as 20 tons of weaponized smallpox possibly engineered to resist vaccines a Lebec further alleged along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it ala Beck's stories about the former Soviet programs smallpox activities have never been independently verified in 1997 the Russian government announced that all of its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the vector Institute in Colts ovale with the breakup of the Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program scientists US government officials have expressed concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use viruses means of biological warfare specific allegations made against Iraq in this respect proved to be mistaken concern has been expressed by some that artificial gene synthesis could be used to recreate the virus from existing digital genomes for use in biological warfare insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related poxviruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus the first step to mitigating this risk it has been suggested should be to destroy the remaining virus stalks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus in 2017 Bill Gates stated that bioterrorism with smallpox could be more dangerous than a nuclear weapon topic notable cases famous historical figures who contracted smallpox include Lakota chief Sitting Bull Ramses v of Egypt the Kang Zi Emperor survived Shunzhi Emperor and tongzi Emperor referred to the official history of China emperor koumei of Japan died of smallpox in 1867 and date masamune of Japan who lost an eye to the disease qui locked the template oh honey ruler of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan died of smallpox in 1520 shortly after its introduction to the Americas and the Incan Emperor huayna Capac died of it in 1527 more recent public figures include guru har Christian eighth guru of the Sikhs in 1664 peter ii of russia in 1730 died George Washington survived King Louis the fifteenth in 1774 died and Maximilian the third Joseph elector of bavaria in 1777 prominent families throughout the world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease for example several relatives of Henry the eighth survived the disease but were scarred by it these include his sister Margaret Queen of Scotland his fourth wife and of Cleves and his two daughters Mary the first of England in 1527 and Elizabeth the first of England in 1562 as an adult she would often try to disguise the pock marks with heavy makeup his great niece Mary Queen of Scots contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring in Europe deaths from smallpox often changed dynastic succession the only surviving son of Henry the eighth Edward the sixth died from complications shortly after apparently recovering from the disease thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne his two immediate successors were both women who had both had it and survived Louis the 15th of France succeeded his great-grandfather louis xiv through a series of deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line he himself died of the disease in 1774 William the third lost his mother to the disease when he was only 10 years old in 1660 and named his uncle Charles his legal guardian her death from smallpox would directly sparked a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent asting of the Stuart line from the British throne William the thirds wife Mary ii of england died from smallpox as well in russia peter ii of russia died of the disease at fifteen years of age also prior to becoming Russian Emperor Peter the third caught the virus and suffered greatly from it he was left scarred and disfigured his wife Catherine the Great was spared but fear of the virus clearly had its effects on her she feared for her son and heir Pavel safety so much that she made sure that large crowds were kept at bay and sought to isolate him eventually she decided to have herself inoculated by a Scottish doctor Thomas Dimmesdale while this was considered a controversial method at the time she succeeded her son pavel was later inoculated as well Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her empire stating my objective was through my example to save from death the multitude of my subjects who not knowing the value of this technique and frightened of it were left in danger by 1800 approximately two million inoculations were administered in the Russian Empire in China the Qing Dynasty had extensive protocols to protect Manchus from P Kings endemic smallpox US presidents George Washington Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln all contracted and recovered from the disease Washington became infected with smallpox on a visit to Barbados in 1751 Jackson developed the illness after being taken prisoner by the British during the American Revolution and though he recovered his brother Robert did not Lincoln contracted the disease during his presidency possibly from his son tad and was quarantined shortly after giving the Gettysburg Address in 1863 famous theologian Jonathan Edwards died of smallpox in 1758 following an inoculation Soviet leader Joseph Stalin fell ill with smallpox at the age of seven his face was badly scarred by the disease he later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent and garyun poet Firenze cokcy who wrote the hungarian national anthem lost his right eye to smallpox topic tradition and religion in the face of the devastation of smallpox various smallpox gods and goddesses have been worshipped throughout parts of the old world for example in China and in India in China the smallpox goddess was referred to as - xiang niang niang Chinese believers actively worked to appease the goddess and pray for her mercy by such measures as referring to smallpox pustules as beautiful flowers as a euphemism intended to avert offending the goddess for example the Chinese word for smallpox as tianhua literally heaven flower in a related New Year's Eve custom it was prescribed that the children of the house where ugly masks while sleeping so as to conceal any beauty and thereby avoid attracting the goddess who would be passing through sometime that night if a case of smallpox did occur shrines would be set up in the homes of the victims to be worshiped and offered to as the disease ran its course if the victim recovered the shrines were removed and carried away in a special paper chair or boat for Berney if the patient did not recover the shrine was destroyed and cursed so as to expel the goddess from the house india's first records of smallpox can be found in a medical book that dates back to AD 400 this book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox India like China created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox the Hindu goddess Chautala was both worshipped and feared during her reign it was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered as well as calm the fever's of the already afflicted portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease in a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims shrines were created where many Indian natives both healthy and not went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease some Indian women in an attempt to ward off Chautala placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes in cultures that did not recognize a smallpox deity there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons who were accordingly blamed for the disease such beliefs were prominent in Japan Europe Africa and other parts of the world nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed it was afraid of the color red this led to the invention of so-called red treatment where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red the practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by among others Charles v of France and Elizabeth the first of England afforded scientific credibility through the studies by FinCEN showing that red light reduced scarring this belief persisted even until the 1930s topic see also list of epidemics population history of indigenous peoples
