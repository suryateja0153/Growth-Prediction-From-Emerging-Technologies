 Alexis Carl French Alex ikaw the 28th of June 1873 - the 5th of November 1944 was a French surgeon and biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine in 1912 for pioneering vascular suturing techniques he invented the first perfusion pump with Charles a Lindbergh opening the way to organ transplantation like many intellectuals of his time he promoted eugenics he was a regent for the French foundation for the study of human problems during Vichy France which implemented the eugenics policies there his association with the foundation and with Jacques doriot ultra-nationalist party populaire francais led to investigations of collaborating with the Nazis but he died before any trial could be held he faced media attacks towards the end of his life over his alleged involvement with the Nazis a Nobel Prize laureate in 1912 Alexis Karl was also elected twice in 1924 and 1927 as an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR topic biography born in st. Foy les Lyon Rhone Carl was raised in a devout Catholic family and was educated by Jesuits though he had become an agnostic by the time he became a university student he was a pioneer in transplantology and thoracic surgery Alexis Carl was also a member of learned societies in the u.s. Spain Russia Sweden the Netherlands Belgium France Vatican City Germany Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from Queens University of Belfast Princeton University California New York Brown University in Columbia University in 1902 he was claimed to have witnessed the miraculous cure of Marie by yet Lourdes made famous in part because she named Carl as a witness of her cure after the notoriety surrounding the event Carl could not obtain a hospital appointment because of the pervasive anti-clericalism in the french university system at the time in 1903 he emigrated to montreal canada but soon relocated to Chicago Illinois to work for home laboratory while there he collaborated with American physician Charles Claude Guthrie in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the head and Carl was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or medicine for these efforts in 1906 he joined the newly formed Rockefeller Institute of medical research in New York where he spent the rest of his career there he did significant work on tissue cultures with pathologist Montrose Thomas Burroughs in the 1930s Carl and Charles Lindbergh became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal political and social views Lindbergh initially sought out Carl to see if his sister-in-laws heart damaged by rheumatic fever could be repaired when Lindbergh saw the crudeness of Carl's machinery he offered to build new equipment for the scientist eventually they built the first perfusion pump an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open-heart surgery Lindbergh considered Carl his closest friend and said he would preserve and promote Carl's ideals after his death due to his close proximity with Jacque Dorian's fascist party populaire francais PPF during the 1930s and his in implementing eugenics policies during Vichy France he was accused after the liberation of collaboration but died before the trial in his later life he returned to his Catholic roots in 1939 he met with Trappist monk alexis press on the recommendation although karl was skeptical about meeting with a priest press ended up having a profound influence on the rest of Karl's life in 1942 he said I believe in the existence of God in the immortality of the soul in Revelation and in all the Catholic Church teaches he's some impressed to administer the Catholic sacraments on his deathbed in November 1944 for much of his life Karl and his wife spent their summers on the Ile Sainte Gilda's which they owned after he and Lindbergh became close friends Karl persuaded him to also buy a neighboring Island the Ile iliac where the Lindbergh's often resided in the late 1930s soppec contributions to science topic vascular suture carl was a young surgeon in 1894 when the French president sadi carnot was assassinated with a knife carnot bled to death due to severing of his portal vein and surgeons who treated the president felt that the vein could not be successfully reconnected this left a deep impression on Carl and he said about developing new techniques for suturing blood vessels the technique of triangulation using three stay sutures as traction points in order to minimize damage to the vascular wall during suturing was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroidery and is still used today Julius Kimura wrote between 1901 and 1910 Alexis Carl using experimental animals performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today he had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins and performing surgical grafts and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912 wound antisepsis during World War one 1914 to 1918 Karl in the English chemist Henry Drysdale Dakin developed the Karl Dakin method of treating wounds based on chlorine Daken solution which preceding the development of antibiotics was a major medical advance in the care of traumatic wounds for this Karl was awarded the lygian bonheur organ transplants Karl co-authored a book with famed pilot Charles a Lindbergh the culture of organs and worked with Lindbergh in the mid 1930s to create the perfusion pump which allowed living organs to exist outside the body during surgery the advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of open heart surgery and organ transplants and to have laid the groundwork for the artificial heart which became a reality decades later some critics of Lindbergh claimed that Karl overstated Lindbergh's rolled to gain media attention but other sources say Lindbergh played an important role in developing the device both Lindbergh and Karl appeared on the cover of Time magazine on June 13 1938 pick cellular senescence carl was also interested in the phenomenon of senescence or aging he claimed that all cells continued to grow indefinitely and this became a dominant view in the early 20th century Carl started an experiment on January 17th 1912 where he placed tissue cultured from an embryonic chicken heart in a Stoppard Pyrex flask of his own design he maintained the living culture for over 20 years with regular supplies of nutrient this was longer than a chicken's normal lifespan the experiment which was conducted at the Rockefeller Institute for medical research attracted considerable popular and scientific attention Carl's experiment by some was never successfully replicated and in the 1960s Leonard hayflick and Palmer had proposed that differentiated cells can undergo only a limited number of divisions before dying this is known as the hayflick limit and is now a pillar of biology l hayflick has shown that a cell has a limited number of divisions equal to the so called hey flicks limit however L francs and others Lou at all 1987 Newton and Thompson 1995 Focus 1 9 8 8 a have shown that the number of cell divisions can be considerably greater than that stipulated by the hayflick limit having practically no limit at all it is not certain how Carl obtained his anomalous results Leonard hayflick suggests that the daily feeding of nutrient was continually introducing new living cells to the alleged immortal culture Jay a Witkowski has argued that while immortal strains of visibly mutated cells have been obtained by other experimenters a more likely explanation as deliberate introduction of new cells into the culture possibly without Carl's knowledge topic honors in 1972 the Swedish post office honored Carl with a stamp that was part of its noble stamp series in 1979 the lunar crater Carl was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs in February 2002 as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's birth the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston established the Lindbergh Carl prize given to major contributors to development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth Michael DeBakey and nine other scientists received the prize a bronze statuette to created for the event by the Italian artists easel Ian named Elizabeth after Elizabeth Morrow sister of Lindbergh's wife Anne Morrow who died from heart disease it was in fact Lindbergh's disappointment that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her that led to Lindbergh first contact with Carl topic Alexis Karl landlords in 1902 Alexis Karl went from being a skeptic of the visions and miracles reported at Lourdes to being a believer in spiritual cures after experiencing a healing of Marie body that he could not explain the Catholic journal lanova least reported that she named him as the prime witness of her cure Alexis Karl refused to discount a supernatural explanation and steadfastly reiterated his beliefs even writing a book describing his experience though it was not published until four years after his death this was a detriment to his career and reputation among his fellow doctors and feeling he had no future in academic medicine in France he emigrated to Canada with the intention of farming and raising cattle after a brief period he accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago and two years later at the Rockefeller Institute of medical research topic man the unknown 1935 1939 in 1935 Karl published a book titled lump said in canoe man the unknown which became a best-seller in the book he attempted to outline a comprehensive account what is known and more importantly unknown of the human body and human life in light of discoveries in biology physics and medicine to elucidate problems of the modern world and to provide possible routes to a better life for human beings for Karl the fundamental problem was that mn cannot follow modern civilization along its present course because they are degenerating they have been fascinated by the beauty of the sciences of inert matter they have not understood that their body and consciousness are subjected to natural laws more obscure than but as inexorable as the laws of the sidereal world neither have they understood that they cannot transgress these laws without being punished they must therefore learn the necessary relations of the cosmic universe of their fellow man and of their inner selves and also those of their tissues in their mind indeed man stands above all things should he degenerate the beauty of civilization and even the grandeur of the physical universe would vanish humanity's attention must turn from the machines of the world of inanimate matter to the body and the soul of man to the organic and mental processes which have created the machines and the universe of Newton and Einstein Korail advocated in part that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals and by incorporating eugenics into the social framework he argued for an aristocracy springing from individuals of potential writing we must single out the children who are endowed with high potentialities and develop them as completely as possible and in this manner give to the nation the non hereditary aristocracy such children may be found in all classes of society although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others the descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities these qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration but this degeneration is often superficial it comes chiefly from education idleness lack of responsibility and moral discipline the sons of very rich men like those of criminals should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings thus separated from their family they could manifest their hereditary strength in the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality the issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct the laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords it is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination courage and judgment of the heroes of the French or Russian revolutions of the high-handed businessmen who live among us might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority as we know criminality is not hereditary if not United with feeble mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects high potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest intelligent hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers who have failed in business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries however from such people sometimes spring artists poets adventurers Saints a brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon Karl advocated the use of gases to rid humanity of defectives thus endorsing the scientific racism discourse his endorsement of this idea began in the mid 1930s prior to the Nazi implementation of such practices in Germany in the 1936 German introduction of his book at the publishers request he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages tee-hee german government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective the mentally diseased and the criminal the ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous for the insane and the criminal he endorsed the use of gassing for euthanasia t he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip or some more scientific procedure followed by a short stay in hospital would probably suffice to ensure order those who have murdered robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun kidnapped children despoiled the poor of their savings mislead the public in important matters should be humanely and economically disposed of in small youth and assic institutions supplied with proper gaseous a similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane guilty of criminal acts otherwise he endorsed voluntary positive eugenics he wrote we have mentioned that natural selection has not played its part for a long while that many inferior individuals have been conserved through the efforts of Hygiene and medicine but we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies the only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the week is to develop the strong our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless we should then turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit by making the strong still stronger we could effectively help the weak for the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite instead of levelling organic and mental inequalities we should amplify them and construct greater men he continued the progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence modern society must therefore allow to all a certain stability of life a home a garden some friends children must be reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents it is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer the artisan the artist the professor and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians possessing nothing but their hands are their brains the development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of industrial civilization it has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense it is destroying the remains of culture all forms of the proletariat must be suppressed each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family marriage must cease be only a temporary union the union of man and woman like that of the higher anthropoids ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection the laws relating to education and especially to that of girls to marriage and divorce should above all take into account the interest of children women should receive a higher education not in order to become doctors lawyers or professors but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings the free practice of eugenics could lead not only to the development of stronger individuals but also of strains endowed with more endurance intelligence and courage these strains should constitute an aristocracy from which great men would probably appear modern society must promote by all possible means the formation of better human stock no financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who through the wisdom of their marriage would end gender geniuses the complexity of our civilization is immense no one can master all its mechanisms however these mechanisms have to be mastered there is need today of men of larger mental and moral size capable of accomplishing such a task the establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eugenics would be an important step toward the solution of our present problems topic French foundation for the study of human problems in 1937 Carl joined gene Kouta centered at UD's des problèmes humaines coutras aim was to develop what he called an economic humanism through collective thinking in 1941 through connections to the cabinet of Vichy France president Philippe Peten specifically French industrial physicians Andre grosse and Jacques monetary er he went on to advocate for the creation of the Fondation France s poor lated des problèmes humaines French foundation for the study of human problems which was created by decree of the Vichy regime in 1941 and where he served as regent the foundation was at the origin of the October eleventh 1946 law enacted by the provisional government of the French Republic GPR F which institutionalized the field of occupational medicine it worked on demographics Robert guessing Paul Vincent Jean bourgeois chat on economics Francois Peru on nutrition Jean Sutter on habitation gene roulette and on the first opinion polls jean stoats all the foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of Finance and public health it was given financial autonomy and a budget of 40 million francs roughly one franc per inhabitant a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German occupation on the nation's resources by way of comparison the whole centre National de la recherche Scientifique CNRS was given a budget of 50 million francs the foundation made many positive accomplishments during its time yet it was also behind the origin of the December 16 1942 act inventing the prenuptial certificate which had to precede any marriage and was supposed after a biological examination to ensure the good health of the spouses in particular in regard to sexually transmitted diseases STD and life hygiene sick the Institute also conceived the scholar book leave race coal air which could be used to record students grades in the French secondary schools and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance according to Glenn Terran whare writing in eugenics in France 1913 to 1941 a review of research findings the foundation was a pleura disciplinary center that employed around 300 researchers mainly statisticians psychologists physicians from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944 after the liberation of Paris Carl was suspended by the Minister of Health he died in November 1944 but the foundation itself was purged only to reappear in a short time as the institut national de tuesday ma graphics I and II D that is still active quote although Carl himself was dead most members of his team did move to the I
