 This is the first CommonSense Robotics micro-fulfillment-center. It is operated by hundreds of robots, fulfills thousands of orders every single day, and delivers over ten thousand different types of products to online customers around it. Up until today, robotic fulfillment centers take up anywhere between the size of 4 football fields to about 20 football fields, and you just can't fit that into a city. our first site, the site that we are in, is actually one tenth of a football field in size. In order to fit our site into small, tight urban spaces, we've designed every single element of it, to optimize our space efficiency. We have hundreds of robots of different types, traveling in all directions, whether it is on the ground or on the shelving units, and they can meet each other anywhere on the map, and that really enables us to fulfill the full set of what's needed for a grocery basket, out of this site. A typical order would take less than 5 minutes to fulfill end-to-end. So, 5 minutes from the moment the consumer places that order online, to the moment that that order is ready for dispatch, and goes to delivery. So, our vision for the future is actually a network of micro-fulfillment-centers, in the centers of cities, that support each other and enable us to move things faster and more accurately. When you order groceries online, you would get these groceries in less than one hour, to your doorstep. As simple as that.
