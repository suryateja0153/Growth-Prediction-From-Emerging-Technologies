 this is one of the many examples of creative innovative research and inventions happening at UT here in Austin and we've been talking about it all week Jay Wallace joins us now here with the final installment of our really interesting stereo series but this one's on robots rights right well you know I've on as robots start to little by little be implemented in companies and businesses we need to know how to interact with them and robots need to know how to interact with us and that's why thanks to the work from some aspiring Mechanical Engineers they are discovering some answers to these questions in a safe and smart way for the output of a series elastic actuator robots aren't science fiction for these UT students this is try keep the students are hoping to unlock answers about the future potential of robots how should a robot react when the robot comes in contact with the person will have to consider all the interactions that are possible once you have multiple robots in multiple humans in the same place people interacting with robots every day is just around the corner she's our friendliest humanoid robot dreamer here is friendly but also versatile we've worked on trying to do some kind of borderline psychology studies with the head and the eye motion but the group's product with the biggest potential has a rhythm to it basically it has the functions of the human leg mercury might only have a lower half but he could end up helping all of us as we start to live longer we're gonna have a lot of people unable to move the same ways that they did it in the young years and those need support for mobility professor Luis Sanchez help these students imagine build and tweak these robots but the process here is completely different he's much more creative that's what we're looking for his students do have goals with their research but not guidelines he leaves the students a lot of freedom and totally willing to talk about abstract philosophical questions which helped PhD student grade Thomas pursue an idea that is letting him work with NASA that just worked that perfectly perfectly for Thomas but planned by professor Cintas who hopes to see his students become more than just engineers in that they accomplish their dreams they become leaders they become creative thinkers so we mentioned this groups research connected to what NASA is working on well these students are also working with our Navy helping them improve their vessels that they deploy out in the water and you know you heard them kind of talk about the freedom to explore their ideas through their research and you know sometimes you go work for companies you get an idea or something you need to work on and you have to focus on that well in these research environments they get to explore whatever they want to so many things you know you could use robots for anything let's just hope not news anchors or reporters right I mean we need to get these monson ality yeah yeah they don't do robots have a personality and if they don't which obviously they don't then maybe we can keep our job there we go we're doing all right I think we're doing okay we got one up on them
