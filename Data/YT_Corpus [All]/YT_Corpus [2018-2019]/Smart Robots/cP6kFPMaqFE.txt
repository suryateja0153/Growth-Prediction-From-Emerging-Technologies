 This device first and foremost adapts to what's around it. It's smart, intelligent. I was in a car wreck, lost my foot, they put it back on. I went through a lifetime of surgeries and finally had it amputated. This actually moves the foot for you. As you step, it will pick it up so you don't drag the ground. And when it contacts the ground, it can resist movement, and adapt and conform to the ground surface. This whole idea of discomfort, whole idea of instability just goes away with this device. And it feels good, feels really good.
