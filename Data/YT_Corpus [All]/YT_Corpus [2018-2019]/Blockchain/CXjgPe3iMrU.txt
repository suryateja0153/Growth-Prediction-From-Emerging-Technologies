 Blockchain is a database of ledgers, or blocks, spread across multiple computers. Each block contains a set of codes called hashes, which keep the blocks in sync. Every time a new entry is introduced, a new hash is created. Once it is verified, the new entry is accepted by all computers. This network of ledgers is what makes blockchain secure. Tampering with just one block, or one computer, has no effect. For perspectives on this topic, click the links provided.
