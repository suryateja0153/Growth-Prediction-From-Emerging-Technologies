 the very fact that you're actually sitting to today or having this panel is very exciting to me because the very premise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies it's a decentralized systems with no central authority that self-governing it does not need any regulation and because it would regulate on its own and lo and behold you're here looking at what's happening in the world and looking at Jesse's nose it was interesting that he had crossed out and the price of Bitcoin and a bunch of times apparently so the volatility animal is quite interesting but in essence I think it's a very exciting time to be interested in finance and entrepreneurship and technology because now you're beginning to see the convergence on a number of factors and realms and industries coming together allowing us to do things that we couldn't do before the solution of digital currency is nothing new we have projects companies the startups papers going back all the way to the 80s that were discussing this very issues and I some of my good colleagues and friends on the venture capital world have been investing in digital currencies in the 80s and the 90s but they all had the fundamental challenge and that is they all required a central place a central authority to issue monitor manage this new currency and if you are in financial services trust is probably the most important thing you could possibly think of or want to do because if I issue a currency and I want I want to see widespread adoption the question is well Who am I till he should how could I trust you so lo and behold back in 2008 almost any ten years ago we had this various nine page paper really nothing you know extraordinary in terms of the length of the paper but d-plex order in terms of the technical and tech and engineering achievement of by Satoshi Nakamoto whether is a he/she or a group of people we don't know so I'll be referring to Satoshi by he or she is of interchangeably so and that was you know probably one of the most interesting developments in the field of financial technology and digital currencies because of the first time ever Satoshi was able to bring together a series of developments of advancements and inventions from a variety of different realms and be able to add truly remarkable and unique elements of his own to create a system ie blockchain that in essence is a way for you to keep track of ownership of digital assets in an immutable unchangeable way that's fully transparent and does not require any central authority to manage it the system up gets updated and managed by the community as a whole so in essence that's what blockchain is and leverages a variety of as I mentioned a variety of different tools and techniques from you know public private key encryption to mining and and hashing and so on and so forth to enable this model to work now my humble theory is that once the toshi developed this methodology this blockchain you figure about I need to come up with a good use case for it and he thought about let's develop a currency you know there's someone that shall go unnamed is famous for saying that if you want to become rich you should develop your own religion because you get tax-free treatment from the federal government I think you're at developing your own cryptocurrency digital currency to to that list as well so so that's how Bitcoin came about and and obviously I hope that you know everyone in this room understands that Bitcoin and blockchain are not the same thing unfortunately you know even the media sometimes gets it wrong or average person might think you are the same and they can use them interchangeably that's not the case blockchain has a variety of different applications and you know there are lots of different definitions for it depending whether you're a pissed or not you know I'm trying to use the most you know easily understood terminology to describe it hopefully here everyone have had some kind of exposure to - to what it is in the past but the notion of its use in the realm of finance is just one is small Specht of it with blockchain we could do a variety of things and things that we couldn't do before for example I give you an example I was actually quite quite interested in the field of energy so in the past imagine me living in a suburban house out in Texas and just a family of two and we decided to put solar panels on our on the roof of our house so Texas is kind of nice and sunny and you know certain days after of the of the year we are producing more energy that I'm actually getting off the grid so I'm actually using me you know giving back to the grid so I get paid for it the other days if I'm using more than I produce I'm using electricity on the grid so I have to pay the utility but the notion is that whenever I sell back to the utility I'm selling at a wholesale price which is fairly low now imagine my neighbor family of you know poor but in a much larger house saying you know setup does the same but in you realize that they're just within the two of us we could trade electricity produced by solar panels before we even sell it to the utility and we can come up with a better price I can sell it at a higher price and wholesale and the person get buying it from it would be cheaper than the retail they get from utility now you can extrapolate this across you know 500 or a thousand community of subdivision and you realize that oh wow for the first time ever I can trade electricity usage produced by let's say solar panels across the community and it's all done through algorithms so no human input involved and you can easily keep track of everything and who gets paid and who gets who has to pay and you can set the price down to minutes or seconds if you will so you know the middle of the afternoon you try and charge more in the middle of a night problem if you have a battery you can contribute back and charge less and so on and so forth so in so doing all of this imagine trying to do this by hand is impossible the army of people walking around and looking at all the meters and so on of a blockchain allows us to do it.make credibly cheaply and incredibly fast without much human input so just as one tiny example of it and in many many other use cases that we can nowadays not only create but monetized and more importantly when it comes to inventions that require a group of people of coming together creating a community and be able to leverage the use case for something without having a network effect first you know something like Facebook obviously now one today when it comes to social social network but before there were many others and variety of reasons Facebook become the first and the first big win and the only way but the only people that contributed to the success of Facebook I don't think are getting much monetary value out of it I mean all of you are contributing data and making in a Facebook successful and the more of you joined the more useful Facebook becomes but the you know the the monetary reward doesn't go to you whereas imagine with Facebook was built on something like a blockchain the exact opposite would come true so at any rate that's how you know the the impact of blockchain is it's getting us all of us you know the technologies and the financier and the economists all excited but you could never under mind a human ingenuity for good and bad it is again my humble belief that the ways nakamoto imagined bitcoin as it you know currency i better be able to discuss whether it is truly a currency ie something that would enable you to trade or is it a store of value something that just meant to store value I think a Bitcoin as a bit of identity crisis you know depending who you talk to you get a different definition and definitely the panel would address that point later on but you know you look at how the Bitcoin itself has gone from a truly decentralized system to morphing towards centralized in which certain groups whether they are miners and so on are you know tend to have more power than they then they should or the fact that how the fundamentals are the way has been built is being used for not so great purposes but again that's just a very tiny part of it professor beleve who's a computer science professor and cybersecurity specialist at Columbia has an interesting way of describing Bitcoin and that is an experiment that got out of the lab too soon if you look at the development of it that the way it came about I can see that point I agree with that but that this does not detract all the height that you see you know obviously all the price volatility and so on does not detract from the actual value and the potential of blockchain first and foremost and and Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies or digital tokens because the distinction between the two which we come to hopefully later on should not detract from the actual potential and yes you know I do believe we live in a bubble and bubbles are almost impossible to see one you are in their midst they are only the only visible you know in hindsight so I do believe you're a bit of a hype and a bubble and about that again and there's some time some winners some losers but that doesn't detract from the actual value that has a alluded to before and one a small ass analogy right before I pass it on is that if you know for those of you who remember the equities market or the internet bubble of a late 90s you know a lot of people knew that in living in a bubble and there were a lot of companies that came to be that had no right to be to exist and many of them no longer are around and some of those that are around never achieved the stock price that they achieved back in the 90s an example Akamai Akamai you know at some point traded I believe close is $400 or so but nowadays is never it's not even close to that number so could you say that the market was overvalued within that in a time period absolutely but there were certain gems that you know I think all of us would kill to go back in time a buyer of those stories of Amazon would you or your Amazon was overvalued in 99 perhaps not so the gems will emerge from this very dynamic and very interesting field that we are kind of seeing happening but from a technology perspective or financial perspective and that begging begs the question that you know how to stomachs to what extent and how should the regulator's be involved and the very fact and now you're entering realms in which technology is it's kind of touching pretty much every industry nowadays but the specialty required to understand the intricacies of a cryptocurrencies lose beyond the traditional role of regulators in which they were experts in finance of commodities and so on and so forth so how does that interplay come about which I hope would be most of the topics we'll be discussing at this at this panel
