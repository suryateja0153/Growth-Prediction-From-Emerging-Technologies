 Abyssal Vision in Depth Abyssal OS is a 3D digital platform combining an ecosystem of applications that provide value-added benefits in every phase of a project. This network of applications paves the way for a truly digital asset life cycle management. From offshore management of subsea and top-side operations to remote onshore monitoring, this platform accomplishes an holistic view of all operations with real-time tracking and communication to a fast and more informed decision-making process. New digital technologies combined with data-driven insights transform operations, boosting agility and strategic decision making. The Abyssal OS is used throughout the entire project lifecycle. From Design and Engineering, Construction, Operations, to Decommissioning. All data is maintained and securely accessible throughout the life of field and across all applications. Abyssal Designer is an engineering tool specifically developed for the Design and Engineering phases of a capital project. Abyssal Designer provides engineers with an enhanced 3D digital view, with accurate GIS positioning and contextualized data of the subsea environment. It provides tools for the user to easily make changes in the 3D field layout design, to perform accurate feasibility studies and reliable risk assessments, and to create and improve operational procedures. All within a digital platform that allows teams to work from any location in a truly collaborative way. Abyssal Simulator is a next generation 3D rendering engine with physics simulation. Seamlessly integrated with a geographical information system, allowing the use of virtual scenarios driven by real-world information. Users can perform virtual system integration tests while planning procedures, determine the feasibility of subsea tooling procedures and perform accessibility and maneuverability studies. ROV pilots and crew can train procedures in each of the simulation scenarios improving operational efficiency. Engineers can perform constructability reviews and identify opportunities  for increased efficiency. The Abyssal OS offshore is a real-time monitoring navigation and management tool for offshore operations. Based on 3D visualization, GIS and Augmented Reality technology, it provides operators with a complete 3D overview of the operations environment, increasing their overall visibility and spatial awareness. The real-time visualization  of the 3D scenario, coupled with the augmented reality feature, improves safety and efficiency in navigation, and eliminates the down time due to low visibility. The ability to create virtual flight paths and virtual safety areas enhances real-time communication and collaboration, reducing risk and increasing response times. The entire operation can be managed by visualizing in real-time the position of field assets, temporary structures ROVs and vessels, providing a Common Operational Picture and allowing efficient and safe Simultaneous Operations. Additional features like the advanced Video Recording System, Digital Dive Logs and instant Reports, allows Engineers, Pilots and Supervisors to focus their time on value added tasks, reducing overall operational time. The Abyssal OS Command Center is an onshore 3D Monitoring System designed for operators to track and monitor in 3D and in real-time operations and assets worldwide, providing a common operational picture. The solution is an office based SIMOPS (Simultaneous Operations Management tool). The Abyssal Command Center provides onshore selected personnel with a real 3D overview of the entire operations environment, increasing their overall knowledge of the operation and allowing them to make informed decisions either in complex interventions, in emergency response, or in routine operations. The Abyssal applications are connected through a Cloud infrastructure. This system can also read and integrate relevant data from third party platforms such as Imagery, 3D, GIS  and Documentation Systems. Fully web-based functionality will be available in any compatible browser providing Abyssal's Engineering and Operational applications to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
