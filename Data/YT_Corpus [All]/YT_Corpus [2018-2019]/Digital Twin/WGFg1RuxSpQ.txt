 My research is about predicting maintenance under limited data availability I'm using the IfM as a case study because we managed to develop an internet of things capability platform within the IfM to collect data from the machines in the plant room and also data from the machines in the workshops. So what you can see in here is a setup that we have used. For example we have sensors, gateways and also wireless controllers and also we are using single board computers for example Raspberry Pi's, and in here you can see the live data coming from the pumps and we are using this sensor, basically it is attached on top of a pump and it is sending data and we are capturing that real-time data in here and what you can see in here is a historical data. Actually, we managed to capture boiler failure last month from this trend as you can see here. So in terms of the business benefits of this research, manufacturers are spending a lot of money due to redundant maintenance and those are false alarms but if they can have these predictive capabilities in order to predict failures they can go to a zero downtime production.
