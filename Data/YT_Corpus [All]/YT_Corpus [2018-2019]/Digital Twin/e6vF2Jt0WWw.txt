 [dramatic musical intro]   Love a musical   -  What will they sing?   -Ugh! [sighs] -Whatcha doing, Tom? -Nothing. I've got the day off, and I'm going to enjoy some peace and-- Loudness! [both] Huh? Anyone at the theater fears that the singing will be too loud. But fear not, thanks to my new Ear Bags. -[klaxon blasts] -[Tom] Ow. -Ow! -[hollering] We can test these out at the musical tonight, but we've still got a lot of work to do. Ben, I need this day off. You had a day off last month when you had that fever. -I went to the hospital! -So you travelled. Here's a list of stuff to get at the hardware store. Tom, you need to help me buy snacks for the big musical tonight. If you think you're going to the grocery store before you go bow-tie shopping-- Please! Could everyone stop bugging me for two seconds? I can't even think straight with all of you--   Tonight we're headed to a musical show     But first there's places Tom's got to go   [wails] Ginger, please stop making up musical-style songs. We'll get plenty of that tonight, after Tom helps with the Ear Bags. -And the snacks! -And the bow-tie! Ugh. [muttering] I can't believe it. This is supposed to be my day off. I'm supposed to spend the day with- -[both] Agh! -...myself?   Wa-oah!   So you look exactly like me and your name is also Tom? It's Tim, but close enough! How have we not run into each other before? I'm just passing through, you see. I work at the carnival. [gasp] Wow. That... is... the coolest thing I have ever heard! -[chuckles] -What do you do? All I do is operate my own tech company and act as manager for my famous singer girlfriend. Bleugh. Haha. Hey, here's a crazy idea. What if... Nah. Never mind. Nothing's too crazy when you're talking to... a mirror. -Hm! -[both laugh] Okay, what if you and me trade lives, just for one day? No one would be able to tell us apart, and we'd both get a break from the things we're sick of. Ha! That idea is so brilliant I wish I came up with it! What are you talking about, Tim? You did come up with that idea. -Huh? -Oh... [screaming] Ah! Wow, this is really peaceful. [screaming] Except for that roller coaster. Still, I could get used to this. Hm. [humming] Hey, Ben. I'm almost done with my painting. Once I finish, we can do our next round of tests for the Ear Bags. Wow, thanks. You know, I was afraid you were going to spend the whole day whining about how you needed a day off, but I'm glad I was wrong! I got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, but I feel better now. It's like I'm a whole new me. I guess I'm not complaining! [evil chuckle] Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! [snoring] Uh! Oh! Well. That's the five o'clock coaster. Time to switch back with Tim! Huh. [CEO] Go ahead. Pull it a third time, maybe something different will happen. Oh, good tip... Huh? Agh! The CEO? What are you doing here? Hatching a plan so genius you didn't even know there was a plan! I fooled you, Tom! Fooled you! I don't understand! I wouldn't even be here if I hadn't met Tim and-- Oh, I get it. Tim's a bad guy? He's not a guy. He's a robot! [Tom] "Tom Impersonation Machine?" That's right, and now, Tim is going to destroy -everything you've ever cared about. -What? Or better yet, you're going to destroy it, because everyone thinks Tim is you! -No! -[evil laugh] You can't make me! -Help! -[screams] What do you think of this tie? Is this bow a no... or a go? Ooh, the cast of the musical better watch out, or the well-dressed mayor might steal the show! Ha-ha. It's funny you bring that up, because I'm going to make an announcement before the show begins. You're pointing out the emergency exits? I've always wanted to do that. No, I can't tell you what it is. But I can say that it's going to change everyone's lives, permanently. -Grrr. -[Angela] So, how do I look? I was going for "breath-taking," but I might have stopped at "stunning." Angela, you make "stunning" even better than "breath-taking." Don't do it. Stop being gross. You guys are going to make us late. [relieved] Oh, man. -Ginger, please. -Oh. This is going to be a mature evening of art and sophistication. -And romance. -What are you doing? Stop! There's no one in the world I'd rather be with than you. No, Angela! You're saying that to someone who isn't me! -[chuckles] -What? No! [sobbing] It's okay, Tom. You have a new life now. You're a carny controlling kiddie rides at an amusement park. -[screams] -[Tom] Wait a minute. You're right. I do control the rides. [screams] Wait. What are you doing? Go back to moping. Stop it! I didn't mean to give you an idea when I was talking. -I was just mocking you! It's not fair! -That's right! It's not fair. It's carnival. [screaming] [kids cheer] Nice try, CEO. Ha! -Get back here, Tom! No! -[kids laughing] Don't look at me. You're not better than me. Shut up! [cheers, applause] I'm so excited about Tom's big announcement. Maybe it's about me. I hope he's going to announce the town is going to get one of those neat cell towers -that look like trees. -[Tim] Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to History: The Musical! Before the show starts, I want to say something in the most public way I can. My whole life, this town has been my home. -Aww. -You've seen me grow up. And I never got a chance to tell you that I am so much better than you. [all gasp] I tried to make this place fun, but you guys are just lame. [whispers] Where's he going with this? And no one is lamer than my boring business partner, Ben. -[gasp] -Yeah. -No-no-no-no-no. -That guy, right there. Look at him. I officially announce that we no longer work together. What? Now, let's talk about my girlfriend, Angela. What's going on? I tried to make it work, but the fact is you're not as fun as me, you're not as interesting as me, and you are definitely not as pretty as me. -Hey! -That's not true! She's way prettier than you! And me! Whoa. Wow! Wait. There's a Tom, and there's a Tom. I don't get it. He's not Tom! He's an imposter! No, he's an imposter! Can't you tell? Actually, no. I think that one is Tom! He's just got that Tom vibe, you know? No way, it's that one! Just look at his face. It's all Tom. They're identical! There's no way to tell. Guys, I'm the real Tom! I would never leave you or switch places with someone who looked like me. He is a fake! -No, he is! -No, he is! Nuh-uh, he is! He is! -He is! -No, he is! Nuh-uh! Aagh. Hm. [dramatic musical intro] -  Two Toms standing by you...   -Wait. What is going on? -  Two Toms on stage   -What are you doing?   We thought we'd watch a musical But it turned into a weird day   Someone tell me what's going on. We have been making up silly songs about what's happening in our lives all week. The real Tom would know that.   So that means you're the fake!   -  That one is the fake!   -[audience jeering] Plan A foiled. In-in-initiate Plan-Plan B, self-destruct! He's going to blow! Everyone exit the building in an orderly and single-file fashion! Head for the nearest emergency exit! Emergency exits are located to the sides and behind you! [hubbub] Whoa! [crowd cheers, applauds] -[Hank] Ooh. -[Ginger] Woah! -[applause, fireworks] -It's good to be back. That is the last time I pretend to be anyone other than who I am. You're the only Tom we need. Plus, that other one just exploded, so you're the only one we've got. That's weird. I wonder why my Ear Bags didn't-- -[explosion] -Whoaaa!
