 in America and by the way probably only for this show you love your Philips airfryer we all love fried food but we don't like our the thousands and thousands and thousands of calories we know you're a huge fan of your Philips airfryer because it's the number one fryer that we sell they are pioneers they brought the technology to HSN they brought the technology to America but what's interesting about this the only comment per se that we happen to get from our customer pick base is gosh I wish it were bigger well gosh it's a lot bigger go big or go home Tim Wilkins come on out seriously this is Tim and I were text and then talking before we got on the air first of all you know I'm a huge huge huge fan of the airfryer I mean I sing its praises I feel like I'm a one woman marketing team it has really changed my life because fried food was not on the menu for me anymore because I just you know for a lot of issues didn't really agree with me etc etc I thought there's no way that you can fry food with air and it's gonna be better than an oil baloney it's better but the only caveat the only comment that we've gotten from our viewers are gosh I love it and use it so much why can't they make why can't it be bigger I have a bigger family I have more people coming over and you talk about air and oil one of my favorite chefs Gordon Ramsay said about this air is the new oil it is that's the coolest phrase ever it is so let's get to the food because there is something there is he actually he's up there he actually loved it so much he approached Phillips and said did I want to do this I've got to be a part of this amazing fryer I'm sure that's a by the way you choose white or black the white is almost gone so free shipping it's less than $50 on your credit card oh yeah look how this pulls out yeah Arthur than it used to yeah everything now pulls out and goes in the dishwasher any removable dishwasher safe but in my house we cook very healthy I'm gonna pour it this way listen to the crunch as this hits no oil you're not putting this in a vat of oil your savings 90% wait wait say that again up to 90% you're saving cent it's capturing the fat on the bottom now I'm gonna I'm gonna get down here and straight but unless you can hear it this you would normally hear that that is like a V Ride Chris list event that's like fried crispy right there without oil do you know what you're sayin I always say this when I have Phillips on the air first of all not all air fryers are created like and we'll talk about the technology because here's the thing you're popular and then people try to knock it off these are the pioneers they're the originators no one makes a better air fryer than Phillips number one they've actually made this even better the out they did they tuned up the technology there's an entire box of fish sticks going in how easy to set by the way this is gonna be a 400 I'm gonna set that for 10 minutes off we go all right but check this out they actually add their airfryers just circulate the air around in a circle that's good enough Phillips added a starfish a while back that gave it four points of air that gave it more circulation now now they've added this insert that lays in there and gives it eight points twin turbo star that actually took it's a tornado that goes in and spins all around the food making it crispy and fresh and delicious and that capturing that up to 90% it reduces and captures the fat up to 90% 90% if you're trying to eat cleaner this is the way to do it let's say okay so I had a tablespoon of butter earlier that's hundred calories other calories so you knock 90 percent off that just went from 100 to 10 unbelievable if you're hundred calories 210 if you're going out to a restaurant those are usually my 20 grams per wing are you know what you've got okay chicken in here plus vegetables and potatoes let's put that over there so this is gonna be our garnish that this is just insane by the way tim has only a couple shows on this it's maybe twice a year that we see the extra extra-large and basically we put this as a today's special this is the first time ever that we've ever done it yeah okay look at how beautiful Christmas and Wow crispy on the outside like it was fried in a vat of oil but with none you know how they do deep fried turkey oh it's like a deep-fried chicken look beautiful only without the oil let's let's pull our plate a little insane now I do want to let you know that there are fewer than 2000 for the entire day basically this would have been a third today's special if we could have secured more than 2,000 if you love your Philips airfryer like I do but if the only concern if you can call it that is the capacity because normally I'll make it back to something another batch or something and that's cuz I love to cook for a crowd even though it's just me at home because I love the flavor I love how crisp things get I love the fact that I get the flavor without the fat maybe more importantly I love the idea that I'm not babysitting something I'm not worrying about is the old well oil old and look at how and that is white meat if you're trying to eat better look at how delicious let's get that extra potato out of there okay now you don't want that you know it's so interesting when you know might have done cooking shows before we talked about that chicken skin like it they call it has a chicken bacon and I've never been able to master that in an oven that just did check and make them right there Oh delicious I'm actually gonna do Vegas in a minute check out when I do it all the fat that comes off it now if you're a grilled cheese lover that chickens now come on this in butter oh is a cook son even but this the way it circulates the air when it creates that tornado by the way this fits three grilled cheese sandwiches holes if you've got a team of kids coming home from the afternoon you know what my ten-year-old uses this because it's safe it's not gonna overcook no I'm gonna set this for 350 which is super easy yeah let's turn this down right there I'm gonna set this for about six minutes six minutes and the fact that this turns off yeah by itself no oil no overcooking no no worrying about is it gonna be kill cooking and overcooked no flipping no flip no fat and by the way now a 60-minute timer that's how we're able to do a three pound chicken and a three and a half pound roast in big steaks is that 60 minutes is that the chicken was 60 minutes okay 60 minutes okay I'm you know what's so funny I might get this just for the chicken alone and it's so funny because I've talked to the Phillips team behind the scenes and they they told me this was they were like teasing me and it's kind of like come on come on come on come on where is it we never ever see this if you love crispy fried food you know the cow air fried french fries now you don't have to heat up the whole oven you don't have to drop those in a vat of oil matter of fact you know to talk about now oil here's what on that grilled cheese yeah I used let's fill it I used a tablespoon a tablespoon a little less right for the lovely sandwiches you would have to get huh to make those french fries trust that right there which is about as much as what's in that yeah so 90% elimination - 90 % up to four times faster because there's no preheat no because it's got convection going on in that tornado with those eight points of contact yeah and it's not even like normal convection no it's so much faster and so much healthier and it's not like any other airfryer out there by the way but you asked about the cookbook in fact you know what Rick I think know everybody loves Philips and the cookbooks are so handy they're so helpful the big thing for me there's a huge Philips airfryer community out there people become rabid fans like I do this is almost a collectible if you will because it is only available here at HSN and only for the next 1,900 people who call there is a 30 day unconditional money-back guarantee and the one other thing that I'll mention to you the profile on this don't let the fact that it says extra extra large go big or go home is actually not that much bigger than my standard issue but this is almost twice the size of the original unit yeah but they put it in this basket thinking Jesus yes it's larger but it's not so much larger if I go oh I don't have room for that on my countertop and you talk about recipes this has been a customer pick since the day Phillips brought it to HSN five years ago the first show this became a customer pick and the like Shannon said so many of you said all we want is a bigger unit but you share recipes you share ideas news is not out of the out of sorts to do bacon like this that's the fact that you're saving from your favorite restaurant quality bacon it's so funny whenever eggs the fact I've taken okay that's like a quarter cup of just pure fat and the thing that I love that when I go to a restaurant it's I want my eggs extra soft but I like the bacon extra extra crispy where it's almost burned I the same thing of my french fries I always like oh you know I want to double fried which that's only adding more fuel to the fire these are dry as a bone but I almost defy anyone watching the show if you didn't know better you would think that they were fried the regular way you would just think okay that came out of a regular fryer when you see how golden-brown and delicious these are but there is no residual oil on my fingers look at that mountain of mozzarella sticks okay I've been cooking healthy three years competing now as an over-50 fitness competitor so I tried to feed my family the same way when you can get that crispy delicious outside look at how crispy delicious and still get the view of your favorite mozzarella stick without trying that without baking it for 20-30 minutes and heating up the whole house okay summer when you got a fight the air-conditioned so much lighter in your diet you are one thing I should mention it we've got one two three four five six seven eight nine fires going whisper quiet sound a dinner everybody because it's shutting itself off which I love but the other thing is when we used to do traditional fryers here at HSN I would be a sweaty mess by the end of the show because there'd be oil and it'd be hot and that would be with just one or two or three fryers going these are I won't say ice-cold to the touch but we've got them going so if you brush against them this is like running right now already yeah okay I never thought this was possible until I saw Gordon Ramsay do it and then I did it at the house yeah there are two beautiful steaks in here sitting in the bed of Russell sprouts because that hair is circulating in throughout here and doing that tornado in and out the Brussels sprouts are crispy like candy mmm I'm gonna pull these steaks off first because this is pretty incredible the way this is done that was like four jobs these are gorgeous and so thing I had to turn these once by the way but they cooked for about 20 minutes and when you hear these Brussels sprouts hit this plate this is vegetable candy right here my daughter my ten-year-old absolutely loves these they're like chips and they are stunning without any oil without any oil adding oil well there's a lot of tablespoon I tossed on those just to get a good listen to this you hear that so delicious now look at a steak I just cooked in an air fryer I didn't believe this could even be done no ready for just look at how moist that is but you don't curious a secret of steak houses that they don't tell you they base those with butter you know very well they do if you watch those cooking shows that's what they do do you know so to get that caramel and you're like oh why is this takes so much better well guess what they probably used a quarter pound of butter while they're basting it in the pan no butter but I can promise you it's going to in my own opinion have better flavor because you're tasting the pure you know what else they do huh they serum in a pan first to sear them close and then they bake them in the oven you're getting both effects let's put my pretzel sticks in here you're getting both effects in Philips airfryer now you are this is an entire box if you're getting one of those store this is an entire box of pretzel sticks and say and I'm actually over in that unit next to you all right I'm gonna put in - okay whole bags this is two of the full bags that you get of popcorn shrimp for heaven's sake no this is a party for party if you're having all the college friends come over to root for your favorite school you've got a lot of people to feed my brother-in-law's got four kids every day there they are ten minutes from now so interesting about this to say if I wanted to do like little mini Meat Loaf's or little mini cakes your ramekins a lot of your little individual pieces will fit in this as well you don't need to buy extra accessory because anything that will go in your oven yeah now goes into those doughnuts now what is this ready to stay this is a three pound roast okay three and a half actually let's pick this up here and sir I have to try it by division ready this is just like okay and I've got leeks and pick carrots and squash in here we'll dump these out this is great for one meal one pond dishes and the whole thing anything that removes here all these little accessories to pop in the inserts the fat catchers all go in the dishwasher so makes cleanup so so easy now I'm telling you if you could check if you could try that steak like I did you'd buy it just for the steaks just for the snow I'm serious but but the community of lovers of this yeah let's get this going the community of people who love this trade these recipes look at this beautiful pork roast look at a juice tender center-cut pork rolls like this you won't get juice on if you bake this it will not be juicy it'll be dry as can be yeah and the juice pouring out of this now you know why Gordon Ramsay loves this why 80,000 people love this yeah so beautiful by the way a quick programming note because apparently I'm aging in dog years as I'm on the air so time just expands in my own brain it's not 24 hours it's 13 which sometimes can feel like 24 but it won't because we've got new products and great prices and wonderful things this however will not make the day because remember we we it's the only place in America you can get it don't let the XXL fool you know we're going to put it the profile trust me when I tell you it's not that much larger than your standard-issue Philips but it's more to love it's more to fry without any oil without any fat white is almost gone and Tim what is going on here cinnamon rolls are going on you can fry bake roast things that would have been grilled so this these are piping hot eight minutes I did these in eight minutes they would have taken me 20 to heat up my I'm just gonna say my oven takes like 20 21 minutes to preheat and depending on these of course it's big enough to hold an entire one of those popping I know and then of course it always comes yeah with the beautiful cinnamon roll sauce there that goes right over the top icing that the kids just love I try to keep enough left over after they get into it to actually put on the cinnamon rolls would you guys make sure there's something about that icing isn't it crazy Oh beautifully brown they are too and that's the really cool thing about this is it does it Browns it caramelizes it fries evenly not a lot of these to go around and remember we're doing free shipping we've never done it on a 6 flex payment of 46 dollars and change to do a chicken without any turning or roasting or brining or priming and basically you think about deep-fried turkey that's deep fried chicken only without any oil so the steak will pay for itself the chicken will pay for itself we do not I've only seen this on the year one at a time and I can tell you it wasn't a $46 flex pay so we don't see the likes of this you know what is that that is a frittata oh is it really that is a full that's 12 eggs of Ratana with him and vegetables if you have a beautiful brunch with people coming over you can cook that all in one cooker one dish and again you don't have to buy extra accessories now anything that goes in your oven yeah goes in this so beautiful and delicious we put this in oh that's beautiful I just want to get my little display over here when you want and you said - it's faster than your oven it's faster than anything else on your countertop more times faster holy with my kid the other day she came home from school famished I was able to throw in a couple of chicken tenders and an egg rolls in the afternoon rolls I don't want to cook heat up the whole kitchen six minutes later a headache right I think I heard the sound of something something something something we got 90 seconds remaining 200 is beautiful and crunchy okay try I'm telling you these french fries are a little addictive Liz now crunchy I'll get to all this I'm ready hmm I don't know if you how beautiful that is beautiful oh yeah whoo-whee you see that going out of there but perfectly crunched all the way around with no oil no light brushing on top oh yeah light brushing well with this just a touch all right there we go and okay ready okay I've got fish sticks such a cute this is another one of those ones we picked up off of one of the philips air fryer fan sites and they said this is a great idea and we'll garnish this you ready yeah let's there we go I'm having buddy the great cheese you know I'm a sucker for the grilled cheese Tim oh you're so delicious now Oh down here of course we've got our fried food Bonanza going on let's move that you ready to lose that complete is art fact the crew loves these nights with Philips airfryer two full
