 A self-organizing factory that entirely configures and organizes itself and responds to changing requirements, and where humans and machines seamlessly collaborate. This vision is becoming reality in the Siemens Living Lab for cyber-physical production systems. The manufacturing of a product starts in virtual reality with the help of simulation technologies. The cyber-physical production system first checks whether the production is feasible. The machines in the factory provide detailed information about their production skills and constraints. Based on this information, the system generates a digital twin of the product and compares the required production steps with the production skills of all machines and humans in the factory. The machine gets the knowledge of how the product shall be made directly from the digital twin. Based on the information about how the parts are to be assembled, the system dynamically calculates all necessary steps and carries out the production autonomously. This means that the product steers its own production. This is an important feature of Industry 4.0 solutions. Siemens enhances the skills of the machines through machine learning, intelligent sensors, and speech recognition. This optimizes the production process and increases the quality of the product. Safety requirements are also developed to ensure that people and machines can work together safely. In the future, cyber-physical production systems will better meet customer needs and manufacture products in a faster, more individualized, and more efficient manner.
