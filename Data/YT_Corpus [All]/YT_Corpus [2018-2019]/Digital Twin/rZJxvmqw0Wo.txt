 Hello my name is Nick Thody. I'm the head of knowledge at Osborne Clarke and I'm joined today by Catherine Hammon, our Digital Revolution Knowledge Lawyer, for another of our talks on the fundamentals that underlie the digital revolution. Hello Catherine. So today we're going to talk about the Internet of Things and, let's do as we always do, let's start at the beginning. Can you briefly tell us what the Internet of Things is? - The Internet of Things is the expression we use for the increasing network of ordinary everyday things which are having power added to them computing power energy plus a connection back to the Internet whether that's mobile or fixed and they are starting to send and receive data okay so this sounds sort of more familiar to me than other topics we've discussed such as blockchain so we're talking about some technology that's effectively building on what's been around for a decade or two yeah so we started off with the Internet of people connecting from computer to computer first of all that was fixed wire then we got mobile connections smart phones etc we can do all sorts of things on the old Internet if you like the ordinary Internet that we're all very used to and the Internet of Things are sort of an extension of that so why are we talking about Internet of Things in our series about the digital revolution if it's actually quite old news so we've had the Internet of Things it's slowly been building up over quite a few years now and it's you're right it's much less unfamiliar than blockchain is or artificial intelligence machine learning deep learning it's much less of an unknown thing but the point about the Internet of Things is really the potential for where it can take us particularly once you start to incorporate into it artificial intelligence functionality or blockchain systems it says for some of the other new technologies which are coming around and it's really the potential of where it can get us to which is really exciting and I know because I've heard you talk about this before you always give the example or you often give the example of a connected fridge which although in some ways much might be seen as something in what doesn't particularly need is a good example of the sort of connectivity issues yeah so I use that because I always think it's easier to talk about the impact of technology in a way which is just straightforward and around ordinary everyday life at the moment the smartest of fridges at the moment has got cameras in it and you can remotely tap into that into those cameras and if you're in the supermarket in your car if you've got any mayonnaise left you can literally buy your phone look in the fridge and see if there is anything but if you start to think about where that fridge could go what if it had sensors on the shelves so it could measure itself whether the milk was getting low what if it had a connection into your internet shopping so that it can when it feels the milk is getting low it adds milk into your internet shopping basket online or perhaps you've given it permission to pay directly and so it automatically replenishes your fridge with milk what if it's connected to the weather forecast etc it knows that if it's going to be a chilly day on Friday you'll like a bottle of red wine if it's going to be a warm sunny evening you might like some rose' to sit in the garden and drink so you can see that the more connectivity these devices have the more automation we give them it becomes incredibly convenient it becomes incredibly easy and they can start to simplify and that that's on the kind of consumer side but I guess when you're talking about large industrial processes you know you've got the similar argument that this enables a connection up of processes within for example a manufacturing system and also the monitoring of the various elements of that system so you can see where things are going wrong where maintenance may need it and generate and ultimately to generate data to improve those processes yeah absolutely and the other really interesting thing around manufacturing processes and we've mentioned that a predictive maintenance you've mentioned efficient processing all that's of thing one of the other things you can do is build digital twin of your system so you take all of that real-time data coming from all the elements within your production line you can then create a virtual replica of your whole system and you can use that to work out why is there a pinch point there or why is that bit not working as efficiently or if I retool along this section what impact will it have and you can start to use that for really fantastic planning processes making you're making your factory work in the most efficient way that it possibly can making sure that changes are implemented swiftly successfully without kind of iterations to get it right exactly you can do that or virtually we're using digital twins okay so I I get the consumer application of it you've used the example of fridges and of course the manufacturing and industrial side of it in terms of monitoring and improving those sort of processes what's actually involved in the Internet of Things and how functions yeah so as I said it's sort of a continuation of the normal internet the Internet it connects people sometimes Internet of Things devices are still connecting back to people so I can use my phone perhaps to access some of the functionality in my house to control the heating before I get home to it than the garage door before I get home sometimes the internet things of Internet of Things devices are actually connecting one to another talking to each other so at some point down the line where we get connected autonomous vehicles we will get platooning of vehicles so you can a fleet can essentially operate almost like a swarm knowing exactly where they are they can move together much more closely as a block which will be more efficient in terms of slipstreaming using less energy using less power using the so you've got different two broad areas internet the Internet of Things devices which connect back to people and ones which are talking to each other and of course when we say the Internet of Things it kind of makes it sound like the existing Internet which works effectively completely seamlessly but the Internet of Things is a much more complex concept isn't it and it doesn't it's not one single thing is the connection of different technologies different types of connectivity and so on yeah that's right so there's lots and lots of variation in how these systems are set up some Internet of Things devices connect very closely so my my my wearable device on my wrist is just going to my phone on the other hand some things have got sims in them and they're connecting directly from the internet of things to buy straight up into the mobile network wherever the nearest Martin may be for example so you've got differences in the distance they need to connect you've got differences in the technology by which they're connecting so is it 4G, 5G coming it Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and there are also some proprietary communication systems which have been created specifically for particular purposes you've got differences in the architecture of these things is it cloud computing is it all going back back up to the cloud is it edge computing is it being done much more locally where it needs to be done you've got differences in the degree of integration with other in with other technology so it's not just internet of things it's also got some artificial intelligence functionality it's sending the data back down to be locked down into a blockchain etc lots and lots of variations some of these things are starting to be standardized but there remains a lot of fragmentation around you know so different access points different connectivity different standards different types of Technology and different kit I think an obvious challenge therefore is going to be cyber security you know we've seen the classic examples in the press of children's toys being hacked home security cameras being hacked what's being done about that first of all there are existing obligations around cyber security obligations around network resilience so you were obliged to public network operators already or have have obligations on them which come out of the communications act there's new European Union legislation coming into force the the NIS the cybersecurity directive which will oblige operators in certain sectors energy transport has included digital infrastructure various different sectors so if your Internet of Things devices within one of those sectors this may apply to apply to you and it basically is obliging the network operators to make sure that their systems are as secure both in terms of not going down and also in terms of vulnerability to attack into hacking etc making sure that they apply state of the art technology and protections into the system making sure they're updated properly making sure that they report downtime or report attacks essentially that's one coming and and another aspect of cyber security I guess is historically you know a lot of emphasis has been put on the end use of a piece of equipment in terms of password inge you know we've all got the you name very challenging experience we're trying to remember lots and lots of different passwords and so on but I think there's a general shift into changing that into an onus more on manufacturers and designers to include security as a fundamental starting point when designing this type of equipment and devices yeah that's quite right and there is there's been recently been a proposed Code of Conduct issued by the Department of Culture Media and Sport that DCMS and the proposal exactly as you say is that the owners should now be on the manufacturers to basically stop to remove from consumers the option to be a bit lacks about all of this so things like individual devices must have individual passports not a generic factory default password it must be easy to update the devices to upgrade the technology to upgrade the hacking protections it's actually that sort of thing it must be easy to report vulnerabilities back to the manufacturer based basically to make it easy for us to have good cyber security around our home devices because of course you don't I mean increasingly we're learning to do it but you don't necessarily think of a toy a connected toy as being a computing device and you have to go to the back to the website and buy it it's easy to be not very good at the security around these products and so the emphasis absolutely some of it's coming from the government some of it's coming from the corporate world there are corporate initiatives as well too for security by design but there's also a cultural challenge around people actually understanding that what they what they bought is is actually a device that can be accessed so moving on from those sort of cyber security and access issues the other thing the Internet of Things is doing and this is kind of its raison d'etre is moving around an awful lot of data so as soon as we're talking about data and data moving we're talking about data security and data privacy issues yeah that's right so we can't talk about data without talking about the GDP are the general data protection regulation which comes which is in force in May the usual obligations apply to Internet of Things devices you need to make sure that the data subject knows that you're collecting data about them that they've consented to that or that there's one of the exception apply adjustment use you need to make sure that they understand the rights attaching to their data so the right to be forgotten the right to have that data corrected the right to take that data and move it across to a different system there are obligations around reporting data data protection failures etc yeah the GD P R is absolutely this is one of the absolute target areas for GD P R if it's personal data if it's sensitive data and also of course the GD P re incorporates into it we were just talking about security by design the GD P one of the GD P our principles is privacy by design so absolutely the expectation on manufacturers increasingly is that they set these products up to protect our data just on that privacy point what's happened to the e privacy directive that was going through the Brussels legislative machine and was meant to sit alongside the GDPR but but isn't on it's basically in discussion between the EU institutions you're quite right it was supposed to come into force alongside the GD P R and to sit beside it in fact what's happened is that GDPR is now very comprehensive and unlike when the previous data privacy legislation was put in place the internet wasn't really with us and so you needed a second piece of legislation to add in the the new gaps where internet trade and that sort of thing had come up the ecommerce had developed now of course ecommerce and the Internet's fully integrated into our commercial world and the question here is is now actually do we need this second piece of legislation if machine-to-machine communications are include personal data then the GD P R covers them and if they don't include personal data then do we actually need to protect them there's that's the debate that's going on at the inside so we don't know whether it will eventually emerge or not well I've seen an indication that the Commission hopes it'll be out next year middle end of next year but that doesn't that suggest that the debate will be resolved in their favor which obviously that's not clear yet yep okay so I think one of the things we've noticed in these talks is on a particular one we we talked about artificial intelligence competition issues are coming to the fore in a lot of areas of the digital revolution and I think this area of the Internet of Things is is another another area where slightly unexpectedly perhaps or a sort of series of second-order consequences is there are competition issues being thrown up now your former competition oils still a competition oil we never forget what sort of lawyer we are do you want to expand enough a little bit yes so again the easiest way to talk about it is to go back to my example of the fridge if my fridge knows that I'm running out of milk and my fridge manufacturer has an exclusive relationship with a particular supermarket then it will get the milk for me from that supermarket if my fridge for example is if I organize my fridge interact with my fridge via my personal digital assistant perhaps that personal digital assistant either has an exclusive relationship or a preference for a particular supermarket or perhaps it's part of a network with its own shopping channel its own shopping online shopping system in which case it will order the milk from that for me now that's fantastically convenient it all gets done for me I never run out of milk but at the same time the price of my milk is driven by the fact that I've got the choice not to buy a milk from that supermarket buts apart from that supermarket know if my fridge is making one of those choices for me and I because of the convenience I don't really question it and I go along with it you can see that adds up into a gradual reduction of competition if that's how the market progresses which is it this is all speculation at the moment but if that's how the market goes forward there are big challenges around maintaining competition because automation is fabulously convenient but it does sometimes remove the active exercise of choice by consumers if choice is reduced competition will reduce if competition goes down then prices will tend to go out of quality will tend to go down innovation new ideas etc etc choice will reduce so that's one of the competition areas the other thing is really an extension of the current issues which the European Commission is grappling with where you have digital businesses with which run platforms and through those platforms generate a huge amount of data does data recall power is data some kind of essential facility tool which people have to have access to in order to be able to compete in this new world so those kind of issues are only exacerbated by the big data that the Internet of Things throws up as well great so as we've seen before new technologies and new concepts to which old theories whether it's in competition or otherwise may have to be applied or adapted or completely new theories developed absolutely Kathryn once again thank you for talking us through the basics of the Internet of Things it's very much appreciated thank you
