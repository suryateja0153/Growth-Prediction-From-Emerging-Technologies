 I explain Digital biomarkers in One Minute! Biomarkers are the heart of diagnostics. Even if we don’t have any visible symptoms, these markers are indicators of the presence and severity of a disease. For example high white blood cell counts may indicate the presence of an infection or an allergic response. Information gained through biomarkers can help in early diagnosis, disease prevention, drug target identification and drug response. But with the rise of digital health, we need to introduce a new idea: digital biomarkers. While “general” biomarkers can be collected through blood and urine tests, or by isotope analysis at the point of care, digital biomarkers are collected through fitness trackers, health apps, sleep sensors, pocket ECGs, and other health measuring devices. Perhaps these devices will not be able to tell us our white blood cell count, but they will present us with a whole new set of informations. Researchers can look at elderly adults with dementia, Parkinson’s or Huntington’s through wearables and smartwatches and identify digital biomarkers that indicate the development and the severity of their diseases. And as these new technologies spread rapidly, healthcare data grows at an astronomical rate. When paired with analytical tools, these large volumes of data can be leveraged to track trends and patterns for both individuals and populations, for all kinds of diseases not just at the point of care. Imagine running millions of clinical trials efficiently and simultaneously. Digital biomarkers could significantly help in bringing healthcare from a reactive towards a more preventive approach, as researchers will not only be able to explain diseases better, but more data will be available to analyze what healthy, normal states signify and to predict future health outcomes.
