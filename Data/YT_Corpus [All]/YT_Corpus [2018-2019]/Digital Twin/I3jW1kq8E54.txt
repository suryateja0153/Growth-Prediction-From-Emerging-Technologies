 hi I'm Peter Morris and welcome to another wiki Bond action item one of those pressing strategic issues that businesses face is how to get more value out of their data in our opinion that's the essence of a digital business transformation is the using of data as an asset to improve your operations and take better advantage of market opportunities the problem of data though it's shareable its copyable its reusable it has it's easy to create derivative value out of it one of the biggest misnomers in the digital business world is the notion that data is the new fuel or the new oil it's not you can only use oil once you can apply it to a purpose and not multiple purposes data you can apply to a lot of purposes which is why you are able to get such interesting and increasing returns to that asset if you use it appropriately now this becomes especially important for technology companies that are attempting to provide digital business technologies or services or other capabilities to their customers in the consumer world it started to reach ahead questions about Facebook's reuse of a person's data through an ad based business model is now starting to lead people to question the degree to which the information asymmetry about what I'm giving and how they're using it is really worth the value that I get out of Facebook is something that consumers and certainly governments are starting to talk about it's also one of the bases for GDP are which is going to start enforcing significant fines in the next month or so in the b2b world that question is going to become especially acute why because as we try to add intelligence to the services and the products that we are utilizing within digital business some of that requires a degree of or some sort of relationship where some amount of data is passed to improve the models and machine learning and AI that are associated without intelligence now some companies have come out and said flat out they're not going to reuse a customer's data IBM being a good example of that when Ginni Rometty at IBM thinks said we're not going to reuse our customers data the question for the panel here is is that going to be a part of a differentiating value proposition in the marketplace are we going to see circumstances in which companies keep props perhaps products and services low by reusing a client's data and others sustaining their experience and sustaining a trust model say they won't how is that going to play out in front of customers so joining me today here in the studio David FOIA hi Dan and on the remote lines we have Neal Raiden Jim Tbilisi George Gilbert and Ralph eNOS hey guys hey hey alright so so let me let me start with you you've been in the BI world as a user as a consultant for many many number of years help us understand the relationship between data assets ownership and strategy Oh God anyway as a consultant when we would do a project for a company there were very clear lines of what belong to us and what belong to the client they were paying us generously they would allow us to come in to their company and and do things that they needed and in return we treated them with respect we wouldn't take their data we want to take their data models that we built for example and sell them to another company that's just as far as I'm concerned that's just that so if I'm housing another company's data because I'm a cloud provider or some sort of application provider and and I say well you know I can use this data to to me the analogy is I'm a warehousing company and independently I go into the warehouse and I say you know these guys aren't moving their inventory fast enough I think I'll sell some of it it just isn't right is a great point Jim Cabela's as we think though about the role that data machine learning play training models delivering new classes of services we don't have a clean answer right now so what's your thought and how this is likely to play out I agree totally with Neil first of all if it's somebody else's data you don't own and therefore you can't sell and you can't monetize it clearly but where you have derivative assets like machine learning models that are derivative from data you know it's the same phenomena is the same issue a higher level you can build and train or should all your machine learning models only from data that you have legal access to you own or you have license and so forth so is you're building these derivative assets first and foremost make sure as you're populating your data Lake to build and you know do the training that you have clear ownership over the data so with GD P R and so forth we have to be doubly triply vigilant to make sure that we're not using data that we don't have authorized ownership or access to that is critically important and so you know what I get kind of queasy when I hear about some people say we use blockchain to make the sharing of training data more distributed and federated or whatever it's like wait a second that doesn't solve the issues of ownership it makes it even more problematic if you get this massive blockchain of data coming from Kathryn yet who owns what how do you know gonna do you dare build any models whatsoever from any of that data that's a huge gray field that area that nobody's really addressed yet yeah well it might mean that the blockchain has been poorly designed I think that we talked in one of the previous action items about the role that blockchain design is going to play but moving aside from the blockchain so it seems as though we generally agree that data is owned by somebody typically and that the ownership of it as Neil said means that you can't intercept it at some point time just because it is easily copied and then generate rents on it yourself David foyer what does that mean from a ongoing systems design and development standpoint how are we going to assure as Jim said not only that we know what data is ours but make sure that we have the right protection strategies and cents in place to make sure that the data as it moves we have some influence and control over it well my starting point is that AI and I infused products are fuelled by data you you need that data and Jim and Neil have already talked about that the most if in my opinion the most effective way of improving a company's products whatever the products are from manufacturing agriculture financial services is to use AI infused capabilities that is likely to give you the most best return on your money and businesses need to focus on their own products that's the first place you are trying to protect from anything anybody coming in businesses own that data that they own the data about your products in use by your customers use that data to improve your products with AI infused function and use it before your competition eats your lunch but let's build on that so we're not saying that for example if you're a storage system supplier since that's a relatively easy one you've got very very fast SSDs very very fast nvme over fabric great technology you can collect data about how that system is working but that doesn't give you rights to then also collect data about how the customers using the system that there's a there is a line which you need to make sure that you are covering for example call home on a product any product whose data is that you need to make sure that you can use that data you have some sort of agreement with the customer and that's a win win because you're using that to improve the product prove things about it but that's very very clear that you should have a contractual relationship as Jim and Neil were pointing out you need the right to use that data it can't be become beyond the hand but you must get it because if you don't get it you won't be able to improve your products now we're talking here about technology products which have often very concrete and obvious ownership and people who are specifically responsible for administering them but when we start getting into the IOT domain or in other places where the device is infused with intelligence but and for and might be collecting data that's not directly associated with its purpose just by virtue of the nature of sensors that are out there and the whole concept of digital twin introduces some tension in all this George Gilbert take us through what's been happening with the overall suppliers of technology that are relating related to digital twin building designing etc how are they securing or making promises committing to their customers that they will not cross this data boundary as they improve the quality of their twins well Liz you quoted Ginni Rometty and starting out she's saying IBM unlike its competitors will not take advantage and leverage and monetize your data but this is it's a little more subtle than that and and digital twins are just sort of another manifestation of industry-specific sort of solution development that we've done for decades the differences as Jim and David have pointed out that with machine learning it's not so much code that's at the heart of these digital twins it's the machine learning models and the data is what is what informs those models now so you don't you don't want all your secret sauce to go from you know Mercedes Benz to BMW but at the same time the economics of industry solutions means that you do want some of the repeatability that we've always gotten from industry solutions you might have parts that are just company specific and so in IBM's case if you really parse what they're saying they they take what they learn in terms of the models from the data when they're working with BMW and some of that is going to go into the industry specific models that they're going to use when they're working with mercedes-benz if you really really sort of peel the onion back and ask them it's the it's not the models it's not the features of the models but it's the coefficients that weight the features or variables in the models that they will keep segregated by customer so in other words you get some of the benefits the economic benefits of reuse across customers in you know with with similar expertise but you don't actually get all of the secret sauce know Ralph you know I agree too Georg here I think that's an interesting topic that's the important one of the important points it's not kosher to monetize data that you don't own but conceivably if you can abstract from that data at some higher level likely George's describing terms of weights and follow of patients and so forth in a neural network that's derivative from the moment it's done point in the abstraction where you should be able to monitor I mean it's like a paraphrase of some copyrighted material a paraphrase I'm not a lawyer but you can you know you can mana you can sell a paraphrased in this your own original work that's based obviously on your reading of Moby Dick or whatever it is you're paraphrasing yeah I think my gym I go ahead nerdy with I agree with that but the there's a line there was a guy who worked at Capital One this is about ten years ago and he was their chief statistician or whatever this is before we had words like you know machine learning and data science it was called statistics and predictive analytics he left the company and formed his own company and rewrote it recoded all of the algorithms he had for about 20 different predictive models formed a company and then Bisons that stuff to Sybase and Teradata and what now the question I have is did that cross the line or didn't it these were algorithms were actually developed and inside capital one did he have the right to use those even if he wrote new computer code to make them run in databases so it's more than just data I think it's a it's well it's a marketplace and I think that if you own something someone should not be able to take it and make money on it but that doesn't mean you can't make an agreement with them to do that and I think we're gonna see a lot of that but I am essen gets data on prescription drugs in and IRI and Nielsen gets scanner data and they pay for it and then they add value to it they resell it so I I think that's really the issue is the use has to be understood by all the parties and the compensation has to be appropriate to the use all right so Ralphy knows as a guy who looks at market models and and handles a lot of the fundamentals for how we do our forecasting look at this from the standpoint of how people are gonna make money because clearly what we're talking about sounds like is the idea that any derivative use is embedded in algorithms seeing how those contracts get set up and I got a comment on that in a second but the promise a number of years ago is that people are going to start selling data willy-nilly as a basis for their economic or there's a way of capturing value out of their economic activities or their business activities hasn't matured yet generally do we see like this brand new data economy where everybody's selling data to each other being the way that this all plays out yeah I think I'm having a hard time imagining this as a marketplace I think we we pointed at the manufacturing industries technology industries where some of this makes some sense but I think from a practitioner perspective you know you're looking for variables that are meaningful that then are in a form you can actually use to make prediction that you understand you know what the the history and the validity of that of that data is a lot of cases there's a lot of garbage out there that you can't use and the notion of paying for something that ultimately you look at and say oh crap it's not this isn't really helping me is going to be a maybe not an insurmountable barrier but it's going to create some obstacles in the market for adoption of this kind of thought process yeah a monthly utility of the data that comes that feeds your models yeah I think there's gonna be a lot of like there's gonna be a lot of legal questions raised and I recommend that people go look at a recent silicon angle article written by Mike Wheatley and edited by our editor-in-chief Rob Howe about Microsoft letting technology partners own right to joint innovations this is a quite a difference this is quite a change for Microsoft who used to send you if you sent an email with an idea to them you'd often get an email back saying oh just to let you know any correspondence we have here is the property of Microsoft so there clearly is tension in the model about how we're going to utilize data and enable derivative use and how we're going to share how we're going to appropriate value and sharing the returns of that I think this is going to be an absolutely central feature of business models certainly in the digital business world for quite some time the last thing I'll know and then I'll get to the action items the last thing I'll mention here is that one of the biggest challenges in whenever we start talking about how we set up businesses and institutionalize the work that's done is to look at the nature of the assets and the scope of the assets and in circumstances where the asset is used by two parties and it's generating a high degree of value as measured by the transactions against those assets there's always going to be a tendency for one party to try to take ownership of it one party that's able to generate greater returns and the other almost always makes move to try to take more control out of that asset and that's the basis of governance and so everybody talks about data governance as though it's like something that you worry about with your your your you know backup and restore and well that's important but this notion of data governance increasingly is going to become a feature of and boardroom conversations about what it really means to build you know createdate asset sustain those data assets get value out of them and how we determine whether or not there's a whether or not the right balance is being struck between the value that we're getting out of our data and third parties are getting out of our data including customers so with that let's do a quick action I'm David Boyer I'm looking at you why don't we start here David foyer action item so my action item is for businesses you should focus focus on data about your products in use by your customers to improve help improve the quality of your products in in views AI into those products as one of the most efficient ways of adding value to it and do that before your competition has a chance to come in and make get the ground that the data that will stop you from doing that George Gilbert action item I guess mine would be that you in most cases you you want to embrace some amount of for use because of the economics involved from your joint development with a solution provider but if others are going to get some benefit from sort of reusing some of the intellectual property that informs models that you build make sure you negotiate with your vendor that any upgrades to those models whether they're digital twins or in other forms that there's a canonical version that can come back and be an upgraded path for you as well Jim to be less action item my action idea is for businesses to regard your data as a product that you monetize yourself or if you are unable to monetize it yourself if there is a partner like a supplier or a customer who can monetize that data and then negotiate the terms of that monetization in your your relationship and be vigilant on that so you get a piece of that stream even if the bulk of the work is done by your part Neal Raiden action item it's all based on transparency your data is your data no one else can take it without your consent that doesn't mean that you can't get involved in relationships where there's an agreement to do that but the problem is most agreements especially when you look at a business consumer are so ownerís that nobody reads to them and nobody understands them so the person providing the data has to have an unequivocal right to sell it to you and the person buying it has to really understand what the limits are that they can do with it rafi knows action item you're muted Ralph but it was brilliant whatever was what it was and that I really can't say much more than that you know a practitioner perspective and I can understand that from a manufacturing perspective how the value could be there but when you're as a practitioner if you're fishing for data out there that someone has it might look like something you can use chances are it's not and you need to be real careful about spending money to get data that you're not really clear is going to help you great all right thanks very much team so here's our action item conclusion for today the whole concept of digital business is predicated in the idea of using data assets in a differential way to better serve your markets and improve your operations it's your data increasing that is going to be the base for differentiation and any weak undertaking to allow that data to get out has the potential that someone else can through their data science and their capabilities re-engineer much of what you regard as your differentiation we've had conversations with leading data scientists who say that if someone were to sell customer data into a open marketplace that it would take about four days for a great data scientist to re-engineer almost everything about your customer base so as a consequence we have to tread lightly here as we think about what it means to release data into the wild ultimately the challenge there for anybody this will be how do i establish the appropriate governance and protections not just looking at the technology but rather looking at the overall notion of the data assets if you don't understand how to monetize your data and nonetheless enter into a partnership with somebody else by definition that partner is going to generate greater value out of your data than you are there's significant information asymmetries here so it's something that everybody every company must undertake an understanding of how to generate value out of their data we don't think that there's going to be a general-purpose marketplace for sharing data in a lot of ways this is going to be a heavily contracted arrangement but it doesn't mean that we should not take great steps or important steps right now to start doing a better job of instrumenting our products and services so that we can start collecting data about our products and services because the path forward is going to demonstrate that we're going to be able to improve dramatically improve the quality of the goods and services we sell by reducing the assets best to these specificities for our customers by making them more intelligent and more programmable finally is this going to be a feature of a differentiated business relationship through trust we're open to that personally I'll speak for myself I think a will I think that there is going to be an important element ultimately of being able to demonstrate to a customer base to a marketplace that you take privacy data ownership and intellectual property control of data assets seriously and that you are very very specific very transparent and how you're going to use those in in derivative business transactions all right so once again David floor thank you very much here in the studio on the phone Neal Raiden Ralph eNOS jim Kabila's and George Gilbert this has been another wiki bond action item
