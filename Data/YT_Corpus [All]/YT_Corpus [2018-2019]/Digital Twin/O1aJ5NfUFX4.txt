  Customers are always demanding more of their vehicles. Where, before, they were maybe happy  that their vehicle survived for 100.000 km now they expect it to last for at least 200.000 km. This is one of the reasons why you see more vehicles on the market that are lighter and stronger, but this of course has a direct impact on the workload  for durability testing. Since these tests are usually large-scale  and mostly happen at the end of the development cycle, they're mostly conducted under huge time pressure. So, it is of crucial importance that vehicle test teams can work together in the most productive way to get all this work done. That is why we offer to our customers  the new Simcenter Testlab Neo software. It is an integrated end-to-end platform that guides the user through all the different steps  of a typical durability testing campaign, combining load data acquisition, load data analysis and fatigue life estimation, and this all within the same software. Thanks to the instant data visualization tools, the interactive or automated analysis, performant processing, and active reporting, our customers can accelerate the delivery  of critical durability insights on their product.
