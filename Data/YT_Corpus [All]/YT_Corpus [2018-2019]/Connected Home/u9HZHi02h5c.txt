 so you've got a generator and you're wondering how do I safely hook it up to the house some of the dogs are barking over here today a garden fork I want to show you a new aunt some new method but a method is new to me that works better than I transfer panels and I have a transfer panel but we're going to be at a house today where they just installed an interlock switch I'm gonna walk you through it and show you how it works make fix grow cook garden fork all right so let's look at some of the stuff that electrician will need this is the generator interlock hardware this is the 220 or 240 breaker the generator power is going to come in to that and into your breaker panel this is your weatherproof outdoor plug very important and then a 240 volt extension cord with the correct amperage to plug into your generator and into your outdoor outlet so your electrician is going to install this circuit breaker to allow power to come in from the generator it's gonna go right here and they will move the two breakers that are here they'll put them down here which is easy enough there are my sisters troublemakers when you're thinking about where to site the outlet the outdoor outlet that your Jenner is going to plug into my suggestion is first of all has to be outdoors don't do this in a garage or a basement or you'll kill yourself but it has to be near where you even put the generator that just is my experience so the generator is stored right there in that shed and right back here is where a lot of the electrical equipment is so we could use a hammer drill and go through the mortar and the brick to run a new cable really easily and then the generator can sit right here actually with the core we have it's long enough it can sit on those pavers right there knuckleheads out there they're being goofs they're kind of like my pups so think about that work with your electrician about where to site it also make sure it's not somewhere that water collects otherwise you're gonna be standing in mud or wet stuff and that is bad when you're dealing with electricity this is your outdoor outlet the power comes through this brick you could use a hammer drill for that goes through this electrical box and connects into this socket here the socket matches the same kind of power outlet you have on your generator your electrician will help you match that a stinger or heavy duty extension cord connects from here and goes to your generator which will be sitting right here because we're using an outdoor generator not in your basement okay for you and your electrician be sure to drill into brick not into mortar we have a whole video about that actually there's two or three videos about how to attach things to brick and cement walls okay here is kind of the meat of the generator interlock switch system the top right hand breakers if there are any breakers here they're moved down and then an amp a 240 volt breaker that matches the amperage of your generator is put in here and these two this red and black wire plus a ground and a neutral travel out of the box over to the outdoor outlet where you're going to plug your generator in the main breaker is forced to turn off when this is turned on power comes from the generator up into those two wires into the panel and feeds selected circuits so that's kind of the juice that's the juju I guess we'd call it of a interlocks which is that breaker right there the electrician will use a template to drill three holes to allow the interlock switch to be attached this is the interlock the electrician will drill some holes and then put these shoulder bolts in here and this acts as a guide for the interlock time to test all right let's pretend that we're having a storm and there's a power outage okay so this is our interlock switch and guard I guess we'd call it alright so if your power goes out oh the power is out first thing you do is you come downstairs and you turn off your main breaker okay then you push this up and that keeps the breaker you're not going to be able to turn the breaker back on again because it hits this metal guard what it does allow you to do though is turn on the interlock breaker now we're going to go outside hook up our generator power is going to come in to the panel from here and flow through but first before we do that turn off all the breakers in your house because your generator probably can't power the entire house like it's not going to be able to run your electric dryer and your air conditioning at the same time depends on the amperage of your generator okay we have a small one it'll run the lights that'll run the air conditioner and that's enough for us you know okay alright so the lights go off turn off the main mean is off so we're not endangering any line workers so our generator power does not go back down the power line turn off all our breakers here and then take our generator extension cord and go outside and we'll pretend as a storm or something we're doing it in the rain that's what we'll pretend this is a great life by the way I'll link to it below alright let's go upstairs very attractive too so we're outside this is our generator power cord it'll only plug in here one way one of them has the little lugs of it has a tang on it and you line that up so pretend you're doing this in the rain and then you turn it to click so it won't pull out okay generator is off this gets plugged in and in turn to lock again so now we're feeding power back into the house with this heavy-duty floor to the breaker panel all right so we're down in the basement our interlock is pushed up the main is turned off the generator and lock is turned on so we're feeding power into here now we can turn on select breakers to power different parts of the house depending on the wattage of your generator we've a small generators 5,000 watts but that'll run enough to keep you comfortable during a power outage and I think the basement lights are down here somewhere look so when your power comes back on you can switch the generator feed off and that will probably drop down just from gravity and then slide your main back on again so the beauty of this is now you're lying power is on you cannot push that across it's brilliantly simple and it works really well it's super simple the expensive part is hire an electrician but it's saving you a headache
