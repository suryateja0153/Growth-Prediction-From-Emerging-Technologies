 I just connected devices initially from a security point of view, being able to monitor the home when I'm away at work or away on holiday was pretty important. Currently in this room alone I've even got a dozen connected devices from the early security cameras, motion detectors, connected lights, plugs, smart television, network storage, Blu-Ray player is connected. There's plenty of benefits of smart devices: I have an air quality monitor for instance so I can see when the air quality in the room is below par so I can try to figure out ways of making my environment with a bit better. Also there's the security side, I can monitor the home from wherever I am in the world. So if I get a notification that motion detector is being set off I can find out why and then through the camera I can see why. So it's a balance from being sensible and useful to pure entertainment. People should be aware that every bit of networked device that they bring into the home, be it a smart camera or even a smart television, these are extra ways in - potentially - for somebody to get into your home. Same way that you protect your doors and windows you need something to protect your Internet of Things, your connected devices, your smart home devices. The speed that IoT is growing seems to be faster than ways to protect it. For me, I haven't got a lot of time to be hiding my network, so adding something like SENSE, which has been really quick and easy solve, and I'm all for the easy win.
