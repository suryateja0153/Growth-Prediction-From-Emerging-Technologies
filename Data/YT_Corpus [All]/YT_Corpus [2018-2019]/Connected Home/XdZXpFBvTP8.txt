 [Music] hey I'm Nik Felker and today hold on give me a second okay Google turn on the studio lights okay turning the studio lights on hey I'm Nick Felker and today I'm going to talk to you about how to make your smart home devices work with the Google assistant without building a conversational interface right now the equal assistant works with more than 1500 smart devices from our 200 popular brands I'll show you just how easy it is for your devices to be part of this ecosystem hey Google what's the weather goingto be like today today in Mountain View it will be a high of 101 degrees wow that's really hot I should find a way to cool off so imagine you have a company smelling internet-connected fans and you want your users to control them from the Google assistant weather using a voice activated speaker like Google home their phone an Android TV or any other supported surface with the actions on Google's smart home API you can integrate your existing cloud connected smart home devices with the Google assistant in this example our smart fan has plastic fan blades and the motor connected to a developer board this device listens to messages from our server to turn on and off you can use any cloud service and device operating system that you want the choice is yours so let's get started with making our fan work with the Google assistant you will need to connect your web server to the Google assistant your web hook will be called when the user gives a command and your server will have to process the request and complete the easiest query you can link this web hook to our project in the actions on Google console just select the option to build for a smart home and provide the URL via web hook in order to make sure each user is only controlling their own fan you will need to set up health credentials so the Google assistant can communicate securely to your server smart home devices connect to the home graph a database which stores and provides contextual information about the user's home and the devices inside for example home graph can store the concept of a living room which contains multiple types of devices from different manufacturers without having to deal with pricing sentences yourself you can handle complex queries like cool down the living room or make my living room light brighter the Google assistant uses information in order to execute user requests based on the appropriate context you're welcome unike twith the assistant servers receiving intent and responding by taking action on devices or responding with information about a user's devices for example what poke will be asked to provide a list of users connected vices via a sync intent it can also be asked to turn a fan on or off with an execute intent applied will have to handle the actual management of the state and execution if asked whether the fan is on a query intent will ask you web hook to provide the current state of the fan when using a smart home api you provide a list of traits that your device can support for example my fan can turn on and off the google assistant handles all the possible ways you can say that you don't write your own grammars nor build a conversational app when you just say tell my workshop fan on please the google assistant processes your command the home graph understands that have a fan in your workshop and that it can turn on and off then the Google assistant will turn that into a structured JSON payload that it tends to your web hook for processing now that web book is done we can open the home of control settings and the Google assistant I can link to the Nick app and get back all of my devices once the devices are synced I can control them okay google turn on the workshop fan okay turning the workshop fan on ah this is much better I hope this video helped explain how to get started with integrating your smart home devices with the Google assistant I think I'm forgetting something okay Google is my smart fan still on yes the workshop fan is on there's a documentation to learn more about smart home and join our community to discuss this with other developers [Music]
