 I have a new home and it's a smart home. And it's a smart home because it's built smartly, it's energy-efficient, but it's also smart because I brought in a lot of new cool technology in it, an Internet connected devices that make it smart. It's an opportunity to test different kind of technology, but I also want to create a secure home so everything related to security is important to me. Obviously entertainment: you got these smart devices and Amazon Echos and Google Homes, the different streamers that I have connected on the TV, toys. And all the old-school stuff like the laptops, tablet, phones. Obviously the TVs themselves are smart, the DVD players or blu-ray players, even the amplifier is internet-connected. So another thing that I have is a smart doorbell. So it is a regular doorbell, but it also has a motion detector and a camera. It detects all the activity that is happening in the front yard, records it on the camera and puts it up in the cloud. Another example would be the smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector. So it's obviously a security related thing, it always informs if something is wrong in the house and obviously it starts alerting when something is bad. I got the F-Secure SENSE router because there's so many connected devices in this home. I wanted to just take care of them and protect them with one solution. Since I like technology, there's gonna be a lot of new technology coming in, so I don't have to worry about protecting them - the SENSE router will make sure that they're protected as well. And I also like the app. The app allows me to manage all those devices and I can block something if I really want to do that. The F-Secure SENSE is a great solution for protecting my connected home.
