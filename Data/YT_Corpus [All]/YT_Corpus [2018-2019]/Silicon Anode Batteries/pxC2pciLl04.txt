 [Music] okay yeah let's get started good afternoon coming to another tech talk of the quantum AI speaker serious and it's actually perfect timing because today we officially kicked off a collaboration between Daimler and Google to explore the use of near-term quantum processors to do quantum simulations for chemistry and materials research problems as they pertain for example to developing new batteries for electric cars and we have here as a guest today andreas Hinton ah who is the specialist at Daimler looking over the area of electro chemistry actually Andreas is a MD a medical doctor and a chemist polymath and he got his degrees from prestigious universities he got this PhD from ETH Zurich and 2010 if I got this right and then who did a postdoc at MIT but since 2011 he is with Daimler and I have to confess everything I know about batteries I learned from Andreas and when I heard him present about it I thought batteries is of course such a crucial element in many technical artifacts that I thought he should spread his knowledge and many people at Google would probably be interested to learn a little bit more where battery technology stands and where it's going to go in the future and yeah looking forward to hearing more from you Andreas thank you very much hard much for giving me the opportunity welcome you to this post and Beyond lithium-ion inside we will have different levels of you know of an inside one will be more close to what's the current state of lithium-ion and of course because that will be one of the potential use cases for new computer-based simulation as well as computer based chemistry a little bit more than more research related past and beyond lithium ah in part but beforehand before I dig in the field of chemistry and physics I would like to use the opportunity just to quickly introduce what the Daimler and in with the main most known brand mercedes-benz is doing what on the worldwide most of our research related to electrochemistry happens in the US and we're another representative Tim McGuire here from mercedes-benz research & development in North America you might see that the californian based research send us widely contributed to the field of R&D locations within Daimler nevertheless the headquarters are in Germany where mercedes-benz as a brand as a core brand is located the range of and the importance of batteries in general mode you will all have one in your cell phones as well in your computers but can be underlined but when you think of the high volumes as well of the need of high energy densities and in particular the safety and life term when you think of the whole product range of work of a comic or a vehicle related to a company it ranges from small passenger cars to large trucks reaches the sub brands like freight line or Western store in the US as well as maybe the best known ambassador of the u.s. worldwide that Thomas builds school buses the yellow school buses because only school buses in the US are yellow and the rest of the world there have different colors are not yet yes well known as what Thomas built buses designed many decades ago and one subtopic will be on the upcoming talk the fuel cell because that is a different application of electrochemistry you might understand it is a hydrogen battery because the processes that happen in general are related to electrochemistry and it doesn't matter for for example for computational related chemistry whether we do computational Relic Emmis tree for catalysts that convert the gas into energy or whether it's a liquid or solid state from the computational perspective it doesn't matter what is converted which type of chemistry into electricity what whether it's gas or whether it's a kind of a liquid or solid that we will see on the upcoming slide just to give your structure of this talk as as promised to you it will have different levels there will be a core level of chemistry because that's the main main focus of my fundamental research or entity I have in Germany as well as in the collaborations in the u.s. boo laughs of look on the latest developments of solid-state batteries it's a hot topic I know nevertheless it's a little bit far down the road and I would like to use the motivation of an insight in raw materials because that is related to one of the driving forces for the company as well as for me because this is related to ethics as well as to sustainability and once we link electro mobility and electrochemistry in batteries in general with the label of Korean chemistry then we need to take care of ethics as well as sustainability all those micro trends in in batteries actually can be some term more in a graphic way that's the same both for laptop computers or cell phones but as well as for any kind of vehicle or aircraft application it's typical capacity because that is the time you can operate any kind of battery for example the lifetime of you during the day of yourself on your computer or the driving range of a potential vehicle safety needs to be very high of course you don't want to have a fire neither in your trousers nor in your home and especially not in your garage or on the road and fast charge and power of course in complications having a lot of power is helpful and nice to have but there's always a minimum requirement in terms of quick charging in the field since youth of us don't have time for to wait for hours to refill the car or refill another kind of application and as I had pointed out sustainability for me personally is the most important driving force because if you don't take care of that then we will lose most of the other promised advantages of any kind of electrochemistry if we have a look on the right side you will see the trans what it means in terms of translation to chemistry this is our notes as well as the electrolytes and cathodes and if you think back to school or college than any kind of battery and even the lead acid better battery in your car nowadays consists of an anode it's one of the electrodes as well as a cathode that's the opposite side and in between there typically is an electrolyte that can be water and acid base like and lettuce it batteries can be bare it can be organic flammable liquid that's a on state-of-the-art lithium-ion and in the future we're hoping that we have new developments in terms of solid-state developments typically a polymer layer or in ultimate solution kind of a Khurram akin to layer that is the most stable but the most complicated solution but just have a look at the current state of the art that's a comparison of cell chemistry's most of you might not be a might not know this kind of war of the presentations it's by explain you the axis on the Left axis you always see the power on what and part on the x-axis you see the energy on the y axis you see the power all this related to the volume because in almost any applications in the cell phone in the computer in the car as well and aircraft volume matters for the car volume is the most crucial powered actually because there's almost no volume left to put a battery and without having a compromise for all the passengers this so-called volumetric gravimetric energy density is the important field with which we differentiate any kind of chemistry's and what you can see from lithium ion it more or less it's a pretty large cloud fulfilling most of the requirements we are looking at and if we have a look to the near future that is about MIT in the mid of the 20s there are even more energy dense chemistry are coming that is what you might know from newspapers and and other article research articles that's in particular the solid-state chemistry where the liquid electrolyte will be realized petrol Kurama class increasing the energy density and increasing lifetime nevertheless the maturity of those applications and you will see that later on is not yet there where we need to have it for the upcoming chemistry's we are working on that's in the end of the 20s these are the more sustainable chemistry's where we try to replace for example all the toxic materials that we still need in the batteries nowadays for example cobalt and nickel by sulfur could be air as well could be oxygen nevertheless most likely it will be something like sulfur because it's an abundant and extremely cheap material and will be along in the yes that before we reach the goal adding something like oxygen or even the full organic batteries the organic battery built in the last part of my talk because then we get really to the post lithium-ion state where we get rid of any kind of metal ion then it's fully organic fully recyclable it's more almost a compostable battery it's not fully compostable but it's made of organic materials you can do this part the yeah that's a good question because gasoline and fuel cell have one difference to the battery in the battery you have the tank or the reservoir as well as the converter combined in the same box once you have a lot of energy you typically get the power more or less because it's just there in gasoline you have the reservoir with the gasoline but the engine the combustion engine is the converter so you can scale the energy that's the gallons of gasoline independent of the power output provided you have hundreds of gallons but the to sell in the engine you won't have a lot of fun but have less fun for a long while if you use a you know eight cell in the turbo engine maybe you have more fun but just for a short time because it converts the gasoline within a short time to much more power that's a beauty actually of the concepts where you can scale reservoir and convert a lag and the combustion and all the fuel cell independent and scale it to their need of the application in the world of batteries we really need to take care of those cloud cloud curves actually or the cloud space because we need to take care we can have extremely high energy dense materials but almost no power and then it becomes feasible by you can add power for example a truck based on those chemistry because you need a minimum of power actually for example to to operate a cell phone to operate the CPU and a computer or to operate a car to drive it uphill that's actually one of the killer reasons why we cannot use this beautiful right field for for vehicle applications or in other words not yet I do the same actually for the power output I will dig in the field a little bit later on typically you see that most of those curves or spaces in in those and this diagram doesn't have a huge field where they meet each other overlap each other there are different types of chemistry with different types of strengths related to power or related to weight or related to volume there's not a kind of a one-size-fits-all solution in the field of batteries for example the current state of the lithium ion has a reasonable range in terms of power and energy compared to weight but it's too heavy for example to operate an aircraft it's too heavy to operate a truck because it will consume about a 1/5 of the payload there might be applications where it's feasible to use heavy batteries but in most applications where weight really matters batteries nowadays are just too heavy that's one of the reasons why for example and I will show you later on let me dig in the field of lithium sulfur which is considered to be a very lightweight but still powerful and energy dense material before we go in the feel more in the deeper field of chemistry about just to show you what happens when you get from what you typically read in research articles or newspaper articles that there might be a breakthrough typically those breakthrough happens on the cell size that is more coin type or small credit card shape cell with less it's not very much energy but it's based on a cell evaluation we just evaluate the weight and the volume of a smaller cell then you are typically on the left part of the diagram just evaluating cell chemistry for any kind of application that needs multiple cells for example a car a large electric computer or aircraft you might need a serious and parallel connection of multiple cells just to increase the energy because it might need more than 100 yds to drive for more than a few minutes to operate the CPU this is bias modules and packs are built from cells where series and parallel connections are attached to each other because cable sensors and cooling plates do not contribute to energy storage this is considered to be a passive material it's essential in the battery pack but some volume is left some weight is added that does not store energy this is just that volume but it's essential so you from the more chemical or fundamental part they lose about half of the energy density getting from the cell to the pack doing all the countermeasures for cooling safety and putting some sensors inside installing heavy weight cables on working on in within this field will generate another type of Wharf but has some feedback on the chemistry tool for example if a chemistry is intrinsically safe if there's no flammable liquid anymore any countermeasures against fires against gas formation can be reduced or can be even discarded or so safe in volume and weight and reducing some other counters measures increases energy density on the pack level significantly we have two large screws we can turn on one is the chemistry in general making it s energy dense as possible the other one is reducing dead volume and dead weight on the peg level increasing energy density which corresponds to avoiding loss of energy density just by negative or passive material countermeasures that's - that's something you need to have in mind when you read research articles when people people only talk about small single cells but making cells of battery packs of multiple cells typically leads to a loss of energy density corresponding to the intrinsic intrinsic factors of the materials for example safety efficiency which for the engineers is a generation of heat that needs to be somehow met by the air conditioning system as well as loss of energy because of a low efficiency if we compare this for just to before because you will need the background I guess for the upcoming table if you compare this for three different type of cars I've used the smallest car we have in the company this is the e smart as well as the passenger cars a trap and compare different type of chemistry the typical lithium-ion actually is not yet a one size fits all but it's a pretty well known and acceptable solution for the next maybe five to ten years with some drawbacks in terms of costed with a very poor efficiency and a very poor sustainability but it fulfills the request between driving ranges well we could cost very well and it's mightily accepted and not yet fully understood but quite durable for at least five to ten years if we go on to scale this a little bit for them will allow vehicles then of course a larger vehicle desperate corresponds a little bit without much question has much more volume left for the battery pack and if you think of a box with the cell inside just on a relative scale the surface to volume ratio changes a lot you can put much more volume inside the same box and don't have almost have no left volume that you Luis actually for cooling requirements this is by one of the reasons my driving range and the cost ratio changes when you scale from a small battery to large battery packs and get even to extremely large systems for example for truck applications I've derived the numbers from what we had filed together with other OEMs to EPA this is why I could put the numbers in but if you have a look at the vehicle cost scale it's not a typical Mercedes Benz cost scale I think we have used average numbers that includes even much cheaper because but on a relative scale that's always true for any kind of car system as well as for the truck application and let's just show the summary because there you will easily point out or find out that the uncertainty for the human nowadays is pretty high the big difference between worst in the best case for a driving range of a thousand kilometers of overall range 512 hours 700 miles in general is very high this corresponds to the material research we are at the moment the classical lithium ion will be some how its exchanged by an evolutionary step within the next year increasing energy density but increasing energy density on the system level to this the best-case scenario if this doesn't work and this is needs a lot of help from organic chemistry as well as computational chemistry then beyond the curve of the case that vehicle cost stays where it is - it's too high actually to meet the mass markets and because some of the numbers were from the cost data derived from General Motors you won't be able to build a mass-market car in the range of 75 to 700 kilometers of driving range for the typical u.s. price twenty five to thirty thousand dollars so then a hundred percent of penetration within the market won't be possible at that yes I didn't hear it for all right now I've got em sorry I just seen it yeah I got it yeah that's correct because the larger the batteries the more weight you put through the wake of the more countermeasures are necessary for the crash structure for safety like countermeasures and this is the uncertainty because it's highly driven by the law it's know somehow driven by physics you can do a lot of another technical scale but it's pretty difficult actually to meet all the standards for example in China and most of the uncertainty above the $40,000 just for this example it's just a relative example it's just driven by Peck development where a potential development on the vehicle structure the crest structure it's a high overhead of cost because then the Paragon itself needs to be safer than the overall car or in other words you need to put all countermeasures in the Box in the pad or Peck and not allowed to use the car itself as a large stretch buffer anymore this is the uncertainty so it's not really actually bad chemistry but it's includes a lot a lot of regulations but any kind of moving objects in daily life vehicles buses aircrafts are part of public regulations driven by law and of course difference between nations somehow influence this uncertainty nevertheless it can be driven down but it will never be a kind of a single curve that worse than best-case we'll meet each other understands the the question or and it's a good very good question nevertheless I don't have a full answer because we do we can influence chemistry and physics we can just somehow influence legislation at least that is not my powerful fundamental resource to have a look on the raw material success just be I don't want to lose too much time on this part actually but just to give you a slide over you because most of us are not engineers in terms of mining raw materials are usually placed in regions in the world works either very hard or very cold or pretty deep under the earth most of the raw materials we need for bed related applications that usually found in the Republic of Congo as well in Cameroon that is cobalt as well nikka sometimes man GaN but those metals are the most important elements we need for energy storage this is related to how you can oxidize materials and reduce those materials in terms of chemistry and we need some of those materials just to to acting in a light nickel and cobalt where the Nick Hobart has somehow the function to occur of the act like a dipper has a diplomatic function in the electrochemistry we called it to be a redox mediator because it's needed to enforce the nickel to be able to store energy those materials are typically metal oxides or metal sulfides in most camp cells you are using in your cell phones or on your laptop computers it's an oxide material of the cobalt it's lithium cobalt oxide it's a very energy dense material but fully made of cobalt and in the upcoming slides I can just show you that supply and demand even without digging food in all the small numbers does meet each other very well there are some applications for example cell phones where there are no alternatives or not very many alternatives but that the upcoming markets to for example the cour as well as the truck fields supply and demand the the blue curves typically show different models for the demand is a collaboration of the US Department of Energy just putting together all the supply and demand numbers in the world written by different applications the curve for the last computational for we did this was in mid of 2017 and sub us was about met by the computational models was somehow met by mining industries thought there's a lot of stockpiling but if we look a little bit further down the road when Eevee Eevee's in vehicles as well as in drugs might have a certain part of the OSHA share of the overall market let's say one to ten to twenty five or thirty five percent and it becomes pretty obvious that even in twenty five in a moderate case scenario supply and demand doesn't meet each other very well that cobalt is one of the crucial elements and I guess you know that maybe so even from newspapers articles is a pretty rare material it's difficult to mine it has some ethical issues because the child Labor's somehow involved in particular in the Republic of Congo and this is one of the ethical issues that your one supplier should have or should take care about because we can label it to be a green element somehow if you take care of all the refining processes in all the chemical processes in the me in that happen in the refining of those elements if the sourcing in general is somehow linked to a situation that doesn't meet our ethical standards it will never be a kind of sustainable way to enable the electron apparel actual traction of a vehicle like electro mobility or an electric vehicle if we built the model and we do some pretty complex modeling for that but you can just put it down because that public I can use numbers that we can easily show and share if you just use a linear approach and just convert some share of the overall EB market like passenger cars all trucks use all the cobalt resources we know and we know them very well as as well as the resource and made some make some assumptions for evey market share for example 11 or 25 percent of passenger cars that are converted to full electric cars you can describe the cobalt supply Barry just easily in terms of megatons or kilotons that are needed per year and the pretty rough translation of all those numbers is if you take into account the chemistry that will happen in in in most of labs during the next about ten years it's about possible to build a hundred millions of mid-size sedans 60 kilowatt hours each with all the cobalt resources we are aware of just to give you a rough estimate eighty five two hundred millions of passenger cars corresponds to what all the car makers produced within one year so a hundred percent penetration within the market won't be possible with the current state of the art of technology we are using in all the applications like laptop computers or electric vehicles this is one of the huge motivations we have to dig in fields like lithium sulphur beyond lithium ion as well as some solid-state applications where we can reduce the cobalt to a minimum or almost replace it get rid of all the toxic elements the rare elements and the pricey elements increasing safety and this is one part will be part of our discussion for the computational chemistry thinking about for example the solid a crystal material for solid ion conductor between the anode and the cathode radio replacing the liquid and flammable electrolytes we are using nowadays and just taking advantage that we can get rid of other toxic materials too just because we got a very safe and very stable electrolyte in the median in the middle as I pointed out in the beginning of just would like to use the opportunity to remind you that there's more than just lithium based chemistry and you will see later on that they are lithium sulfur that is the solid state as well as some polymer based work too in the beginning there is another type of conversion because it's the same most simple element in the periodic table of element this is one of the reasons maybe by electro chemists like hydrogen hydrogen is very energy dense it's pretty clean production at the moment does not and then to be honest is made from natural gas this needs to be changed needs to be a border and electrolysis just from made from electricity nevertheless fuel cell has some advantages when it comes to large applications like vehicles cars trucks or even aircraft because its energy dance is pretty lightweight it's fully recyclable afterwards you just have steam of water nevertheless the fuel cell has still some it disadvantages cannot handle high requests or high demand of power changes so pushing an accelerator and a car usually changes the dynamic of the overall car within a few seconds this not can't be met with catalysts today because when the hydrogen flashes the electrodes there's a catalyst sitting on top of the carbon layers that needs to convert the hydrogen burning with the oxygen converted to electricity this is one of the motivators why we do a lot of work for the catalysts it's similar to the catalytic converter you have an in your carb 4 to convert toxic gases from your combustion engine before it leaves leaves the car nevertheless a lot of research can be done on the solid state of typically oxide materials or metal alloys for those catalytic converters to reduce the price the elements like platinum or rhodium making them more sustainable and in particular more durable on the other hand we would love to increase the energy density or the efficiency to reduce the loss of heat from the electrochemistry side a point of view doing research fundamental research for batteries and fuel cell actually there's not very much difference in between because it's always a kind of catalytic conversion reaction so for from our computational work and this might be part of our ongoing work it doesn't matter actually for which part of the fuel cell or the battery we have a look at typically it will be a solid-state approach for batteries nevertheless please keep in mind that there are some catalytic work for fuel cells too and even in the fuel cell just give me a second to the finish my sentence even in the fuel cell there's a way to replace metal atoms by fully organic catalysts so called organic fuel cell but this is a little bit far down the road that required you mean when you add a fuel cell and kind of forensics and this corresponds to the application typically the the kilowatt of the power output of the fuel cell somehow corresponds to the number of the battery in terms of kilowatt hour that is related because our so-called one-seed charge charge a full charge of the battery within one hour is a reasonable number and converting but not regular power nominal power output of the fuel cell charging the battery within one hour to boodle is a good balance but of course you can play around with the numbers nevertheless increasing the battery size and reducing the fuel cells has enabled the engineers and chemists to reduce the talks the well thats a pricey catalyst of the fuel cell were roughly ninety percent because the battery in general is more kind of a transaxle or well the dynamic happens and that's usually because they don't drive on a girl down at the constant level the battery helps the fuel cell to do what the fuel cell ideal they can do just running a very stable and constant conditions that's a very good question in hydrogen in itself is not explodes if it needs the oxygen correct its corresponds to that now let become to that point it's corresponds to your liquid gasoline in your car you need oxygen due to enable it to react in the reservoir itself in the gas bombs there is no oxygen so it cannot react you must have a leak then hydrogen might get to the environment because the hydrogen is very lightweight you do not run into issues like with propane gas in California you don't have basements but in all the states where you might have propane furnaces and you might collect the propane in the basement just under your house so it won't get outside of the house just because it has less weight than the air this is one of the reasons by explosions with propane for example can happen so why did you have hydrogen in your getting in your garage and it's somehow might leak might Lippe leaking then it would leave the garage much earlier then you can get to a concentration that it gets to an explosive level this is one of the reasons why even in a not very well in and in case of any potential failure of a wall for whatever it might be the the certainty to get to a level of concentration that an explosion might happen is very uncertain the if you think of a battery in the battery house and give every element that is likening this typical explosive that is there to enable it to react in case of a short in a Cell on the battery housing in general you do not need any external element like oxygen to enable it to react like with an explosive just a trigger like us a short in a battery will cause it to form a fire or an explosion so from even as a battery researcher in terms of chem in getting back to the chemistry the battery itself is less safe than the fuel cell concept in general nevertheless in terms of what happens you there billions of cells in your and your pockets as well as on your office desk there's almost no failures reported we are in the level of ppb of fayliss that's actually a remarkable success of large-scale engineering as well as large-scale quality control I share your opinion that or the idea that a gas highly compressed includes some intrinsic risk and the answer from the theory is of course it's risky but it's much more risky to carry around something that can you react without having an external trigger so we do our very best to make it as safe as possible that's that's more the scientific maybe this is the scientific answer there are sensor concepts as well as other intrinsic concept to make it much an increase safety a lot for the battery it's a solid-state concept to reduce flammable liquids so hydrogen is what was one of the core parts to the development of carbon fiber based tanks reducing liquid based hydrogen in vehicles this depends on the driving cycle as I have pointed out here because there's not very much hydrogen infrastructure in the u.s. in particular out of California this would be a reasonable way to use hydrogen as a range extender when it comes to driving at long distances and once there's more infrastructure either fourth quick charging of electricity were quick charging of hydrogen use just what is available because then it's more flexible with regard to how to use the infrastructure this depends on the country shall provide you live in Sweden or Norway may well there's a lot of hydropower or in the u.s. close to Canada where hypo Quebec produces a lot of excess of electricity then hydrogen of course is often a cheap storage as well as transportation solution to avoid to invest in the electric infrastructure but transport gases because for transportation of liquefied gases there is already a well existing infrastructure then it might be worth to think about it for example for trucks and buses for passenger cars because of the overall efficiency and out whether you can beat the regular court and the block just provided you charge with 3 kilowatt a night and stay at home for 8 hours this corresponds to 24 kilowatt hours enabling to drive you roughly 80 miles that may be what the typical commuter won't exceed a day provided you don't live in a very chilly state we only didn't need a lot of heating but let's succeed from the positive angle it enables a lot of flexibility to use what is available to detect advantage of quick charging will in terms of charging or gas instead of just relying on one of the other options unfortunately the beauty of 100% of flexibility we are used to from driving a thousand miles and higher without refill having the refill you need to refill diesel power there are cars seems to be overcome or to end someone in the close of your job just to do and this part of the more technical AMA Quadling this is a kind of concept to show you but you with regard what you are have been asking comparing about passenger car as well as a truck then how to read but you will see a comparison between the years of 2017 this is the solid lines as well as 2014 this is interrupted lines as well for a lithium-ion battery electric vehicle as a fuel cell vehicle this is the blue lines as well as pardon the surrey yellow kind of a reddish lines as well as the blue lines is a so-called plug-in hybrid concept where small fuel cell acts more as a range extender and enables longer driving distances short answer there is not one size fits all again this depends on the overall driving range it won't be reasonable to build a small like a small city car with a fuel cell because there's not too much volume left in the car thought might be a very convenient options on the other hand building a long range truck is doable with a battery but they'll be heavy and will be pretty costly their fuel cell can use all the advantages that hydrogen provides just by nature giving all the high energy density of this of this gas but let's take a little bit more deeper into the chemistry because that's actually where the strengths of my teams are in the fundamental chemistry and as I promised one of the approaches is replacing cobalt and nickel with sulfur you taking advantage of an abundant and very cheap material that usually is available in H and very pristine way from the desulphurization of gas natural gas as well as of true toil when it's refined to gasoline as well of diesel we thought about one of the core concepts using a solid state approach when starting this type of research replacing flammable liquids the electrolyte at least with a polymer that is less flammable of course if you think of a plastic foil this is somehow flammable at elevated temperatures but not at room temperature the ultimate goal would be to convert it to a full comics that we are not yet there I will point out that later but most of the research in lithium sulfur is linked to solid state concepts where all the electrochemistry happens in a solid concept that's very different from all you might know from daily life as well as what nature enables us to do the largest battery you know is actually your body at the end of your nerves where electricity is converted to chemistry and from chemistry again back to electrochemistry to electricity what happens in your nervous system this is a kind of a natural battery but voltages are low energy densities the low it's more used as a kind of digital from a function to transmit signals were everything that we need in cars and water in aircrafts and other applications is always linked to much more important differences in electrochemistry in terms of voltage that in terms of electrochemical electro negative difference just to give you an idea of how sulphur in the world looks like that typically happens in how Abbas the crude oil is somehow process typically in the hub of Toronto and runs maybe you can have a close look to people and some larger cars and just get an estimate how those large mountains made of just powder of sulfur look alike it's just abandoned it's there it's not used for most of the processes because the world doesn't have a high demand on sulfur as sulfuric acid so most of the sulfur is just stored in the landscape it doesn't pollute the world too much because it's not soluble in water that that part it just stands around was one of the driving force is about ten years ago when I thought about lithium cell for metal sulfur research and started in the sodium sulfur and just taking advantage of what's available in nature and what is very close to the opposite of hydrogen that was oxygen as a very energy dense material and if you think of the periodic table of elements one row is that below the oxygen they're self acidic offering a similar electronegativity towards the lithium and self is a pretty lightweight material so we could take advantage of all the lightweight material from the from nature lithium as a lightweight material or metal as well as they were pretty lightweight sulfur without having to do too much too much research for oxygen Bay related chemistry never maybe if you think bad lithium chemistry when people were thinking about lithium or air batteries the truth was that most of those batteries were lithium oxygen batteries because the batteries didn't have the ability you have your body's able to absorb oxygen and just doesn't take advantage of the nitrogen that is in the air to where as for all the batteries we need to filter the oxygen apart from the rest of the air and this was one of the crucial factors but if you mayor didn't work in the beginning because the female in real life was more lithium oxygen and because the batteries do not have a full chemical bloondig the gas cleaning devices the concept didn't work but let's get let's get back to the lithium sulfur walk when you think about a very sustainable concept you need to think about how to fix lithium cell for how to process it in a more sustainable way without using too many chemical steps in between like sulfuric acid that is considered to be toxic to be dangerous we got back to fibers because in nature sulfur in some of edibles you might taste it like asparagus but nature widely uses sulfur to bind polymers together hair typically uses some amino acids to strengthen if you do a permanent of course you bind sulfur chains between the between the hair somehow to give it a shape if natural rubber for tires is converted in the vulcanization reaction we take advantage of sulfur to cross-linked natural rubber to make those more like looking pretty heavy-duty and durable tires any polymer consists and it's the same for nature as well as for chemistry of a backbone structure which at which sulfur typically is bonded sulfur can cross-linked those chains to give it a more 3d structure and make it pretty durable for example the tires for the cow but we can also take advantage of the bonds of sulfur that they have a high tendency to stick to a polymer to a natural backbone of any kind of polymer so the backbone of the polymer becomes a kind of a host that attaches the sulfur to it to each other there are a lot of concepts in and research papers using carbon structure attaching somehow in an adhesion reaction sulfur to the surface but there's no chemical bond that fixes the sulfur atoms to the back to the backbone of the polymer let's say for example here to the carbon atoms this is why we thought about a concept how to fix the sulfur to those polymers the reaction in general leads to polyacrylonitrile based polymers that are widely used for closes that are lightweight for sports like adidas or Colombia the more soft fabrics that gives this kind of nice fielding of sports closest as but what PA and fiber and in general have a wide well-established industry so we didn't be had no need to dig in the field of polymer engineering since the chemistry shouldn't have happened on the fundamental science side if you convert polyacrylonitrile the typical known fibers with sulphur we end up by something we call SP a and sulfur poly acrylonitrile it's not a structured general or it's not muchas one structure it's a wide field of different structures because depending on the catalysts we are using depending on the process parameters we end by very different structures as well as very different hosts because the way how we make those carbon structures the different a lot of difference is actually related to how much sulfur can be infused in those structures how the binding happens to the sulfur how likely the cow bond is to release the sulfur again there are three major types that are known from literature one is the more bulky type with an undefined 3d structures the most ordered one is the so called fiber SP and we're highly defined fiber like hair is produced in a synthetical step with a highly defined surface to volume ratio as well as the so called monolithic concept that didn't work just to leave it up aside for this this side this would be just processing a huge block of a polymer infusing the sulfur as you know it from tire sex or actually from cars but tiles are pretty durable the same happen for that - chemistry just - sure alright yeah that it can be made conductive this depends on the structure how we make it what we have what substitutes we add we can give it some conductivity this can have some fair advantages related yeah in this structure but that's just a symbol for one of all the PA and structures it can be made conductive depending on how we built the poly acrylonitrile structure the core structure without Salva is typically not conductive this is why we need some let's say cross polymerization to make it more conductive you will see the chemistry I think on the next slides maybe then oops sorry on this lag the polymerization the cross polymerization takes advantage of some of the core elements that are known actually from polyacrylonitrile chemistry I cannot disclose all the additives we are using this is somehow related to the electrochemistry as well as to the conductivity the conductivity can be easily measured from those fibers most of the of the additives actually have an influence and how much sulphur can be attached to the backbone because that is crucial provided there's a huge overhead of a kind of polymer structure with almost no sulfa attached to each other the energy density will most likely be very low because the reaction happens between lithium as well as with the sulphur and typically the backbone or the polymer should remain a very stable kind of structure nevertheless we can use for example nickel as well as some other forms to take advantage of some catalytic or pseudo catalytic reactions to steer the reaction or control the reaction and the repetitive units of the polymer the chain lengths typically are the lengths or correspond to the crystallinity of the material or the pseudo crystallinity as well as to the density of the polymer and somehow control the the amount of sulfur we can infuse in those polymer materials before we converted to the final cathode Tyrael it's a pretty complex concept a check cannot just can't fully dig in this field because then it gets to my understanding too complex nevertheless if you're interested in that just come in the break and please ask the amount of sulfur that corresponds to the energy density of the lithium sulfur concept in general is pretty close to a roughness due to 3/4 that's about 75% of the polymer can be loaded with sulfur maybe this gets back to your question and underlines why the structure I've shown is just a symbol of the P and in general provided you have just a few positions worth Coulomb carbon can be bonded to the sulfur the percentage would be much less than maybe 10 or 20% this is one of the answers why we cannot just rely on the typical Pierre and structures you might note from textbooks but need to change it in a cross polymerization where the original structure of the Pierre and just has a very small percentage of the overall 3d structure of a larger polymer that is more likely to be a protein like structure rather than a typical technical polymer structure nevertheless if we look at those fiber based reaction reaction products we get after the reaction it looks a little bit like hair or the fibers you know from textiles were pretty long pretty huge surface but almost no volume and pretty well structures and pretty homogeneous structures all over the polymer after potential in fusion reaction the sulfur using some catalytic reactions we get a well-established SPN structures but maybe I may draw your attention to the few pores we get and we can't avoid them during polymerization they cannot be filled with alpha because alpha that is not bond covalently bonded to the surface might be dissolved in the ongoing reactions form lithium sulfide that is known to be not very conductive as well as my dissolve or diffuse to the anode which is lithium metal and not just my poison it by a passivation of the surface just poison it from any kind and avoid any kind of further electrochemical reaction just the homogeneity of the SPN polymer was the one of the core reasons why we stayed with this concept for the conversion of a polymer this alpha is known to be a pretty difficult stepping in chemistry because it needs to be highly homogeneous if you convert if you compare two of the concepts we have in tech a technical literature one is more the fiber based reaction that is what you might wear as is closest as well as bulk that is a chaotic mixture of a 3d structure there are so-called current density strongly differs this current density corresponds to the charge speed you can apply to any kind of cell for example whether you can charge it within one hour or not this somehow gets back to the question well how fast can a car be charged if it's charged with succeed and in within one sixth of an hour it will be fully charged of course one sixth of an hour that's just about 10 minutes this might be core it might correspond to what you know from refilling a car nowadays it's difficult to do that with electrical grid nevertheless it's an important number for battery related research when it the application might be at all and this one of the core reasons why we need to pay attention to the current density which is the more scientific number of electro chemistry the DMT SS PN hybrid system might need a electrolyte we had we got a cathode material we have a unknown material now we need the electrolyte in between as you pointed out and I have you have asked about the conductivity before about SPN and conductivity of the backbone once fully locked and fully coated with the sulfur it's not very conductive anymore because the sulfur chain sulfur chains are very likely to form bridges fully passivating and hindering the surface of the polymer to undergo any kind of chemical reaction if you use a catalytic real extra light like the MTS or DMD s we found that can easily crack those sulfur chains and if you may draw your attention maybe to the double binding of the sulfur chain and small liquid reaction to the DMT s we can easily correct this or the sulfur chains and more or less activated if you literally take it like that then it's kind of the activation of the sulfur coated surface of the polymer enabling the sulfur to react with the lithium enabling it to store energy and surprisingly maybe it's a surprise but it's easy to describe the chemistry one of the sulfur atoms remains on the surface of the polymer building a kind of grain or seat where the rest of the sulfur will recombine in the other type of the reaction for example in the charging step this is my after fully charging and discharging and charging again the electrochemistry didn't change it changed a lot in the meanwhile because the electric electro chemically active redox active electrolyte contributed to the charging of the system but in the end the solid phase the cathode obviously didn't change thought there was a wide change in chemistry during charging in this charge and this is what you know from daily life from a catalyst it somehow takes part but it is not changed during the reaction just keep that if you compare cycle life that corresponds to the number of miles or kilometers you might live with an overall of a lifetime or how many times you can recharge your cell phone and compare the capacity and the y-axis again if you just think about the onesy that corresponds again to a one-seed charge or discharge within one hour the number of cycles exceeds about what has been reported in literature so far about by double the number typical literature values go to 3 to 3 a 2 to 300 because sulfur is likely to dissolve in electrolytes since we bind it to the surface and it's fully bonded overall the chemical reaction there's no poisoning of the anode material and this is very similar to what happens to catalysts for example in your catalytic converter on fuel cells that once they get poisoned over lifetime they lose their reactivity and cannot participate and and electrochemical reaction but finding a concept to avoiding the poisoning or to have a reactivation of poisoned surfaces we could at least limit in the first step the deterioration of life himself chemistry's never last the concept of polymer based lithium sulfur chemistry is still pretty complex and complex to handle sorry for that for due to time I just skip the slides but there I guess there will be online so kind of a closer look to a spectra that are a little bit difficult to explain the SPN cathode in general is coded in a tri coding step to a current collector because cathode and anode will need to current collectors where electricity can flow through those layers are made of solids as you know it from lithium ion cells and cell phones as well as in laptop computers in contrast to the cells you know we we can use metallic lithium foil which is highly reactive towards moisture as well as to air but it's fully sealed and because we do can avoid any kind of liquid electrolyte that might be flammable we can take advantage of highly energy dense with your metal foil that cannot be used so far in any kind of lithium-ion cells because the reason why lithium-ion is called lithium ion it avoids typically lithium metal foils only ions are moving back and forth between cathode and anode and after the disaster in the beginning of the 90s with sony cells that exploded because they hold some lithium ion metal I know it's the solid state concepts for example if your metal polymers or lithium sulfur polymer systems as well as future qur'anic solid state concepts can take advantage of lithium metal foil because they avoid any kind of flammable and highly reactive organic liquids in the cell avoiding a short enabling the use of high energy dense materials so the advantage of lithium sulfur actually doesn't really come from the sulfur it's a huge benefit to take advantage of sulfur abundant material but most of the advantage of high energy density comes forward from a lightweight and very energy dense anode and this is a lithium metal in a purist and mode very pristine why just to give you an idea how live part yes listen it's fully reactive and high with both board or oxygen and even nitrogen this is one of the reasons my cells have a durable and pretty well sealed housing can be a pouch film that includes for example aluminum layer to block even diffusion of oxygen can be a hard case housing like aluminum or stainless steel but needs a durable and hermetically sealed housing to avoid penetration of oxygen nitrogen moisture this was correct provided they have a liquid electrolyte because then you have mobility of selenium and lithium sulfide to a places where reaction can happen provided you have an inter layer made of a polymer or even a qur'anic then you can easily control the fuse ability of lithium sulfide or hold it too close to the side for example the cathode where the reaction happens in a controlled way and avoid the poisoning on the other side of the lithium your question is fully correct but the answer is yes if you have a liquid electrolyte and no if it's a core polymer system worker romic system solid state in this case is a kind of an enabler of safe use of lithium metal and moreover this was not part of your question but if you look at the surface actually of the of a use lithium anode you will dissolve the film lithium ions will more or less travel to the other other side and come back again they do not recombine in a kind of flat reaction as you know it from for example plating of copper or plating of chromium or blurb lighting of metals on silver male it will somehow form a pretty chaotic surface there's a weakening of those surfaces over lifetime nevertheless the solid-state electrolytes for example we are working on equalize the current density distribution leading to a pretty flat recombination after several hundreds of cycles of lithium on top of leech lithium actually lithium is one of the metals that doesn't like it light itself very much couple likes to play it on itself lithium hates itself it's likely to play it everywhere but not in itself nevertheless you will find that there's a weakening of the lithium an order of a lifetime increasing for example the surface and surface of us is related to reactivity and of course of course to off to lack of diffuse and diffusion properties and diffusion kinetics nevertheless for the time frame we are looking at lifetime of fifteen to twenty years this is a controlled process where we know the kinetic factors for nevertheless even with this kind of coin made cells have shown you before on the sizes for reasonable reasons about the diameter of a compact disc or DVD disc because it's typically spin carried the current density distribution as well as the way how lithium passes through from the cathode to the anode is monitored by Neutron death profiling and this is one of the ways how to monitor lithium concentration within a wall operating cell of a lithium sulfur cell or lithium ion cell and without digging even in the details you can easily see that it's far away from being a homogeneous reaction so far so there's much more work needed in particular for the polymer because at the moment we have a high concentration where we did expect it actually more or less in the center of those disks of electrodes but still the axis is like in biology the less stable parts where inhomogeneities happens and if you think of nature all integrals in nature get to a more radial shape than ninety degree angles there are typically no no specific inhomogeneous part because that leads to an inefficiency of energy conversion this is the same actually for any kind of shape of electro electrode in electrochemistry where you have edges and this is a motivation to take more care of the electrolyte to get lead it to a single iron conductor which can equalize this kind of low of ions from anode I thought one of the reasons to go to and just an insight because I cannot show any kind of details but it's part of a and Department of Energy funded projects in collaboration with here two universities in Michigan this will guide us from the polymer based electrolyte to a full economic made with a protected lithium metal surface to set up that you can see here on top corresponds to what you had seen before you taken advantage of lithium sulfur cathodes but replacing the polymer by a more or less comic solid state system that course that somehow looks like a very thin sheet of paper made of a Kurama kinder layer using lithium metal as the uh note maybe and on top of copper but most likely we will replace even the copper but using a protective intermediate layer made of an inorganic polymer so the lithium and this corresponds to the question whether it's highly reactive they'll be protected by an inter layer made of an inorganic polymer like layer that protects and equalizes the current flow and makes it much more durable in terms of lifetime the title but had included some beyond lithium work and this will be the last few slides I would like to show you because on the long range lithium is not actually powder for any issues about raw materials access nevertheless refining this film even from seawater needs some energy pollutes the environment this is one of the driving forces we think back to what happens in chemistry and every cell in your body for example has a sodium ion pump it can easily pump in sodium's to the silk and pump rotones and nature there's very well in pumping any kind of metal ions since sodium is pretty abundant with sodium chloride that's the salt table salt that you might use in daily life nevertheless the porphyrin structures can be loaded with other metals ions to connect does not necessarily need to be a sodium it could be iron then it's hemoglobin and that's a red part of the blood it could be magnesium that is abundant to than it's chlorophyll that makes leaves green could be other material cobalt in this case then it's vitamin b12 that's very healthy if it's a low dose material it's highly toxic if it's too much nevertheless all those three structures inspired from nature still contain a metal ion and if you want to go to large-scale and want to have it fully recyclable you need to avoid the metal because that makes the large-scale organic structure to be an inorganic metal organic structure but nature does very well in replacing those ions because the way how for example bacteria or fungus makes the porphyrin structures a biotech new process where the overall structure is built before the copper or the cobalt or the magnesium is loaded on top of the structures so we can replace at least in just a symbolic reaction because it's not yet published but we can replace the metal structure building a full organic salt it's a bilayer salt where one part of the reaction is made of chlorophyll the other is made of molecules you might know from sleeping aids as well as from maybe pain relievers in some way but maybe the electro chemistry should keep you awake and a few last slides is just the results it's not yet there where it needs to be and if you think of leaves in nature they tend to bleach out in fall if you think of colors and dyes like ink they tend to bleach out with light because the structure without a metal center atom becomes pretty unstable influences from nature like heat like radiation typically tend to decompose those salt like structures those organic salts leading them to a cross-linking making an organic polymer or what happens in nature just to the composition of those structures so we can get to very high number of cycles could be corresponding to a half a million of kilometers in a car but you need to drive them within one year this is one of the reasons why at the moment the organic chemistry works very well if done within a very short time time Metro sexually organic is organic batteries are pretty far down the road at the moment this is maybe something we need they might think about in 2030 it's an excellent field of research because can be done with almost no energy input inspired from nature that is something we do with the Technion in Israel where we use highly concentrated it's a sea water that comes from a decent education process for making water that can be used for for humans have a genetically modified cell that has no sodium ion pumps anymore but lithium ion pumps increasing the concentration of lithium ions within a cell and after just burning down the cells the biological waste it's a classic chemical process that you might know from other industries then it's just processing lithium salts but because the initial step is inspired just by a kind of nature where we use lithium so Seaboard or highly concentrated lithium sources and enriched the lithium concentration again using a reaction from nature we do not invest any a lot of energy as well as we get rid of all the catalysts that are in nowadays used for enriching lithium ions or concentration for example in salt products that come from Chile or the desert of Atacama just jump over and well get back to this slide about this just an inspiration why we need some computational help actually for this field when you dig in the field of biotech bed race you easily get to a hundred thousands or millions of reactions you need to take care of and this is at least to my understanding nothing that you can do by with humans in a lab that is by computers by they'll be needed or computational help will be needed for this field it leads to filtering out the most promising compounds and I think this is one of the most inspiring aspects may be a future for electro chemistry in the meanwhile there's a long aspect of at least ten years making chemistry safe or more durable increased recyclability and I think this is truly a positive perspective for the future with that said I would like to thank you I think we're ten minutes past the hour but maybe one or two questions people's mind would have time for that thank you very much that was a really really nice talk I did maybe a bit of a technical question for some of the lithium sulfur cycling data was that on a like a coin cell no based on her 12 centimeter diameter disc cells that's a typical format we built we started with small coin tap cells in increased buttons kept the shape so make a pretty large coin type but it's 12 centimeter in diameter and there are pouch cells of rectangular shape the data I have shown here just for code to make a comparison a little bit easier it's made of a disk shape but the disk is pointed out before it's related to how we code those surfaces this is a kind of spin coating process and then of course the kind of cylindrical discussed advantages once you do not dig in the field of coding okay and since we are not engineers I just need to keep the spin coating as sure so my follow-up question is was you tell me what the loading density of sulfur was like areal density because there's the cursor stronger very nice but I know that the big challenge in the literature is getting to you know above like the eight you know eight milligrams per centimeter square and higher it's higher up needs to be in the each iteration otherwise you cannot get it's rather close to 12 okay nevertheless if you think about the y-axis again I can skip back while I'm trying to explain you that the V Doc's active electrolytes somehow contributes because when we get back to this one slide since the TPMS is an electronic contributes to the electrochemical storage if you look it's always the battery if you have a look to the right structure where the lithium sulfide is formed as a derivative of the sulfur coding of the SPN it's how to distinguish which part of the cathode is not in a liquid phase in which still solid after full discharge and recharge it's still SPN and everything stays with a solid phase of the cathode in in an intermediate step of half discharge or half charge there's some energy stored in the salt of the electrolyte and therefore in a kind of extremely thin but a kind of liquid interface this is why it's very different difficult to differentiate what what's the end of this kind of yeah semi cell where does the volume really end and I guess along the same lines what is your ratio of electrolyte to active it's a highly sensitive number two well internet electrochemistry not in terms that can be disclosed this depends on the sulfur loading but the sulfur loading needs to correspond about one by one with the electrolyte one since we use a PNP electrolyte then we can reduce the liquid phase to a few drops per cell so it's almost no liquid in involved and like liquid easily converts to a kind of chela structure then the ratios one to zero because there's no liquid anymore nevertheless the electro active part of the electrolyte needs to be one by one with sulfur and what usually what you might know from literature there's usually in excess of liquid earlier this doesn't help and anything in himself usually it's better to keep it as dry as possible because there's a chemical equilibrium that you can easily just control by providing in excess of something and while it provided you provide in excess of a liquid it will get to another driven to an electrolyte consumption it will be tried out over lifetime but that's exactly the wrong reaction you want to have I see and okay great great answer and then one I think we think was slide 9 or when you're showing the future of going from Seldon yeah exactly cell module so I noticed the 2025 right roughly 2025 all right so and going from selten module there's like like more associated with the the yellow right compared to 2019 is my simple understanding is because you'll be working with some more difficult chemistry's you'll try to engineer more at the module size to get over is that the reason why there's more of a hit there in a way depends on the chemistry if we stay in an evolutionary phase of lithium ion the numbers on the right side in 2025 will be higher we because we read it might be able to reduce the loss of passive material this was a really correlated to why I told you it's roughly 2025 sensitive point actually didn't in research because in what we happen what happens in research nowadays might be driving on roads in 20 24 and 25 it's a typical 7 years difference from now to 2025 and provided we get close to something like a full solid state concept then the overhead of passive material is significantly reduced I see if we stay with very energy dense but elect a highly highly reactive materials that for example nickel rich oxide materials then those right numbers will be even less ok perfect make sure just enabling the the solid state concept will help us a lot to keep the numbers on the right on the peck level much higher than today just because we get rid of safety countermeasures thank you okay Shelby close it out one more burning question okay Andrea thank you so much for that informative talk and thank you guys for coming [Music]
