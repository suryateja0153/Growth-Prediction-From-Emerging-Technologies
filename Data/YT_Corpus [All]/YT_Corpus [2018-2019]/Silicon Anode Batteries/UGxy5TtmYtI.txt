 corrosion is a natural process which converts a refined metal to a more chemically stable form such as its oxide hydroxide or sulfide it as the gradual destruction of materials usually metals by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and stopping corrosion in the most common use of the word this means electrochemical oxidation of metal in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen or sulfates rusting the formation of iron oxides is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion this type of damage typically produces oxides or salts of the original metal and results in a distinctive orange coloration corrosion can also occur in materials other than metals such as ceramics or polymers although in this context the term degradation is more common corrosion degrades the useful properties of materials and structures including strength appearance and permeability to liquids and gases many structural alloys corrode merely from exposure to moisture in air but the process can be strongly affected by exposure to certain substances corrosion can be concentrated locally to form a pit or crack or it can extend across a wide area more or less uniformly corroding the surface because corrosion is a diffusion controlled process it occurs on exposed surfaces as a result methods to reduce the activity of the exposed surface such as passivation and chromate conversion can increase a materials corrosion resistance however some corrosion mechanisms are less visible and less predictable topic galvanic corrosion galvanic corrosion occurs when two different metals have physical or electrical contact with each other and are immersed in a common electrolyte or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations in a galvanic couple the more active metal the anode corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal the cathode corrodes at a slower rate when immersed separately each metal corrodes at its own rate what type of metals to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series for example zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures galvanic corrosion is a major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water containing salts contacts pipes or metal structures factors such as relative size of a node types of metal and operating conditions temperature humidity salinity etc affect galvanic corrosion the surface area ratio of the anode and cathode directly affects the corrosion rates of the materials galvanic corrosion is often prevented by the use of sacrificial anodes topic galvanic series in any given environment one standard medium is aerated room-temperature sea water one metal will be either more noble or more active than others based on how strongly its ions are bound to the surface to metals in electrical contact share the same electrons so that the tug-of-war at each surface as analogous to competition for free electrons between the two materials using the electrolyte as a host for the flow of ions in the same direction the noble metal will take electrons from the active one the resulting mass flow or electric current can be measured to establish a hierarchy of materials in the medium of interest this hierarchy is called a galvanic series and is useful in predicting and understanding corrosion topic corrosion removal often it is possible to chemically remove the products of corrosion for example phosphoric acid in the form of navel jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces to remove rust corrosion removal should not be confused with electro polishing which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface for example phosphoric acid may also be used to electro polish copper but it does this by removing copper not the products of copper corrosion topic resistance to corrosion some metals are more intrinsically resistant to corrosion than others for some examples see galvanic series there are various ways of protecting metals from corrosion oxidation including painting hot dip galvanizing and combinations of these topic intrinsic chemistry the materials most resistant to corrosion are those for which corrosion is thermodynamically unfavorable any corrosion products of gold or platinum tend to decompose spontaneously into pure metal which is why these elements can be found in metallic form on earth and have long been valued more common base metals can only be protected by more temporary means some metals have naturally slow reaction kinetics even though their corrosion is thermodynamically favorable these include such metals as zinc magnesium and cadmium while corrosion of these metals is continuous and ongoing it happens at an acceptable slow rate an extreme example as graphite which releases large amounts of energy upon oxidation but has such slow kinetics that it is effectively immune to electrochemical corrosion under normal conditions topic passivation passivation refers to the spontaneous formation of an ultra thin film of corrosion products known as a passive film on the metal surface that act as a barrier to further oxidation the chemical composition and microstructure of a passive film are different from the underlying metal typical passive film thickness on aluminium stainless steels and alloys as within 10 nanometers the passive film is different from oxide layers that are formed upon heating and are in the micrometer thickness range the passive film recovers if removed or damaged whereas the oxide layer does not passivation in natural environments such as air water and soil at moderate pH is seen in such materials as aluminium stainless steel titanium and silicon passivation is primarily determined by metallurgical and environmental factors the effect of pH is summarized using Pourbaix diagrams but many other factors are influential some conditions that inhibit passivation include high pH for aluminium and zinc low pH or the presence of chloride ions for stainless steel high temperature for titanium in which case the oxide dissolves into the metal rather than the electrolyte and fluoride ions for silicon on the other hand unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected as the alkaline environment of concrete does for steel rebar exposure to a liquid metal such as mercury or hot solder can often circumvent passivation mechanisms topic corrosion in passivated materials passivation is extremely useful in mitigating corrosion damage however even a high-quality alloy will corrode if its ability to form a passivating film is hindered proper selection of the right grade of material for the specific environment is important for the long-lasting performance of this group of materials if breakdown occurs in the passive film due to chemical or mechanical factors the resulting major modes of corrosion may include pitting corrosion crevice corrosion and stress corrosion cracking topic pitting corrosion certain conditions such as low concentrations of oxygen or high concentrations of species such as chloride which complete as anions can interfere with a given alloys ability to reform a passivating film in the worst case almost all of the surface will remain protected but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified and can cause corrosion pits of several types depending upon conditions while the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an auto catalytic process in extreme cases the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter a thin film pierced by an invisible small hole can hide a thumb-sized pit from view these problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys but it can be prevented by control of the alloys environment pitting results when a small hole or cavity forms in the metal usually as a result of de-passivation of a small area this area becomes anodic while part of the remaining metal becomes cathodic producing a localized galvanic reaction the deterioration of this small area penetrates the metal and can lead to failure this form of corrosion is often difficult to detect due to the fact that it is usually relatively small and may be covered and hidden by corrosion produced compounds topic weld decay and knife line attack stainless-steel composed special corrosion challenges since its passivating behavior relies on the presence of a major allowing component chromium at least 11.5% because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment chromium carbide scan form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys this chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary making those areas much less resistant to corrosion this creates a galvanic couple with the well protected alloy nearby which leads to weld decay corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones in highly corrosive environments this process can seriously reduce the mechanical strength of welded joints over time a stainless steel is said to be sensitized if chromium carbide ZAR formed in the microstructure a typical microstructure of a normalised type 304 stainless steel shows no signs of sensitization while a heavily sensitized steel shows the presence of grain boundary precipitates the dark lines in the sensitized microstructure are networks of chromium carbide x' formed along the grain boundaries special alloys either with low carbon content or with added carbon getters such as titanium and niobium in types 321 and 347 respectively can prevent this effect but the latter requires special heat treatment after welding to prevent the similar phenomenon of knife line attack as its name implies corrosion is limited to a very narrow zone adjacent to the weld often only a few micrometers across making it even less noticeable Topic crevice corrosion crevice corrosion is a localized form of corrosion occurring in confined spaces crevices to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited formation of the differential aeration cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts under gaskets or seals inside cracks and seams space is filled with deposits and under sludge piles crevice corrosion is influenced by the crevice type metal metal metal nonmetal crevice geometry size surface finish and metallurgical and environmental factors the susceptibility to crevice corrosion can be evaluated with ASTM standard procedures a critical crevice corrosion temperature is commonly used to rank a materials resistance to crevice corrosion topic microbial corrosion microbial corrosion or commonly known as micro biologically influenced corrosion mike is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms usually chemoautotrophs it can apply to both metallic and nonmetallic materials in the presence or absence of oxygen sulfate reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen and aerobic they produce hydrogen sulfide causing sulfide stress cracking in the presence of oxygen aerobic some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides other bacteria oxidized sulfur and produced sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products leading to localized corrosion accelerated low water corrosion a lwc is a particularly aggressive form of mike that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark it is characterized by an orange sludge which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed at the time of construction are not susceptible to al wc4 unprotected piles sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted sacrificial anode system can be installed affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit which will help shield the metal from further attack topic high temperature corrosion you high-temperature corrosion as chemical deterioration of a material typically a metal as a result of heating this non galvanic form of corrosion can occur when a metal is subjected to a hot atmosphere containing oxygen sulfur or other compounds capable of oxidizing or assisting the oxidation of the material concerned for example materials used in aerospace power generation and even in car engines have to resist sustained periods at high temperature in which they may be exposed to an atmosphere containing potentially highly corrosive products of combustion the products of high temperature corrosion can potentially be turned to the advantage of the engineer the formation of oxides on stainless steels for example can provide a protective layer preventing further atmospheric attack allowing for a material to be used for sustained periods at both room and high temperatures in hostile conditions such high temperature corrosion products in the form of compacted oxide layer glazes prevent or reduce wear during high-temperature sliding contact of metallic or metallic and ceramic surfaces topic metal dusting metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities such as synthesis gas and other high Co environments the corrosion manifests itself as a breakup of bulk metal to metal powder the suspected mechanism is firstly the deposition of a graphite layer on the surface of the metal usually from carbon monoxide CO in the vapor phase this graphite layer is then thought to form metastable m3c species where m is the metal which migrate away from the metal surface however in some regimes no m3c species is observed indicating a direct transfer of metal atoms into the graphite layer topic protection from corrosion you various treatments are used to slow corrosion damage to metallic objects which are exposed to the weather salt water acids or other hostile environments some unprotected metallic alloys are extremely vulnerable to corrosion such as those used in neodymium magnets which can spoil or crumble into powder even in dry temperature stable indoor environments unless properly treated to discourage corrosion topic surface treatments you when surface treatments are used to corrosion great care must be taken to ensure complete coverage without gaps cracks or pinhole defects small defects can act as an Achilles heel allowing corrosion to penetrate the interior and causing extensive damage even while the outer protective layer remains apparently intact for a period of time topic applied coatings plating painting and the application of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments they work by providing a barrier of corrosion resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues there may be trade-offs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high-temperature platings usually fail only in small sections but if the plating is more noble than the substrate for example chromium on steel a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than a nun plated surface would for this reason it is often wise to plate with active metals such as zinc or cadmium if the zinc coating is not thick enough the surface soon becomes unsightly with rusting obvious the design life is directly related to the metal coating thickness painting either by roller or brush is more desirable for tight spaces spray would be better for larger coating areas such as steel decks and waterfront applications flexible polyurethane coatings like dura bec m26 for example can provide an anti corrosive seal with a highly durable slip resistant membrane painted coatings are relatively easy to apply and have fast drying times although temperature and humidity may cause dry times to vary topic reactive coatings if the environment is controlled especially in recirculating systems corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it these chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces to suppress electrochemical reactions such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coding since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed chemicals that inhibit corrosion includes some of the salts in hard water Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits chromates phosphates polyaniline other conducting polymers and a wide range of specially designed chemicals that resemble surfactants ie long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups topic anodization aluminium alloys often undergo a surface treatment electrochemical conditions in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores several nanometers wide appear in the metals oxide film these pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow at the end of the treatment the pores are allowed to seal forming a harder than usual surface layer if this coating is scratched normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area anodizing is very resilient to weathering and corrosion so it is commonly used for building facades and other areas where the surface will come into regular contact with the elements while being resilient it must be cleaned frequently if left without cleaning panel edge staining will naturally occur anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it topic biofilm coatings a new form of protection has been developed by applying certain species of bacterial films to the surface of metals in highly corrosive environments this process increases the corrosion resistance substantially alternatively antimicrobial producing biofilms can be used to inhibit mild steel corrosion from sulfate reducing bacteria topic controlled permeability formwork controlled permeability formwork CPF is a method of preventing the corrosion of reinforcement by naturally enhancing the durability of the cover during concrete placement CPF has been used in environments to combat the effects of carbonation chlorides frost and abrasion topic cathodic protection cathodic protection CP is a technique to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making that surface the cathode of an electrochemical cell cathodic protection systems are most commonly used to protect steel and pipelines and tanks steel peer piles ships and offshore oil platforms topic sacrificial anode protection for effective CP the potential of the steel surface is polarized pushed more negative until the metal surface has a uniform potential with a uniform potential the driving force for the corrosion reaction is halted for galvanic CP systems the anode material corrodes under the influence of the steel and eventually it must be replaced the polarization is caused by the current flow from the anode to the cathode driven by the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode the most common sacrificial anode materials are aluminum zinc magnesium and related alloys aluminum has the highest capacity and magnesium has the highest driving voltage and is thus used where resistance is higher zinc is general-purpose and the basis for galvanizing topic impressed current cathodic protection for larger structures galvanic anodes cannot economically deliver enough current to provide complete protection impressed current cathodic protection ICCP systems use a nodes connected to a DC power source such as a cathodic protection rectifier anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials these include high silicon cast iron graphite mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires topic anodic protection anodic protection impresses a notic current on the structure to be protected opposite to the cathodic protection it is appropriate for metals that exhibit passivity eg stainless steel and suitably small passive current over a wide range of potentials it is used in aggressive environments such as solutions of sulfuric acid topic rate of corrosion a simple test for measuring corrosion as the weight loss method the method involves exposing a clean weight piece of the metal or alloy to the corrosive environment for a specified time followed by cleaning to remove corrosion products and weighing the piece to determine the loss of weight the rate of corrosion are is calculated as R equals K w bro 8 T display style R equals frac kW Rohit where K is a constant w is the weight loss of the metal in time T a is the surface area of the metal exposed and Rho is the density of the metal in gram per cc other common expressions for the corrosion rate is penetration depth and change of mechanical properties topic economic impact in 2002 the US Federal Highway Administration released a study titled corrosion costs and preventive strategies in the United States on the direct costs associated with metallic corrosion in the US industry in 1998 the total annual direct cost of corrosion in the US was ca 276 billion dollars C a 3.2 percent of the US gross domestic product broken down into five specific industries the economic losses are twenty two point six billion dollars in infrastructure seventeen point six billion dollars in production and manufacturing twenty nine point seven billion dollars in transportation 20 point 1 billion dollars in government and forty seven point nine billion dollars in utilities rest is one of the most common causes of bridge accidents as rust has a much higher volume than the originating mass of iron it's buildup can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts it was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in 1983 when the bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support three drivers on the roadway at the time died as the slab fell into the river below the following NTSB investigation showed that a drain in the road had been blocked for road resurfacing and had not been unblocked as a result runoff water penetrated to support hangars rust was also an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia when a steel suspension bridge collapsed within a minute killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time similarly corrosion of concrete covered steel and iron can cause the concrete to spawn creating severe structural problems it is one of the most common failure modes of reinforced concrete bridges measuring instruments based on the half-cell potential can detect the potential corrosion spots before total failure of the concrete structure is reached until twenty to thirty years ago galvanized steel pipe was used extensively in the potable water systems for single and multi-family residents as well as commercial and public construction today these systems have long ago consumed the protective zinc and are corroding internally resulting in poor water quality and pipe failures the economic impact on homeowners condo dwellers and the public infrastructure is estimated at 22 billion dollars as the insurance industry braces for a wave of claims due to pipe failures topic corrosion in nonmetals most ceramic materials are almost entirely immune to corrosion the strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical energy in the structure they can be thought of as already corroded when corrosion does occur it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction rather than an electrochemical process a common example of corrosion protection in ceramics as the lime added to soda lime glass to reduce its solubility in water though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate normal glass does form sub microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture due to its brittleness such flaws caused a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature topic corrosion of polymers polymer degradation involves several complex and often poorly understood physicochemical processes these are strikingly different from the other processes discussed here and so the term corrosion is only applied to them in a loose sense of the word because of their large molecular weight very little entropy can be gained by mixing a given mass of polymer with another substance making them generally quite difficult to dissolve while dissolution is a problem in some polymer applications it is relatively simple to design against a more common and related problem as swelling where small molecules infiltrate the structure reducing strength and stiffness and causing a volume change conversely many polymers notably flexible vinyl are intentionally swelled with plasticizers which can be leached out of the structure causing brittleness or other undesirable changes the most common form of degradation however is a decrease in polymer chain length mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA ionizing radiation most commonly ultraviolet light free radicals and oxidizers such as oxygen ozone and chlorine ozone cracking is a well known problem affecting natural rubber for example plastic additives can slow these process very effectively and can be as simple as a UV absorbing pigment eg titanium dioxide or carbon black plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter topic corrosion of glass glass is characterized by a high degree of corrosion resistance because of its high water resistance it is often used as primary packaging material in the pharma industry since most medicines are preserved in a watery solution besides its water resistance glass is also robust when exposed to certain chemically aggressive liquids or gases glass disease is the corrosion of silicate glasses in aqueous solutions it is governed by two mechanisms diffusion controlled leaching ion exchange and hydrolytic dissolution of the glass Network both mechanisms strongly depend on the pH of contacting solution the rate of ion exchange decreases with pH as 10 minus 0.5 Pico Henry's whereas the rate of hydrolytic dissolution increases with pH as 100.5 Pico Henry's mathematically corrosion rates of glasses are characterized by normalized corrosion rates of elements and RI gram per square centimetre D which are determined as the ratio of total amount of released species into the water me g2 the water contacting surface area s cm2 time of contact t days and weight fraction content of the element in the glass v and R I equals M I s f i t display style mathroom NR underscore I equals frac M underscore is f underscore I T the overall corrosion rate is a sum of contributions from both mechanisms leaching plus dissolution NRI equals and rxi plus and Rh diffusion controlled leaching ion exchange is characteristic of the initial phase of corrosion and involves replacement of alkali ions in the glass by a hydronium h3o plus ion from the solution it causes an ion selective depletion of near surface layers of glasses and gives an inverse square root dependence of corrosion rate with exposure time the diffusion controlled normalized leaching rate of cations from glasses gram per square centimeter D is given by n R X I equals to Rho D I PI T display style bathroom and R X underscore I equals to Rho s QR t frac d underscore I PI T where T is time D is the ith cation effective diffusion coefficient C M to D which depends on pH of contacting water as d equals d 0 10 PX and rho is the density of the glass gram per CC glass Network dissolution as characteristic of the later phases of corrosion and causes a congruent release of ions into the water solution at a time independent rate in dilute solutions gram per square centimeter D and our H equals bro our H display style bathroom and our H equals Rho our underscore H where our H is the stationery hydrolysis dissolution rate of the glass CMD in closed systems the consumption of protons from the aqueous phase increases the pH and causes a fast transition to hydrolysis however a further saturation of solution with silica impedes hydrolysis and causes the glass to return to an ion exchange eg diffusion controlled regime of corrosion in typical natural conditions normalized corrosion rates of silicate glasses are very low and are of the order of 10 - 7 - 10 - 5 grams cm 2d the very high durability of silicate glasses in water makes them suitable for hazardous and nuclear waste immobilization topic glass corrosion tests there exists numerous standardized procedures for measuring the corrosion also called chemical durability of glasses in neutral basic and acidic environments under simulated environmental conditions in simulated body fluid at high temperature and pressure and under other conditions the standard procedure iso 719 describes a test of the extraction of water-soluble basic compounds under neutral conditions 2 grams of glass particle size 300 to 500 micrometers is kept for 60 minutes in 50 milliliters 2 ionized water of grade 2 at 98 degrees Celsius 25 milliliters of the obtained solution is titrated against 0.01 moles l HCL solution the volume of HCl required for neutralization is classified according to the table below the standardized test iso 719 is not suitable for glasses with poor or not extractable alkaline components but which are still attacked by water eg quartz glass b2o3 glass or p2o5 glass usual glasses are differentiated into the following classes hydrolytic class 1 type 1 this class which is also called neutral glass includes borosilicate glasses eg durán Pyrex file ax glass of this class contains essential quantities of boron oxides aluminium oxides and alkaline earth oxides through its composition neutral glass has a high resistance against temperature shocks in the highest hydrolytic resistance against acid and neutral solutions it shows high chemical resistance because of its poor alkali content against alkaline solutions hydrolytic class 2 type to this class usually contains sodium silicate glasses with a high hydrolytic resistance through surface finishing sodium silicate glass has a silicate glass which contains alkali and alkaline earth oxide and primarily sodium oxide and calcium oxide hydrolytic class 3 type 3 glass of the third hydrolytic class usually contains sodium silicate glasses and has a mean hydrolytic resistance which is two times poorer than of type 1 glasses acid class den 12,000 116 an alkali class den 50 2322 ISO 695 are to be distinguished from the hydrolytic class den 12,000 111 ISO 719
