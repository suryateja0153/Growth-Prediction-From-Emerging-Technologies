 Florine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number nine it is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions as the most electronegative element it is extremely reactive as it reacts with almost all other elements except for helium and neon among the elements fluorine ranks 24th in Universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance fluorite the primary mineral source of fluorine which gave the element its name was first described in 1529 as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting the Latin verb fluo meaning flow gave the mineral its name proposed as an element in 1810 fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts only in 1886 did French chemist on Remus and isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis a process still employed for modern production industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment its largest application began during the Manhattan Project in World War two owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine most commercial applications use fluorine compounds with about half of mine fluorite used in steelmaking the rest of the fluoride is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride enroute to various organic fluorides or into cryolite which plays a key role in aluminium refining organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability their major uses are as refrigerants electrical insulation and cookware the last is PTFE Teflon pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation Global fluoro chemical sales amount to more than 15 billion dollars a year fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global warming potentials 100 to 20,000 times that of carbon dioxide organofluorine compounds persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon fluorine bond fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals a few plants synthesize organofluorine poisons that deter herbivores topic characteristics you topic electron configuration fluorine atoms have nine electrons one fewer than neon an electron configuration ones 22s 22 p5 two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one more to be filled the outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 minus 2 equals 7 this affects the atoms physical properties fluorines first ionization energy is third highest among all elements behind helium and neon which complicates the removal of electrons from neutral fluorine atoms it also has a high electron affinity second only to chlorine and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon it has the highest electronegativity of any element fluorine atoms have a small covalent radius of around 60 picometers similar to those of its period neighbors oxygen and neon equals topic reactivity equals the bond energy of die fluorine is much lower than that of either cl2 or bridge 2 and similar to the easily cleaved peroxide bond this along with high electronegativity accounts for fluorines easy dissociation high reactivity and strong bonds to non fluorine atoms conversely bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorines high electronegativity unreactive substances like powdered steel glass fragments and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet reactions of elemental fluorine with metals require varying conditions alkali metals cause explosions and alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk to prevent passivation from the formation of metal fluoride layers most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at 300 to 450 degrees Celsius 575 to 850 degrees Fahrenheit some solid nonmetals sulfur phosphorus react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine the latter sometimes explosively sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity requiring elevated temperatures hydrogen like some of the alkali metals reacts explosively with fluorine carbon as lampblack reacts at room temperature to yield floor methane graphite combines with fluorine above 400 degrees Celsius 750 degrees Fahrenheit to produce non stoichiometric carbon mono fluoride higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons sometimes with explosions carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide reacted or just above room temperature whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions even fully substituted halo alkanes such as carbon tetrachloride normally and combustible may explode although nitrogen trifluoride is stable nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen ammonia may react explosively oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions but can be made to react using a metric discharge at low temperatures and pressures the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon of the other noble gases only xenon and Krypton react and only under special conditions topic phases at room temperature fluorine is a gas of diatomic molecules pale yellow when pure sometimes described as yellow-green it has a characteristic pungent odor detectable at 20 ppb fluorine condenses into a bright yellow liquid at minus 180 eight degrees Celsius minus 306 degrees Fahrenheit a transition temperature similar to those of oxygen and nitrogen fluorine has two solid forms alpha and beta fluorine the latter crystallizes at minus 220 degrees Celsius minus 364 degrees Fahrenheit and is transparent and soft with the same disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens further cooling to minus 228 degrees Celsius minus 378 degrees Fahrenheit induces a phase transition into opaque and hard alpha fluorine which has a monoclinic structure with dense angled layers of molecules the transition from beta to Alpha fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine and can be violent topic isotopes only one isotope of fluorine occurs naturally in abundance the stable isotope 19f it has a high magnetogyric ratio and exceptional sensitivity to magnetic fields because it is also the only stable isotope it is used in magnetic resonance imaging 17 Radio isotopes with mass numbers from 14 to 31 have been synthesized of which 18f has the most stable with a half-life of 109 point seven seven minutes other Radio isotopes have half-lives less than 70 seconds most decay in less than half a second the isotope 17 F and 18 F undergo beta plus decay an electron capture lighter isotopes decay by proton emission and those heavier than 19 F undergo beta minus decay the heaviest ones with delayed Neutron emission two metastable isomers of fluorine are known eighteen millions with a half-life of 162 7 nanoseconds and 26 milli ferret's with a half-life of 2.21 milliseconds topic occurrence you topic universe among the lighter elements fluorine's abundance value of 400 ppb parts per billion 24th among elements in the universe is exceptionally low other elements from carbon to magnesium are 20 or more times as common this is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross-sections allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively beyond this transient existence three explanations have been proposed for the presence of fluorine during type 2 supernova bombardment of neon atoms by neutrinos could transmute them to fluorine the solar wind of wolf-rayet stars could blow fluorine away from any hydrogen or helium atoms or fluorine is borne out on convection currents arising from fusion in asymptotic giant branch stars topic Earth Florine is the 13th most common element in Earth's crust at 600 to 700 ppm parts per million by mass elemental fluorine in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor precluding its natural occurrence it has found only in combined mineral forms of which fluoride fluorapatite and cry light are the most industrially significant flaw right or fluorspar calcium fluoride colorful and abundant worldwide is fluorines main source China and Mexico are the major suppliers the us-led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995 although fluorapatite calcium phosphate F contains most of the world's fluorine it's low mass fraction of 3.5% means that most of it is used as a phosphate in the u.s. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via flora silicic acid a phosphate industry by-product cryolite not three aluminium fluoride once used directly in aluminium production is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals the main commercial mine on Greenland's West Coast closed in 1987 and most cryolite is now synthesized other minerals such as topaz contain fluorine fluorides unlike other halides are insoluble and do not occur in commercially favorable concentrations in Saline waters trace quantities of organo florins of uncertain origin have been detected in volcanic eruptions and geothermal Springs the existence of gaseous fluorine in crystals suggested by the smell of crushed and ozone aiight is contentious a 2012 study reported the presence of 0.04 percent f2 by weight in Antos o'night attributing these inclusions to radiation from the presence of tiny amounts of uranium topic history you topic early discoveries in 1529 Georgie is Agricola described fluorite as an additive used to lower the melting point of metals during smelting he penned the Latin word flue race flue or flow for fluoride rocks the name later evolved into fluorspar still commonly used and then fluoride the composition of fluoride was later determined to be calcium difluoride hydrofluoric acid was used in glass etching from 1720 onwards ondrea's Sigismund Margraff first characterized it in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid and the resulting solution corroded its glass container Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele repeated the experiment in 1771 and named the acidic product flush spat serum fluorspar acid in 1810 the French physicist Andre Murray impaired suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid sir Humphrey Davy proposed that this then unknown substance be named flooring from fluoric acid and the ind suffix of other halogens this word with modifications is used in most european languages Greek Russian and some others following ampere suggestion use the name FTO are are derivatives from the Greek Thoreau's Torrio's destructive the new Latin name florrum gave the element its current symbol F Florida was used in early papers topic isolation initial studies on fluorine were so dangerous that several 19th century experimenters were deemed fluorine martyrs after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme corrosiveness of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride as well as the lack of a simple and suitable electrolyte Edman free me postulated that electrolysis of pure hydrogen fluoride to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce an hydras samples from acidified potassium by fluoride instead he discovered that the resulting dry hydrogen fluoride did not conduct electricity free Me's former student on Remus and persevered and after much trial and error found that a mixture of potassium bi fluoride and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor enabling electrolysis to prevent rapid corrosion of the Platinum in his electrochemical cells he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and iridium and used fluoride stoppers in 1886 after 74 years of effort by many chemists Mawson isolated elemental fluorine in 1906 two months before his death Mawson received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with the following citation I n recognition of the great services rendered by him in his investigation and isolation of the element fluorine the whole world has admired the great experimental skill with which you have studied that savage beast among the elements topic later uses the Frigidaire division of General Motors GM experimented with chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants in the late 1920s and kinetic chemicals was formed as a joint venture between GM and DuPont in 1930 hoping to market freon 12 carbon D chloride f2 as one such refrigerant it replaced earlier and more toxic compounds increased demand for kitchen refrigerators and became profitable by 1949 DuPont had bought out kinetic and marketed several other freon compounds polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon was serendipitously discovered in 1938 by Roy J Plunkett while working on refrigerants at kinetic and its superlative chemical and thermal resistance lend it to accelerated commercialization and mass production by 1941 large-scale production of elemental fluorine began during World War two Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to make tons of the planned incendiary chlorine trifluoride in the Manhattan Project used huge quantities to produce uranium hexafluoride for uranium enrichment since uf6 as as corrosive as fluorine gaseous diffusion plants required special materials nickel for membranes fluoropolymers for seals and liquid fluorocarbons as coolants and lubricants this burgeoning nuclear industry later drove postwar fluoro chemical development topic compounds fluorine has a rich chemistry encompassing organic and inorganic domains it combines with metals non-metals metalloids and most noble gases and usually assumes an oxidation state of minus 1 fluorines high electron affinity results in a preference for ionic bonding when it forms covalent bonds these are polar and almost always single topic metals alkali metals form ionic and highly soluble mono fluorides these have the cubic arrangement of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides alkaline earth dye fluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water with the exception of beryllium difluoride which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz like structure rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic tri fluorides covalent bonding first comes to prominence in the tetrafluoride those of zirconium hafnium and several actinides are ionic with high melting points while those of titanium vanadium and niobium are polymeric melting or decomposing at no more than 350 degrees Celsius 660 degrees Fahrenheit pentafluoride 's continue this trend with their linear polymers and oligomeric complexes third-team metal hexafluoride 's are known all octahedral and are mostly volatile solids but for liquid Moff six and rf6 and gaseous wf6 rhenium hepta fluoride the only characterized metal hepta fluoride is a low melting molecular solid with pentagonal bi-pyramidal molecular geometry metal fluorides with more fluorine atoms are particularly reactive topic hydrogen you hydrogen and fluorine combined to yield hydrogen fluoride in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding resembling water more than hydrogen chloride it boils at a much higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them as fully miscible with water hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form a quiesce hydrogen fluoride also known as hydrofluoric acid unlike the other hydro Halleck acids which are strong hydrofluoric acid as a weak acid at low concentrations however it can attack glass something the other acids cannot do topic other reactive nonmetals metalloids are included in this section binary fluorides of metalloids and p-block nonmetals are generally covalent and volatile with varying reactivities period 3 and heavier nonmetals can form hypervalent fluorides boron trifluoride is planar and possesses an incomplete octet it functions as a lewis acid and combines with lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and invert its group analogues silicon and germanium tetrafluoride are also tetrahedral but behave as lewis acids the NICTA jhin's form tri fluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic the pentafluoride x' of phosphorus arsenic and antimony are more reactive than their respective tri fluorides with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known calso genes have diverse fluorides unstable dye fluorides have been reported for oxygen the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of plus 2 sulfur and selenium tetrafluoride x' and hexafluoride x' exist for sulfur selenium and tellurium the latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms so sulfur hexafluoride is especially invert chlorine bromine and iodine can each form mono try and pentafluoride but only iodine hepta fluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen hepta fluorides many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine topic noble gases noble gases having complete electron shells defied reaction with other elements until 1962 when Neil Bartlett reported synthesis of xenon hexafluoride diamond I fluoride tetrafluoride hexafluoride and multiple oxy fluorides have been isolated since then among other noble gases Krypton forms a dye fluoride and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give argon fluoro hydride helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides and no neon fluoride has ever been observed helium fluoro hydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures topic organic compounds the carbon fluorine bond does organic chemistry strongest and give stability to organo Florence it is almost non-existent in nature but is used in artificial compounds research in this area is usually driven by commercial applications the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity inherent in organic chemistry topic discrete molecules the substitution of hydrogen atoms in an alkane by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties melting and boiling points or lower density increases solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases perfluorocarbons in which all hydrogen atoms are substituted are insoluble in most organic solvents reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium and liquid ammonia the term perfluorinated compounds is used for what would otherwise be a pro fluorocarbon if not for the presence of a functional group often a carboxylic acid these compounds share many properties with perfluorocarbons such as stability and hydrophobicity while the functional group augments their reactivity enabling them to adhere to surfaces or act as surfactants fluoro surfactants in particular can lower the surface tension of water more than their hydrocarbon based analogues flora telomers which have some unforunately topic polymers polymers exhibit the same stability increases afforded by fluorine substitution for hydrogen in discrete molecules their melting points generally increased to polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE the simplest fluoropolymer and per fluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural units ef-2 demonstrates this change is expected but it's very high melting point makes it difficult to mold various PTFE derivatives are less temperature tolerant but easier to mold fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with tri fluoro methyl groups per fluoro alkoxy alkanes do the same with tri fluoro methoxy groups and nafion contains per fluoro at their side chains capped with sulphonic acid groups other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms poly vinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has 1/4 but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers topic production you topic industrial massan's method is used to produce industrial quantities of fluorine via the electrolysis of a potassium fluoride hydrogen fluoride mixture hydrogen and fluoride ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container cathode and a carbon block anode under 8 to 12 volt to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively temperatures are elevated kf2 HF melting at 70 degrees Celsius 158 degrees Fahrenheit and being electrolyzed at 70 to 130 degrees Celsius 158 to 266 degrees Fahrenheit KF which acts as catalyst is essential since pure HF cannot be electrolyzed fluorine can be stored in steel cylinders that have passivated interiors at temperatures below 200 degrees Celsius 392 degrees Fahrenheit otherwise nickel can be used regulator valves in pipe work are made of nickel the latter possibly using monel instead frequent passivation along with the strict exclusion of water and greases must be undertaken in the laboratory glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions some sources instead recommend nickel monel PTFE systems topic chemical while preparing for a 1986 conference to celebrate the centennial of massan's achievement Carlo cristae reasoned that chemical fluorine generation should be feasible since some metal fluoride anions have no stable neutral counterparts their acidification potentially triggers oxidation instead he devised a method which evolves fluorine at high yield and atmospheric pressure to potassium permanganate plus 2 kilo ferret's plus 10 HF plus 3 H 2 O 2 2 k2 manganese 6 fluoride plus 8 h2o plus 3 o2 2 k2 manganese 6 fluoride plus 4 antimony 5 fluoride 4 KS b f 6 plus 2 manganese 3 fluoride plus F 2 Chris day later commented that the reactants had been known for more than 100 years and even Mawson could have come up with this scheme as late as 2008 some references still asserted that fluorine was too reactive for any chemical isolation topic industrial applications fluorite mining which supplies most global flooring peaked in 1989 when 5.6 million metric tons of ore were extracted chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994 production has since been increasing around 4.5 million tonnes of ore and revenue of 550 million dollars were generated in 2003 later reports estimated 2011 global fluoro chemical sales at 15 billion dollars and predicted 2016 to 18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons and revenue of at least 20 billion dollars froth flotation separates mined fluoride into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion sixty to eighty five percent pure met spar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97 percent plus pure acid spar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride at least seventeen thousand metric tons of fluorine are produced each year it costs only $5 - eight per kilograms as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride but many times more is an element because of handling challenges most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ in situ generation under vertical integration the largest application of fluorine gas consuming up to seven thousand metric tons annually is in the preparation of uf6 for the nuclear fuel cycle fluorine is used to Flora nate uranium tetrafluoride itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid fluorine is Mundo isotopic so any mass differences between uf6 molecules are due to the presence of 235u or 238u enabling uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion or gas centrifuge about six thousand metric tons per year go into producing the inert dielectric sf6 for high voltage transformers and circuit breakers eliminating the need for hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls associated with oil filled devices several fluorine compounds are used in electronics rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in chemical vapor deposition tetra fluoro methane in plasma etching and nitrogen trifluoride in cleaning equipment fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides but its reactivity often necessitates conversion first to the getler chlorine trifluoride bromine trifluoride or if5 which together allow calibrated fluorination fluorinated pharmaceuticals use sulfur tetrafluoride instead topic inorganic fluorides as with other iron alloys around 3 kilograms 6.5 pounds Mets bar is added to each metric ton of Steel the fluoride ions lower its melting point and viscosity alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats most acid spar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid which is used in steel pickling glass etching and alkane cracking one third of hf goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride both fluxes in the Hall aero process for aluminium extraction replenishment as necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus each metric tonne of aluminium requires about 23 kilograms 51 pounds of flux flora silicates consume the second largest portion with sodium flora silicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment and as an intermediate enroute to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt nickel and ammonium topic organic fluorides Organo fluorides consume over 20% of mine fluorite and over 40% of hydrofluoric acid with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share surfactants are a minor application but generate over 1 billion dollars in annual revenue due to the danger from direct hydro carbon fluorine reactions above minus 150 degrees Celsius minus 240 degrees Fahrenheit industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as swartz fluorination in which chloro carbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride and the fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride topic refrigerant gases halogenated refrigerants termed freons in informal contexts or identified by our numbers that denote the amount of fluorine chlorine carbon and hydrogen present chlorofluorocarbons CFCs like r11 r12 and are 114 once dominated organo florins peaking in production in the 1980s used for air conditioning systems propellants and solvents their production was below one tenth of this peak by the early 2000s after widespread international prohibition hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs and hydrofluorocarbons HFCS were designed as replacements their synthesis consumes more than 90 percent of the fluorine in the organic industry important HCFCs include r22 clora dye flora methane and our 141 be the main hf c is r134a with a new type of molecule hf o 1 2 3 4 YF a hydro floral if an hf o coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of hfc-134a topic polymers about 180 thousand metric tons of fluoropolymers were produced in 2006 and 2007 generating over 3.5 billion dollars revenue per year the global market was estimated at just under six billion dollars in 2011 and was predicted to grow by 6.5 percent per year up to 2016 fluoropolymers can only be formed by polymerizing free-radicals polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE sometimes called by its DuPont name Teflon represents 60 to 80 percent by mass of the world's fluoropolymer production the largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric it is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed in coating pipes tubing and gaskets another major uses in PFT II coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs the major consumer application is for nonstick cookware jerk PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE PTFE a fine poured membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name gore-tex and used for rain wear protective apparel and filters EPT EFI fibers may be made into seals and dust filters other fluoropolymers including fluorinated ethylene propylene mimic PTFE properties and can substitute for it they are more moldable but also more costly and have lower thermal stability films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells the chemically resistant but expensive fluorinated ionomer Tsar used as electrochemical cell membranes of which the first and most prominent example is nafion developed in the 1960s it was initially deployed as fuel cell material and spacecraft and then replaced mercury based chlor-alkali process cells recently the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles floor elastomers such as Viton or cross-linked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in oring per floor o butane c4f 100 is used as a fire extinguishing agent topic surfactants fluoro surfactants are small organofluorine molecules used for repelling water and stains although expensive comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200 - two thousand per kilograms they yielded over 1 billion dollars in annual revenues by 2006 Scotchgard alone generated over 300 million dollars in 2000 fluoro surfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon based products applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs this use was valued at only one hundred million dollars in 2006 topic agrochemicals about 30% of agrochemicals contain fluorine most of them herbicides and fungicides with a few crop regulators fluorine substitution usually of a single atom or at most a tri fluoro methyl group is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals increased biological state time membrane crossing and altering of molecular recognition try floral and is a prominent example with large-scale use in the US as a weed killer but it is a suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries sodium mono fluoro acetate 1080 is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogen's are replaced with fluorine and sodium it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle first synthesized in the late 19th century it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th and was later deployed in its current use New Zealand the largest consumer of 1080 uses it to protect Kiwis from the invasive Australian common brush tail possum Europe and the US have been 1080 topic medicinal applications you topic dental care population studies from the mid 20th century onwards show topical fluoride reduces dental caries this was first attributed to the conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable floor appetite but studies on pre fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries after studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying six percent of the global population including 2/3 of Americans reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds the benefits of fluoridation have lessened possibly due to other fluoride sources but are still measurable in low-income groups sodium mondo fluoro phosphate and sometimes sodium or 10/2 fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes first introduced in the u.s. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries alongside fluoridated mouthwashes gels foams and varnishes topic pharmaceuticals you 20% of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine one of these the cholesterol reducer atorvastatin Lapita made more revenue than any other drug until it became generic in 2011 the combination asthma prescription sarah tied a top 10 revenue drug in the mid-2000s contains two active ingredients one of which fluticasone is fluorinated many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon fluorine bond is very stable fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon hydrogen bond and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability tricyclics and other pre 1980s antidepressants had several side-effects due to their non selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective in one of the first to avoid this problem many current antidepressants received the same treatment including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram its isomer a citalopram and fluvoxamine and paroxetine quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects these include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin fluorine also finds use in steroids fludrocortisone as a blood-pressure raising mineralocorticoid and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids the majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries later compounds such as the fluorinated ether sevoflurane and dis fluorine are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood allowing faster waking times topic pet scanning fluorine-18 is often found in radioactive tracers for positron emission tomography as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers the most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which after intravenous injection is taken up by glucose requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors computer assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging topic oxygen carriers liquid fluorocarbons can hold large volumes of oxygen or carbon dioxide more so than blood and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water they must be mixed into emulsions small droplets of perfluorocarbons suspended in water to be used as blood one such product oxy site has been through initial clinical trials these substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports one cyclists near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse applications of pure pur fluorocarbon liquid breathing which uses pure pur fluorocarbon liquid not a water emulsion include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs partial and complete lungs filling have been considered though only the former has had any significant tests in humans an alliance pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies topic biological role fluorine is not essential for humans or other mammals small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength but this has not been definitively established as there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets natural organofluorine have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals the most common is fluoro acetate which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa Australia and Brazil other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids fluoro acetone and two flora citrate an enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon adenosyl fluoride synthase was discovered in bacteria in 2002 topic toxicity elemental fluorine is highly toxic to living organisms its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanides 50 ppm and are similar to those of chlorine significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm an inhalation of 1000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide topic hydrofluoric acid hydrofluoric acid as a contact poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid even though it is weak it remains neutral and aqueous solution and thus penetrates tissue faster whether through inhalation ingestion or the skin and at least nine US workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994 it reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160 square centimeters 25 in two can cause serious systemic toxicity exposure may not be evident for eight hours for 50 percent HF rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations and a burn may initially be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function if skin has been exposed to HF damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10 to 15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing calcium gluconate is often applied next providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously using calcium chloride a common laboratory reagent in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated and may lead to severe complications excision or amputation of affected parts may be required topic fluoride ion soluble fluorides are moderately toxic five to ten grams sodium fluoride or 32 to 64 milligrams fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass represents a lethal dose for adults one-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects and chronic excess consumption may lead to skeletal fluorosis which affects millions in Asia and Africa ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines where it crosses cell membranes binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes before urinary excretion exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions historically most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride containing toothpaste malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment as another cause one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below 6 brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste one regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases including one death from ingesting insecticide most had no symptoms but about 30 percent had stomach pains a larger study across the u.s. had similar findings 80 percent of cases involved children under 6 and there were few serious cases topic environmental concerns you topic atmosphere the Montreal Protocol signed in 1987 set strict regulations on chlorofluorocarbons CFCs and bromo fluorocarbons due to their ozone damaging potential ODP the high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant that they were not decomposing until they reached higher altitudes we're liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules even with the ban and early indications of its efficacy predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery with 1/10 the ODP of CFCs hydrochlorofluorocarbons H CFCs are the current replacements and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030 to 2040 by hydrofluorocarbons HFCS with no chlorine and zero ODP in 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited 1h CFCs production and kept those of to others in 2003 fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global warming potentials GW peace of about 100 to 10,000 sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000 an outlier as HF Oh 1 2 3 4 YF which is a new type of refrigerant called a hydro floral elephant HFO and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1430 for the current refrigerants standard hfc-134a topic bio persistence Organo florins exhibit bio persistence due to the strength of the carbon fluorine bond for fluoro alkyl acids PFA S which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups are noted persistent organic pollutants perfluorooctanoic acid P Foss and perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA are most often researched PFA A's have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans with P Foss and PFOA known to reside in breast milk in the blood of newborn babies a 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFA a-levels and human activity there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating and higher amounts of pee Foss were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA in the body PFA A's bind to proteins such as serum albumin they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys dwell time in the body varies greatly by species with half-lives of days in rodents and years in humans high doses of pee Foss and PFOA caused cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels topic C also you topic notes you topic sources
