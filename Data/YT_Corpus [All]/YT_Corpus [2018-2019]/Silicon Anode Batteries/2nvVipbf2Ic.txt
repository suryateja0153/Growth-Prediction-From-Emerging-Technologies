 all right how you guys doing today good ok cool so you guys know that this class is all about semiconductors and nanotechnology we're going to look at one of the most fundamental semiconductor devices and that is a diode so tonight we're going to learn all about diodes. We're going to start with a quick review of function generators and oscilloscopes we talked about last time. we'll go over a little bit about what those are and how they work then we'll get into our lecture we'll talk about what diodes are why they're important and then how they work we're going to do a bit of a deep dive into the physics of diodes today this is probably the most physics that we're going to do all semester so if it starts getting into the weeds a little bit and it's not 100% clear don't stress we're not gonna this is not going to be a huge part of a test or anything but we just want to get into it a little bit and tell you a little bit about how so it can work since a lot of the devices we talk about are based on its organ yeah talk a little bit about physics then we'll talk about the behavior of diodes their their characteristic curve how they behave when we put whole teach on them in one direction and then voltage them in the opposite direction then we'll talk about a couple of special cases for diodes okay so that's going to be the majority of our lecture today from homework I want to remind you that we have a syllabus page on canvas so if you're ever wondering about what homework to do or what reading should go along with a particular topic you should go to the syllabus page I recommend checking that every night that you're here for tonight in particular you should start on the diode homework in the lab look that word in the lab book and the diode quiz on you know I know that's a lot of homework you don't have to finish it all right away we're gonna be talking about diodes next time as well so you'll have a couple of nights to do this but I just wanted to make you aware of these assignments and let you get started on those yeah yes yeah do the quiz as many times as you want you get to keep the highest score so no penalties for trying over and over again in fact I recommend it and I think it's good practice okay it is cuz it sinks in better yeah yeah so that's what any questions about what we're gonna be doing tonight before we get started okay cool so then let's start with a quick review of function generators and Apostolou scopes we use these pieces of equipment to test out circuits you learned a little bit about them last time one of them creates so you'll send the other one measures signals which one creates the signals yeah the function generator exactly so let's talk about some of the controls on the function generator the first type of control that we mentioned allowed us to select what type of waveform or signal we're going to create essentially the shape of the waveform so what kinds of shapes are available in these function generators so whether sine-wave looks kind of like this what are some examples in nature or in the real world where we might see some waves yeah music and audio exactly a pure tone from a strum on a guitar string is a sine wave a lot of pure tones that you a pure audio tone is always a sine wave the pitch of the tone is determined by the frequency so audio is a great example for sine waves yeah yep analog signals exactly the next type is a square wave where are some places where we might find the square wave in digital testing yeah yeah digital signals are typically made up of square waves so you know the digital is either on or off one or zero in electronics that's often represented by a high or a low voltage so I square wave is high some of the time and most of those are so that's square wave a sawtooth wave feels like this looks kind of like a shark's fin it might mean that way or it might mean you gather way in both cases it's called a sawtooth wave hard for me to think of an example where we might use a sawtooth wave in nature in the real world but there are many many many circuits out there I'm sure that there are lots of places where sawtooth waves are out of the books and then triangle waves look like this there's that in both cases again not something that you see every day but it might be useful in various circuits we I think if we use sawtooth waves in certain types of analog to digital converters actually so so that's one place well yeah so digital time too yeah so if you if you did an integral of a square wave then you would get a triangle wave and to get an integral of a triangle wave would look kind of like a sine wave and we'll see integrators and differentiator circuits a little bit later in the semester so we'll see how we can actually we had our own square waves and then use that to generate a triangle wave and a sine wave so we can you create our own function generators we'll see that in a company from several several weeks women so so those are some of the shapes that we can play the tower function generator what are some other controls in the functional rate yeah frequency so the frequency is how often the signal repeats right high frequency is a signal that repeats very quickly a low frequency is something that takes a long time to repeat and then frequency was related to something else if you measured the top of one way to the top of another wave what was that amount of time called Jerry yacker period then there was a formula where you could you could calculate the period of even the frequency for vice versa you guys remember what that formula was went over whatever the other one isn't doing nicely so frequency is 1 over the period and the period exactly the frequency yeah yep so if you know one you can figure out the other one so you can set the frequency with the function generator and therefore also security what was the last control that we looked at on the function generator the amplitude yeah so the amplitude was how favor the voltage was so a small amplitude that do something like this a large amplitude like you something like that and there were a couple of different ways that we could label the inner tube what were some of the different measurements that that we had for the amplitude yeah p2p was a very common one so that was the very top to the very bottom one key to another just peak yeah so another one was just peak amplitude and that was from the middle of the signal to to the top yeah then that the RMS was the last one and you said that for a sine wave yeah exactly you guys are way ahead of me this is great so for RMS there silently the RMS value is 0.707 times the peak so if you know what the peak value is you can calculate the RMS comment or vice versa so any questions about the amplitude okay so we can set all of those things with the function generator so again the function generator creates the signal and we can choose all of these different settings to create the type of signal that we want the other instrument that we looked at was the oscilloscope and the oscilloscope measured the signals so the function generator creates them the oscilloscope measures them the oscilloscope was kind of like a camera it looks at the signal it shows you it it shows no signal to you but it doesn't actually change the city right just like taking a picture of something doesn't change it using the oscilloscope will let you measure the signal but it won't change the signal so if you want to change the signal you have to change the thing that's creating it in our case that was the function generator if you're testing a circuit and you wanted to change the signal you might have to change the circuit to regular so the oscilloscope never changes the signal it just lets you look at it so let's talk a little bit about oscilloscopes from the main window on an oscilloscope looks dumb like this and it's got these dashed lines vertically and horizontally and together these dashed lines create boxes you guys remember what each box is called a division yeah and there are markings or indications down here down at the bottom of your window that tell you how big each of these divisions is so there's one marking that is labeled volts per division and then there's another one what is the other one they are division exactly so these tell you how big each boxes so if it said two volts per division that would mean that each one of these boxes represents two poles going up voltage is in this direction and time is this way okay so you had two volts per division that would mean each box is 2 volts tall if you had say 3 seconds per division then that would mean that each box was 3 seconds why do you have a question oh yeah okay yeah so these indications tell you how big each box is and by looking at those indications you can actually get a sense for how large a signal might do so if we had a signal that went like this we could see that it was two boxes from the middle of the signal to the top so what would be the peak amplitude in the middle of the signal to the top four vaults exactly there's two boxes two divisions and each division is two bolts so that's a total of four volts for a peak amplitude and then we can measure the the period of the signal as well so remember the period is the length of time from one spot on the signal to the same spot so we can pick the length of time from right here this point on the signal to the right there and we can see that that's one two three four boxes wide each box is three seconds so what would the period be twelve twelve seconds exactly now so you can you can just eyeball the signal and get a good rough approximation of a period amplitude and then if you know the period you can calculate the frequency right so that's a good method for to get an approximation of how big your signal is but there are certain ways that the oscilloscope allows you to get more precise measurements as well so there were there were two main ways that we could get more precise measurements what was one of those things yeah there's a measure menu on the oscilloscope you can that gives you access to some built in measurement capabilities so if you hit the measure menu that that allows you to get a whole bunch of different measurements and you can have up to five of them on the screen of these oscilloscopes at the same time so what were some of the measurements that you could pull up on the screen yeah sure beep - beep that's awful an abbreviation for P to be PK - PK don't slow people's yeah wait so those are all being amplitude measurements that we talked about where are some of the other regimens you'd begin here yeah hey what's one over the period frequency to frequency so you can get that measurement as well and then there were some measurements related to - oh yeah duty say exactly so um but the duty cycle wasn't on there exactly it was remember the the duty cycle was the amount of time that the signal was high divided by the total amount yeah so the positive width I know it's kind of a funny way of saying it I think it was abbreviated cause yeah exactly so when when you want to calculate the duty cycle you you get the positive width measurement and then you you figure out the period and the duty cycle is the positive wave divided by the period great so so that's one way of getting precise measurements off the oscilloscope you can use the measure menu and you can get these and lots of other versions as well what was the other general way of making amendments on unsociable yeah cursors exactly so cursors allow you to make precise measurements as well remember cursors were those those lines then went across the oscilloscope so you could either make horizontal lines or vertical lines and then the oscilloscope would tell you a distance between those lines so they were vertical you could line them up with the same point on the wave and then the oscilloscope would tell you the distance between them and that would be what what would that give you the period exactly and the oscilloscope actually assumes that you're going to be using those cursors to calculate a period and so when you when you line that up it also does the math for you and it calculates the frequency at the same time so if you line them up to measure the period it will tell you the frequency for free frequency and so that's that's what you get when the cursors are vertical what sorts of measurements do you get when the cursors are horizontal yeah voltage you can ya measure B if you line them up with the top of the bottom then the difference in the voltage will give you the amplitude exactly oh and we have a very special guest tonight everyone this is dr. Trish Caldwell she's the Dean of our department and she just wanted to welcome you all to this amazing so let's give her our attention for a few minutes thank you sorry for interrupting I'm Trish and I did just sorry to say but we're delighted that you chosen to take classes in this program and you're very good with Jordan and all of his colleagues and I wanted to remind you if you didn't know we have counselors who are available just for students who are in technical education we'll just one of these programs with a lot of them but you are a student in those programs and it's really helpful to check in where the counselor have how many ever worked with accounts are here on campus oh good yeah and it's helpful to have somebody know what our programs are like so Heather's housed in our technical education fact of the office filming which is basically right over there and you can go in and make an appointment with her she's part time that we should be getting another person on board here pretty soon so there'll be more hours available but it's it's very much choice about spending you and a half an hour before to your gym to speed secondly there's a swimmer named look at all this oh god oh who is a representative of SATA ii we don't limit rating agencies also there was the Metalworks which is an outside agency that helps with hiring I've been helping people get hired and she's also housed in our ticket offices she's here to serve the entire campus but we like to take advantage of her since she's in our offices and nobody knows much about her so I'd encourage you to meet with her you can go in that check out office and think of recording call her directly and look inside it's posted up in here in game so she can help you with your resume with suggested employers maybe connections with those employers I know someone out online applications are really kind of weird so she could not go back to and she also dependable your situation and she may have resources that are available to you it's sort of limited but sometimes they're tools and things that you can favor so so we're checking out and also just wanted to remind you or at least tell you if you didn't know that there are a lot of resources available on campus just to help you as a person let alone help you as a student succeed Devon you're struggling with reading or math there are resources or tutors available that you can work with there if they're personally struggling with even relationship issues there are people on campus and organizations on campus they can help you there's a really robust you probably know if you're a veteran but if you don't know in your router there's a really good reference resource here at center here so one pensa nodding is one of the best in the state and a great resource and we have some faculty from here actually and there's a pride center or they're just all kinds of things happening on campus it's a really interesting place to be but just know that there's a lot of support for you if you need any help there just let Jordan know or let me know and we'll point you in the right direction and I found one other thing how many of you knew or participated in celebrate career education last year yeah oh all right good job that's the most time perfect so far we're gonna be doing it again this year it's an event to recognize all the hard work that you could doing whether you're going to graduation or not you're working hard and that's all you really need to do and so we'd like to do that was it'll be bigger this year we'll be informal you don't have to rent a Kappa or gown you can just wear whatever goofy saying a shoe like peak wigs and stuff but anyhow he'll do that graduation to tell her the big gym you walk in all together I mean all that electronics people would be together so we'll do that again and it all helps us because you register with the contact information Santa Rosa Junior College will contact some of the students here later and ask you some very specific questions about what you're doing where you're working how the program benefit view or didn't likely to correct those kinds of things 26 questions really helpful so it's a two-fold reason to be better and that's it do you have any other questions yes no his unfortunately he's been assigned to a new project this year's publish Eve so he used to on campus but he's a scientist very specific thing but we're trying to get somebody else back but Heather Heather Hughes is that yeah Heather is still here and she's fabulous so yes it's all good they know us which is the big deal for many there are always all sorts of anecdotes that the older faculty have about sending students across the road as we call it okay general counseling and in their defense they've got a lot of programs to to know about and they come back with incorrect information then take the incorrect class and they're still here so we're trying to get rid of oh man besides it's fun to ever around so okay we won't take any more time thank you very much all right and we'll see you around campus thank you thank you yeah my teacher said there's lots of great resources on here please feel free to ask me if you have any questions or ask Trish she's over in the TechNet Department I'd be happy to point you in that direction so any questions before we get back to them germs okay so we were talking about cursors we said that they could when they're vertical they could measure the period or the frequency when they're horizontal they can measure the voltage between them and so if you line them up with the top and bottom of your your waveform they will give you the peak to peak amplitude if you line one up at the top and the other one in the middle then that would give you the peak amplitude and so on so where what is an example where you might want to use the measure function versus and then what's an example of wave use the cursor approach yeah yeah exactly so the measure function is very precise and if you have a nice clean signal then the measure function will do a good job for you and it will it's really fast right because it's already built-in you don't have to dial the cursors around it's just there so for last clean signal the measure is perfect what's a problem with a noisy signal why would the measure not work so well with the noisy see it might mistake the signal that you're trying to read yeah exactly might get a little bit confused right Sophie if your signal is like this you want to measure that frequency but but it's actually got a little bit of noise on here sometimes the measure function gets confused and ends up measuring the frequency of the noise instead of the signal that you want or when you're talking about measuring the amplitude the measure of truancy measures the arms like the measure function measures the very top of the signal to the very bottom so if you've got some little spikes on there it'll measure the top of the highest spike to the bottom of the lowest spike and that might not be that the actual measurement that you want to think so when you have a noisy signal you can use the cursors and dial them in exactly where you want them to measure and then get that measurement that way okay and that's why it's important to be able to kind of eyeball the signals so that you can tell the measurement lives in the right ballpark or whether it's way off so any questions about the oscilloscope like I said last time both the oscilloscope and the function generator are tools that were going to be using throughout the semester so you guys will have lots and lots of chances to practice with these so it's good to become you'll here with them as soon as you can so that was the review that I wanted to do we talked a little bit about function generators little about oscilloscopes so now I'd like to move on and talk about diet okay so we talked about diodes a little bit in 83 o2 simply remember the sort of the fundamental definition the basic function of the diode it's like a like a check valve yeah like a check valve it's only one oh right a one one direction valve for electricity no it allows electricity to go through in one direction but it blocks it from going the other way okay so the diode symbol looks like this it's got two sides anybody remember what this side is called anode exactly and the other side that I heard somebody say it cathode so when you put a a positive voltage on this side and negative voltage on that side is this forward bias to reverse bias forward times it's not great those are remembering this is good there's electricity flow in that direction yeah and there there's a voltage drop across the diode anybody remember what that voltage drop is approximately yeah right about 0.6 to 0.7 volts somewhere in that direction so we're somewhere in that range it's not precise but it's somewhere between 60 point 7 volts and does that change much with the amount of Fulton or the amount of current that's flowing through the diode no it's pretty constant we're gonna be doing some homework with diodes and they will want you to assume a particular voltage drop across the diode so for the purposes of homework you can say that it's 0.7 volts but really it's somewhere in that range so if we put the voltage in the other direction that's not forward bias anymore what is that called yeah so that's reverse-biased does the electricity flow no electricity and a voltage is the whatever voltage you apply it so if you had if you were putting ten volts across here then you get ten volts if you're putting twenty volts it could be twenty volts so you can hold as much voltage as you want within its specified operating range yeah if you go out of the range doesn't just melt down or what happens yeah so a typical diode will will experience catastrophic failure as they say so basically it'll burn up and will explode it'll it'll melt down I mean if you're going just a little bit outside the range it might overheat and start to melt if you go way outside the range of might explode but in any case it's gonna be damaged permanently no longer be a diamond yeah they would no longer function and while we're talking about diodes I want to pass around a couple of examples so we have some small diodes a typical diode that's a typical diode looks like this this is a small little case I'll pass this around basically it's a wire and then it's a cylindrical body and the body is mostly black but it's got a silver stripe on one side so the silver stripe corresponds to the lion on the diode symbol okay so that's a typical diet that's a great common sight in electrical circuits but there are also larger diodes so this is an example of a diode and this is an even bigger diet so yeah I'll pass those around you guys can check those out those work in the same way they have the same physics that we'll talk about in a minute they still act as a one-way valve for electricity but the difference is that these can handle a lot more current but they still have about the same voltage drop across them so if you were to test them with a normal meter you can still see about a point six four point seven volt drop across waves okay so the main difference is that they handle more current so yep the basic function of a diode any questions about what diodes are okay so then you might ask well why do we care why are we gonna spend time on these right there's lots of interesting components out there why diodes well diodes are used in lots of different electrical circuits they have many many different applications one of the most common is power supplies you guys were in each 3:02 so you probably remember that we both power supplying circuits and we'll build some more of those this semester will actually build a positive and negative power supply circuit and we'll get into a little bit more details with those as well so that's one common application for diodes diodes are also used in signal processing applications especially for radio frequency signals so we'll see that and they can be used in charge of public circuits that we'll be talking about later in this semester as well so really diodes are one of the most fundamental components in electronics in there they're used all over the place so that's why we're gonna spend some time getting to know how they work both from a theoretical physics standpoint and also from a practical application standpoint about why we care any questions about that okay so then let's get into the physics of how diodes actually work and to understand this we have to understand the material that diodes are made out of which is primarily silicon so again like I mentioned at the beginning of this class the fluids that we talked about today it's probably going to be the most and the deepest dive into physics all right so it's a little bit complicated a little bit in the Queenie ins don't worry too much about it if you have questions of course let me know but if some of the terms are unfamiliar stuff like that don't worry about it too much okay so here we go basically diodes are made of silicon and silicon is an element and all elements are atoms and atoms include a nucleus and then electrons around the nucleus okay so nucleus would be here it's got protons and neutrons in it and then it's got electrons around it and these electrons fit into various shells and some shells are closer to the nucleus and sub shells are farther apart farther away from the louvers and the electrons in the outermost shell are the ones that interact with electrons from other elements nearby so these are the ones that that are touching and interacting with other nearby Alma's so these are the ones that primarily determine how this atom interacts with other nearby elements so so the number of atoms are inside the number of electrons in this outermost shell is really what what determines the properties most of the properties of this element so this outer shell has a fancy name it's called the valence shell and the electrons in the valence shell are called valence electrons now who remembers a the simple definition for what electricity is yeah but slower the movements of electrons right so one of the most important characteristics from an electrical standpoint of an element is how tightly that element holds on to its valence electrons if it only has a very weak grasp on those valence electrons then it's going to be easy for those electrons to hop over to a nearby atom and so it's going to be easy for those electrons to move in other words that element would conduct electrons it would conduct electricity easily so if it has a loose grasp on the valence electrons they can be conducted easily if it holds on to its valence electrons tightly and doesn't let them go that's gonna make it hard for those electrons to move it's gonna make it hard for the electricity to flow so if it's holding on tight that type of element would be a poor conductor or another way to say that is that type of element would be a good insulator okay all right so that's a little bit about atoms and electrons so let's talk about the type of material that we're interested in which is soybean sodium has four valence electrons so it's got four electrons in its outermost shell and what happens with silicon is that when you have a whole bunch of silicon together and it's grown in a pure way then it forms a crystal structure so if you have a bunch of pure silicon what you have are these silicon nuclei like this and then around the nuclei you have these valence shells and each valence-shell has four electrons in it what's it well they each share a bit together kind of like puzzle pieces yeah they sort of share them so at each of these junctions there's these you can think of it as two electrons so basically the the silicon atoms bent together in this really nice crystal structure they're they're kind of like puzzle pieces that are intermeshed with each other and everything fits very snugly so yeah exactly so these electrons are very happy where they are they don't want to move right they don't want to go anywhere so that means that is this a good conductor or good insulator it's a pretty good insulator yeah yeah exactly it's a good insulator and another name for pure silicon is intrinsic intrinsic silicon yeah so pure intrinsic silicon is pretty good instantly but scientists have discovered a way to introduce other types of elements into a silicon crystal structure so certain types of elements have an extra valence electron so some examples of these our arsenic antimony and bismuth so what happens is that if you introduce one of these other elements that have five valence electrons then then you get a crystal structure like this so you got a silicon and then you got arsenic there and then you still got the the other silicon nuclei around so we're the silicon is right next to another silicon you still have the normal sharing arrangement that we had before but now where you have the arsenic you've got the normal sharing plus you've got one extra valence electron hanging out in there so you've got this extra guy just kind of yeah just sort of sitting in there with no real place to fit in it's not really bonded he's just yeah yeah exactly so since it doesn't have a place to fit in like you said it's able to move or easily so there's this extra extra electron electrons have a negative charge to them so when you have extra electrons hanging around the whole material has a slightly negative charge to it so this is called n-type so it may be or negative charge so and endotex okay and since it's got this extra electron that can move this is a relatively good conductor well right I'm only drawing more the electron but of course in a real right right it's not going to be as good as a as a wire but it is still able to to conduct like just just a few extra electrons hanging out in there is actually enough to allow the electricity to move through the substance was relatively little little ever for a while yeah so in order to get that you need these substances which have five electrons in the outer shell anybody know what that prefix four five is Penta Penta exactly so these are called pentavalent elements so so the silicon the intrinsic silicon is doped with a pentavalent element and then it's able to conduct a big yeah so so if we put it element in there with only three electrons in the valence would it be a p-type yes that's exactly right and that's where we're going next yeah so so just like you said just like there are pentavalent elements there are also elements that have only three electrons in their valence show so what is the prefix for three right right exactly so these are called trivalent elements and some examples of those are now in boron can thallium doesn't matter which one they use or do these trends and see this oh well each one has slightly different they have different properties yeah and so in some cases they would definitely want to use the cheapest to save money but some of them have slightly different you have to apply slightly different voltages to get the electricity to move so in some cases you might want to choose one where you have a very small voltage required okay so you might need a larger one so so those are just some examples of the properties that that each of these have so then we're not going to go into the properties of each one that's a little bit but but each one it does have its own pluses but you could probably read it yeah so for trivalent elements again they fit in with the silicon crystal structure so you've got the thermal silicon with Natomas ground here and then you've got this trivalent element.extend so the trivalent element has this hole where one of its electrons should be so it's missing one of the electrodes and like you said before electrons have a positive charge right electrons have a negative charge and so if one of them is missing the element or the silicon has an overall positive charge so we called this p-type silicon thank you soon okay what why would you want to use a p-type versus an entire yes exactly so so a diode is actually made up of a sandwich of p-type and uh materials and we talked about that in just a second so right so just to review we've got the pure intrinsic silicon which is a pretty good insulator it so it only is a quadrivalent element it's got four electrons in the valence shell and it shares them nicely it beats a good crystal structure everything has its place so the electrons don't want to move so it's a pretty good insulator right n-type so it can has this extra electron which makes it negative and this electron is able to move around so it's a pretty good conductor g-type has this hole and a hole is a place where an electron can fit in so if you're pushing electrons or you're trying to push them through you type silicon they can kind of jump from one hole to the next to the next to the next so it's actually relatively easy for electricity to move through p-type silicon as well so this is a relatively good convector so intrinsic silicon ISM is insulator n-type and p-type silicon czar both relatively good conductors so any questions about that so far okay do you guys have these pictures down I want to move on okay so again like I said before we're really diving deep into the physics of all this so if this stuff was from them a little cheap bastard anything like that if it's not a hundred percent clear don't don't worry about it too much we're gonna that would be cool that would be cool I don't know in a place that makes diodes of them here there yeah okay yeah all right so let's talk about how a diode is actually made so a diode is this sandwich it's made up of two different types of silicon one is an n-type one side is n-type and the other side is p-type so the end type has all these holes where the electrons should be and then the p-type has lots of extra electrons hanging around in it that was opposite yes I'm sorry thank you get everybody confused all right so I've got all these extra electrons over here now the one side has these extra electrons they don't really have a place to fit in right then the other side has all of these holes that yeah kind of have a positive charge and the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged holes basically these electrons want to fit in and fill up those spaces there okay so what happens is that right in the mill where you have the two materials sandwich next to each other some of the electrons from the n-type jump over and they start filling up the holes in the p-type material so what you're left with is this area right in the middle where you don't have a bunch of extra electrons because we've slipped over to the other side and you don't have these holes because they've been filled up by the electrons so right in the middle you have this space called a depletion region it's called that because it's been depleted electrons and holes and what's happened here is that the electrons the extra electrons have been moved over and they're filled up the holes so this side now it doesn't have a lot of extra electrons basically this is back to pretty much a normal silicon crystal structure and those electrons have come over here and this is back to a pretty much normal so it can crystal structure again so the depletion region behaves pretty much like intrinsic so again the exact review the insolence so so that's why diodes don't conduct electricity right away if you put just a small voltage like 0.1 or 0.2 volts on a diode even in the forward direction it's not going to do that right away because it's got this depletion region which is back to my head not insulated that's what the Josh would exactly so this side that had all the extra electrons on it gets a slightly negative charge because it's got these extra electrons and then this side that lost its electrons has a positive charge on it and so what happens is that if you put if you put a positive voltage over there and a negative voltage over there well immediately let me start a new bike okay so we found our diode we've got the hole we've got the middle right there we've got the holes over on this side and we've got the the electrons on this side so if you put eight a negative voltage on that side and a positive voltage on that side then what happens is that all these negative electrons are attracted to that side and the positive holes you end up with more positive pulse so the depletion region ends up getting wider so is that gonna conduct electricity no exactly so this is the reverse bias yeah voltage um direction okay so if you put this type of voltage on that's the reverse bias on this diode and it's basically making this depletion region bigger and not allowing it to conduct that's why the diode does not conduct in the reverse bias direction this with me so far okay so if we go the other way I still have the diode here and now we apply the opposite voltage what happens is that these the negative voltage that you're applying on this side starts to supply electrons and fill up some of those holes and it presses the the depletion region on this side it presses it in towards the middle and similarly the positive voltage on the other side is applying pressure on the depletion region and shrinking it from this side and it's making it smaller so what happens is that in in this direction this is the forward biased direction okay and eventually when you when you put enough voltage those two sides meet in the depletion region throws away entirely and that's when electricity starts to flow okay so well I mean if you put too much electricity then it starts to heat up and it will eventually overheat and get damaged but you it's perfectly acceptable to put enough electricity in order to make those two sides touch so here's a here's a question how much how much voltage do you guys think it takes in order to make those two sides touch each other what is it yeah about point 7 volts that's where that that point six point seven volt comes from that's exactly how we get there and what happens is that when when you apply 0.6 volts or so the sides get really close to each other and it starts to conduct just a little bit and then when you apply the point seven when it gets up to 0.7 those sides are touching entirely and it's making a good conduction good connection and the electricity is flowing well more easily so on any diet you're cooking you know you can hope that positive up to the n-type and p-type sorry well so so in some cases we want to have the dynamic forward biased and in other cases we actually want to have a reverse uh-huh okay yeah for instance in the power supply we hope the diodes up and we hook them up to an alternating current so have to time their forward biased and then half the time there are so those it can go both ways but I mean if you want that we if you want to float it has me know yes yes yeah okay so that that is the physics that I wanted to cover for diamonds so I know that that was a lot of technical terms and a lot of information to absorb but you guys have questions about that the explanation thank you okay cool so so that's kind of the theory of how diodes working what's going on inside them so let's talk about some of the practical aspects of diodes and and how they actually behave when we apply different voltages to them so let's talk about a graph here let's say that we have a graph that's showing the amount of voltage that we're applying to a diode and the amount of current that goes through the bad guy so we said that ideally but diode starts conducting when you hit 0.7 volts right so ideally a diode doesn't conduct any current at all here and then when we get up to 0.7 volts it starts conducting perfectly so this is the ideal case this is 0.7 volts there but in the real world nothing's perfect so what we actually see is that the IO doesn't conduct much down here then it starts conducting a little bit and then it goes kind of like like that so this is real okay so that's again that's kind of showing you that it's not exactly 0.7 volts where they turn on it's sort of point six point seven somewhere in that general range okay so this is as the voltage goes up those two sides start getting closer and closer together starts to come back a little bit and then when they meet it starts to conduct very very well so that's a look at the for positive generation and then in the negative direction the diodes can you can withstand much more voltage but then eventually if you exceed their specifications they fail catastrophically and they start conducting a lot of current so it would go down in that direction and we're a normal diode it's not exactly clear when that's going to happen there's some maximum specification here as long as you're within that Mathewson little specification you're okay this is typically you know 20 volts or yeah I I know that when I drew my picture it looks kind of similar distance but really the it can usually withstand much much more voltage in the negative direction so around 20 volts 30 volts 50 volts in some cases so it was sort of a break-in rafter yeah did they also have tolerance in the voltage tolerance in the positive direction like 51 to flow like 50 volts going oh the Breck way work and we could take it well no so so normal diodes have to break down around 0.6 0.7 volts you can buy some that are made with slightly different chemicals that are that write down around between three or point 4 volts but it's somewhere in that range no I mean it is there a maximum vote like dude diodes have a maximum voltage it's like tolerance oh well if you in general if you go much beyond this like if you if you tried to force you know one volt or two bolts on there that would damage the diode um I don't know I I think that they probably do have a maximum fine older specification as well yeah okay so and the ideal and the real case are pretty much the same in the negative direction okay so that's what what happens with normal diodes again if you get to this point the diode is destroyed and today during lap we're going to be actually plotting this curve for some real diamonds okay you'll get to this trend no we're not going to get to this place okay so don't watch the dial right great don't and so this is this is a typical standard dialect but there are some special diodes that I want to talk about as well so these special diodes have have other applications beyond the ones that we already mentioned so the first type of special diodes that I want to talk about is called a Zener diode so a Zener diode behaves pretty much the same way as a typical diode when you put a forward voltage on it so so it was like this and kind of like that again around 0.7 volts somewhere in there but the special thing about Zener diodes is that they have a very fixed and specific point where they start conducting electricity in the reverse direction and with Zener guides this does not destroy them the dianna home so this so this is some fixed voltage for example five volts and in this case with zr diodes the diode is not destroy when when we get to this point okay so you can buy Zener diodes in many different specifications synced by having 5 volts 10 volts 9 volts 7 volts lots of different values pretty much any value you want you can go on a website and buy one but it works for you so if it's less than 5 volts it will not allow current to flow through if it's greater than 5 volts it will allow and the symbol for a Zener diode is pretty much like a normal diode except that it's got these extra little wings on its line there so let me give you an example of where this might be useful say you've got a battery over here in this battery you can charge it up to 7 or 8 volts to see it's rechargeable battery but the voltage can drift so when you first charge it up it's eight volts but then after you use some of the energy it drops down to 7 bowls and then six and a half and six volts but what you really need is a constant voltage supply that doesn't change that's at five holes what you can do is you can have a resistor here and then a Zener diode like this so if you want a five volt supply you can have a 5 volt Zener diode like that and then right there you always get five volts so regardless of whether this eight bolts are seven volts or six volts they're always going to get a fixed constant high moments coming up yeah all right okay I could use this for something else I'm working on it's huh yeah that's cool yeah so this is one example of a fixed voltage power supply okay this is not terribly efficient because any any thing beyond the five volts is getting used up by this resistor and getting turned into heat okay so it's not super efficient but often times what will happen is that you will have something like this that is used as a voltage reference so you just put a small amount of current through here and you use that as a reference and then you use this fixed five homes to control something else that they can supply more power okay so this is a simple our eye or Paulton so that's a little bit about senior drivers and they stop is the point the point seven drop is the same on those as on regular those if they're forward bias then it's about point seven eight but so typically senior diodes are used in the reverse - direction yeah because that's where their companies so any questions about those okay so there are a couple of other types of diodes that I would like to mention Schottky diodes again the symbol is very similar to a standard diode except that this one it's got these extra Oh square things on the ends of the yeah line there and these are good at fast switchable so they are they can go from blocking electricity in one direction to conducting it in the other direction very quickly and so this is good for things like radio frequency applications where the signal is changing directions very fast so that's what Schottky diodes are good for in diodes are called pin diodes because they're made up of P they have an extra layer of silicon so instead of just being a p-type and n-type sandwich they actually have a small thin layer intrinsic so it can in between them so and then so it's p-type in forensic and then then okay okay so that's where the repeat I am in name comes from these are again they they offer fast switching kind of like the Schottky diodes with these when you have a forward bias on them they don't always have the 0.7 volts instead they act kind of like a resistor so the more voltage you have on them the more current they will allow to pass through so the antenna like resistor in the forward bias direction tunnel diodes I don't think that there is if there is I don't know it so I don't think tunnel diodes act like a they have a for as negative resistance ug so basically with a typical resistor when you put more voltage on it you get more current through right the funny thing about tall diodes is that they have this negative resistance region where you start putting more voltage on and you actually get less current out you put less voltage on you get more current - that's really a strange thing yeah so that's just a fun thing there yeah yeah yeah it's very strange okay so those are the types of diodes that I wanted to pitch so many questions about those okay so those are those special diodes so I wanted to take just a second and do some homework examples with these these dogs do you guys are going to be doing some homework from your lab book it's going to involve some some circuit problems with diodes I want to take just a second and do some examples of those so for instance you might have a problem like this might have a power source that was safe 10 volts and then you've got a resistor that's one kill at home and then a senior died out of my class right here that is it's a 3 volt Zener diode when I say that I mean that it has it can support 3 volts in the reverse direction and it the question might be something like how much voltage is across the resistor Oh Mitch current close through the resistor so so first of all let's look at the Zener diode so we know that this is the positive side of the power supply this negative side so that means that this side of the Zener diode is going to be more positive in this side is going to be more negative so it's a senior diode forward biased or reverse biased voters rehearsed exactly so if it were forward biased it would have that 0.7 volt drop across e so it's reverse biased so we know it's not going to be the point seven volt drop so how much voltage is going to be across the Zener diode oh yeah three volts we've got ten volts over here so that's more than enough to to reach that threshold so we have three volts across there so we can draw that in so then yeah exactly we know that all together all of these voltages have to add up to 10 volts we know that this one is 3 volts so whatever is left over has to be over here so that means that there's seven volts over there any questions about how we got that so far okay so we got to send them all to cross there so then we can answer that question so then the next question is how much current flows through the resistor well we know the voltage and we know the resistance so what log can we use to figure that out moles long exactly so we haven't talked about Ohm's law this semester so let's take a minute and review that number it's written like this okay could be our B standard voltage I for current and our for resistance and if we want to figure out one of these we just cover up the one we want to figure out so in this case we want to figure out current so we cover that up we see the current as voltage divided by resistance equals B over R so in this case that's seven volts divided by 1,000 servers and goals yeah so that's point zero zero seven amps remember we always use bra anyt s-- in our calculations both with some homes then the answer comes out in row units amps and then they if we want we can translate that into milliamps so how many milliamps would that be perfect so the amount of current flowing through there would be point that would be seven doing so questions about that okay so that's the type of problem that you guys are going to be working on in the horn so I'll let you guys work on that over you know while you're at home and then next time if you guys have any questions you can ask me at the beginning of it might be willing to do one or two problems for you alright so then let's take a minute and go over the lab so the first part of the lab is about testing diodes with a multimeter so these are the multimeters because probably I'll work with these in 302 these are the multimeters we're going to use we're going to have them up here and the box you can come in get one after and I'm talking we're going to have leads for the multimeters on those racks at the back of the room there so you can all go and grab leads for those the multimeter has a diode setting over here on the the left part of the diode so the diode is here and then right about here there is a diode symbol and you put the meter into that position to measure the to check and see how a diode is working so this meter will take will measure the diode and there will be two leads coming out of the mirror one there and one there and it will check to see how much voltage is required to make current flow through the diameter so if you put it in the positive the forward bias direction and the diode is working properly how much voltage should you see on the display oh yeah point 6 point 7 volts give or take so if you see that ledge voltage then you know that your diode is working properly in the forward bias direction now if you are measuring a good diode and you flip it around how much gold to do is it going to take to make it conduct like just too much too much right exactly the type of the meter is programmed so that it doesn't destroy diodes so yeah so if you click the diode in the reverse bias direction you should see something that says oh well on the meter so yeah oh well stands for overload so forward biased on a good dog you should see about point 6 point 7 volts give or take reverse biased on a good diode you should see Oh up for overload meaning that the meter tried as much as it could to make the electricity flow in it it still wasn't enough ok so those are the readings you should get for a good diet what if you put a diode in in the reverse bias direction and you saw 0.3 volts or something yeah that means it's a bad diet that means that it's conducting electricity in the reverse direction which diodes should not do so that means that that guy out would be broken what yeah so so if you were measuring the Zener diodes and you knew that it was a very low breakdown voltage like 1 volt or something and I like you okay most Zener diodes are are closer to 5 volts or above and the meter doesn't go up that high so even even though your Zener diode might be good you can put it in the reverse direction and you still probably see the overload indication meaning that the meter went up to its highest voltage and it still was not able to give that diode to conduct okay so the first part of the lab is going to be about measuring the measuring diodes using a meter and we're going to measure several different types of atoms we're going to measure normal diodes and then we're also going to measure LEDs so do you guys remember what LED stands for no might emitting diode exactly so it is a dialogue which which emits light just like it sounds so again LEDs act like one-way valves for electricity LEDs have different forward bias voltages so instead of being point 6 point 7 volts the the forward bias voltage on an LED is determined by the type of color that it creates so certain colors have voltages around 1.2 or 1.3 volts other diodes other colors go up to 2 or 3 volts in the forward bias Trench ya heard that blue ones and hardest to gaze at her well when when they were first being produced certain types of diodes certain colors were more difficult to manufacture and so they were more expensive and harder to find these days the technology has advanced to the point where they're they're all pretty pretty available yeah so you guys are gonna measure the forward bias of several different colors of LEDs and you should see slightly different voltage values for those different colors so that's the first part of your lab and then the second part of your lab is about recreating that this type of curve here okay I believe that we're going to do that for about instead of so we're going to do that in the forward biased direction first and you're going to you're gonna slowly increase the voltage here and measure the amount of current that's coming through the Zener diode and then at some point you'll start to see it go way up and then you're going to flip the diode around and then you're going to start measuring voltages in the reverse bias direction so you'll start measuring the voltages for this part of the curve and eventually you'll see it go way way down so you're going to take those down in two tables one for the forward bias and one for the reverse biased and then you're going to use that information to actually plot this graph and that's what we'll be doing for the left so questions about that okay
