 heavy metals are generally defined as metals with relatively high densities atomic weights or atomic numbers the criteria used and whether metalloids are included vary depending on the author in context in metallurgy for example a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behavior more specific definitions have been published but none of these have been widely accepted the definition surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements only mercury lead and bismuth meet all of them despite this lack of agreement the term plural or singular is widely used in science a density of more than five grams per CC as sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and as used in the body of this article the earliest known metals common metals such as iron copper and tin and precious metals such as silver gold and platinum are heavy metals from 1809 onwards light metals such as magnesium aluminium and titanium were discovered as well as less well-known heavy metals including gallium thallium and hafnium some heavy metals are either essential nutrients typically iron cobalt and zinc or relatively harmless such as ruthenium silver and indium but can be toxic in larger amounts or certain forms other heavy metals such as cadmium mercury and lead are highly poisonous potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining tailings industrial wastes agricultural runoff occupational exposure paints and treated timber physical and chemical characterisations of heavy metals need to be treated with caution as the metals involved are not always consistently defined as well as being relatively dense heavy metals tend to be less reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides while it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium a few heavy metals such as zinc mercury and lead have some of the characteristics of lighter metals and lighter metals such as beryllium scandium and titanium have some of the characteristics of heavier metals heavy metals are relatively scarce in the Earth's crust but are present in many aspects of modern life they are used in for example golf clubs cars antiseptics self-cleaning ovens plastics solar panels mobile phones and particle accelerators topic definitions there is no widely agreed criterion based definition of a heavy-metal different meanings may be attached to the term depending on the context in metallurgy for example a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number and a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behavior density criteria range from above 3.5 grams per cc to above 7 grams per cc atomic weight definitions can range from greater than sodium atomic weight 22.98 greater than 40 excluding s and F block metals hence starting with scandium or more than 200 ie from Mercury onwards atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 calcium sometimes this is capped at 92 uranium definitions based on atomic number have been criticized for including metals with low densities for example rubidium in group column 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1 point 5 3 2 grams per cc which is below the threshold figure used by other authors the same problem may occur with atomic weight based definitions the United States pharmacopoeia includes a test for heavy metals that involves precipitating metallic impurities as they're colored sulfides quote in 1997 Stephen Hawkes a chemistry professor writing in the context of 50 years experience with the term said it applied to metals with insoluble sulfides and hydroxides whose salts produce coloured solutions in water and whose complexes are usually colored on the basis of the metals he had seen referred to as heavy metals he suggested it would useful to define them as in general all the metals in periodic table columns 3 to 16 that are in row 4 or greater in other words the transition metals and post transition metals the lanthanides satisfy Hawks three-part description the status of the actinides is not completely settled in biochemistry heavy metals are sometimes defined on the basis of the Lewis acid electronic pair acceptor behavior of their ions in aqueous solution as Class B and borderline metals in this scheme Class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors Class B ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors and borderline or ambivalent ions show either Class A or B characteristics depending on the circumstances Class A metals which tend to have low electronegativity and form bonds with large ionic character are the alkali and alkaline earths aluminium the Group three metals and the lanthanides and actinides Class B metals which tend to have higher electronegativity and form bonds with considerable covalent character are mainly the heavier transition and post transition metals borderline metals largely comprised the lighter transition and post transition metals plus arsenic and antimony the distinction between the Class A metals and the other two categories as sharp a frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted topic list of heavy metals based on density a density of more than five grams per cc as sometimes mentioned as a common heavy metal defining factor and in the absence of a unanimous definition is used to populate this list and unless otherwise stated guide the remainder of the article metalloids meeting the applicable criteria arsenic and antimony for example are sometimes counted as heavy metals particularly in environmental chemistry as is the case here selenium density 4.8 grams per cc is also included in the list it falls marginally short of the density criterion and is less commonly recognized as a metalloid but has a waterborne chemistry similar in some respects to that of arsenic and antimony other metals sometimes classified or treated as heavy metals such as beryllium density 1.8 grams per cc aluminium 2.7 grams per cc calcium 1.5 5 grams per cc and barium 3.6 grams per cc are here treated as light metals and in general are not further considered topic origins and use of the term the heaviness of naturally occurring metals such as gold copper and iron may have been noticed in prehistory and in light of their malleability led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments tools and weapons all metals discovered from then until 1809 had relatively high densities their heaviness was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion from 1809 onwards light metals such as sodium potassium and strontium were isolated there are low densities challenged conventional wisdom and it was proposed to refer to them as metalloids meaning resembling metals in form or appearance this suggestion was ignored the new elements came to be recognized as metals and the term metalloid was then used to refer to nonmetallic elements and later elements that were hard to describe as either metals or nonmetals an early use of the term heavy metal dates from 1817 when the german chemist leopold gamelon divided the elements into nonmetals light metals and heavy metals light metals had densities of 0.8 6:02 5.0 grams per cc heavy metals 5.30 8 to 22.000 the term later became associated with elements of high atomic weight or high atomic number it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term heavy element for example in discussing the history of nuclear chemistry McGhee notes that the actinides were once thought to represent a new heavy element transition group whereas Seaborg and co-workers favored a heavy-metal rare earth-like series in astronomy however a heavy element as any element heavier than hydrogen and helium topic criticism in 2002 Scottish toxicologist John Duffus reviewed the definitions used over the previous 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless along with this finding the heavy metal status of some metals as occasionally challenged on the grounds that they are too light or are involved in biological processes or rarely constitute environmental hazards examples include scandium to light vanadium to zinc biological processes and rhodium indium and osmium to rare topic popularity despite its questionable meaning the term heavy metal appears regularly in scientific literature a 2010 study found that it had been increasingly used and seemed to have become part of the language of science it is said to be an acceptable term given its convenience and familiarity as long as it is accompanied by a strict definition the counterparts to the heavy metals the light metals are alluded to by the minerals metals and materials society as including aluminium magnesium beryllium titanium lithium and other reactive metals the named metals have densities of 0.534 to 4.5 4 grams per cc topic biological role trace amounts of some heavy metals mostly in period four are required for certain biological processes these are iron and copper oxygen and electron transport cobalt complex syntheses and cell metabolism zinc hydroxylation vanadium and manganese enzyme regulation or functioning chromium glucose utilization nickel cell growth arsenic metabolic growth in some animals and possibly in humans and selenium antioxidant functioning and hormone production periods five and six contain fewer essential heavy metals consistent with the general pattern that heavier elements tend to be less abundant and that scarcer elements are less likely to be nutritionally essential in period 5 molybdenum is required for the catalysis of redox reactions cadmium is used by some marine diatoms for the same purpose and tin may be required for growth in a few species in period 6 tungsten is required by some archaea and bacteria for metabolic processes a deficiency of any of these period four to six essential heavy metals may increase susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning conversely an excess may also have adverse biological effects an average 70 kilograms human body as about 0.01% heavy metals approximately 7 grams equivalent to the weight of two dried peas with iron at four grams zinc at 2.5 grams and led at 0.12 grams comprising the three main constituents 2% light metals approximately 1.4 kilograms the weight of a bottle of wine and nearly 98% nonmetals mostly water a few non-essential heavy metals have been observed to have biological effects gallium germanium a metalloid indium and most lanthanides can stimulate metabolism and titanium promotes growth in plants though it is not always considered a heavy metal topic toxicity the focus of this section is mainly on the more serious toxic effects of heavy metals including cancer brain damage or death rather than the harm they may cause to one more of the skin lungs stomach kidneys liver or heart for more specific information see metal toxicity toxic heavy metal or the articles on individual elements or compounds heavy metals are often assumed to be highly toxic or damaging to the environment some are while certain others are toxic only if taken in excess or encountered in certain forms topic environmental heavy metals chromium arsenic cadmium mercury and lead have the greatest potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use the toxicity of some of their combined or elemental forms and their widespread distribution in the environment hexavalent chromium for example is highly toxic as our mercury vapor and many mercury compounds these five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur in the human body they usually bind via thiol groups shish to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions the resulting sulfur metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved human health deteriorates sometimes fatally chromium in its hexavalent form and arsenic are carcinogens cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system lead as the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant levels in the aquatic environments of industrialized societies have been estimated to be two to three times those of pre-industrial levels as a component of tetraethyl lead ch3 ch2 for peta bits it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s to 1970s although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996 soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States taking into account a 22 year time lag for the average age of violent criminals the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve other heavy metals noted for their potentially hazardous nature usually as toxic environmental pollutants include manganese central nervous system damage cobalt and nickel carcinogens copper zinc selenium and silver endocrine disruption genital disorders or general toxic effects in fish plants birds or other aquatic organisms tin as organotin central nervous system damage antimony a suspected carcinogen and thallium central nervous system damage topic nutritionally essential heavy metals heavy metals essential for life can be toxic if taken in excess some have notably toxic forms vanadium pentoxide v2o5 is carcinogenic in animals and when inhaled causes DNA damage the purple permanganate ion M and o4 as a liver and kidney poison ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours nickel carbonyl need to co for at 30 parts per million can cause respiratory failure brain damage and death and by being a gram or more of copper sulfate copper to sulfate can be fatal survivors may be left with major organ damage more than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic this is roughly 10 times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects topic other heavy metals a few other non-essential heavy metals have one or more toxic forms kidney failure and fatalities have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements approximately 15 to 300 grams in total consumed over a period of two months to three years exposure to osmium tetroxide oso4 may cause permanent eye damage and can lead to respiratory failure and death indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys liver and heart cisplatin PTCL - nh3 - which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells is also a kidney and nerve poison bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess insoluble uranium compounds as well as the dangerous radiation they emit can cause permanent kidney damage topic exposure sources heavy metals can degrade air water and soil quality and subsequently cause health issues in plants animals and people when they become concentrated as a result of industrial activities common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes vehicle emissions lead acid batteries fertilizers paints and treated timber aging water supply infrastructure and micro plastics floating in the world's oceans recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease in Japan 1932 to 1968 lawsuits ongoing as of 2016 the bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint Michigan in the northeast of the United States topic formation abundance occurrence an extraction heavy metals up to the vicinity of iron in the periodic table are largely made via stellar nucleosynthesis in this process lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers heavier heavy metals are not usually formed this way since fusion reactions involving such nuclei would consume rather than release energy rather they are largely synthesized from elements with a lower atomic number by neutron capture with the two main modes of this repetitive capture being the s process and the art process in the S process S stands for slow singular captures are separated by years or decades allowing the less stable nuclei to beta decay while in the our process rapid captures happen faster than nuclei can decay therefore the S process takes a more or less clear path for example stable cadmium 110 nuclei are successively bombarded by free neutrons inside a star until they form cadmium 115 nuclei which are unstable and decayed to form indium 115 which is nearly stable with a half-life 30,000 times the age of the universe these nuclei capture neutrons and form indium 116 which is unstable and decays to form 10 116 and so on in contrast there is no such path in the art process the s process stops at bismuth due to the short half-lives of the next two elements polonium and astatine which decay to bismuth or lead the art process is so fast it can skip this zone of instability and go on to create heavier elements such as thorium and uranium heavy metals condense in planets as a result of stellar illusion and destruction processes stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes and sometimes their rafter as a result of a neutron star merger thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium when gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed the Earth's crust is made of approximately 5% of heavy metals by weight with iron comprising 95% of this quantity light metals approximately 20% and nonmetals approximately 75% make up the other 95% of the crust despite their overall scarcity heavy metals can become concentrated in economically extractable quantities as a result of mountain building erosion or other geological processes heavy metals are primarily found as Litha files Rock loving or Chalco files or loving lit the file heavy metals are mainly f-block elements and the more reactive of the d-block elements they have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exists as relatively low density silicate minerals schalke file heavy metals are mainly the less reactive d-block elements in period four to six peoples and metalloids they are usually found in insoluble sulfide minerals being denser than the Litha files and sinking lower into the crust at the time of its solidification the Chalco files tend to be less abundant than the Litha files on the other hand gold as a sitter a file or iron loving element it does not readily form compounds with either oxygen or sulfur at the time of the Earth's formation and as the most noble inert of metals gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high density metallic alloys consequently it is a relatively rare metal some other less noble heavy metals molybdenum rhenium the platinum group metals ruthenium rhodium palladium osmium iridium and platinum germanium and tin can be counted as Sidorov files but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the earth core mantle and crust rather the crust these metals otherwise occur in the crust in small quantities chiefly as Chalco files less so in their native form concentrations of heavy metals below the crust are generally higher with most being found in the largely iron silicon nickel core platinum for example comprises approximately one part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the cores thought to be nearly six thousand times higher recent speculation suggests that uranium and thorium in the core may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives plate tectonics and ultimately sustains the Earth's magnetic field the winning of heavy metals from their ores as a complex function of or type the chemical properties of the metals involved and the economics of various extraction methods different countries and refineries may use different processes including those that differ from the brief outlines listed here broadly speaking and with some exceptions little file heavy metals can be extracted from their ores by electrical or chemical treatment while Chalco file heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulfide ores to yield the corresponding oxides and then heating these to obtain the raw metals radium occurs in quantities too small to be economically mind and as instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels the Chalco file platinum group metals PGM mainly occur in small mixed quantities with other Chalco file ores the ores involved need to be smelted roasted and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM this is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms compared to other metals PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs gold a Sidra file is commonly recovered by dissolving the ores in which it has found in a cyanide solution the gold forms a dye cyano or 8i for example 2 O plus h2o plus one half o2 plus KC and 2 K gold two cyanide plus two curl zinc is added to the mix and being more reactive than gold displaces the gold - Gold - cyanide + ZN k to zinc cyanide + 2 o the gold precipitates out of solution as a sludge and is filtered off and melted topic properties compared with light metals you some general physical and chemical properties of light and heavy metals are summarized in the table the comparison should be treated with caution since the terms light metal and heavy metal are not always consistently defined also the physical properties of hardness and tensile strength can vary widely depending on purity grain size and pretreatment these properties make it relatively easy to distinguish a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten but the differences become less clear at the boundaries light structural metals like beryllium scandium and titanium have some of the characteristics of heavy metals such as higher melting point post transition heavy metals like zinc cadmium and lead have some of the characteristics of light metals such as being relatively soft having lower melting points and forming mainly colorless complexes topic uses heavy metals are present in nearly all aspects of modern life iron may be the most common as it accounts for 90% of all refined metals platinum may be the most ubiquitous given it is said to be found in or used to produce 20% of all consumer goods some common uses of heavy metals depend on the general characteristics of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density strength and durability other uses depend on the characteristics of the specific element such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties examples of such atomic properties include partly filled D or F orbitals in many of the transition lanthanide and actinide heavy metals that enable the formation of coloured compounds the capacity of most heavy metal ions such as platinum cerium or bismuth to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts poorly overlapping 3 D or 4 F orbitals in iron cobalt and nickel or the lanthanide heavy metals from europium through thulium that give rise to magnetic effects and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories topic weight or density based some uses of heavy metals including in sport mechanical engineering military ordnance and nuclear science take advantage of their relatively high densities in underwater diving lead is used as a ballast in handicapped horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight based on factors including past performance so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors in golf tungsten brass or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the center of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics in fly fishing sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder so that they sink at the required rate in track and field sport steel balls used in the hammer throw and shotput events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980 the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was at that time an expensive metal triple the cost of other hammers not generally available in all countries tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf in mechanical engineering heavy metals are used for ballast in boats aeroplanes and motor vehicles or imbalance weights on wheels and crank shafts gyroscopes and propellers and centrifugal clutches in situations requiring maximum weight and minimum space for example in watch movements in military ordnance tungsten or uranium is used in armour plating and armor-piercing projectiles as well as in nuclear weapons to increase efficiency by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials in the 1970s tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped-charge and explosively formed the armor weapons on account of its higher density allowing greater force concentration and better deformability less toxic heavy metals such as copper tin tungsten and bismuth and probably manganese as well as boron a metalloid have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions doubts have been raised about the safety or green credentials of tungsten because denser materials absorb more radioactive emissions than lighter ones heavy metals are useful for radiation shielding and to focus radiation beams and linear accelerators and radiotherapy applications topic strength or durability based the strength or durability of heavy metals such as chromium iron nickel copper zinc molybdenum tin tungsten and lead as well as their alloys makes them useful for the manufacture of artifacts such as tools machinery appliances utensils pipes railroad tracks buildings and bridges automobiles locks furniture ships planes coinage and jewelry they are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals of the two-dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only to carbon and aluminium are not heavy metals gold silver and platinum are used in jewelry as are for example nickel copper indium and cobalt in colored gold low-cost jewelry and children's toys may be made to a significant degree of heavy metals such as chromium nickel cadmium or lead copper zinc tin and lead are mechanically weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties while each of them will react with air the resulting patinas of either various copper salts zinc carbonate tin oxide or a mixture of lead oxide carbonate and sulfate confer valuable protective properties copper and lead are therefore used for example as roofing materials zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanized steel and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans the workability and corrosion resistance of iron and chromium are increased by adding gadolinium the creep resistance of nickel as improved with the addition of thorium tellurium is added to copper and steel alloys to improve their machine ability and to lead to make it harder and more acid resistant topic biological and chemical the biocidal effects of some heavy metals have been known since antiquity platinum osmium copper ruthenium and other heavy metals including arsenic are used in anti-cancer treatments or have shown potential antimony antiprotozoal bismuth anti-ulcer gold anti arthritic and iron anti malarial are also important in medicine copper zinc silver gold or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control algal growth in for example cooling towers depending on their intended use as fertilizers or biocides agro chemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium cobalt nickel copper zinc arsenic cadmium mercury or lead selected heavy metals are used as catalysts in fuel processing rhenium for example synthetic rubber and fiber production bismuth emission control devices palladium and in self-cleaning ovens where cerium IV oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidize carbon based cooking residues in soap chemistry heavy metals form insoluble soaps that are used in lubricating greases paint dryers and fungicides apart from lithium the alkali metals and the ammonium ion formed soluble soaps topic coloring and optics the colors of glass ceramic glazes paints pigments and plastics are commonly produced by the inclusion of heavy metals or their compounds such as chromium manganese cobalt copper zinc selenium zirconium molybdenum silver tin praseodymium neodymium erbium tungsten iridium gold lead or uranium tattoo inks may contain heavy metals such as chromium cobalt nickel and copper the high reflectivity of some heavy metals as important in the construction of mirrors including precision astronomical instruments headlight reflectors rely on the excellent reflectivity of a thin film of rhodium topic electronics magnets and lighting heavy metals are their compounds can be found in electronic components electrodes and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors semiconductors or insulators molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks ruthenium IV oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine home electrical systems for the most part are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices particularly in contact switches as a result of their high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimize the formation of impurities on their surfaces the semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels hafnium oxide an insulator is used as a voltage controller in microchips tantalum oxide another insulator is used in capacitors in mobile phones heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800 promethium lanthanum and Mercury are further examples found in respectively atomic nickel metal hydride and button cell batteries magnets are made of heavy metals such as manganese iron cobalt nickel niobium bismuth praseodymium neodymium gadolinium and dysprosium neodymium magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet commercially available they are key components of for example car door locks starter motors fuel pumps and power windows heavy metals are used in lighting lasers and light-emitting diodes LEDs flat panel displays incorporate a thin film of electrically conducting indium tin oxide fluorescent lighting relies on mercury for its operation Ruby lasers generate deep red beams by exciting chromium atoms the lanthanides are also extensively employed in lasers gallium indium and arsenic and copper iridium and platinum are used in LEDs the latter three inorganic LEDs topic nuclear nice uses of heavy metals with high atomic numbers occur in diagnostic imaging electron microscopy and nuclear science in diagnostic imaging heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten make up the anode materials found in x-ray tubes an electron microscopy heavy metals such as lead gold palladium platinum or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining negative staining or vacuum deposition in nuclear science nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium iron or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce super-heavy elements heavy metals are also employed as Splashin targets for the production of neutrons or Radio isotopes such as astatine using lead bismuth thorium or uranium in the latter case topic notes topic sources equals equals equals citations
