 nickel is a chemical element with symbol me and atomic number 28 it is a silvery white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge nickel belongs to the transition metals in his hardened ductile pure nickel powdered to maximize the reactive surface area shows a significant chemical activity but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms on the surface and prevents further corrosion passivation even so pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts usually in ultramafic rocks and in the interiors of larger nickel iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis an iron nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's inner core use of nickel as a natural meteoric nickel iron alloy has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by axel frederick Kronstadt who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral in the cobalt mines of Los palce England sweden the elements name comes from a mischievous sprite of german miner mythology nickel similar to old nick who personified the fact that copper nickel ores resisted refinement into copper an economically important source of nickel as the iron ore limonite which often contains one to two percent nickel nickels other important ore minerals include Pentland it-- and a mixture of me rich natural silicates known as garni aright major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada which is thought to be of meteoric origin New Caledonia in the Pacific and Noorie liske in Russia nickel is slowly oxidized by air at room temperature and is considered corrosion-resistant historically it has been used for plating iron and brass coating chemistry equipment and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish such as German silver about 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion resistant nickel plating nickel plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy nickel has been widely used in coins though it's rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years nickel is one of four elements the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium that are ferromagnetic at approximately room-temperature alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron based permanent magnets and rare earth magnets the metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel a further 10% is used for nickel based and copper based alloys 7% for alloy Steel's 3% in foundries 9% in plating and 4% in other applications including the fast-growing battery sector as a compound nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses such as a catalyst for hydrogenation cathodes for batteries pigments and metal surface treatments nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site topic properties you topic atomic and physical properties nickel is a silvery white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish it is one of only four elements that are magnetic at her near room temperature the others being iron cobalt and gadolinium its Curie temperature as 355 degrees Celsius 671 degrees Fahrenheit meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature the unit cell of nickel is a face centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.35 2 nanometers giving an atomic radius of 0.1 to 4 nanometers this crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70 Giga Pascal's nickel belongs to the transition metals and his hardened ductile topic electron configuration dispute the nickel atom has two electron configurations are 3d 8 4 s 2 and R 3 D 9 4 s 1 which are very close in energy the symbol R refers to the argon like core structure there is some disagreement on which configuration has the lowest energy chemistry textbooks quote the electron configuration of nickel as R 4 is 2 3 D 8 which can also be written R 3 D 8 4 s 2 this configuration agrees with the madelung energy ordering rule which predicts that 4s is filled before 3d it is supported by the experimental fact that the lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a 3d 8 4 s 2 energy level specifically the 3d a 3 F 4 is 2 3 F J equals 4 level however each of these two configurations splits into several energy levels due to fine structure and the two sets of energy levels overlap the average energy of states with configuration are 3 D 9 for s 1 is actually lower than the average energy of states with configuration R 3 D 8 for s 2 for this reason the research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state configuration of nickel as R 3 D 9 for s 1 equals topic isotopes equals the isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from 48 u 48 me 278 u 78 me naturally-occurring nickel is composed of five stable isotopes 58 me 60 me 61 me 62 me and 64 nee with 58 me being the most abundant 68 point zero seven seven percent natural abundance isotopes heavier than 62 nee cannot be formed by nuclear fusion without losing energy nickel 62 has the highest mean nuclear binding energy per nucleon of any nuclide at eight point seven nine four six MeV nucleon it's binding energy is greater than both 56 Fei and fifty-eight Fei more abundant elements often incorrectly cited as having the most tightly bound nuclides although this would seem to predict nickel 62 as the most abundant heavy element in the universe the relatively high rate of photodisintegration of nickel and stellar interiors causes iron to be by far the most abundant stable isotope nickel 60 as the daughter product of the extinct radionuclides 60 fay which decays with a half-life of 2.6 million years because 60 fay has such a long half-life its persistence and materials in the solar system may generate observable variations in the isotopic composition of 16e therefore the abundance of 16e present in extraterrestrial material may provide insight into the origin of the solar system in its early history some eighteen nickel radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable being 59 me with a half-life of 76,000 years 63 me with 100 years and 56 me with 6 days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 60 hours and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 30 seconds this element also has one meta state radioactive nickel-56 is produced by the silicon burning process and later set free in large quantities during type IA supernovae the shape of the light curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late times corresponds to the decay via electron capture of nickel-56 to cobalt 56 and ultimately to iron 56 nickel 59 as a long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides with a half-life of 76,000 years 59 me has found many applications in isotope geology 59 me has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment nickel 78s a half-life was recently measured at 110 milliseconds and has believed an important isotope in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron the nuclide 48 me discovered in 1999 is the most proton rich heavy element isotope known with 28 protons and 20 neutrons 48 Nia's double magic as is 78 me with 28 protons and 50 neutrons both are therefore unusually stable for nuclides with so large a proton Neutron imbalance topic occurrence on earth Nicola occurs most often in combination with sulfur and iron in Pentland ight with sulfur and milla right with arsenic in the mineral Nick line and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel Galena nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys comma site and tonight the bulk of the nickel is mined from two types of ore deposits the first is laterite where the principal or mineral mixtures are Nicola first limonite fay me oxygen mono hydroxide and garni a'right a mixture of various hydrous nickel and nickel rich silicates the second as magmatic sulfide deposits where the principal or mineral is Pentland it-- me fay 9s 8 Australia and New Caledonia have the biggest estimate reserves 45% altogether identified land-based resources throughout the world averaging 1 percent nickel or greater comprise at least 130 million tons of nickel about the double of known reserves about 60% as in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits on geophysical evidence most of the nickel on earth is believed to be in the Earth's outer and inner course , site and tonight are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel 4 , site the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90 to 10 to 95 to 5 although impurities such as cobalt or carbon may be present while for tonight the nickel content as between 20% and 65% comma site and tonight are also found in nickel iron meteorites topic compounds the most common oxidation state of nickel as +2 but compounds of me zero me + and nee 3 + are well-known and the exotic oxidation states need to - v1 minus an e 4 + have been produced and studied topic nickel 0 nickel tetracarbonyl me CEO for discovered by Ludwig Mond is a volatile highly toxic liquid at room temperature on heating the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide me CEO Forney +4 cthis behavior as exploited in the Mong process for purifying nickel as described above the related nickel 0 complex biz cyclooctadiene nickel 0 is a useful catalyst in Organa nickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene for cod ligands are easily displaced topic nickel I Nicoll i complexes are uncommon but one example is the tetrahedral complex and IBR pph3 three many nickel i complexes feature nimi bonding such as the dark red diamagnetic k for me to see n6 prepared by reduction of k to need to see n6 with sodium amalgam this compound is oxidized in water liberating h2 it is thought that the nickel i oxidation state is important to nickel containing enzymes such as ni Fe hydrogenase which catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to h2 topic nickel to Nicoll two forms compounds with all common anions including sulfide sulfate carbonate hydroxide carboxylates and halides nickel ii sulfate is produced in large quantities by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid forming both a hexa and heptahydrate useful for electroplating nickel common salts of nickel such as the chloride nitrate and sulfate dissolve in water to give green solutions of the metal aquo complex me h2o 6 2 plus the four halides form nickel compounds which are solids with molecules that feature octahedral knee centers nickel ii chloride is most common and its behavior is illustrative of the other halides nickel ii chloride is produced by dissolving nickel or its oxide in hydrochloric acid it is usually encountered as the green hexahydrate the formula of which is usually written nicl2 6 h2o when dissolved in water this salt forms the metal aquo complex me h2o 6 2 plus dehydration of nicl2 6 h2o gives the yellow anhydrous nicl2 some tetra coordinate Mikal 2 complexes eg BIST triphenylphosphine nickel chloride exist both in tetrahedral and square planar geometry the tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic in having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes they contrast with the divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals palladium 2 and platinum 2 which form only square planar geometry Nicola scene is known it has an electron count of 20 making it relatively unstable topic nickel three and IV numerous me3 compounds are known with the first such examples being nickel 3 trehala phosphenes me pph 3x3 further me three forms simple salts with fluoride or oxide ions neat 3 can be stabilized by Sigma donor ligands such as styles and phosphenes me IV is present in the mixed oxide baño 3 while neat 3 is present in nickel oxide hydroxide which is used as the cathode in many rechargeable batteries including nickel cadmium nickel iron nickel hydrogen and nickel metal hydride and used by certain manufacturers in li-ion batteries me IV remains a rare oxidation state of nickel and very few compounds are known to date topic history because the ores of nickel are easily mistaken for ores of silver understanding of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times however the unintentional use of nickel is ancient and can be traced back as far as 3500 BCE bronze is from what is now Syria have been found to contain as much as 2 percent nickel some ancient Chinese manuscripts suggest that white copper cupro-nickel known as by Tong was used there between 1700 and 1400 BCE this packed tongue white copper was exported to Britain as early as the 17th century but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until 1822 coins of nickel copper alloy were minted by the bactrian Kings Agatha Cleese euthydemus ii and pan tallien in the 2nd century BCE possibly out of the chinese cupro-nickel in medieval Germany a red mineral was found in the Earth's Coburg or mountains that resembled copper ore however when miners were unable to extract any copper from it they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology nickel similar to old Nick phurba setting the copper they called this ore copper nickel from the German cup for for copper this ore is now known to be mick aligned a nickel arsenide in 1751 baron axel frederick Kronstadt tried to extract copper from cup for nickel at a cobalt mine in the swedish village of los and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral nickel in modern german cup for nickel or cup for nickel designates the alloy cupro-nickel originally the only source for nickel was the rare cup for nickel beginning in 1824 nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt blue production the first large-scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in 1848 from nickel rich pyro tight the introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia discovered in 1865 provided most of the world supply between 1875 and 1915 the discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin Canada in 1883 in nori lists tannic Russia in 1920 and in the morenski Reef South Africa in 1924 made large-scale production of nickel possible topic coinage aside from the aforementioned Bactrian coins nickel was not a component of coins until the mid 19th century topic Canada 99.9% Nikhil five cent coins were struck in Canada the world's largest nickel producer at the time during non war years from 1922 to 1981 the metal content made these coins magnetic during the wartime period 1942 to 45 most or all nickel was removed from Canadian and US coins to save it for manufacturing Armour Canada used 99.9 percent nickel from 1968 in its higher value coins until 2000 topic Switzerland coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in 1881 in Switzerland topic united kingdom Birmingham forged nickel coins in about 1833 for trading in Malaya topic United States in the United States the term nickel or Nick originally applied to the copper nickel flying eagle cent which replaced copper with 12 percent nickel 18 57 to 58 then the Indian Head cent of the same alloy from 1859 to 1864 still later in 1865 the term designated the three cent nickel with nickel increased to 25 percent in 1866 the five cent shield nickel 25% nickel 75% copper appropriated the designation along with the alloy proportion this term has been used to the present in the United States topic current use in the 21st century the high price of nickel has led to some replacement of the metal in coins around the world coins still made with nickel alloys include one in two euro coins 5 10 25 and 50 US coins and 20 p 50 P 1 pound and 2 pounds UK coins nickel alloy and 5p and 10 p UK coins was replaced with nickel-plated steel began in 2012 causing allergy problems for some people and public controversy Topic world production around two million tons of nickel are produced annually worldwide the Philippines Indonesia Russia Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers of nickel as reported by the US Geological Survey the largest deposits of nickel in non-russian Europe are located in Finland in Greece identified land-based Resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contained at least 130 million tons of nickel about 60% as in laterites and 40% as in sulfide deposits in addition extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor particularly in the Pacific Ocean the one locality in the United States where nickel has been profitably mind as riddle Oregon where several square miles of nickel beringar Nia right surface deposits are located the mine closed in 1987 the Eagle mine project as a new nickel mine in Michigan's Upper Peninsula construction was completed in 2013 and operations began in the third quarter of 2014 in the first full year of operation Eagle mine produced 18,000 tons topic extraction and purification Nicoll is obtained through extractive metallurgy it is extracted from the ore by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a medal of greater than 75% purity in many stainless steel applications seventy-five percent pure nickel can be used without further purification depending on the impurities traditionally most sulfide ores have been processed using pyro metallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining recent advances in hydro metallurgical techniques resulted in significantly pure metallic nickel product most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction in hydro metallurgical processes nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation differential floatation if meet Fay ratio is too low and then smelting the nickel matte is further processed with the sherrod Gordon process first copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide leaving a concentrate of cobalt in nickel then solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel with the final nickel content greater than 99% topic electrorefining a second common refining process is leeching the metal mat into a nickel salt solution followed by the electrowinning of the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel topic mond process the purest metal is obtained from nickel oxide by the menthe process which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99% the process was patented by Ludwig Mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century in this process nickel is reacted with carbon monoxide in the presence of a sulphur catalyst at around 40 to 80 degrees Celsius to form nickel carbonyl iron gives iron pentacarbonyl too but this reaction is slow if necessary the nickel may be separated by distillation de cobalt octa carbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product but it decomposes to tetra Cobalt dodeca carbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid nickel is obtained from nickel carbonyl by one of two processes it may be passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres called pellets are constantly stirred the carbonyl decomposes and deposits pure nickel unto the nickel spheres in the alternate process nickel carbonyl is decomposed in a smaller chamber at 230 degrees Celsius to create a fine nickel powder the byproduct carbon monoxide is recirculated and reused the highly pure nickel product is known as carbonyl nickel topic metal value the market price of nickel surged throughout 2006 in the early months of 2007 as of April 5th 2007 the metal was trading at fifty two thousand three hundred dollars per ton or one dollar and forty seven cents per ounce the price subsequently fell dramatically and as of September 2017 the metal was trading at eleven thousand dollars per ton or thirty one cents per ounce the u.s. nickel coin contains zero point zero four ounces 1.1 grams of nickel which at the April 2007 price was worth six point five cents along with three point seven five grams of copper worth about three cents with a total metal value of more than nine cents since the face value of a nickel is five cents this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit however the United States Mint in anticipation of this practice implemented new interim rules on December 14th 2006 subject to public comment for 30 days which criminalized the melting and export of cents and nickels violators can be punished with a fine of up to ten thousand dollars and or imprisoned for a maximum of five years as of September 19 2013 the melt value of a u.s. nickel copper and nickel included is zero point zero four five dollars which is 90 percent of the face value topic applications the global production of nickel is presently used as follows 68% in stainless steel 10% in non-ferrous alloys 9% in electroplating 7% in alloy steel 3% in foundries and 4% other uses including batteries nickel is used in many specific and recognizable industrial and consumer products including stainless steel alnico magnets coinage rechargeable batteries electric guitar strings microphone capsules plating on plumbing fixtures and special alloys such as / malloy elinvar and invar it is used for plating and as a green tinting glass nickel is pre-eminently an alloy metal and its chief use as in nickel steels and nickel cast irons in which it typically increases the tensile strength toughness and elastic limit it is widely used in many other alloys including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper chromium aluminium lead cobalt silver and gold inconel Inc alloys monel mnemonic because it is resistant to corrosion nickel was occasionally used as a substitute for decorative silver nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after 1859 as a cheap coinage metal see above but in the later years of the 20th century was replaced by cheaper stainless steel ie iron alloys except in the United States and Canada nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain precious metals and is used in the fire assay as a collector of platinum group elements PGE as such nickel is capable of fully collecting all six PGE elements from ores and of partially collecting gold high-throughput nickel minds may also engage in PGE recovery primarily platinum and palladium examples are nori Liske in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada nickel foam or nickel mesh is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells nickel and it's alloys are frequently used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions Raney nickel a finely divided nickel aluminium alloy is one common form the related catalysts are also used including Rainey type catalysts nickel is a naturally magnetostrictive material meaning that in the presence of a magnetic field the material undergoes a small all change in length the magnetostriction of nickel is on the order of 50 ppm and is negative indicating that it contracts nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide or hard metal industry and used in proportions of 6% to 12% by weight nickel makes the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion resistance to the cemented parts although the hardness is less than those with a cobalt binder 0.63 me with its half-life of 100.1 years is useful in krytron devices as a beta particle high-speed electron emitter to make ionization by the keepalive electrode more reliable around 27% of all nickel production as destined for engineering 10% for building and construction 14% for tubular products 20% for metal goods 14% for transport 11% for electronic goods and 5% for other uses topic biological role although not recognized until the 1970s nickel is known to play an important role in the biology of some plants you bacteria archaea bacteria and fungi nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some organisms urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbonate the NIF ii hydrogenases can catalyze the oxidation of h2 to form protons and electrons and can also catalyze the reverse reaction the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas a nickel tetra parol co enzyme cofactor f430 is present in methyl coenzyme m reductase which can catalyze the formation of methane or the reverse reaction in methanogenic archaea one of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an famous cluster other nickel bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase and glyoxal Eisai enzymes in bacteria and several parasitic eukaryotic Trypanosoma parasites in higher organisms including yeast and mammals this enzyme contains divalent Zn 2 + dietary nickel may affect human health through infections by nickel dependent bacteria but it is also possible that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine in effect functioning as a prebiotic the u.s. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans so neither a recommended dietary allowance RDA nor an adequate intake have been established the tolerable upper intake level of dietary nickel as one thousand micrograms per day as soluble nickel salts dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 micrograms per day with less than 10% absorbed what is absorbed is excreted in urine relatively large amounts of nickel comparable to the estimated average ingestion above bleach into food cooked in stainless steel for example the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88 micrograms nickel released from Siberian traps volcanic eruptions as suspected of assisting the growth of methane SR chena a genus of Uri archaea archaea that produced methane during the Permian Triassic extinction event the big extinction event on record topic toxicity the major source of nickel exposure as oral consumption as nickel is essential to plants nickel is found naturally in both food and water and may be increased by human pollution for example nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste water nickel steel alloy cookware and nickel pigmented dishes may release nickel into food the atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry shampoos detergents and coins a less common form of chronic exposure as through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin the average daily exposure does not pose a threat to human health most of the nickel absorbed everyday by humans is removed by the kidneys and passed out of the body through urine or is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract without being absorbed nickel is not accumulative poison but larger doses or chronic inhalation exposure may be toxic even carcinogenic and constitute an occupational hazard nickel compounds are classified as human carcinogens based on increased respiratory cancer risks observed in epidemiological studies of sulphide ore refinery workers this is supported by the positive results of the NTP bioassays with nisab sulfide and knee oxide in rats and mice the human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumors after inhalation nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks and workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumors in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder in the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds in nickel metal increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed in rat studies oral ingestion of water-soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects and pregnant animals whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects people can be exposed to nickel in the workplace by inhalation ingestion and contact with skin or eye the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for the workplace at one milligram per cubic meter per 8-hour workday excluding nickel carbonyl the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH specifies the recommended exposure limit Rell of 0.01 5 milligrams per cubic meter per 8-hour workday at 10 milligrams per cubic meter nickel is immediately dangerous to life and health nickel carbonyl knee co 4 is an extremely toxic gas the toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of the metal and the off gassing of carbon monoxide from the carbonyl functional groups nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air sensitized individuals may show a skin contact allergy to nickel known as a contact dermatitis highly sensitized individuals may also react to foods with high nickel content sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with palm flicks nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy red skin many earrings are now made without nickel or low release nickel to address this problem the amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the European Union in 2002 researchers found that the nickel released by one and two euro coins was far in excess of those standards this is believed to be the result of a galvanic reaction nickel was voted allergen of the year in 2008 by the American contact dermatitis Society in August 2015 the American Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel estimates suggest that contact dermatitis which includes nickel sensitization accounts for approximately one point nine one eight billion dollars and affects nearly seventy two point two nine million people reports showed that both the nickel induced activation of hypoxia-inducible factor hif-1 and the up regulation of hypoxia inducible genes are caused by depletion of intracellular ascorbate the addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal induced stabilization of hif-1 and hif-1 alpha dependent gene expression
