 a metalloid is a type of chemical element which has properties in between or that are a mixture of those of metals and nonmetals there is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such despite the lack of specificity the term remains in use in the literature of chemistry the six commonly recognized metalloids are boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium five elements are less frequently so classified Carbon aluminium selenium polonium and astatine on a standard periodic table all eleven elements are located in a diagonal region of the P block extending from boron at the upper left to astatine at lower right some periodic tables include a dividing line between metals and nonmetals and the metalloids may be found close to this line typical metalloids have a metallic appearance but they are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity chemically they behave mostly as nonmetals they can form alloys with metals most of their other physical properties and chemical properties are intermediate in nature metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses they and their compounds are used in alloys biological agents catalysts flame retardants glasses optical storage and optoelectronics pyrotechnics semiconductors and electronics the electrical properties of silicon and germanium enabled the establishment of the semiconductor industry in the 1950s and the development of solid-state electronics from the early 1960s the term metalloid originally referred to nonmetals its more recent meaning as a category of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties became widespread in 1940 to 1960 metalloids are sometimes called semi metals a practice that has been discouraged as the term semi metal has a different meaning in physics than in chemistry in physics it specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance topic definitions you topic judgment based a metalloid as an element with properties in between or that are a mixture of those of metals and nonmetals and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal this is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature difficulty of categorization as a key attribute most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced only the elements that are near the margins lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties are classified as metalloids boron silicon germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium are commonly recognized as metalloids depending on the author one or more from selenium polonium or astatine are sometimes added to the list boron sometimes is excluded by itself or with silicon sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid the inclusion of antimony polonium and astatine as metalloids has been questioned other elements are occasionally classified as metalloids these elements include hydrogen beryllium nitrogen phosphorus sulfur zinc gallium tin iodine lead bismuth and radon the term metalloid has also been used for elements that exhibit metallic luster and electrical conductivity and that are Mpho Taric such as arsenic antimony vanadium chromium molybdenum tungsten tin lead and aluminium the p-block metals and nonmetals such as carbon or nitrogen that can form alloys with metals or modify their properties have also occasionally been considered as metalloids topic criteria based no widely accepted definition of a metalloid exists nor any division of the periodic table into metals metalloids and nonmetals Hux questioned the feasibility of establishing a specific definition noting that anomalies can be found in several attempted constructs classifying an element as a metalloid has been described by sharpest arbitrary the number and identities of metalloids depend on what classification criteria are used Emsley recognized for metalloids germanium arsenic antimony and tellurium James at all listed 12 M's Lee's plus boron carbon silicon selenium bismuth polonium moscovia and livermorium on average seven elements are included in such lists individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins a single quantitative criterion such as electronegativity is commonly used metalloids having electronegativity values from one point eight or one point nine to two point two further examples include packing efficiency the fraction of volume in a crystal structure occupied by atoms and the gold hammer herzfeld criterion ratio the commonly recognized metalloids have packing efficiencies of between 34% and 41% the gold hammer herzfeld ratio roughly equal to the cube of the atomic radius divided by the molar volume is a simple measure of how metallic an element is the recognized metalloids having ratios from around 0.85 to 1.1 and averaging 1.0 other authors have relied on for example atomic conductance or bulk coordination number Jones writing on the role of classification in science observed that classes are usually defined by more than two attributes mastered inand Slowinski used three criteria to describe the six elements commonly recognized as metalloids metalloids have ionization energies around 200 kilocalories per mole 837 kilo joules per mole and electronegativity values close to 2.0 they also said that metalloids are typically semiconductors though antimony and arsenic semi metals from a physics perspective have electrical conductivities approaching those of metals selenium and polonium are suspected as not in this scheme while astatine status is uncertain topic periodic table territory you topic location metalloids lie on either side of the dividing line between metals and nonmetals this can be found in varying configurations on some periodic tables elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behavior elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behavior when presented as a regular stir step elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups Li b al j SB po lie just below the line the diagonal positioning of the metalloids represents an exception to the observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups a related effect can be seen in other diagonal similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbors specifically lithium magnesium beryllium aluminium and boron silicon Rainer Khanum has argued that these similarities extend to carbon phosphorus nitrogen sulfur and into 3d block series this exception arises due to competing horizontal and vertical trends in the nuclear charge going along a period the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons the additional pull on outer electrons is nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons with some irregularities atoms therefore becomes smaller ionization energy increases and there is a gradual change in character across a period from strongly metallic to weakly metallic to weakly nonmetallic to strongly nonmetallic elements going down to main group the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus atoms generally become larger ionization energy Falls and metallic character increases the net effect is that the location of the metal nonmetal transition zone shifts to the right in going down a group and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table as noted topic alternative treatments depictions of metalloids vary according to the author some do not classify elements bordering the metal nonmetal dividing line as metalloids noting that a binary classification can facilitate the establishment of rules for determining bond types between metals and non metals metalloids are variously grouped with metals regarded as nonmetals or treated as a subcategory of nonmetals other authors have suggested that classifying some elements as metalloids emphasizes that properties change gradually rather than abruptly as one moves across or down the periodic table some periodic tables distinguish elements that are metalloids and display no formal dividing line between metals and nonmetals metalloids are shown as occurring in a diagonal band or diffuse region topic properties metalloids usually look like metals but behave largely like nonmetals physically they are shiny brittle solids with intermediate to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band structure of a semi metal or semiconductor chemically they mostly behave as weak nonmetals have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values an amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides they can form alloys with metals most of their other physical and chemical properties are intermediate in nature topic compared to metals and nonmetals characteristic properties of metals metalloids and nonmetals are summarized in the table physical properties are listed in order of ease of determination chemical properties run from general to specific and then to descriptive the above table reflects the hybrid nature of metalloids the properties of form appearance and behavior when mixed with metals are more like metals elasticity and general chemical behavior are more like nonmetals electrical conductivity band structure ionization energy electronegativity and oxides are intermediate between the two topic common applications the focus of this section is on the recognized metalloids elements less often recognized as metalloids are ordinarily classified as either metals or nonmetals some of these are included here for comparative purposes metalloids are too brittle to have any structural uses in their pure forms they and their compounds are used as or in alloying components biological agents toxicological nutritional and medicinal catalysts flame retardants glasses oxide and metallic optical storage media and optoelectronics pyrotechnics semiconductors and electronics topic alloys riding early in the history of inter metallic compounds the British metallurgist Cecil - observed that certain nonmetallic elements are capable of forming compounds of distinctly metallic character with metals and these elements may therefore enter into the composition of alloys he associated silicon arsenic and tellurium in particular with the alloy forming elements Phillips and Williams suggested that compounds of silicon germanium arsenic and antimony Whitby metals are probably best classed as alloys among the lighter metalloids alloys with transition metals are well-represented boron can form inter metallic compounds and alloys with such metals of the composition M and B if N greater than 2 fair Oberon 15% boron is used to introduce boron into steel nickel boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries respectively germanium forms many alloys most importantly with the coinage metals the heavier metalloids continue the theme arsenic can form alloys with metals including platinum and copper it is also added to copper and it's alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium antimony is well known as an alloy former including with the coinage metals its alloys include pewter a tin alloy with up to 20 percent antimony and type metal a lead alloy with up to 25 percent antimony tellurium readily alloys with iron as furro tellurium 50 to 58 percent tellurium and with copper in the form of copper tellurium 40 to 50 percent tellurium ferro tellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting of the nonmetallic elements less often recognized as metalloids selenium in the form of ferrous selenium 50 to 58 percent selenium is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels topic biological agents all six of the elements commonly recognized as metalloids have toxic dietary or medicinal properties arsenic and antimony compounds are especially toxic boron silicon and possibly arsenic are essential trace elements boron silicon arsenic and antimony have medical applications and germanium and tellurium are thought to have potential boron is used in insecticides and herbicides it is an essential trace element as boric acid it has antiseptic antifungal and antiviral properties silicon is present in silo train a highly toxic rodenticide long-term inhalation of silica dust causes silicosis a fatal disease of the lungs silicon is an essential trace element silicon gel can be applied to badly burned patients to reduce scarring salts of germanium are potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested on a prolonged basis there is interest in the pharmacological actions of germanium compounds but no licensed medicine is yet arsenic is notoriously poisonous and may also be an essential element in ultra trace amounts during World War one both sides used arsenic based sneezing and vomiting agents to force enemy soldiers to remove their gas masks before firing mustard or phosgene at them in a second salvo it has been used as a pharmaceutical agent since antiquity including for the treatment of syphilis before the development of antibiotics arsenic is also a component of Malhar cipro the medicinal drug used in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness in 2003 arsenic trioxide under the trade name tri sonics was reintroduced for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia a cancer of the blood and bone marrow arsenic in drinking water which causes lung and bladder cancer has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality rates metallic antimony is relatively non-toxic but most antimony compounds are poisonous too antimony compounds sodium stubo gluconate and Stieb often are used as anti parasitical drugs elemental tellurium is not considered particularly toxic 2 grams of sodium tell urine if administered can be lethal people exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic like odor tellurium dioxide has been used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics in the future such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance of the elements less often recognized as metalloids beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity lead arsonate has been extensively used as an insecticide sulphur is one of the oldest of the fungicides and pesticides phosphorus sulfur zinc selenium and iodine are essential nutrients an aluminium tin and lead may be sulfur gallium selenium iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer gallium citrate a radiopharmaceutical facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials topic catalysts boron trifluoride and trichloride are used as catalysts in organic synthesis in electronics the tribromide is used in the manufacture of diborane non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorous ligands in some transition metal catalysts silica sulfuric acid silicon oxide OS o3h is used in organic reactions germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of pet plastic for containers cheaper antimony compounds such as the trioxide or triacetate are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas to boost the removal of carbon dioxide as have cell Innis acid and tell your assassin selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms tellurium it's dioxide and it's tetrachloride are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500 degrees Celsius graphite oxide can be used as a catalyst in the synthesis of I mines and their derivatives activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals topic flame-retardants compounds of boron silicon arsenic and antimony have been used as flame retardants boron in the form of borax has been used as a textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century silicon compounds such as silicones cylons sil sesqui oxide silica and silicates some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials arsenic compounds such as sodium arsenide or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood but have been less frequently used due to their toxicity antimony trioxide as a flame retardant aluminium hydroxide has been used as a wood fiber rubber plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s apart from aluminium hydroxide use of phosphorus based flame retardants in the form of for example organophosphates now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types these employ boron antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds topic glass formation the oxides b203 silicon oxide germanium oxide as 2:03 and antimony three oxide readily formed glasses Te'o two forms a glass but this requires a heroic quench rate or the addition of an impurity otherwise the crystalline form results these compounds are used in chemical domestic and industrial glassware and optics boron trioxide is used as a glass fiber additive and is also a component of borosilicate glass widely used for laboratory glassware and domestic oven where for its low thermal expansion most ordinary glassware is made from silicon dioxide germanium dioxide is used as a glass fiber additive as well as in infrared optical systems arsenic trioxide is used in the glass industry as a decolorizing and fining agent for the removal of bubbles as as antimony trioxide tellurium dioxide finds application in laser and nonlinear optics amorphous metallic glasses are generally most easily prepared if one of the components as a metalloid or near metalloid such as boron carbon silicon phosphorus or germanium aside from thin films deposited at very low temperatures the first known metallic glass was an alloy of composition reported in 1960 a metallic glass having a strength and toughness not previously seen of composition PD 82.5 hexa phosphorus known as silicide point 5j ii was reported in 2011 phosphorus selenium and lead which are less often recognized as metalloids are also used in glasses phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 rather than the silica silicon oxide of conventional silicate glasses it is used for example to make sodium lamps selenium compounds can be used both as decolorizing agents and to add a red color to glass decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead to oxide PBO lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PBO lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronic components enameling sealing and glazing materials and solar cells bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead in many of these applications topic optical storage and optoelectronics varying compositions of GES BTE GST alloys a nagging induct a ist alloys being examples of phase change materials are widely used in rewritable optical discs and phase change memory devices by applying heat they can be switched between amorphous glassy and crystalline states the change in optical and electrical properties can be used for information storage purposes future applications for GES BTE may include ultra-fast entirely solid-state displays with nanometer scale pixels semi-transparent smart glasses smart contact lenses and artificial retina devices topic pyrotechnics the recognized metalloids have either pyrotechnic applications or associated properties boron and silicon are commonly encountered they act somewhat like metal fuels boron is used in pyrotechnic initiator compositions for igniting other hard to start compositions and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate boron carbide has been identified as a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexa chloride pain mixtures in smoke munitions signal flares and fireworks silicon like boron is a component of initiator and delay mixtures doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel arsenic trisulfide as 2s3 was used in old naval signal lights in fireworks to make white stars in yellow smoke screen mixtures and in initiator compositions antimony trisulfide antimony 3 sulphide is found in white light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions Carbon aluminium phosphorus and selenium continue the theme Carbon in black powder is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants bursting charges and effects mixtures and military delay fuses and igniters aluminium is a common pyrotechnic ingredient and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat including in thermite mixtures phosphorus can be found in smoke and incendiary munitions paper caps used in toy guns and party poppers selenium has been used in the same way as tellurium topic semiconductors in electronics all the elements commonly recognized as metalloids or their compounds have been used in the semiconductor or solid-state electronic industries some properties of boron have limited its use as a semiconductor it has a high melting point single crystals are relatively hard to obtain and introducing and retaining controlled impurities as difficult silicon is the leading commercial semiconductor it forms the basis of modern electronics including standard solar cells and information and communication technologies this was despite the study of semiconductors early in the 20th century having been regarded as the physics of dirt and not deserving of close attention germanium has largely been replaced by silicon and semiconducting devices being cheaper more resilient at higher operating temperatures and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon germanium alloys and these have been growing in use particularly for wireless communication devices such a lousy exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium the synthesis of gram scale quantities of semiconducting German Ain was reported in 2013 this consists of one atom thick sheets of hydrogen terminated germanium atoms analogous to graphene it conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium and is thought to have potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications the development of a germanium wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014 in the same year Liat all reported that defect free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on and removed from a germanium substrate arsenic and antimony are not semiconductors in their standard states both form type 3v semiconductors such as gallium 3 arsenide aluminium antimonide Organa SSB in which the average number of valence electrons per atom is the same as that of Group 14 elements these compounds are preferred for some special applications antimony nano crystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries tellurium which is a semiconductor in its Stan state is used mainly as a component in type ii v semiconducting chalcogenides these have applications in electro optics and electronics cadmium telluride cadmium telluride is used in solar modules for its high conversion efficiency low manufacturing costs and large band gap of 1.4 4 electron volts letting it absorb a wide range of wavelengths bismuth telluride bismuth 3 telluride alloyed with selenium and antimony is a component of thermoelectric devices used for refrigeration or portable power generation 5 metalloids boron silicon germanium arsenic and antimony can be found in cell phones along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals tellurium is expected to find such use of the less often recognized metalloids phosphorus gallium in particular and selenium have semiconductor applications phosphorus is used in trace amounts as a dopant for n-type semiconductors the commercial use of gallium compounds is dominated by semiconductor applications in integrated circuits cell phones laser diodes light-emitting diodes photo detectors and solar cells selenium is used in the production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors boron silicon germanium antimony and tellurium as well as heavier metals and metalloids such as SM h g TL PB by and say can be found in topological insulators these are alloys or compounds which at ultra cold temperatures or room temperature depending on their composition are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors cadmium arsenide cadmium arsenide at about 1 K is a Dirac semi metal a bulk electronic analog of graphene in which electrons travel effectively as massless particles these two classes of material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications topic nomenclature and history you topic derivation and other names the word metalloid comes from the latin metal-on-metal and the greek OED resembling in form or appearance several names are sometimes used synonymously although some of these have other meanings that are not necessarily interchangeable amphoteric element boundary element half metal half way element near metal meta metal semiconductor semi metal and submittal amphoteric element is sometimes used more broadly to include transition metals capable of forming oxyanions such as chromium and manganese half metal is used in physics to refer to a compound such as chromium dioxide or alloy that can act as a conductor and an insulator meta metal is sometimes used instead to refer to certain metals B ZN c d hg in t l beta SN PB located just to the left of the metalloids on standard periodic tables these metals are mostly diamagnetic and tend to have distorted crystalline structures electrical conductivity values at the lower end of those of metals and Mpho Taric weakly basic oxides semi metal sometimes refers loosely or explicitly to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure electrical conductivity or electronic structure examples include gallium ytterbium bismuth and neptunium the names anthat eric element and semiconductor are problematic as some elements referred to as metalloids do not show marked amphoteric behavior bismuth for example or semi conductivity polonium in their most stable forms topic origin and usage the origin and usage of the term metalloid is convoluted its origin lies in attempts dating from antiquity to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms it was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water sodium and potassium and then more popularly to nonmetals earlier usage in mineralogy to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance can be sourced to as early as 1800 since the mid twentieth century it has been used to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements the international union of pure and applied chemistry IUPAC previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid and suggested using the term semi metal instead use of this latter term has more recently been discouraged by Acton's at all as it has a different meaning in physics one that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element the most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semi metal topic elements commonly recognized as metalloids properties noted in this section refer to the elements in their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions topic boron pure boron does a shiny silver gray crystalline solid it is less dense than aluminium two point three four versus two point seven zero grams per CC and is hard and brittle it is barely reactive under normal conditions except for attacked by fluorine and has a melting point of two thousand seventy six degrees Celsius CF steel approximately one thousand three hundred seventy degrees Celsius boron is a semiconductor it's room temperature electrical conductivity is one point five times ten minus six SCM minus one about two hundred times less than that of tap water and it has a band gap of about one point five six electron volts the structural chemistry of boron is dominated by its small atomic size and relatively high ionization energy with only three valence electrons per boron atom simple covalent bonding cannot fulfill the octet rule metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenita boron but this generally requires low ionization energies instead because of its small size and high ionization energies the basic structural unit of boron and nearly all of its allotropes is the icosahedral b12 cluster of the thirty-six electrons associated with twelve boron atoms twenty-six reside in thirteen delocalized molecular orbitals the other ten electrons are used to form two and three Center covalent bonds between icosahedra the same motif can be seen as our Delta he drool variants or fragments in metal borides and hydride derivatives and in some halides the bonding in boron has been described as being characteristic of behavior intermediate between metals and non metallic covalent Network solids such as diamond the energy required to transform B C n C and P from nonmetallic to metallic States has been estimated as 30 100 240 33 and 50 kilo joules per mole respectively this indicates the proximity of boron to the metal nonmetal borderline most of the chemistry of boron as nonmetallic in nature unlike its heavier congeners it is not known to form a simple B 3 plus or hydrated B h2o for 3 plus cation the small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy type borides analogies between boron and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes and adducts for example BH 3 + Co BH 3 C Owen similarly fate Co 4 + Co Fei Co 5 as well as in the geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as B 6 H 6 2 - and Roo 6 Co 18 2 - the aqueous chemistry of boron is characterized by the formation of many different poly borate anions given its high charge to size ratio boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds the exceptions are the borides as these include depending on their composition covalent ionic and metallic bonding components simple binary compounds such as boron trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron pair donated by a Lewis base boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive boric chemistry the oxide b2o3 is polymeric instructure weakly acidic and a glass former organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century see organo boron chemistry topic silicon silicon is a crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster like boron it is less dense at 2.33 grams per CC than aluminium and is hard and brittle it is a relatively unreactive element according to Rocko the massive crystalline form especially if pure is remarkably inert to all assets including hydrofluoric less pure silicon and the powdered form are variously susceptible to attack by strong or heated

Celsius silicon is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of 10-4 SCM minus 1 and a band gap of about 1.1 one electron volt when it melts silicon becomes a reasonable metal with an electrical conductivity of 1.0 to 1.3 times 104 SCM minus one similar to that of liquid mercury the chemistry of silicon is generally nonmetallic covalent in nature it is not known to form a cation silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper it shows fewer tendencies to an ionic behavior than ordinary nonmetals it's solution chemistry is characterized by the formation of oxyanions the high strength of the silicon oxygen bond dominates the chemical behavior of silicon polymeric silicates built up by tetrahedral silicon oxide units sharing their oxygen atoms are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon the polymeric borates comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral b o3 or b o4 units are built on similar structural principles the oxide silicon oxide is polymeric in structure weakly acidic and a glass former traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon C Organa silicon topic germanium germanium is a shiny gray white solid it has a

around 2 times 10 minus 2 SCM minus 1 and a bandgap of 0.67 electron volts liquid germanium as a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity similar to that of liquid mercury most of the chemistry of germanium is characteristic of a nonmetal whether or not germanium forms a cation is unclear aside from the reported existence of the j2 plus ion in a few esoteric compounds it can form alloys with metals such as aluminium and gold it shows fewer tendencies to an ionic behavior than ordinary nonmetals it's solution chemistry is characterized by the formation of oxyanions germanium generally forms tetravalent IV compounds and it can also form less stable divalent 2 compounds in which it behaves more like a metal germanium analogs of all of the major types of silicates have been prepared the metallic character of germanium is also suggested by the formation of various oxoacids salts a phosphate hpo4 2j h2o and highly stable tri fluoro acetate j OC OC f34 have been described as have germanium sulfate germanium perchlorate and germanium hydride c 2o 4 3 the oxide germanium oxide is polymeric amphoteric and a glass former the dioxide is soluble in acidic solutions the monoxide geo is even more so and this is sometimes used to classified germanium as a metal up to the 1930s germanium was considered to be a poorly conducting metal it has occasionally been classified as a metal by later writers as with all the elements commonly recognized as metalloids germanium has an established organometallic chemistry see organo germanium chemist topic arsenic arsenic is a

ionic behavior than ordinary nonmetals it's solution chemistry is characterized by the formation of oxyanions arsenic generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5 the halides and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples in the trivalent state arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties the halides are hydrolyzed by water but these reactions particularly those of the chloride are reversible with the addition of a hydro Halleck acid the oxide is acidic but as noted below weakly amphoteric the higher less stable pentavalent state has strongly acidic nonmetallic properties compared to phosphorus the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacids salts such as a spa for as to so4 3 and arsenic

prepared in 2004 it can form alloys with one or more metals such as aluminium iron nickel copper zinc tin lead and bismuth antimony has fewer tendencies to an ionic behavior than ordinary nonmetals its solution chemistry is characterized by the formation of oxyanions like arsenic antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5 the halides and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples the +5 state is less stable than the +3 but relatively easier to attain them with arsenic this is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons in comparison the tendency of antimony being a heavier atom to oxidize more easily partially offset to the it's for d10 she'll try positive antimony is Mpho tarik Penta positive antimony is predominantly acidic consistent with an increase in metallic character down group fifteen antimony forms salts or salt like compounds including a nitrate antimony three nitrate

the formation of oxyanions tellurium generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of minus 2 plus 4 or plus 6 the +4 state is the most stable tell your Ides of composition xx tear easily formed with most other elements and represent the most common tellurium minerals non stoichiometry is pervasive especially with transition metals many Telluride x' can be regarded as metallic alloys the increase in metallic character evident in tellurium as compared to the lighter calso jhin's is further reflected in the reported formation of various other oxyacid salts such as a basic cell innate to Teo to selenium trioxide and an analogous perchlorate and pariah date to Teo 2 HX o for tellurium forms a polymeric amphoteric glass forming oxide tio 2 it is a conditional glass forming oxide it forms a glass with a very small amount of additive tellurium has an extensive organometallic chemistry see organo tellurium chemistry topic elements less commonly recognized as metalloids you topic carbon carbon is ordinarily classified as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally classified as a metalloid hexagonal graphitic carbon graphite is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions it has a lustrous appearance and as a fairly good electrical conductor graphite has a layered structure each layer consists of carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice arrangement the layers are stacked together and held loosely by Vander Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons like a metal the conductivity of graphite in the direction of its planes decreases as the temperature is raised it has the electronic band structure of a semi metal the allotropes of carbon including graphite can accept foreign atoms or compounds into their structures via substitution intercalation or doping the resulting materials are referred to as carbon alloys carbon can form ionic salts including a hydrogen sulfate perchlorate and nitrate c plus 24x minus 2h x where x equals hso4 chlorine tetroxide and c plus 2 4 and O minus 3.3 H and O 3 in organic chemistry carbon can form complex cations termed carbocations in which the positive charges on the carbon atom examples are CH plus 3 and c h plus 5 and their derivatives carbon is brittle and behaves as a semiconductor in a direction perpendicular to its planes most of its chemistry is nonmetallic it has a relatively high ionization energy and compared to most metals a relatively high electronegativity carbon can form anions such as c 4 minus method I'd C 2 minus 2 a satellite and C 3 minus 4 sesqui carbide or a Lilin ID in compounds with metals of main groups 1 2 3 and with the lanthanides and actinides it's oxide SiO 2 forms carbonic acid h2co3 equals topic aluminium equals aluminium is ordinarily classified as a metal it is lustrous malleable and ductile and has high electrical and thermal conductivity like most metals it has a close-packed crystalline structure and forms a cation in aqueous solution it has some properties that are unusual for a metal taken together these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds the oxide aluminium oxide as Mpho Taric in a conditional glass former aluminium can form an ionic illuminates such behavior being considered nonmetallic in character classifying aluminium as a metalloid has been disputed given its many metallic properties it is therefore arguably an exception to the mnemonic that elements adjacent to the metal nonmetal dividing line or metalloids stott labels aluminium as a weak metal it has the physical properties of a metal but some of the chemical properties of a non metal steel notes the paradoxical chemical behavior of aluminium it resembles a weak metal in its Mpho Taric oxide and in the covalent character of many of its compounds yet it is a highly electrolytic metal with a high negative electrode potential moody says that aluminium is on the diagonal borderland between metals and nonmetals in the chemical sense equals topic selenium equals selenium shows borderline metalloid or nonmetal behavior it's most stable form the great trigonal allotrope is sometimes called metallic selenium because it's electrical conductivity is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the red monoclinic form the metallic character of selenium is further shown by its luster and it's crystalline structure which is thought to include weakly metallic interchain bonding selenium can be drawn into thin threads when molten and viscous it shows reluctance to acquire the high positive oxidation numbers characteristic of nonmetals it can form cyclic polycation 'z such as say 2 plus 8 when dissolved in ol iums and attribute it shares with sulfur and tellurium and a hydrolyzed cationic salt in the form of tri hydroxy selenium IV perchlorate selenium tri hydroxide plus CL o for the nonmetallic character of selenium is shown by its brittleness and the low electrical conductivity approximately 10 - 9 - 10 - 12 SCM - one of its highly purified form this is comparable to or less than that of bromine 7.95 times 10 to 12 SCM - 1 a nonmetal selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in liquid form it has a relatively high electronegativity 2.55 revised Pauling scale it's reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic and ionic forms say 2 - selenium dioxide - 3 and selenium dioxide - 4 selenium is commonly described as a metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature it moves through the aquatic environment similarly to arsenic and antimony it's water soluble salts in higher concentrations have a similar toxicological profile to that of arsenic topic polonium Polonia mosz distinctly metallic in some ways both of its allotropic forms are metallic conductors it is soluble in acids forming the rose-colored po2 plus cation and displacing hydrogen po plus 2 h plus po 2 + + H too many polonium salts are known the oxide polonium 4 oxide is predominantly basic in nature polonium is a reluctant oxidizing agent unlike its lightest congener oxygen highly reducing conditions are required for the formation of the po 2 - anion in aqueous solution weather polonium as ductile or brittle is unclear it is predicted to be ductile based on its calculated elastic constants it has a simple cubic crystalline structure such a structure has few slip systems in leads to very low ductility and hence low fracture resistance polonium shows nonmetallic character in its halides and by the existence of Polana T's the halides have properties generally characteristic of non metal halides being volatile easily hydrolyzed and soluble in organic solvents many metal Polana teas obtained by heating the elements together at 500 to 1000 degrees Celsius and containing the PO 2 - anion are also known topic astatine as a halogen astatine tends to be classified as a nonmetal it has some marked metallic properties and as sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or less often as a metal immediately following its production in 1940 a investigators considered it a metal in 1949 it was called the most noble difficult to reduce nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble difficult to oxidize metal in 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and therefore a reactive nonmetal in 2013 on the basis of relativistic modelling astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal with a face centered cubic crystal in structure several authors have commented on the metallic nature of some of the properties of astatine since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization increment hvap greater than approximately 42 kilo joules per mole are metallic when liquid such elements include boron silicon germanium antimony selenium and tellurium estimated values for increment hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kilo joules per mole or higher diatomic iodine with an increment hvap of 40 1.71 falls just short of the threshold figure like typical metals it astatine is precipitated by hydrogen sulfide even from strongly acid solutions and is displaced in a free-form from sulphate solutions it is deposited on the cathode on electrolysis further indications of a tendency for astatine to behave like a heavy metal are the formation of pseudo halide compounds complexes of astatine cations complex anions of trivalent astatine as well as complexes with a variety of organic solvents it has also been argued that astatine demonstrates cationic behavior by way of stable at plus and Auto plus forms in strongly acidic aqueous solutions some of a students reported properties are nonmetallic it has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals MP 302 degrees Celsius BP 337 degrees Celsius that Sanath gives a calculated bandgap energy for astatine of 0.7 electron volts this is consistent with nonmetals in physics having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators the chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterized by the formation of various anionic species most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine which is a halogen in a nonmetal such compounds include asta tides xat acetates hot o3 and mono valent interhalogen compounds Restrepo at all reported that astatine appeared to be more polonium like than halogen like they did so on the basis of detailed comparative studies of the known and interpolated properties of 72 elements topic related concepts you topic near metalloids in the periodic table some of the elements adjacent to the commonly recognized metalloids although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals are occasionally referred to as near metalloids are noted for their metal oil character to the left of the metal nonmetal dividing line such elements include gallium tin and bismuth they show unusual packing structures marked covalent chemistry molecular or polymeric and Mpho tourism to the right of the dividing line are carbon phosphorus selenium and iodine they exhibit metallic luster semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character this applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions carbon as graphite phosphorus as black phosphorus and selenium as gray selenium topic allotropes different crystalline forms of an element are called allotropes some allotropes particularly those of elements located in periodic table terms alongside her near the notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals exhibit more pronounced metallic metalloid allure nonmetallic behavior than others the existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved tin for example has two allotropes two trigonal white beta tin and cubic gray alpha tin white tin is a very shiny ductile and malleable metal it is the stable form at or above room temperature and has an electrical conductivity of 9.1 seven times 104 SCM minus 1 tilde one-sixth that of copper great in usually has the appearance of a grey micro crystalline powder and can also be prepared in brittle semi lustrous crystalline or poly crystalline forms it is the stable form below thirteen point two degrees Celsius and has an electrical conductivity of between two to five times 102 SCM minus 1 tilde one 250th that of white tin great in has the same crystalline structure as that of diamond it behaves as a semi conductor as if it had a bandgap of 0.08 electron volts but has the electronic band structure of a semi metal it has been referred to as either a very poor metal a metalloid a nonmetal or a near metalloid the diamond allotrope of carbon is clearly nonmetallic being translucent and having a low electrical conductivity of 10 - 14 to 10 - 16 as cm - one graphite has an electrical conductivity of three times 104 SCM - one a figure more characteristic of a metal phosphorus sulfur arsenic selenium antimony and bismuth also have less stable allotropes that display different behaviors topic

magnesium B 2 O 3 + 3 mega grams 2b + 3 mg o after secondary processing the resulting Brown powder has a purity of up to 97% boron of higher purity greater than 99% is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds such as bcl3 or BB r3 either in a hydrogen atmosphere to be x3 + 3 H - 2 B plus 6 HX or to the point of thermal decomposition silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen silicon oxide plus CC plus co2 germanium oxide plus 2 h 2 j + 2 h2o arsenic is isolated from its pyrite fast or arsenical pyrite iron 6 arsenide by heating alternatively it can be obtained from its oxide by reduction with carbon 2 is 2 O 3 plus 3 C 2 as plus 3 CO 2 antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron antimony 3 sulfide 2 SB + 3 FES tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH yielding Telluride then by electrolytic reduction teo 2 + 2 NaOH sodium Telluride + h2o sodium Telluride + h2o teh + 2 NaOH +

equals the recognized metalloids and they're closer neighbors mostly cost less than silver only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold on account of their significant radioactivity as of the 5th of April 2014 prices for small samples up to 100 grams of silicon antimony and tellurium and graphite aluminium and selenium averaged around one third the cost of silver one dollar and fifty cents per gram or about $45 an ounce boron germanium and arsenic samples averaged about three and a half times the cost of silver polonium is available for about $100 per microgram zelitsky and prison
