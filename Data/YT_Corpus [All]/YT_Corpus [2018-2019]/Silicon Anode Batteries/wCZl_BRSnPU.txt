 the problem with most drugs is that they don't reach their target let's take this example although we have the cure to treat this tumor there are few efficient ways to avoid that the drug is spread throughout the whole body normally not more than 1% of the drug actually reaches the disease cells the remaining 99% distributes throughout the body and will often have a negative impact on healthy cells side effects will occur as a result of this porous silicon nanoparticles is a drug carrier that you can design according to your needs the pores of the particle are loaded with the desired drug and the particle is targeted to search for specific cells the medication based on the drug carrier system is injected into the body the nanoparticle will concentrate around the target cells and release the drug in the target area resulting in a higher portion of the drug impacting the disease cells due to the targeted drug carrier it is possible to reduce drug doses and still achieve the same result at a much lower ratio of side-effects naca made the natural way to treatment efficiency revolutionize your treatment schemes with porous silicon nanoparticles [Music]
