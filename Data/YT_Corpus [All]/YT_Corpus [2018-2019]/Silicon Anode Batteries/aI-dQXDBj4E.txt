 magnesium is a chemical element with symbol mg and atomic number 12 it is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column group 2 or alkaline earth metals of the periodic table all group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe it is produced in large ageing stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus when such stars explode as supernovas much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the fourth most common element in the earth after iron oxygen and silicon making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planets mantle it is the third most abundant element dissolved in sea water after sodium and chlorine magnesium occurs naturally only in combination with other elements where it invariably has a +2 oxidation state the free element metal can be produced artificially and is highly reactive though in the atmosphere it is soon coated in a thin layer of oxide that partly inhibits reactivity see passivation the free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light the metal has now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine and is used primarily as a component in aluminium magnesium alloys sometimes called magma Liem or magnesium magnesium is less dense than aluminium and the alloy is prized for its combination of lightness and strength magnesium is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body and is essential to all cells in some 3-hundred enzymes magnesium ions interact with polyphosphate compounds such as ATP DNA and RNA hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives antacids eg milk of magnesia and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm in such conditions as a clamp SIA topic characteristics you topic physical properties elemental magnesium is a gray white lightweight metal 2/3 the density of aluminium it tarnishes slightly when exposed to air although unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove magnesium has the lowest melting 923 K 1202 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest boiling point 1363 K 1994 degrees Fahrenheit of all the alkaline earth metals magnesium reacts with water at room temperature though it reacts much more slowly than calcium a similar group to metal when submerged in water hydrogen bubbles formed slowly on the surface of the metal though if powdered it reacts much more rapidly the reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures see safety precautions magnesium's reversible reaction with water can be harnessed to store energy and run a magnesium based engine magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids such as hydrochloric acid HCL producing the metal chloride and hydrogen gas similar to the HCL reaction with aluminium zinc and many other metals topic chemical properties you topic flammability magnesium is highly flammable especially when powdered are shaved into thin strips though it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach 3100 degrees Celsius five thousand six hundred ten degrees Fahrenheit although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than 300 millimetres 12 in once ignited such fires are difficult to extinguish because combustion continues in nitrogen forming magnesium nitride carbon dioxide forming magnesium oxide and carbon and water forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen this property was used in incendiary weapons during the fire bombing of cities in World War two where the only practical civil defense was to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude atmosphere from the combustion magnesium may also be used as an igniter for thermite a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that ignites only at a very high temperature topic source of light you when burning in air magnesium produces a brilliant white light that includes strong ultraviolet wavelengths magnesium powder flash powder was used for subject elimination in the early days of photography later magnesium filament was used in electrically ignited single use photography flash bulbs magnesium powder is used in fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white light is required it was also used for various theatrical effects such as lightning pistol flashes and supernatural appearances topic occurrence magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron and molarity it is found in large deposits of magnesite dolomite and other minerals and in mineral waters where magnesium ion - soluble although magnesium is found in more than 60 minerals only dolomite magnesite brucite karna light talc and olivine are of commercial importance the mg 2 plus cation is the second most abundant cation in seawater about one-eighth the mass of sodium ions in a given sample which makes seawater and sea salt attractive commercial sources for mg to extract the magnesium calcium hydroxide is added to seawater to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate magnesium chloride plus calcium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide plus calcium chloride magnesium hydroxide brucite is insoluble in water and can be filtered out and reacted with hydrochloric acid to produced concentrated magnesium chloride magnesium hydroxide plus 2 HCL magnesium chloride plus 2 h2o from magnesium chloride electrolysis produces magnesium topic forms you topic alloy as of 2013 magnesium alloy consumption was less than 1 million tonnes per year compared with 50 million tons of aluminum alloys its use has been historically limited by its tendency to corrode creep at high temperatures and combust topic corrosion the presence of iron nickel copper and cobalt strongly activates corrosion greater than a very small percentage these metals precipitate as inter metallic compounds and the precipitate locales function as active cathodic sites that reduce water causing the loss of magnesium controlling the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance sufficient manganese overcomes the corrosive effects of iron this requires precise control over composition increasing costs adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal this prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas an essential factor of corrosive chemical processes the addition of about 1 in 300 parts arsenic reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly 10 topic high temperature creep and flammability research showed that magnesium's tendency to creep at high temperatures is eliminated by the addition of scandium and gadolinium flammability is greatly reduced by a small amount of calcium in the alloy topic compounds magnesium forms a variety of compounds important to industry and biology including magnesium carbonate magnesium chloride magnesium citrate magnesium hydroxide milk of magnesia magnesium oxide magnesium sulfate and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate epsom salts topic isotopes magnesium has three stable isotopes 24 mega grams 25 mega grams and 26 mega grams all are present in significant amounts see table of isotopes above about 79% of Mg as 24 mega grams the isotope 28 mega grams is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was produced by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments this isotope has a relatively short half-life 21 hours and it's use was limited by shipping times the nuclide 26 mega grams has found application in isotopic geology similar to that of aluminium 26 mega grams as a radiogenic daughter product of 26 L which has a half-life of 717 thousand years excessive quantities of stable 26 mega grams have been observed in the CL rich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites this anomalous abundance is attributed to the decay of its parent 26 al in the inclusions and researchers conclude that such meteorites were formed in the solar nebula before the 26 al had decayed these are among the oldest objects in the solar system and contain preserved information about its early history it is conventional to plot 26 mega grams 24 mega grams against an al per megagram ratio in an isochron dating plot the al / megagram ratio plotted as 27 out 24 mega grams the slope of the isochron has no age significance but indicates the initial 26 out 27 al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir topic production you China is the dominant supplier of magnesium with approximately 80% of the world market share China is almost completely reliant on the silicon thermic pigeon processed the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon often provided by a ferrous silicon alloy in which the iron is but a spectator in the reactions to obtain the metal the process can also be carried out with carbon at approximately 2300 degrees Celsius 2 mg o s plus 6 plus 2 C AOS 2 mega grams G plus calcium silicate s mg o s plus C's mg g plus co G in the United States magnesium has obtained principally with the doubt process by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brine and seawater a saline solution containing mg 2 plus ions as first treated with lime calcium oxide and the precipitated magnesium hydroxide is collected mg 2 plus aq plus CA o s plus h2o CA 2 + AQ + magnesium hydroxide s the hydroxide is then converted to a partial hydrate of magnesium chloride by treating the hydroxide with hydrochloric acid and heating of the product magnesium hydroxide s plus 2 HCL magnesium chloride AQ + 2 h2o l the salt is then electrolyzed in the molten state at the cathode the mg 2 plus ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal mg 2 plus plus 2 e minus ma at the anode each pair of cl- ions is oxidized to chlorine gas releasing two electrons to complete the circuit 2 CL minus CL 2g plus 2 e - a new process solid oxide membrane technology involves the electrolytic reduction of MgO at the cathode mg 2 plus ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal the electrolyte as it Ria's stabilized zirconia YSZ the anode as a liquid metal at the YSZ liquid metal anode o 2 minus is oxidized a layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode and at this interface carbon and oxygen react carbon-monoxide when silver is used as the liquid metal anode there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed and only oxygen gas has evolved at the anode it has been reported that this method provides a 40% reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic reduction method this method is more environmentally sound than others because there is much less carbon dioxide emitted the United States has traditionally been the major world's supplier of this metal supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995 today the US market share is at 7% with a single domestic producer left us magnesium a Renko group company in Utah born from now-defunct mag Corp topic history the name magnesium originates from the Greek word for a district in Thessaly called magnesia it is related to magnetite and manganese which also originated from this area and required differentiation as separate substances see manganese for this history in 1618 a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a well there the cows refused to drink because of the waters bitter taste but the farmer noticed that the waters seemed to heal scratches and rashes the substance became known as epsom salts in its fame spread it was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate magnesium sulfate 7 h2o the metal itself was first isolated by Sir Humphrey Davy in England in 1808 he used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide Antoine bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831 Davies first suggestion for a name was Magnum but the name magnesium is now used topic uses as a metal magnesium as the third most commonly used structural metal following iron and aluminium the main applications of magnesium are in order aluminium alloys die casting alloyed with zinc removing sulfur in the production of iron and steel and the production of titanium in the Kroll process magnesium is used in super-strong lightweight materials and alloys for example when infused with silicon carbide nanoparticles it has extremely high specific strength historically magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War one and extensively for German aircraft in World War two the Germans coined the name electron for magnesium alloy a term which is still used today in the commercial aerospace industry magnesium was generally restricted to engine related components due to fire and corrosion hazards currently magnesium alloy use in aerospace is increasing driven by the importance of fuel economy development and testing of new magnesium alloys continues notably electron 21 which in tests has proved suitable for aerospace engine internal and airframe components the European community runs three R and D magnesium projects in the aerospace priority of six framework programme in the form of thin ribbons magnesium is used to purify solvents for example preparing super dry ethanol topic aircraft Wright aeronautical used a magnesium crankcase in the wwii era right duplex cyclone aviation engine this presented a serious problem for the earliest models of the Boeing b-29 heavy bomber when an in-flight engine fire ignited the engine crankcase the resulting combustion was as hot as 5,600 degrees Fahrenheit 3,100 degrees Celsius and could sever the wing spar from the fuselage topic automotive mercedes-benz used the alloy electron in the body of an early model mercedes-benz 300sl are these cars ran with successes at Lamont the Mille Miglia and other world-class race events in 1955 Porsche used magnesium alloy frames in the 917 Oh 5-3 that one Lamont's in 1971 and continues to use magnesium alloys for its engine blocks due to the weight advantage Volkswagen Group has used

series models as well as the z4 x1 x3 and x5 Chevrolet used the magnesium alloy AE 44 in the 2006 Corvette zo6 both a J 6 2 a and a II 44 are recent developments in high temperature low creep magnesium alloys the general strategy for such alloys is to form inter metallic precipitates at the grain boundaries for example by adding mish metal or calcium new alloy development and lower costs that make magnesium competitive with aluminium will increase the number of automotive applications topic electronics because of low weight and good mechanical and electrical properties magnesium is widely used for manufacturing of mobile phones laptop and tablet computers cameras and other electronic components topic other magnesium being readily available and relatively non-toxic has a variety of uses magnesium is flammable burning at a temperature of approximately 3,100 degrees Celsius three thousand three hundred seventy K five thousand six hundred ten degrees Fahrenheit and the auto ignition temperature of magnesium ribbon is approximately four hundred seventy three degrees Celsius 746 K eight hundred eighty three degrees Fahrenheit it produces intense bright white light when it burns magnesium's high combustion temperature makes it a useful tool for starting emergency fires other uses include flash photography flares pyrotechnics and fireworks sparklers magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite or other materials that require a high ignition temperature in the form of turnings or ribbons to prepare grignard reagents which are useful in organic synthesis as an additive agent in conventional propellants and the production of modular graphite in cast iron as a reducing agent to separate uranium and other metals from their salts as a sacrificial galvanic anode to protect boats underground tanks pipelines buried structures and water heaters alloyed with zinc to produce the zinc sheet used in photo engraving plates in the printing industry dry cell battery walls and roofing as a metal this elements principle uses as an alloying additive to aluminium with these aluminium magnesium alloys being used mainly for beverage cans sports equipment such as golf clubs fishing reels and archery bows and arrows specialty high grade car wheels of magnesium alloy are called mag wheels although the term is often miss applied to aluminium wheels many car and aircraft manufacturers have made engine and body parts for magnesium magnesium batteries have been commercialized as primary batteries and are an active topic of research for rechargeable secondary batteries topic safety precautions magnesium metal and it's alloys can be explosive hazards they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form burning or molten magnesium reacts violently with water when working with powdered magnesium safety glasses with eye protection and UV filters such as welders use are employed because burning magnesium produces ultraviolet light that can permanently damage the retina of a human eye magnesium is capable of reducing water and releasing highly flammable hydrogen gas MGS + 2 h2o l magnesium hydroxide s + h2 G therefore water cannot extinguish magnesium fires the hydrogen gas produced intensifies the fire dry sand is an effective smothering agent but only on relatively level and flat surfaces magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide exothermically to form magnesium oxide and carbon to mega grams + co2 to mg o + CS hence carbon dioxide fuels rather than extinguishes magnesium fires burning magnesium can be quenched by using a Class D dry chemical fire extinguisher or by covering the fire with sand or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source topic useful compounds magnesium compounds primarily magnesium oxide MgO are used as a refractory material in furnace linings for producing iron steel non-ferrous metals glass and cement magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural chemical and construction industries magnesium oxide from calcination is used as an electrical insulator in fire resistant cables magnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a grignard reagent which is a very useful tool for preparing alcohols magnesium salts are included in various foods fertilizers magnesium as a component of chlorophyll and microbe Culture Media magnesium sulfate is used in the manufacture of paper sulfite process magnesium phosphate is used to fireproof wood used in construction magnesium hexa Flores silicate is used for moth proofing textiles topic biological roles you topic mechanism of action the important interaction between phosphate and magnesium ions makes magnesium essential to the basic nucleic acid chemistry of all cells of all known living organisms more than 300 enzymes require magnesium ions for their catalytic action including all enzymes using or synthesizing ATP and those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA the ATP molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion topic dietary sources recommended intake and supplementation spices nuts cereals cocoa and vegetables are rich sources of magnesium green leafy vegetables such as spinach are also rich in magnesium in the UK the recommended daily values for magnesium are 300 milligrams for men and 270 milligrams for women in the US the recommended dietary allowances are das are 400 milligrams for men ages 19 to 30 and 420 milligrams for older for women 310 milligrams for ages 19 to 30 and 320 milligrams for older numerous pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium and dietary supplements are available in two human trials magnesium oxide one of the most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because of its high magnesium content per weight was less bioavailable than magnesium citrate chloride lactate or aspartate topic metabolism an adult has 22 to 26 grams of magnesium with 60% in the skeleton 39% intracellular 20% in skeletal muscle and 1% extracellular serum levels are typically 0.7 to 1.0 mmol/l or 1.8 to 2.4 meq/l serum magnesium levels may be normal even when intracellular magnesium is deficient the mechanisms for maintaining the magnesium level in the serum are varying gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion intracellular magnesium is correlated with intracellular potassium increased magnesium lowers calcium and can either prevent hypercalcemia or cause hypocalcemia depending on the initial level both low and high protein intake conditions inhibit magnesium absorption as does the amount of phosphate phytate and fat in the gut unabsorbed dietary magnesium as excreted in feces absorbed magnesium as excreted in urine and sweat topic detection in serum and plasma magnesium status may be assessed by measuring serum and erythrocyte magnesium concentrations coupled with urinary and fecal magnesium content but intravenous magnesium loading tests are more accurate and practical a retention of 20% or more of the injected amount indicates deficiency no biomarker has been established for magnesium magnesium concentrations in plasma or serum may be monitored for efficacy and safety and those receiving the drug therapeutically to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose the newborn children of mothers who received parental magnesium sulfate during labour may exhibit toxicity with normal serum magnesium levels topic deficiency low plasma magnesium hypomagnesemia is common it is found in 2.5 to 15 percent of the general population from 2005 to 2006 48% of the United States population consumed less magnesium than recommended in the Dietary Reference intake other causes are increased renal or gastrointestinal loss an increased intracellular shift and proton pump inhibitor antacid therapy most are asymptomatic but symptoms referral to neuromuscular cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction may occur alcoholism is often associated with magnesium deficiency chronically low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus type 2 fasciculation and hypertension topic therapy intravenous magnesium is recommended by the ACCA HAES C 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death for patients with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long QT syndrome and for the treatment of patients with digoxin induced arrhythmias magnesium sulfate intravenous is used for the management of preeclampsia and eclampsia hypomagnesemia including that caused by alcoholism is reversible by oral or parental magnesium administration depending on the degree of deficiency there is limited evidence that magnesium supplementation may play a role in the prevention and treatment of migraine sorted by type of magnesium salt other therapeutic applications include magnesium sulfate as the heptahydrate called epsom salts is used as bath salts a laxative and a highly soluble fertilizer magnesium hydroxide suspended in water is used in milk of magnesia antacids and laxatives magnesium chloride oxide gluconate malate orotate glycinate ascorbate and citrate are all used as oral magnesium supplements magnesium borate magnesium salicylate and magnesium sulfate are used as antiseptics magnesium bromide is used as a mild sedative this action is due to the bromide not the magnesium magnesium stearate is a slightly flammable white powder with lubricating properties in pharmaceutical technology it is used in pharmacological manufacture to prevent tablets from sticking to the equipment while compressing the ingredients into tablet form magnesium carbonate powder is used by athletes such as gymnasts weight lifters and climbers to eliminate pom sweat prevent sticking and improve the grip on gymnastic apparatus lifting bars and climbing rocks topic overdose overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the blood is promptly filtered by the kidneys and overdoses more likely in the presence of impaired renal function in spite of this mega dose therapy has caused death in a young child and severe hypermagnesemia in a woman and a young girl who had healthy kidneys the most common symptoms of overdose are nausea vomiting and diarrhea other symptoms include hypotension confusion slowed heart and respiratory rate deficiencies of other minerals coma cardiac arrhythmia and death from cardiac arrest topic function implants plants require magnesium to synthesize chlorophyll essential for photosynthesis magnesium in the center of the porphyrin ring and chlorophyll functions in a manner similar to the iron in the center of the porphyrin ring and heme magnesium deficiency in plants causes late season yellowing between leaf veins especially in older leaves and can be corrected by either applying epsom salts which is rapidly leached or crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil topic see also list of countries by magnesium production magnesium oil equals equals modes
