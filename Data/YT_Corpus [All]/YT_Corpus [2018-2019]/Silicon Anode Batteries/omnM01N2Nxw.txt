 graphite archaically referred to as plumbago is a crystalline allotrope of carbon a semi metal a native element mineral and a form of coal graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions therefore it is used in thermo chemistry as the standard state for defining the heat of formation of carbon compounds topic types and varieties the principle types of natural graphite each occurring in different types of ore deposits are crystalline small flakes of graphite or flake graphite occurs as isolated flat plate like particles with hexagonal edges of unbroken when broken the edges can be irregular or angular amorphous graphite very fine flake graphite is sometimes called amorphous lump graphite or vane graphite occurs in fissure veins or fractures and appears as massive platy inter growths of fibrous or acicular crystalline aggregates and is probably hydrothermal in origin highly ordered pyrolytic graphite refers to graphite with an angular spread between the graphite sheets of less than 1 degree the named graphite fiber is sometimes used to refer to carbon fibers or carbon fiber reinforced polymer topic occurrence graphite occurs in metamorphic rocks as a result of the reduction of sedimentary carbon compounds during metamorphism it also occurs in igneous rocks and in meteorites minerals associated with graphite include quartz calcite Mica's and tourmaline in meteorites graphite occurs with troilite and silicate minerals small graphitic crystals in meteoritic iron are called cliff tonight some microscopic grains have distinctive isotopic compositions indicating that they were formed before the solar system they are one of about 12 known types of mineral that predate the solar system and have also been detected in molecular clouds these minerals were formed in the ejecta when supernova exploded or low to intermediate sized stars expelled their outer envelopes late in their lives graphite may be the second or third oldest mineral in the universe topic properties you topic structure graphite has a layered planar structure the individual layers are called graphene in each layer the carbon atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice with separation of 0.14 to nanometers and the distance between planes is 0.33 5 nanometers atoms in the plane are bonded covalently with only three of the four potential bonding sites satisfied the fourth electron is free to migrate in the plane making graphite electrically conductive however it does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane bonding between layers as via weak van der Waals bonds which allows layers of graphite to be easily separated or to slide past each other the two known forms of graphite alpha hexagonal and beta rhombohedral have very similar physical properties except for that the graphene layers stacked slightly differently the Alpha graphite may be either flat or buckled the Alpha form can be converted to the beta form through mechanical treatment and the beta form reverts to the Alpha form when it is heated above 1,300 degrees Celsius topic thermodynamics the equilibrium pressure and temperature conditions for a transition between graphite and diamond is well-established theoretically and experimentally the pressure changes linearly between 1.7 Giga Pascal's at 0k and 12 Giga Pascal's at 5,000 K the diamond graphite liquid triple point however the phases have a wide region about this line where they can coexist at normal temperature and pressure 20 degrees Celsius 293 K and one standard atmosphere 0.10 mega Pascal's the stable phase of carbon is graphite but diamond is metastable and its rate of conversion to graphite is negligible however at temperatures above about 4500 K diamond rapidly converts to graphite rapid conversion of graphite to Diamond requires pressures well above the equilibrium line at 2000 K a pressure of 35 Giga Pascal's is needed topic other properties the acoustic and thermal properties of graphite are highly anisotropic since phonons propagate quickly along the tightly bound planes but are slower to travel from one plane to another Graphite's high thermal stability and electrical and thermal conductivity facilitate its widespread use as electrodes and refractories in high-temperature material processing applications however in oxygen containing atmospheres graphite readily oxidizes to form carbon dioxide at temperatures of 700 degrees Celsius and above graphite as an electrical conductor hence useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes it can conduct electricity due to the vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers a phenomenon called aromaticity these valence electrons are free to move so are able to conduct electricity however the electricity is primarily conducted within the plane of the layers the conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones graphite and graphite powder are valued in industrial applications for their self lubricating and dry lubricating properties there is a common belief that Graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose inter lamellar coupling between sheets in the structure however it has been shown that in a vacuum environment such as in technologies for use in space graphite degrades as a lubricant due to the hypoxic conditions this observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers such as air and water which are naturally adsorbed from the environment this hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed recent studies suggest that an effect called super lubricity can also account for Graphite's lubricating properties the use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate pitting corrosion in some stainless steel and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals due to its electrical conductivity it is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture for this reason the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft and discouraged its use in aluminium containing automatic weapons even graphite pencil marks on alum parts may facilitate corrosion another high-temperature lubricant hexagonal boron nitride has the same molecular structure as graphite it is sometimes called white graphite due to its similar properties when a large number of crystallographic defects bind these planes together graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes what is known as pyrolytic graphite it is also highly anisotropic and diamagnetic thus it will float in midair above a strong magnet if it is made in a fluidized bed at 1000 to 1300 degrees celsius then it is isotropic turbo strata and is used in blood contacting devices like mechanical heart valves and is called pyrolytic carbon and is not diamagnetic pyrolytic graphite and pyrolytic carbon are often confused but are very different materials natural and crystalline Graphite's are not often used in pure form as structural materials due to their sheer planes brittleness and inconsistent mechanical properties topic history of natural graphite use in the fourth millennium BC during the Neolithic Age in southeastern Europe the Morita culture used graphite in a ceramic paint for decorating pottery some time before 1565 some sources say as early as 1500 an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to gray mots from the hamlet of seethe wait in borrowdale parish Cumbria England which the locals found useful for marking sheep during the reign of Elizabeth the first 1558 to 1603 Borrowdale graphite was used as a refractory material to line molds for cannonballs resulting in rounder smoother balls that could be fired farther contributing to the strength of the English Navy this particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and soft and could easily be cut into sticks because of its military importance this unique mind in its production were strictly controlled by the crown during the 19th century Graphite's uses greatly expanded to include stove polish lubricants paints crucibles foundry facings and pencils a major factor in the expansion of educational tools during the first great rise of Education for the masses the British Empire controlled most of the world's production especially from salon but production from Austrian German and American deposits expanded by mid-century for example the Dixon crucible company of Jersey City New Jersey founded by Joseph Dixon inventor and partner orestes Cleveland in 1845 opened mines in the Lake Ticonderoga District of New York built a processing plant there and a factory to manufacture pencils crucibles and other products in New Jersey described in the engineering and mining journal the 21st of December 1878 the Dixon pencil is still in production the beginnings of the revolutionary froth flotation process are associated with graphite mining included in the E and M J article on the Dixon crucible company as a sketch of the floating tanks used in the age-old process of extracting graphite because graphite is so light the mix of graphite and waste was sent through a final series of water tanks where a cleaner graphite floated off which left waste to drop out in an 1877 patent the two brothers vessel Adolf in August of Dresden Germany took this floating process a step further and added a small amount of oil to the tanks and boiled the mix an agitation or frothing step to collect the graphite the first steps toward the future flotation process adolf Bessel received the waller medal for the patented process that upgraded the recovery of graphite to 90% from the German deposit in 1977 the German society of mining engineers and metallurgists organized a special symposium dedicated to their discovery and thus the 100th anniversary of flotation in the United States in 1885 Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia patented a similar process but it is uncertain if his process was used successfully in the nearby graphite deposits of Chester County Pennsylvania a major producer by the 1890s the Bessel process was limited in use primarily because of the abundant cleaner deposits found around the globe which needed not much more than hand sorting to gather the pure graphite the state of the art see a 1900 is described in the Canadian Department of Mines report on graphite mines and mining when Canadian deposits began to become important producers of graphite topic other names historically graphite was called black lead or plumbago plumbago was commonly used in its massive mineral form both of these names arise from confusion with the similar appearing lead ores particularly Galena the Latin word for lead plumbum gave its name to the English term for this gray metallic sheen mineral and even to the lead words or plumbago s' plants with flowers that resemble this color the term black lead usually refers to a powdered or processed graphite matte black in color Abraham Gottlob Werner coined the name graphite writing stone in 1789 he attempted to clear up the confusion between molybdenum plumbago and black led after Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 proved that there are at least three different minerals shields analysis showed that the chemical compounds molybdenum sulfide molybdenite led to sulfide Galena and graphite were three different soft black minerals topic uses of natural graphite natural graphite is mostly consumed for refractories batteries steelmaking expanded graphite brake linings foundry facings and lubricants graphene which occurs naturally in graphite has unique physical properties and as among the strongest substance is known however the process of separating it from graphite will require more technological development topic refractories you the use of graphite as a refractory material began before 1900 with the graphite crucible used to hold molten metal this is now a minor part of refractories in the mid-1980s the carbon-magnesite brick became important and a bit later the alumina graphite shape as of 2017 the order of importance as alumina graphite shapes carbon-magnesite brick monolithic gunning and ramming mixes and then crucibles crucibles began using very large flake graphite and carbon-magnesite brick requiring not quite so large flake graphite for these and others there is now much more flexibility in the size of flake required and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories alumina graphite shapes are used as continuous casting wear such as nozzles and troughs to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold and carbon-magnesite brick slime steel converters and electric arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical high purity monolithic SAR often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite brick s' the US and European refractories industry had a crisis in 2002-2003 with an indifferent market for steel in a declining refractory consumption per ton of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of harvests and walker refractories by RHI ag and some plants had their equipment auctioned off since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina graphite shapes and monolithic sand away from brick the major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from China almost all of the above refractories are used to make steel and account for 75% of refractory consumption the rest is used by a variety of industries such as cement according to the USGS US natural graphite consumption in refractories comprised 12,500 tonnes in 2010 topic batteries the use of graphite in batteries has increased in the last 30 years natural and synthetic graphite are used to construct electrodes in major battery technologies the lithium-ion battery utilizes roughly twice the amount of graphite as lithium carbonate the demand for batteries primarily nickel metal hydride and lithium ion batteries caused a growth in demand for graphite in the late 1980s and early 1990s a growth driven by portable electronics such as portable CD players and powered tools laptops mobile phones tablets and smartphones products have increased the demand for batteries electric vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand as an example a lithium ion battery in a fully electric Nissan Leaf contains nearly 40 kilograms of graphite topic still making natural graphite in steelmaking mostly goes into raising the carbon content in molten steel and can also be used to lubricate the dyes used to extrude hot steel carbon additives are subject to competitive pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder petroleum coke and other forms of carbon a carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level an estimate based on USGS as graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in the u.s. in 2005 topic brake linings natural amorphous and fine flake graphite are used in brake linings or brake shoes for heavier known automotive vehicles and became important with the need to substitute for asbestos this use has been important for quite some time but none as best as organic now compositions are beginning to reduce Graphite's market share a brake lining industry shakeout with some plant closures has not been beneficial nor has an indifferent automotive market according to the USGS US natural graphite consumption in brake linings with 6510 tonnes in 2005 topic foundry facings and lubricants a foundry facing mold wash as a water-based paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite painting the inside of a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures as forging dye lubricant and anti-seize agent a gear lubricant for mining machinery and to lubricate locks having low grit graphite or even better no grit graphite ultra high purity is highly desirable it can be used as a dry powder in water or oil or as colloidal graphite a permanent suspension in a liquid an estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2200 tons was used in this fashion in 2005 topic pencils the ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner it stems from graphene meaning to write or draw in ancient Greek from the sixteenth century all pencils were made with leaves of English natural graphite but modern pencil led is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay it was invented by Nicolas Jacques Conte in 1795 it is chemically unrelated to the metal lead whose ores had a similar appearance hence the continuation of the name plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing the term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th century works mostly portraits today pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite around 7% of the 1.1 million tons produced in 2011 was used to make pencils low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from China topic other uses natural graphite has found uses in zinc-carbon batteries in electric motor brushes and various specialized applications graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when used as an artistic medium railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a heat-resistant protective coating for the exposed portions of a steam locomotives boiler such as the smoke box or lower part of the firebox topic expanded graphite expanded graphite is made by immersing natural flake graphite in a bath of chromic acid then concentrated sulfuric acid which forces the crystal lattice planes apart thus expanding the graphite the expanded graphite can be used to make graphite foil or used directly as hot top compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss or as fire stops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe during a fire the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use after being made into graphite foil the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells the foil is made into heat sinks for laptop computers which keeps them cool while saving weight and is made into a foil laminate that can be used in valve packings are made into gaskets old-style packings are now a minor member of this grouping fine flake graphite in oils or greases for uses requiring heat resistance a gun estimate of current US natural graphite consumption in this end uses 7,500 tons topic intercalated graphite graphite forms intercalation compounds with some metals and small molecules in these compounds the host molecule or atom gets sandwiched between the graphite layers resulting in a type of compound with variable stoichiometry a prominent example of an intercalation compound is potassium graphite denoted by the formula k c8 some graphite intercalation compounds are superconductors the highest transition temperature by June 2009 T C equals 11.5 K has achieved intact six and it further increases under applied pressure 15.1 KH giga pascals Graphite's ability to intercalation I ins without significant damage from swelling is what makes it the dominant anode material in lithium-ion batteries equals topic uses of synthetic graphite equals equals equals topic invention of the process to produce synthetic graphite equals equals in 1893 Charles Street of LA Carbone discovered a process for making artificial graphite another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by Edward Goodrich Atchison 1856 to 1931 in the mid 1890s Acheson discovered that overheating carborundum silicon carbide or sic produced almost pure graphite while studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum he had found that silicon vaporizes at about four thousand 150 degrees Celsius seven thousand five hundred degrees Fahrenheit leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon this graphite was another major discovery for him and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant in 1896 Atchison received a patent for his method of synthesizing graphite and in 1897 started commercial production the Atchison graphite Co was formed in 1899 equals equals topic scientific research equals equals highly oriented pyrolytic graphite hopg is the highest quality synthetic form of graphite it is used in scientific research in particular as a length standard for scanner calibration of scanning probe microscope equals equals topic electrodes equals equals graphite electrodes carry the electricity that melts scrap iron and steel and sometimes direct reduced iron dry in electric arc furnaces which are the vast majority of steel furnaces they are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch they are then extruded and shaped baked to carbonize the binder pitch and finally graph'it eyes by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000 degrees Celsius at which the carbon atoms arranged into graphite they can vary in size up to 3.5 meters 11 feet long and 75 centimeters 30 in in diameter an increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces and the electric arc furnace itself is becoming more efficient making more steel per tonne of electrode an estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197 thousand tons in 2005 electrolytic aluminium smelting also uses graphitic carbon electrodes on a much smaller scale synthetic graphite electrodes are used in electrical discharge machining EDM commonly to make injection molds for plastics equals equals topic powder and scrap equals equals the powder is made by heating powdered petroleum coke above the temperature of graphitization sometimes with minor modifications the graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material in the manufacturing stage or after use and lathe turnings usually after crushing and sizing most synthetic graphite powder goes to carbon raising and steel competing with natural graphite with some used in batteries and brake linings according to the USGS u.s. synthetic graphite powder and scrap production was 95,000 tons in 2001 latest data equals equals topic Neutron moderator equals equals special grades of synthetic graphite such as gilsu carbon also find use as a matrix a neutron moderator within nuclear reactors it's low Neutron cross-section also recommends it for use in proposed fusion reactors care must be taken that reactor grade graphite is free of neutron absorbing materials such as boron widely used as the seed electrode in commercial graphite deposition systems this caused the failure of the Germans World War two graphite based nuclear reactors since they could not isolate the difficulty they were forced to use far more expensive heavy water moderators graphite used for nuclear reactors is often referred to as nuclear graphite equals equals topic other uses equals equals graphite carbon fiber and carbon nanotubes are also used in carbon fiber reinforced plastics and in heat-resistant composites such as reinforced carbon-carbon RCC commercial structures made from carbon fiber graphite composites include fishing rods golf club shafts bicycle frames sports car body panels the fuselage of the boeing 787 dreamliner and pool cue sticks and have been successfully employed in reinforced concrete the mechanical properties of carbon fiber graphite reinforced plastic composites and gray cast iron are strongly influenced by the role of graphite in these materials in this context the term 100% graphite is often loosely used to refer to a pure mixture of carbon reinforcement and resin while the term composite is used for composite materials with additional ingredients modern smokeless powder is coated in graphite to prevent the build-up of static charge graphite has been used in at least three radar absorbent materials it was mixed with rubber in some finsh Ornstein Vater which were used on u-boat snorkels to reduce their radar cross-section it was also used in titles on early f-117 Nighthawk stealth strike fighters graphite composites are used as absorber for high-energy particles eg in the LHC beam dump topic graphite mining beneficiation and milling graphite is mined by both open pit and underground methods graphite usually needs beneficiation this may be carried out by hand picking the pieces of gang rock and hand screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and marks coats the particles of gang this makes the marked gang particles float off with the graphite yielding impure concentrate there are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product repeated regrinding and floating up to seven times to purify the concentrate or by acid leaching dissolving the gang with hydrofluoric acid for a silicate gang or hydrochloric acid for a carbonate gang in milling the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified sized or screened with the coarser flake size fractions below 8 mesh 8 to 20 mesh 20 to 50 mesh carefully preserved and then the carbon contents are determined some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content if flake size is unimportant the concentrate can be ground more freely typical end products include a fine powder for use as a slurry and oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds carbon raiser in the steel industry synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser environmental impacts from graphite Mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil according to the United States Geological Survey USGS world production of natural graphite in 2016 was 1,200,000 tons of which the following major exporters are China 780,000 T India 170,000 T Brazil 80,000 T turkey 32,000 T and North Korea 30,000 T graphite is not mined in the United States but US production of synthetic graphite in 2010 was one 134,000 tea valued at one point zero seven billion dollars topic occupational safety people can be exposed to graphite in the workplace by breathing it in skin contact and eye contact topic United States the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for graphite exposure in the workplace as a time-weighted average TWA of 15 million particles per cubic foot one point five milligrams per cubic meter over an eight-hour workday the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit rel of TWA 2.5 milligrams per cubic meter respirable dust over an eight-hour workday at levels of 1,250 milligrams per cubic meter graphite is immediately dangerous to life and health topic graphite recycling the most common way of recycling graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded or the electrode or other are used all the way down to the electrode holder a new electrode replaces the old one but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains this is crushed in size and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel graphite containing refractories are sometimes also recycled but often not because of their graphite the largest volume items such as carbon-magnesite brick that contain only 15 to 25 percent graphite usually contain too little graphite however some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace repair materials and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners while crucibles have a high graphite content the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small a high-quality flake graphite product that closely resembles natural flake graphite can be made from steelmaking Kish Kish is a large volume near molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic oxygen furnace and consists of a mix of graphite precipitated out of the supersaturated iron lime rich slag and some iron the iron is recycled on-site leaving a mixture of graphite and slag the best recovery process uses hydraulic classification which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity graphite is light and settles nearly last to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95 percent graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down equals equals see also
