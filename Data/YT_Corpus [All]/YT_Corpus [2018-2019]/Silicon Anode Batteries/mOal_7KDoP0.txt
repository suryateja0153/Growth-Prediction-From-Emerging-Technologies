 All right thanks everyone. I hope everyone had a great lunch and are ready for the second half of our summit this afternoon we are preparing to start for our third panel this afternoon which is on high energy lithium-ion batteries the third panel is moderated by Katie Greenwood director of risk assessment Bureau HC Ezzor is associated with high injury high energy density batteries are common to all three jurisdictions this panel will address how risks to consumers can be reduced and what steps have already been taken by stakeholders in north america points of focus include the industry's product safety processes pre and post-market understanding and eliminating failure modes and challenges in how stake how can stakeholders and regulators work together to improve safety so our panelists this afternoon are Charlie Monahan director regulatory compliance Panasonic Don mais chief safety and quality officer from Samsung and Rick Brenner president product safety Advisors LLC good afternoon really privileged to be here this afternoon with my three distinguished panelists I have to say it's been absolutely fantastic organizing this panel with these three and listening to them on the phone their wealth experience on lithium-ion batteries I have learned a lot in the last several weeks so I'm not going to take a lot of times in opening remarks but I think their presentations are very interesting and I really want to get into them but preventing harm is sort of the core of what we do as regulators and as industry and working in the product safety area it's the core of what we do and it's the heart of why we go to work every day as a regulator we find it incredibly difficult to keep up with the changing landscape in product safety and more and more of the products we're regulating do have lithium-ion batteries in in them so it's becoming in tune with the changes in the technology and making sure that we are aware of the product hazards associated with these given the versatility of the lithium-ion batteries we've all seen the videos on YouTube of products failing rather spectacularly and sometimes less spectacularly as well these incidents come in to us as regulators and we then have to assess the risks we test the products in our labs and we work with industry to find solutions so how can we design safer products manufacturer safer batteries and protect our consumers what is the role of standards in ensuring battery safety so I'm really I'm gonna turn it over quite quickly to the first panelist Charles Monahan as you know director of regulatory compliance at Panasonic who's well-known in the industry for his knowledge and investment in battery safety and sustainability so Charlie okay good afternoon everybody I've been asked to put together a little not knowing what everybody's our background is when regard to batteries I've been asked to put together a little bit of battery 101 so please put up with me for the first few minutes a single cell is a single cell of the building block for battery packs every single cell has an anode a cathode a separator and and other components hopefully safety components single cells are put together into battery packs this here is a cordless tool pack and you'll see that there's five cells so when you see your pad or your notebook or your phone each of them inside these battery packs are made up of individual cells when you wire cells together in series you increase the voltage when you wire them together in parallel you increase the capacity and battery packs usually have cells in both series and parallel to make the voltage you need and the capacitor you need also hopefully your battery pack also has a battery management unit the battery management unit is that intelligence on the circuit board that controls overcharge over discharge counts cycles things like that it's a ways to help with the safety of the battery pack you have cylindrical batteries where it's wound material you've got prismatic where you basically take a wound cell and you flatten it into a prismatic shape and then the less when you have polymer cells and a polymer cell is not built in a round format it's built like a deck of cards you put anode cathode separator an old cathode separator and you wire them together and they can come in absolutely any shape and all of the new plot a lot of the new consumer products that are super super thin are the polymer cells any battery is no stronger than its weakest cell and no cell is stronger than its weakest component it's very important that when you build cells that the battery the cell manufacturers build out of the top rate components and also build them extremely well I'll touch of that later on everybody talks about lithium-ion there's actually six different types of lithium-ion chemistry's you've got the lithium nickel cobalt aluminum this is the one found like in the Tesla you've got a lithium cobalt oxide this is the original battery that Sony produced back in 1990 it's now like in the Apple iPhone and stuff you've got a little with iam nickel manganese cobalt oxide and then you've got iron phosphate lithium manganese oxide and then lithium titanate and again each of these have a different they're all called lithium ion batteries but they have different anode different cathode materials and and they're banned in a battery pack you can't mix them or you shouldn't mix them together from a safety point of view and one of the just a fact the 18 650 which a lot of people have heard the name of is 18 millimeters wide 65 long this particular cell comes in all six chemistry's why is the lithium ion battery different from past rechargeable batteries all of the batteries in the past the lead acid the NiCad the nickel metal hydride the three rechargeable chemistry's before lithium-ion were all aqueous base they were all water based electrolyte the lithium ion is the first rechargeable battery that is flammable these solvents inside the electrolyte is flammable on top of that the energy density both from a volumetric and weight basis is much higher than past chemistry's so again we have a lot of energy in a very small area mixed with a flammable electrolyte and that's basically you know you know in a nutshell what is differently you know lithium ion than all the other rechargeables that came before okay I have to thank Bosch this is probably the simplest picture I could find on the web for how a battery works again every battery has a cathode everybody every battery has an anode and every battery has a separator the cathodes are made of some type of lithium metal oxide and and again it varies six different ways most of the anodes or graphite carbon some type of carbon graphite some of the companies are also now mixing in small amounts of silicon but again there's problems with that it's a great material if we can get it to work but silicon swells up during the cycling and so at this point we're working out technically how to get more and more of it mixed in into the anode the separator is the material which separates the anode and the cathode separators are now down to about 20 microns in thickness give you an idea a human hair is between 17 and 180 microns so it's a very very thin material this is the material that allows ions to pass between the anode and the cathode in addition every battery has a current collectors you have a a cathode current collector which is made of copper foil and you have an an anode copper collector which is made of aluminum these current collectors are about 1.5 microns and thickness these are extremely thin in a in a first-tier high-end lithium-ion battery how do batteries work during the charge the lithium ions move from the cathode which is the positive electrode to the anode where they are stored this is where they attract an electrons because of their charge they receive the they receive these from an external power source plug it in the wall and that you know that power came from someplace wind solar cold someplace and that's how the battery is charged during discharge the electrons migrate back toward the anode from the anode to the cathode during this migration this is where we force the electrons to go through the product that is powering this is where the energy comes from during the discharge site again what the difference between primary batteries and rechargeable batteries is that the chemical process of charging and discharging can be repeated in a rechargeable battery in a primary battery it's a metal reduction reaction and once it's done it's done it can't be reversed rechargeable batteries it can be reversed again this is showing a typical cylindrical battery again it's got a cathode it's got an anode it's got a separator and has got a collection collector plate in there both on the anode and the cathode also a will build cell at least from Panasonic's point of view well build cells and you know companies like Panasonic sanyo Samsung LG etc we also put safety devices in each one of our cells we put in PTC's these are positive temperature coefficient thermistors this is a device that raises resistance in some when resistance increases due to temperature it goes up to a whatever set level that we set as a specification once the resistant gets high enough to a point it will start reducing the current when it gets to whatever size would add at whatever level we specify for that particular cell it will totally cut off the current for that cell this is a one-time device once it trips and it doesn't get reset another thing that first tier manufacturers do in every cell is we put in C IDs or current interrupted devices these are bi-metal devices that deform in such a way that will cut off current if it gets above if the gas pressure built up inside the cell from the high current gets above a certain level and again this is this this is not mandated you know when you build cells but the first tier manufacturers wouldn't put a cell into the marketplace we don't think we should without a PTC and a CID at the cell level and obviously not everybody does this thermal runaway this is what a lot of people hear here the third term thermal runaway is when the internal cell reaction generates more heat than the cell can dissipate this is just a definition from the I Triple E 16 and 1725 cells should only fail if they are either abused or poorly main poorly manufactured the fact is there's many ways to either abuse a cell or poorly manufacture or sell some examples of abuse external heating external heating can damage either the separator or the cathode overcharge can result in lithium plating inside the cell lithium plating will cause dendrites that could Pierce the separator also overcharge can result in electrolyte decomposition that would lead to gas generation over discharge again could lead the lithium plating again causing dendrite that could pierce the SEP separator that again and all of these could cause internal shorts high current charging heat generation and excess oxygen generation inside the cell any structural damage to the cell that results in something being damaged you have one even one of the safety circuits inside or just the the cell itself external short circuits external short circuits can cause heat generation these are all examples of abuse that could happen to her cell examples of poor men poor manufacturing metal contamination we're talking at the that the mice of the micron level extremely small not hardly even not even visible to the human eye metal amounts of metal so our factories and walk into one of these state-of-the-art factories people were walking around basically you've seen them like the Intel commercials and the bunny suits this is how how state-of-the-art lithium-ion factories are run these days and and not everybody in the world's factories are all like that having any type of damage to a misplaced insulation material inside the cell either at missing it or not putting in the right place or having the insulation of the wrong type or quality or just worn through during the cycling there's lots of ways that that insulation can be damaged over time any irregular application of active material any type of rip or tear or wrinkle we're talking 1.5 micron thick materials and then they have to be laid down and wrapped up perfectly plate slitting make sure when you slip your place there's no burrs or imperfections I mean there's lots of steps in the process that could go horribly wrong you know from a quality point of view because the materials you're working with a very very fine again the idea is to get as much active material as you can inside the cell pour welding wear a connector internal connector inside a battery pack could fail or even a weld inside the cell could fail this is why we do extensive testing on vibration and shock to make sure that what whatever we're building inside the cell is robust enough any of these going wrong could lead to thermal runaway and again thermal runaway as a heat buildup heat buildup leads to separator breakdown any type of separator breakdown could lead to internal short-circuiting also he buildup could lead to electrolyte breakdown that would also build up flammable internal gases any type of breakdown could also lead to any type of internal short-circuiting again anything anything that would lead somehow inside the cell the negative and the positive touching would generate a hot spot that hot spot with coarse pressure the pressure would cause he heat and the the battery would ultimately vent systems approach to safety to assure safe products what the cell manufacturers and the battery manufacturers recommend is that the throughout the life of the cell that the cell be maintained in a safe zone of voltage current and temperature its entire life while short excursions outside the cells spec range are allowed those excursions also have specifications how much it can be outside and how long they can be you know microburst outside a range is okay but again everything has to be within spec the cell the the cell is the power source the little chemical factory that contains the flammable electrolyte the next level is the battery pack the battery pack and again the cell contains safety features the battery pack is the next level the battery pack communicates with the cell and the host device the battery pack also should contain battery managing unit that again controls over charge over discharge items like this current temperature counting cycles there's lots of different things that the battery management unit should be looking at you've got the host device whatever the piece of equipment is that needs to actively communicate with the battery pack and the charger and the power supply you've got the power supply that converts ac/dc again this should be conditioning the power and also communicating with the other devices you've got the end user the end user has again all these different circles have a responsibility to help protect the cell throughout his lifetime the next one is the end user the end user has the responsibility if the if the product gives you a warning at hit Earth and the last thing all of this is sitting in an environment the obviously the environment while we we roughly know what the environment is there's limits to how hot and how cold and and what you should do to your equipment your battery pack and your cell again to assure a safe cell and ie then a save battery over its life you need a systems approach to safety everything should be working together when you buy a piece of equipment the equipment the charger the cell the battery should be sold as a unit the people who designed that should have all worked together and communicated with each other to make sure they're selling or building a safe system and all of this is aimed at protecting the cell over its life so you can't have an incident let's see the last thing I can say about batteries is you've all seen in the last few years a lot of batteries a lot a lot of batteries I read something the other day that between 2015 and 2020 the world's capacity of lithium-ion will triple I can assure you that after 2020 the forecast that we're seeing is only straight-up if you think there's a lot of batteries out there now the amount of Giga factories like the one Panasonic is building currently out in Nevada there's plans for many many of those all over the world and the number of cells and batteries are only going to increase nobody wants to give up the portability of having their laptops and their cell phones and their pets so it's up to all of us to make sure that we we get this right so we can continue to use batteries in the long run thank you that'll work Thank You charlie Thank You Katie for organizing this panel shade it it's really hard to have a robust discussion about lithium-ion battery safety without being reminded of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone recall from 2016 I'd like to discuss some of the safety assurance and process improvements we've made since that time today I'd also like to share with you my perspectives on the advantages in pitfalls of analyzing incident data real re gum related to battery safety plus the importance of ensuring the authenticity of branded lithium-ion batteries and associated accessories now while I've only been in Samsung for a few short months I know that Samsung's commitment to safety goes beyond our own products we recognize that our past challenges with lithium-ion batteries battery safety can benefit all of those in the industry if we openly share our lessons learned now you remember we may you may remember that shortly after the Galaxy Note 7 was introduced in August of 2016 we received reports of certain issues specifically overheating incidents with some of our devices we quickly initiated a recall program in cooperation with government agencies and our wireless and retail partners this recall program allowed customers to exchange their original note 7 for a device using what Samsung thought at the time to be a safe alternative battery as soon afterwards however further reports of issues led us to a second recall which included the replacement of the devices that we'd previously made available to consumers ultimately we made the decision to halt Note 7 production and sales now in response to this crisis we undertook two critical missions first get the phones back from our customers and second to get to the bottom of the problem so let's start with a recall we moved quickly to notify our consumers that they should stop using and return their devices immediately and it's fair to say that we adopted the stance of over communication we offered a variety of innovative innovative options for returns and compensation so a bounty per se to encourage customers to return their devices promptly of course we did the things that are typical of recalls you know such as point-of-sale posters and email messages and you know toll-free numbers and even a dedicated website but Samsung also had the unique advantage of being able to directly communicate with the customers because the device itself became the communication tool to reach them more than 23 million text messages and push notifications were sent to note 7 customers on the device itself alerting them of the recall program we also worked with our wireless partners to push firmware updates to limit battery capacity to make the devices less convenient to use initially we reduce battery capacity by 60% and then finally to 0% so the customers would return the returned their phones the result was 97 percent of the note seventh were retrieved globally 99% in the US a rate that experts tell us is unprecedented at least for any product that is sold in the millions of units now at the same time that we were working to retrieve as many of the devices as possible we are also working with government officials and experts from three respected independent testing and forensic laboratories to determine what caused the issue and how to prevent those issues from occurring again now our extensive root cause investigation examined every aspect of the note 7 note 7 device and took several months to complete involved 700 engineers it wasn't simple ultimately what we found were two separate issues involving lithium-ion batteries provided by two different suppliers the initial recall was prompted by incidents with device containing the first suppliers batteries the recall was expanded when incidents were identified with devices containing batteries from a second battery supplier at the investigation determined that in the case of supplier a the battery problem was one of a defective design and in the case of supplier B it was a faulty weld what Charlie had mentioned during production now together it was unforeseeable combination of circumstances now even though the two note seven battery devices met industry standards and certification requirements and we've had appropriate processes in place from a safety and quality assurance standpoint these note 7 batteries note seven phones failed in practice we realize that time that we had to innovate beyond industry standards not only in product but also in process that's why we move forward with a number of concrete actions to raise the bar for our safety and quality assurance processes we started by building a large scale test facility where we could replicate the incidents and complete a detailed analysis we then implemented a new eight point battery safety check which adds significant quality checks to each step in the manufacturing process including the component level inline production and post production tests the new process is one of enhancing testing on an increased number of samples including these steps more durability testing including overcharging tests nail puncture tests extreme temperature tests visual inspection on every battery against enhanced acceptability criteria x-ray testing for any or abnormalities charging and discharging test for 100 cycles a volatile organic compounds test to ensure there is no leaking electrolyte a disassembly test to assess overall quality and product integrity testing under foreseeable use and misuse conditions to simulate what a consumer would do and finally an open current voltage change test throughout the manufacturing process so in addition to these extensive checks on batteries we also instituted a new Quality Assurance process to cover every phase of the battery in the end the device development now these multi-layer safety measures are intended to help identify and address any potential safety vulnerabilities they extend beyond current in current industry standards and also beyond the root cause we identified with a note 7 to address potential future safety risks now some examples of the measures and how we apply are to that we apply to our new products as number 1 is improved safety standards for the materials in the design of the battery in the device hardware new requirements including structural elements to further protect the device for example if it's dropped and in device software improved algorithms that control battery charging temperature current and duration the same sort of safeguards that Charlie was mentioning we believe we've left no stone unturned from our investigation to our blueprint for an industry-leading safety and quality assurance process that goes beyond current industry standards in order to avoid a recurrence of a note 7 type situation unlikely as it may be now in addition to process improvements I just mentioned we've also enhanced our data analytics capabilities to quickly detect emerging safety and quality defects advanced or big data analytics can provide early warning signals that companies didn't get it on top of problems quickly before they become a crisis advanced analytics pull structured data from internal sources such as customer service or warranty databases and marries it with external unstructured data sources such as social media postings or e-commerce customer reviews using tools for web scraping and voice to text translation and displaying analyzed information on a visual dashboard one can easily spot emerging issues analyzing historical data can indicate quality creep that might otherwise get unnoticed by let's say someone who traditionally relies on spreadsheets to analyze their data but advanced analytics is not necessarily the panacea for identifying lithium-ion battery safety problems social media is often full of exaggerated or fraudulent safety claims the same goes for customer reviews on ecommerce sites which are sometimes written by paid reviewers who don't actually purchase the products they review we've seen cases where unscrupulous consumers placed mobile phones in a microwave oven and then claimed a safety defect news media sometimes reports these incidents without knowing all the facts now my point here is that information citing safety defects should be very verified before action is taken speaking about fraudulent claims we've also seen a rise in fraudulent testing we all know about the dieselgate scandal vehicle emission scandal and you may have heard about the Japanese steel and aluminum suppliers who falsified test data on the quality of their materials auditing testing operations is an often forgotten and neglected part of the internal audit process yet when testing is so important to ensure the safety of lithium-ion batteries it's important to make sure that tests is valid it's not only a matter of verifying the data itself but also ensuring that the testing has been done by a qualified laboratory using trained staff that follow appropriate test protocols with calibrated test equipment there's a lot to consider and worry about another instance of which product safety can be jeopardized is during the repair service unauthorized repair centers may not be using OEM parts replacement batteries in particular can be substandard and unsafe they may not fit exactly or be compatible with a product in which they're they're being installed the same goes for accessories such as chargers and cables now that's why we strongly recommend that battery replacement service be conducted by authorized repair shops by technicians that have the training the tools and the diagnostic capabilities to get it right and make sure it's safe counterfeiting is also a concern the global counterfeit market is projected to reach one point nine trillion dollars four years from now ecommerce provides the perfect venue for distributing counterfeit products such as lithium-ion batteries now there are various levels of counterfeiting there are trade dress infringement involving making the product we look with the same colors the same fonts packaging but perhaps with a slightly different name and an attempt to fool the consumer knock offs go one step further they try to make the product look virtually identical to the real McCoy sometimes counterfeit products are made at the same factory as the genuine product but might use substandard components or materials or weak quality use weak Quality Assurance standards I call this backroom manufacturing in addition to counterfeit products there are also counterfeit safety certifications ul has a special group just dedicated to stop unauthorized use of their ul listed market now today it's important for companies to develop strategies anti counterfeiting strategies to protect their brand supply chain security is the first step traceability with blockchain technology can help detect and prevent diversions there are also ways of placing unique markers on products and its packaging such as electronic inks or crystal taggants to make it easy to determine authenticity web scraping analytics can be used to detect the sale of counterfeit products on e-commerce one of the most effective methods to battle counterfeit products is by prepared by partnering with government agencies we work with customs Border Patrol to identify counter products that are trying to enter our stream of Commerce it's a constant battle but one that's important for safety assurance now with the right safety and quality assurance processes the market police and marketplace safeguards we think that high-powered lithium-ion batteries will continue to revolutionize the consumer products market in North North American marketplace thank you thanks Don and Charles now we've had what lithium-ion batteries are how they're made the Samsung experience and how to do the root cause analysis and the changes they made and the fraudulent and counterfeit concerns and now we'll hear from Rick Brenner who takes us as an importer and the things that he has to look for when purchasing products with lithium-ion batteries Thank You Katie and thanks to CPSC for the invitation and the opportunity to speak to all of you my experience comes from 20 years as an importer I headed a large consumer products company in the promotional products industry and have spent hundreds of hours in factories overseas overseeing quality and compliance as product safety and compliance was one of my responsibilities you could subtitle my presentation today my often frustrating search for a bright line particularly related to lithium-ion what could I do as an importer that would guarantee to the greatest possibility that the product would be safe it's an honor for me to be on this panel with Samsung and Panasonic who I'm happy to say are not part of the problem that I'm going to talk to you about they were the standard that we were trying to find a way to achieve one disclaimer that my comments are mine alone I learned this from watching lots of CPSC presentations they do not represent the views of any organization of which I have had a leadership role so I want to talk about the challenges faced by anybody who's importing products in particularly lithium ion products why it's difficult and make some suggestions of what could be done to make things better the short version is we need stricter regulations and greater enforcement that's the bottom line that I'm going to be advocating today so for an importer a lot of our work starts at this show last week about 4,000 exhibitors exhibited in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong gifts and premium fare and tens of thousands of exhibitors many from the US retailers distributors suppliers of all kinds that are searching for the newest and latest the one key thing that you should know related to lithium ion is that an enormous percentage of the products that were displayed at this show are powered by lithium ion the number of experts in lithium ion at this show is de minimis the number of lithium ion experts were attendees at the show looking at these products is de minimis and therein lies the problem Thank You charlie for your power for your battery this is what I call a mobile power bank if you are running out of charge and you're at a baseball game and you you need to charge your phone you can take one of these devices and plug your phone in and get a charge they have become ubiquitous they certainly are ubiquitous in the promotional products industry you can see here that some particular law firm is giving these away promotional products by the way are generally given away for free companies buy them to give the give away as a promotion but you would find these same same products at retail as well whether you go into a bookstore whether you go online to any of the familiar ecommerce sites you'll find the same the same products they're ubiquitous everywhere this was my introduction to lithium ion safety customer called up and said one of the people that we gave these away to just called us and said that they put the thing down on their kitchen counter heard it whistling turned around and fire was spewing out of one end of it as a matter of fact you can see this particular product had never even been plugged in and it burned up pretty quickly so you know the challenge is obvious that that maybe if nobody had been home maybe the house would have burned down maybe a kid could have been killed maybe the whole family could have been killed so the question then that I had as the CEO and chief Safety Officer the company is why did this secure why did this occur and what steps should we take in sourcing this product to prevent this this happened right in the beginning where we started handling these products because there was a point in time probably was around 2011 when at that Hong show everybody was showing these these power banks and they became extremely popular so this was my first step I gathered my entire supply sourcing team along with the company that we had bought the product from which was a trading company along with the factory where the trading company had bought that but the product from and went to you l's facility in Guangzhou I believe now of the people in this photograph but two guys with the lanyards around their their neck are from ul they're the only two guys in the whole picture that have expertise in lithium-ion and even the guy who's standing next to the guy with the with with the with the with lanyard on he's the owner of the factory where this came from he's not an expert either he bought components from somebody else he's an expert at assembling products and that's another important thing to know is a lot of the companies that are making these products are simply assembling them and as Charlie said to me while we were talking after lunch they might have been assembling something very different the week before it's probably a little bit cynical but not terribly so so this is what this product looks like on the inside it's exactly what Charlie was talking about when he showed you the the 18 650 cell that pink part on on the right side of this photograph that looks like a triple-a battery but it's not a triple-a battery it's a lithium-ion cell the other important element of this photograph is that little circuit board there that's actually two circuit boards plugged in together and that it is referred to amongst manufacturers of these products as the battery management system and so I'm gonna talk a lot about that manner battery management system the other thing that you should notice is that that battery management system those circuit boards are connected connected to the cell by wires that's all done by hand another significant things when you go into these two these factories and I thought it was significant when Charlie was talking about the welds and the problem with the welds these this is all this is all done by by handwork so let's talk about the components of a lithium-ion power bank this one pictured here is similar to the one that I just showed you only this one has two cells it also has a battery management system so the the cell could be an 18 650 cell that's the one that looks like the double A or triple a battery or it could be a prismatic one which is the one that Charlie was talking about that gets pressed flat typically used in products that either need larger capacity or because of the shape it needs to have a different shape but it's basically the same thing so it's got the circuitry the battery battery management system and that's a very very critical element because there are a number of functions that battery management system serves as a second level of protection the first level of protection is the cell that Samsung or Panasonic manufactures and Charlie described into a detail the protections that are built into those cells but if that fails the battery management system is supposed to take effect and it's particularly takes effect in the use of the product that is once somebody plugs it in because if you look back at this photograph here if you look closely at that at that circuit board you'll see there's two ports there one port is the USB that you plug into to plug your phone in and the other one is what you plug your charger in to charge the item so the that that battery management system among other things is against plugging in into the wrong charger for example or overcharging or wrong voltage so you've got a housing you've got wire you got insulating materials those are the various components so each one of those is a critical aspect of what could go wrong so here is here the consideration cell selection Charlie talked about Tier one manufacturers that's a very important consideration in selecting cells there is a lot of controversy as to whether there's a significant difference in the cells that certainly beyond my expertise to know all I know is that the first tier manufacturers you have the assurance of knowing that there's a very strict quality control program in place so one of the things when when I was in China was trying to ensure that Samsung batteries notwithstanding the note seven difficulty that Samsung cells were used in our products that alone was a challenge because unless you're buying a million dollars a week you can't buy from Samsung so then you have to buy from a distributor so I took that same group of people to the distributor to say how can we how can you show my inspector here who's going to inspect every single ship and how can you show him how he can detect a counterfeit battery because if if a power bank manufacturer can get an extra 50 or 50 cents or more for a battery because it says Samsung on it there's a significant incentive for him to put a pink wrapper around it and print Samsung on it how could we tell if that was a if that was a counterfeit the circuit board design that is a black box because most of the people that assemble these do not design the circuit boards so to be assert assert of the design of the circuit board you really have to send it to somebody like ul or I'm independent consultant that can do an evaluation one of the reasons that I am such a proponent of certification is that ul certification in a case of the two O five six which is their new standard for power banks not only includes a certification of the cell which most cells are certified to UL 1642 I believe the the to get the full two oh five six the actual battery management system not only does that have to be certified but all the components itself have to be certified so that's why it's so important for me as an importer because at least it's a third party looking over somebody's shoulder saying yes you do have a quality product other considerations levels of protection the component selection on the board and as I said third-party evaluation so testing and certification is a very challenging thing to those of us who are not electrical engineers there's lots of numbers lots of standards organizations and lots of considerations the most important one I want to talk to you about is at one in the upper left hand corner because it's the only one that is required and unfortunately in many cases it's the only one that's done and that's that UN 38.3 it's a transportation standard it's required or you can't ship the product but it's primarily focused on mechanical aspects not electrical so while it's heavily oriented to drop tests and other mechanical tests of hazards that might occur during shipment it doesn't protect it doesn't test anything about using the product in a real life so I raise the question should a transportation standard drive lithium ion safety testing strategy there are many companies mine included the one that I ran that did far more than this but there are many as I'm going to show you that don't do more than this and it's why I advocate a stricter standard this is a experience I had as a consumer and it just gives you an example of what the challenges are the battery on the left side is a nikon battery for a camera that they have and it's about a hundred and eighty-five dollars a cameras retailer is not allowed to discount the camera so the camera retailer says but will give you an extra battery when you when you buy the product so the extra battery they gave is the one that was pictured on the right side and as you notice maybe you can't the nikon battery is ul certified and it lists the certification number on the battery the generic battery has no such certification so this particular retailer that I bought this from has a website where you can enter comments so I went online buy this product and I said I'm not certain what the safety testing of this battery is but you probably should ask those questions before you buy this okay the retailer refused to post that comment and so I got into a rather protracted discussion with their corporate communications I'm not talking about a small store I'm talking about a billion-dollar retailer they refused to post my comment after three weeks they finally produced a letter for me from the generic manufacturer saying it was tested to un 38.3 here are some other challenges that you have these are both solicitations that I received lowest pricing ul certified battery so now you get into an issue that is confusing because the cell you go back to the picture of the cell the cells might be ul certified as I said to you all 1642 but that doesn't mean that the entire battery pack including the battery management system is certified and that's what's really important yes of course it's important to have the cells certified but these imply these are these are ads for battery packs and by the way the same exact situation is the case with 38.3 not only does the cell need to be certified to un 38.3 but the assembled power bank has to be has to be certified and that's a significant issue where many times the documentation that's produced for a power bank to 38.3 is really what came from the cell manufacturer not a separate test by the manufacturer and this was maybe the most disappointing situation of all to me by the way I have particularly I have purposely not included the names of the companies involved here because I don't think that's really important I think what's really important is that these issues exist I suspect the companies involved that I've that I'm giving examples of are not the only ones but as you can imagine having a power bank that exploded as as the one that I showed you finding reliable solutions of the critical element so when one of my supply chain people told me that they found a factory that is making power banks from one of the most recognizable battery companies in the world a name that they're there's not an individual in the US over 15 years of age who doesn't know this name as a household name so when I heard this I was ecstatic I thought we hit the mother lode and I went to the factory and we negotiated an exclusive arrangement to distribute these power banks then I started with the due diligence show me the documentation show me the documentation and we kept hearing well the the company in the US the the company that I'm not going to tell you their name did the testing and we're just waiting to get it from them long story short because because our time is limited there was no testing absolutely no testing there was 38.3 and in fact of one of the power banks the 38.3 test that was shown to me was the 38.3 of a cell that was a chinese cell it wasn't it wasn't a Samsung or a Panasonic or an LG it was it was from from some other company and it was the 38.3 the even the battery power bank from this brand name yet yet the power bank bore the name of the well-known company with no other qualifier and I was livid about this so I wrote to the CEO of the fortune 50 company in the US that name it was on it and I was surprised that I actually got an email back in ten minutes saying that I'm going to refer this to our people and they'll get back to you and that's this email that you're looking at here and basically this email said that the CEO contacted me thank you for bringing this to our attention this is a licensed product licensees test their own we don't have anything to do with it we trust they'll do the right thing you have any issues you can talk to our global head of licensing that was the answer it was pretty shocking my last example is to talk about the pressures that retailers have and importers have for price and how when people are overzealous in wanting to make a sale how safety can go out the window I could show you a hundred of these this particular one is significant because it was in an RFP from a major league baseball team that wanted to give away 30 power thirty thousand power banks at the stadium and sent out an RFP to distributors giving detailed specifications for what they were looking for there are no safety specifications so don't squint trying to find them but what is significant is that the maximum budget was $3 now $3 end-user price would mean that we would have to buy that product as the importer for about a buck and a half to sell it to the distributor who would then sell it to the to the team so we not only refuse to participate but I begged the distributor not to participate as well and he walked away but this goes on all the time just because I said no somebody else is going to say yes and these can be had but there isn't going to be any safety testing so what can we do about that so the first thing I want to do is congratulate CPSC for the initiative this is a available on CPSC's web site Doug Lee put this together thank you Doug fantastic work this is this is all part of CPSC's wonderful initiative on lithium-ion batteries and the four steps that CPSC outlined improving standards outreach to education collaborate with external partners that is that's fantastic but at the end of the day what we really need is a holistic standard that requires anybody importing or selling these products to have tested the entire thing because the battery management system is such a critical part and there's no there's no requirement for anybody to do that I threw out maybe use the 15j rule and others have told me now it can't really you can't really use a 15j rule because it's got to be an observable characteristic and maybe that ul certification mark on the nikon battery isn't enough it's over my head and beyond my paygrade to know whether that's true or not I know that we need to have a standard that you can't bring about a power bank or a battery pack into this country unless the entire system is tested so thank you I appreciate it and acknowledgments 2ul and energy assurance for their technical assistance thanks Rick thanks to all my panelists Rick Donn and Charlie those are three fascinating presentations sort of starting at the beginning of the manufacturer of the cell and working all the way through the process to the importers and distributors I know we are running out of time but I'm hoping we can squeeze in time for a question or two yep if anybody has questions this questions for Rick you mentioned on you and 38.3 that there was no electronic or electrical testing involved my recollection on you and 38.3 is there's actually three tests the overcharge test t 7 the force discharged test t 8 and the external short T 5 are you could you clarify what you were referring to then in in your comment yeah my understanding and I would defer to to Charlie on this because he knows way way more about this than I do but my understanding is that it doesn't test the entire system in use it doesn't test the the system when you plug in a charger yes it's heavily oriented to meant to mechanical it does have some electrical but it doesn't test the entire system Charlie can you these are truly and they were developed as transportation tests and the tests that you mentioned do are are the correct ones you mentioned and there's there's t1 through th but again they truly are limited for transportation and and they serve a purpose for that that they're definitely not the only test you should be doing on cells and batteries Oh seeing nobody else that'll and the panel three thanks very much all right so we are ready for our final panel today our fourth panel which is our stakeholders perspectives panel this panel will be moderated by Richard O'Brien who is the director of the Office of International Programs here at CPSC so regulatory cooperation should be relevant and responsive to real world challenges a stakeholders panel will provide prospective IDE perspectives on new trends products and hazards and what can be done within the North America cooperation framework points that they're going to focus on this afternoon include cooperation and best practices policy alignment is to end consumer messaging our panelists for this panel are Augustine at ma independent consultant formerly with perfecto Linda may acceso president and partner with the law firm Denton's US LLP carol Pollak nelson PhD and independent safety consultant and jean rider a principal at exponent product safety consulting good afternoon everyone we are we are the caboose on this train we will try to make it interesting for you and I thank Rick for saying what I should already say which is none of the opinions that I express necessarily reflect those of the Commission and I'm going to just go into the question that you're undoubtedly asking and that is why are we having this panel here what's the point of it we're we have specifically planned a panel to take into account the thoughts and views of a diverse group of stakeholders and there must be some reason behind it so first of all maybe the most obvious all three countries in this partnership are democracies and in democracies we believe that people should have a voice and we try to build in a way to listen to the voices of the stakeholders second reason is failure to do that kind of puts governments in an echo chamber where we're just talking back and forth to each other and that's not necessarily the most creative way to solve problems and the third is I'm going to apply a little bit of conditional logic here the third reason is if governments had all the answers there would be no private sector and since there is a private sector it follows therefore that government doesn't have all the answers so those are three reasons for having this panel this afternoon and I would just ask our panelists as they talk to us to do one thing I mean to really be sure that you do the following please be really clear during your presentations when you're making a point that you think the three regulators the three agencies really need to take away today from all of the other things that you say which are undoubtedly very useful but make sure that we get the takeaways from you okay now I think we're going to start with Augustine and do you need access to the computer here okay so we will begin thank you try to do all the presentation in English those two practices if if not will be prepared without telephones so well I thank the CPSC for the invitation today it's my four summit and different seats but it's good news not only for me because I'm here I'm very glad to be here in DC but to hear of the the summit continues it's at least eight years in the first summit and maybe two years prior to this first for me to plan the the first summit so it's a long time and that shows at least many goals have been achieved so not only goals as Richards talking to us for for the government also to the other stakeholders that's the reason I was interesting in coming here because I think it's very good thing that three agencies continue working together at it has been done their last year's because achievements have been important so so I'll I'll start my presentation with it's not the first slide it's the name of the presentation but it's also in statement we are all consumers and is no one can deny that maybe you can go to the meeting either with the authorities or in a voluntary standard and if we all go to the final to defend our product it won't take us to to any place we have to go as consumers because having in mind and in the room in the other room it can be an standard for for toys and you have small children and you like to have a standard that protects your children for for any danger they can get from the product having that in mind I start by numbering the stakeholders that most of the voluntary or or regulations have on their tables first of all of our manufacturers the importers the wholesalers of any size in Mexico is very common we invite the Academy I'll try to go through that why do do we do that also the consumers NGOs individual groups as profit Co as something no well it's not do not make the regulations it's usually used the seat of consumer representation also in the developing standards in in Mexico so it it's not included in in that groups but is generally the seat they did for the consumers is used by the profit the government in Mexican case is the secretary of economy and other people that are interested in in the making of the standard or any are interested in the in the product either this code in discussion with authorities or in the standardization process is is how I see each group could be a participating when when you have to give ideas of how to make the the prote safer for the consumers manufacturers I have had some examples of the importance of the participation of the manufacturers in the the standard development or in the discussions with the authority but after the panel with previous panel with lithium batteries it comes even more important when Samsung was talking about the problem with the with the tablet he talks also he invited 700 engineers to try to solve the problem if we have a problem with a product at any point we don't have manufacturers in the country it could be very difficult to solve it in that country because they are the experts in the product and they are the only ones that can give the best ideas on how to solve the problem unsafety I have been in several countries in Central American South America they don't have manufacturers of almost any product and I have been in meetings where they are discussing the standard but I don't know how they discuss the standard without manufacturers I cannot imagine mainly they invite importers most of the importers are are represented by law firms I did know very well the loss but not the product so manufacturers we are here in the North America summits where I think we are privileged to have manufacturers in both in the three countries and and it's when we go to either to make a standard or to the discussion with the authorities we can invite the experts so so we have to work with that and the manufacturers have to be open consumer to give everything the hick the manufacturer can some of the items I think we can expect for the manufacturer the incident data consumer feedback flowers affected in quality control maybe they detect the problem and solve it inside the manufacturer facility but sometimes to give away that information would be very very useful for authorities because some other manufacturers smaller manufacturers or importers could detect the the failure even before it goes out to the to the market so that information I consider it's very important to give to the groups of this caution and could solve problems even before the cure that is a purpose for any any standard or any decision made by the authorities how to eliminate if they find out the product has been it's in the market and has a problem how they can correct it there are proposals to correct them that will be easier for the consumer also would be and are very necessary when when the risk is detected they also know perfectly well how to use the equipment so they can train not only their people a problem we have seen a place in Mexico and I am be much more convinced that is very important to take if they did the previous panel that talk about the case of lithium batteries and there were only two experts in ul in the whole ul to test the batteries when you we have any of the authorities can't publish standard Andrea created the laboratory's which Esper is the one in charge to operate it that expert so sometimes the accreditation goes through and gets to a laboratory with expert that are not really experts in the field at least for for a product as big as Newton batteries are there were only two people really really prepared to test instance if Mexico or Canada the UL standard which which one will be training the experts in the country that's a very technical issue but that it's a very very big issue in at least in in Mexico it that's enough for manufacturers importers well I said they can I cannot have experts but even though they can recall some expert from the manufacturer failure or in they do participate or they can participate through distance through the internet so we can encourage importers I think to to participate on that way they have incident at that consumer complaints probe traceability it's also very important because maybe the product is not the problem but the the in seems to manufacturer they the plot will be very important to know where it comes from maybe it's very used in CPC to make that travel 'ti but for other countries is not so common to to get to that point of knowing the the trance ability of products put the last item is ingenious my free report I was asked by the CPC what I was talking about it not ingenious in the in the nice sense is ingenious in the bad sense and Mexico have seen many reporters or even the manufacturers on other countries to sell product if you back you can buy a container but maybe have the contrary near complies with the standard and the other part does not comply with the standard the reason is they can reduce the cost by by doing that and when they show us in the in the table for for certification bodies this kind of knowledge the manufacturers have it's it's a big problem because we have standard we have testings but when this importers with the knowledge or without their knowledge they import that kind of product I I think they would be a very important data to show the authorities or the standardization bodies about this ingenious companies so so many as some other manufacturers can't importers can stop buying from from them marketers or traders I think is the same thing the incidence data consumer complaints Proctor's ability process for repairing the recall sales data and consumer feedback so there are common things between them the Academy well the camera me they have not only 700 engineers they have thousands of engineers that can go to the standardization process with authorities and help also a lot to develop a standard they don't own doesn't charge anything for doing that so that's also a very good notice they know very well their laboratory equipment and something very complicated in the standards or when the natori if has a decision to make is the the mat in math mathematical models and they're very very good in that they have helped mexico to develop voluntary or regulations a lot with that without help that's why and and i haven't seen the academy in ASTM standards or rise over UL standard so maybe would be interesting to consider an estate holder also the they academy also consumers associations particulars or or even trophic a site that they have also very good information about the the product they have technical experts each of these as was as an important issue Canada the United States and Mexico are the only consumer agencies at Casa laboratory in all the Americas there are no other laboratories from here to from Mexico to Tierra del Fuego Argentina so it's very important to have the experts of the laboratory working with the stakeholders with the standardization as people or their authorities well as I said only it's very important to to the participation of the stakeholders of the laboratories the certification body and standardization bodies because they they are they wanna use the standards there there are the ones that make give you a certificate to import it or to export the product so it would be very important and I haven't Carroll of a lot of this participating stakeholder and it's very important to for them to participate the Consumer Protection Agency has also a lot of information that they could be in use in developing new standards are or the discussions for for risk management the importance of cooperation what we're looking for is similar level of protection for all consumers and it could be also a benefit for the for the all the other stakeholders principally for manufacturers and and importers we have laboratories well the institution has laboratory and similar proposals also have been made today and they can achieve a lot of more things if we get them the information Richard told us to take out something we like to take out from the from the from the agencies it's it's it's difficult to do that but principally I'll try to think of working together in the development of the standards that we are the agency ours are not doing that for for Mexico's if it is difficult but because they have the experts but they don't have the language for for many terms in discussions and a ASTM or ul know so that that would be a very good effort towards together in the standards develop okay thank you very much otters team and Belinda is I think gonna speak next and I should just mention it's interesting that each one of our panelists either has a recent change of job or concurrently does different jobs either way there's a ton of experience up here and it's really beneficial so thank you before we talk about which which job I'm going to talk from first would be useful to know how to advance the slides there we go look I didn't even have to advance the slides Wow perfect okay so thanks again and thank you very much to CPSC Health Canada and perfetto for the invitation to speak today if you were not here this morning then you didn't hear me say that I am here on behalf of two different stakeholder groups today very much on purpose the first I guess you could just say is industry I'm a partner at Denton's us LLP we're a law firm based around the world the the second group that I'm here representing today it is my honor to to be here with you as president of ik faso we are celebrating our 25th year this year again if you were not here this morning then you also didn't hear me introduce my my partner in this in this endeavor I'd like everybody to acknowledge and recognize mark chom who's in the back of the room and he's waving reluctantly yep he's known in these parts anyway but it's very important for us to talk a little bit about the perspectives and and and whether or not those perspectives align in ways that we don't already may not be conscious of but that they're already aligned so with that we'll move on to the stakeholders that are either here today or are represented here today by proxy or otherwise and so if we look at the stakeholder cloud I'm looking at you and the audience and I'm seeing you struggle I'm seeing you worry and that's because that that's indicative of our challenge it's indicative of our challenge to first and foremost recognize the multitude of voices that must come together in order to benefit everyone on the supply chain and so that we can talk as stakeholders on how we might serve you the put the three principal agencies that have invited us to be here today to assist you in your challenge so these are a lot lots of points of view and and frankly I was telling rich at the break maybe I should just go straight to BWI because a lot of the things I was going to say today have already been touched on he threatened me and said no you'll go ahead and speak actually he didn't say it quite like that but what what I thought would be the most powerful is to highlight the two takeaways from each of our principal speakers this morning that I was moved by because it shows the thought alignment between the heads of these agencies and in my opinion industry what industry believes once and is interested in as well as the beloved it for so model that we'll talk more about so first from acting chairman Buerkle what we see in the North American summit and the resulting work that has been done since 2011 and in particular this week is a stronger more efficient and transparency that has never existed before among the three agencies this is information that my industry colleagues want to know and need to know next from federal attorney Sarah de science is the key and is the foundation to a globalized world and finding areas for unification he also shared with us that it the attitudes visions and paradigms of the three agencies have changed so from an industry standpoint you can't not care about what is happening in unification and indeed once the process matures to fruition we will find such efficiency whether that becomes reporting whether that becomes compliance whether it multiple types of reverse logistics borders the fact is is the more the agencies are aligned and transparent the better off all will be even if some people go kicking and screaming but that's for a different topic we also had director Ian Nero point out maybe the most salient feature of all and that is technology has delivered for us a borderless society so even though our nation-states necessarily have limitations no one's saying they don't Jeff Barrett did a great job earlier today explaining that the fact is the consumers also pointed out by federal attorney Sarah de consumers are going to have the last say in any event it's the consumers in this word cloud that are the most important of all and it goes way beyond just making sure we keep one baby safer it goes clearly to the point of making sure that industry stakeholders understand ways they can improve their goodwill ways that they can increase their own loyalty with their customers in other words it's extremely cyclical it's very logical you'll also note that I don't have this is tricky in case anybody's trying to catch me but this is fun it was so in the bottom right hand corner of your screen is not included in the stakeholder grouping and it's not for the purpose of exclusion on the contrary it's because speaking now with my xso hat on episode seeks to facilitate as its mission more than ever before a platform as a neutral as a neutral that facilitates the conversation for each of the stakeholders that you see in the stakeholder cloud so next let's move on to stakeholder alignment I do better with visual I just do better I've seen a lot of the mathematical calculations and about as far as I go with true mathematics really is Venn diagrams so I'm a big fan of Bend diagrams that that I understand so the resulting and resoundingly successful progress from this summit already reflects huge strides and alignment but I think unless we realize the two bookends on either side of products are absolutely the the takeaways that the three agencies can focus on heavily innovation on the left side and collaboration on the right side serving as the bookends for the products we often talk about consumer product safety frankly the products are merely a symptom the safer the product that means the better the innovation and collaboration pieces are working how well the products are doing is a symptom of how the other features are operating and so I believe strongly and I think I might be mixing up my hats the industry hat and the episode happened that's okay late in the day I believe that products are a symptom of unified safety unified safety that's the larger encompassing circle in the Venn diagram so unified safety takes into account innovation we are indeed in the exponential age there is one thing and one thing only that we can count on and that is that the speed of change will continue to increase that is the only certainty we can all take to the bank recognizing that a group very informal a group of folks around the world decided that it might not be a bad idea to think about an innovative products process standard because we thought that somehow or other that might actually help the three agencies in their work down the line because trying to keep up with the regulatory constraints and oftentimes handcuffs with which you must work whether that be budgets whether that be timing whether that be self reporting structures doesn't really matter we got the idea that maybe just maybe there was a way to advance safety by creating an innovative products process standard so now we're for sure switching to the episode out right now advanced the idea with my friend Jean writer who will speak next or after Carol on this topic I also picked the brains of guys like George borlase Jeff Barrett and multiple people around the world to see how they might feel about exploring this and so as a result we're gonna have a task force an independent task force meeting at the Seattle Echo so on Monday afternoon and we're not sure where it will go from there but what we do know is that we are committed to finding a way to serve everybody in the stakeholder cloud that was in my first slide and then finally to wrap it up rich said that's shareholder or sorry shareholder stakeholder takeaways were important and this is like probably the scariest part of my day I'm gonna fly home to San Francisco tonight and I'm probably gonna obsess for the next six hours whether or not this was a smart move or not but anyway here goes normally I share the contents of this slide with industry in an effort to help industry stakeholders shift their paradigms about working with agencies today though I am offering my my own personal little long-standing rules of the road in an in in efforts that hopefully and share them with you as agencies and stakeholders and with the hard work you're doing it maybe just maybe some of the things that I share with industry will help you and so the first one is it's always about the science it just always is whether its financial science or economic science or human factors science engineering science and maybe I should have put in their governmental science it is always about the science and if anybody ever says to the contrary that's just not accurate number two the US fast track model Wow Wow wouldn't it be amazing if we had a fast-track model that that we could come to all three of you and do a fast track recall with all three of you with one portal I realized that like I said I will obsess the whole ride to San Francisco whether or not this was this really stupid thing to say and I'll never be invited back again but I just Richard asked me to please just say what I felt so I'm doing it that would be amazing industry remains daunted by the challenge of different timing different compliance staff frankly different outcomes different remedies different requirements for reverse logistics and if there if we could if there were a way to apply just conceptually a fast-track model for all three I think that that that would take us a long ways toward unified safety my next point is that there's always a solution anybody who works with me knows that that that an unqualified no is not the way to proceed with me ever gonna need a reason and what do I mean by that I mean in order for us to be thoughtful if we accept that that just because we don't know a solution today there isn't one how do we put a man on the moon in other words there's always a solution so the rule that I follow is if I'm stuck i reaiiy go leave it leave it and come back and read it again cold the next morning in that regard the application to this day and to you is that you know to make the plan for the very next summit probably already is on the calendar but the fact that you've already achieved such amazing strides from my perspective means that manat fully solved today it will be on the fourth point is the ik faso model i'm obviously a little biased but i feel like the fact that that that we are in an inclusive and non polarized conversation today is the very essence of the episode model and you you know some this is a little trite i feel like i might be a little bit bumper stickers on this one but you know Madani we're not smiling right if we're screaming we're not talking we're not having a conversation so if we're in the conversation our chances for getting to that solution increase exponentially and then finally i can't even believe I'm putting this on a slide in front of the people that I normally say I'm talking about you it's Belinda's triple a rule the last thing you want to do manufacturer importer client is have the agency surprised so if we shift our paradigm to how can we take a look at section 15 be in a new way that's the u.s. section 14 in Canada and it for me for proof echo it winds up being a phone call to the people I know it perfec oh but if if if we can make sure that we're approaching the self-reporting nature of our structure with with with the the triple a rule and that is avoiding surprise we will avoid things that that if I were talking to my industry clients will avoid things like civil penalties here the the and I don't want to come off pejorative or or in any way critical but the more you all are synergized amongst each other and nobody finds themselves surprised about a direction that that one of the agencies is taking then it may not may not have value at all but I do know that it works in industry and and so I that that's it for me I want to thank you again I also can't help myself in inviting you to Seattle for episodes next regional meeting that's June 19th and then Brussels November 12th and 13th and our annual meeting is back in the District of Columbia next February so hope to see you again very soon thank you very much Belinda and thank you for speaking freely you're among friends here you can do that Carol speak freely okay first I just want to say thanks for including me in today's proceedings the US Canada and Mexico are to be lauded for coming together to work together on product safety this is undoubtedly going to benefit consumers in all three countries I'm a human factor psychologist and I specialize in consumer product safety and I realize that a lot of people don't know what human factors is it's an odd discipline so I'm just going to take a second to tell you about it if you don't mind human factors is a discipline that seeks to understand and enhance the interaction between people and the things that they use and the spaces that they use them in so within that definition I'm very focused just on consumer product safety so I look at the interaction between consumers and the products that they use when I'm looking into a product the key question that I'm asking myself is how is the consumer going to use the product and that includes forseeable who are the forseeable users including sometimes unintended users sometimes we have adult products that children are using another question I ask is what are the uses that we can anticipate with the product and this includes unintended uses sometimes called alternative uses or misuse and in cases where there is misuse I wanted there we go okay I want to know I'm sorry I'm pressing too hard I guess okay I'll just talk I want to know what are the reasons for the misuse and how reasonable is that misuse we have to answer the question about the reasonableness of the misuse because ultimately I want to decide what's the recommendation is it that we need to change the product change the instructions change something else maybe not change anything so we've got to understand all these factors about the the use of the product so as you saw from my next slide I will be talking a bit about voluntary standards but before I do I just want to say since we're talking about stakeholders I represent a lot of different stakeholder groups I guess sometimes I really work with all stakeholders so sometimes I am working with consumers I work with consumers when I petition the CPSC I've petitioned on a number of different products that I was concerned about everything from window coverings with the cords that can cause strangulation to gas fireplaces with the excessively hot glass fronts bunk beds even bunk beds which have had mandatory and voluntary standards for decades one of the key elements of that standard was that there were not allowed to be spaces in the head and footboard that could present a head and neck entrapment that could lead to strangulation however that same provision was not extended to the side ladder that in it where it intersects with the bunk bed so even though there was only maybe one death every 18 months those deaths were entirely preventable so it's only one death every 18 months unless it's your child and especially when it's something that we knew about the hazard pattern and we already know how to prevent it so those are just some examples and I also work as an expert witness and litigation on behalf of plaintiffs so you might be thinking I work you know as a consumer advocate and I don't I also work just as much with manufacturers I work as a consultant to industry and I try to go through these very factors that we've discussed which is how is someone going to use the product and the reason I want to know this is because we want to talk I want to talk honestly with the manufacturer about whether or not anticipated uses might lead to injuries or deaths and if they do is it possible that you might need to change product design possibly the instructions or perhaps it's the way that the product is marketed so I work with all the different stakeholders I work with government agencies as well testing laboratories but regardless of who I'm working with I always have the same goal and that is to enhance consumer product safety and so one of the most important ways that I can think of I'm real I have to apologize because when I press a button different things happen so I hope I'll get to my slide the right button right okay okay here we go so one of the most important ways that I work that I think we can all work towards the benefit of the safety of consumer products is through our work and participation in voluntary standards voluntary standards as my colleague said brings together all stakeholders manufacturers retailers sorry there we go consumers and consumer advocates scientists and testing laboratories and people like you who are in this room I'm sorry I have no control of this but people like you in this room from the different agencies from perfecto Health Canada and the CPSC and the objective of voluntary standards as you know is to promote product safety and that's done through the development of performance requirements as well as requirements sometimes for the instructions and warnings that might accompany that product one example of a voluntary standard that has benefited tremendously from the involvement of my colleagues in CPSC and Health Canada as well as other stakeholders is the subcommittee for liquid laundry packets for which I serve as the co-chair along with my colleague Rick Hackman from Procter & Gamble the liquid laundry packets voluntary standard brought together all stakeholders including regulate regulatory staff the involvement of agency staff was essential to developing a standard that we hope will lead to a significant reduction in poisonings associated with liquid laundry packets I'm going to tell you a little but about the standard really quickly because I think it's important to hear what resulted from this collaboration the standard includes design requirements that are aimed at reducing both the attractiveness and access attractiveness of the laundry packets and also access to those laundry packets and this is this requirement includes things like number one requiring the use of an aversive agent like a bittering agent on the exterior soluble packaging number two it requires that the packaging has to be opaque or it has to otherwise visibly mask the contents that we think are attractive to children and the third thing most importantly is that the packaging has to be difficult for children to access now this last factor is defined in a number of different ways which allow manufacturers a menu of options to select from in order to figure out how they will achieve packaging that is difficult for children to access so one of the options for example is manufacturers can individually wrap the laundry packets and have like a little hidden tear not that would be difficult for little children to pick up on and also to open another option is they can design the exterior packaging in a way that exceeds the dexterity and manipulative capabilities of young children and yet a third option that they have is to design the exterior packaging in a way that's difficult for young children that exceeds the cognitive and intellectual capabilities of young children so this creative approach that we came up with this sort of multifaceted approach was due to the contributions and the involvement of all stakeholders and in particular we had a lot of stakeholder involvement from Health Canada and from CPSC furthermore beyond drafting this initial standard it is the continued involvement of all the stakeholders including the regulatory staff it's important for answering this next question that we're dealing with and it's a difficult question and that is where do we set the threshold for when we say the standard is being successful at what point do we say we're doing a good enough job this is important and it's leading to a lot of controversy and debate with all of the stakeholders around the table healthy debate but this is important because if the standard is not adequate if it's not doing what it needs to do we will go back to the table and we will incorporate additional performance requirements into the standard because ultimately our goal is to make the product less of a risk to children another standard that is benefited tremendously from regulatory staff involvement is the ANSI standard for window coverings for which I serve on an oversight steering committee the work on this standard has been challenging to say the least the vocal support of my colleagues from CPSC and Health Canada led to the most the development of the most stringent voluntary standard for window blind coverings which I am pleased to say will finally eliminate hazardous accessible cords from most but not all window covering products without a doubt the support of every stakeholder in the room including regulatory staff was essential to developing this most this most comparatively speaking stringent standard I also want to say that I appreciate having the opportunity to comment on Health Canada's mandatory regulation which is moving to eliminate hazardous accessible cords from all window covering products while it would be ideal for our standards to be fully harmonized it is not possible due to differences in the laws between our countries despite these differences I believe I know we have drawn strength from our shared effort and I believe that the new ANSI standard as well as or I should say certainly with the Health Canada mandatory standard that hopefully will be published in the next 12 months that these standards are going to benefit the consumers from all the countries in North America and the reason I say this and I might be just a little bit optimistic but I'm really hoping the reason that I say this is because I do hope that manufacturers will decide that it's economically more prudent to import one set one type of product that meets just one global standard rather than products meeting different standards into into the different countries sorry I don't have control over the final standard that I want to talk about are products that are in the standards that are intended for the pertain to products intended for infants sleep you may have noticed that there are a lot of infant sleep products on the market we've got cribs bassinets play yards but we also have other products like baby boxes in bed sleepers bed side sleepers etc many of these products facilitate in-room sharing where the parent is going to share the same room as the pay as the bet baby shares the same room but not the same bed as the parent this is important it's what it the aap American Academy of Pediatrics advises for at least the six first six months of life to reduce the risk of SIDS other products are intended to be used in a separate sleep surface these are products that are in bed sleepers that provide a separate sleep surface and a perimeter barrier around the exterior and that's important because there's a risk of asphyxiation due to overlaying if the baby is in the bed and on the same metal surface as the adult all of the products in the market today that relate to infant sleep are responsive to the needs of parents as a human factor psychologist understanding consumers perceive needs is essential to understanding behavior and why consumers elect to use certain products why they feel that they need to use certain products voluntary standards for infant sleep related products are developed with the objective of allowing the product to exist in order to satisfy the needs of parents while at the same time developing performance standards that will reduce hopefully reduce potential hazards this week actually last night I just returned from voluntary standards meetings at the ASTM headquarters in west conshohocken for the juvenile products I the presence of CPSC and health canada technical staff at these meetings was invaluable as staff contributes to our understanding of the hazard patterns and that informs what we put in the performance requirements for the standards in closing i'd like to reiterate how important it is that we have the participation of regulatory staff from all three countries our other stakeholders hope to see regulators at the table their input is sought and it is highly respected I am very thankful to CPSC and Health Canada staff and I hoped for their participation and I hope to work with our esteemed colleagues from perfetto in these voluntary standards as well thank you that's my final slide Thank You Carol Jeanne irani thank you rich and I want to thank CPSC Health Canada perfecto and the summit safety summit organizers for inviting me to participate here today before I start on my presentation I'd like to build a little bit on the conversations that we've had about standards particularly the conversation that Berlinda brought up in terms of an innovation product process standard the concept is is that the we don't know what the future innovative products are going to look like we have no way of knowing when they're going to appear on the marketplace or in somebody's imagination but we do know that there are processes by which you can insert safety into or design safety into any product that's available whether it's virtual reality which we hadn't seen for four would be four or four or five years ago or it's hoverboards or any other product we know there's a process by which we can insert safety so the objective of this team that we're building that ik foresaw is to start to look at who wants to participate and how we would organize ourselves and what the scope would be the intent of doing it at it for so is because it for so is the one place where all industry gets together if you go to you know think about safety organization SDOs you know standards organizations they tend to they tend to organize themselves around products or around industries but innovation is not an industry innovation you know covers all industries so we need a place a location where we can bring in stakeholders from all sources all product areas all product concepts in all industries in order to build this this process standard and I certainly hope that the regulators will participate with us and if you think about some of the challenges that I'll call them sellers have is when an innovation product comes on the market and there's no standard they can't they have nothing to ask the the inventors or the producers or the manufacturers did you test that did you certify that there's nothing out there for them to say did you do that because there aren't no one knew about the product it could take years to build a standard for that product but if we had a process standard then in fact we would have something that we can hand them and say did you follow this process and to insert to design safety into your product before you bring it to the market so it could serve a very valuable I believe this standard could serve a very valuable purpose across of the entire marketplace so I hope that you'll support us as we try to work our way through building this I also want to thank rich for explaining why we're here and what we're supposed to be doing today what I really want to talk about today or what I intended to talk about today is tolerable product risk and that's something that we haven't you know talked about or touched on at all today as far as I know right and we all know about this recent incident you know a motor and airplane you know engine flew apart and someone was killed and within hours of this incident we heard from safety professionals we heard from regulatory agencies this is a freak actress accident the public should not worry okay now what does that say okay it says that some risk is tolerable the public should not worry okay in fact that was one fatality out of a hundred million flights or so estimated hundred million flights for a March 2009 until now but if you went back to January 2009 it was actually 50 fatalities out of about a hundred million flights so in one case you're talking about one in a hundred million in another case you're talking about five out of ten million so there's a range of tolerability in society what society will accept in terms of you know risk now before you talk about risk you have to talk about the risk equation the risk equation is so simple it's actually complicated it is the product of exposure and hazard and what it tells you immediately is that if you have a little exposure and a little hazard you're gonna have a big risk and that's just how it works when we're in the consumer products industry our goal is to have a huge exposure we don't want to sell tens of products we want to sell millions of products so exposure is very high in our consumer products industry now it is very efficient to manage risk by managing hazard and I noted this morning and this afternoon how often the word hazards was mentioned but not the word risk and we want to eliminate hazard we want to control hazard we want to manage hazards there's two problems the first problem is is you never can drive hazard to approximate zero if you could you could eliminate risk but it doesn't work that way there's always will be some level of hazard in product so there always will be some level of risk in the product product category so what we have to do is we have to really understand what is an unreasonable risk or what is a tolerable risk from our products and I think this can help drive a number of changes in terms of how we approach you know the safety of products in terms of how we approach the energy that it takes to recall products that may not be unreasonably risky right it can help change how we think about things in many cases now we hear about recall fatigue there are so many recalls nobody cares anymore there's so many recalls of gee I've been using this product for years and nothing's wrong with it so I'm not going to recall I'm not going to turn it in I'm not going to change it well you should think about what scope we really wanted to have when we talk about tolerable risk so risk is a probability it's really a probability of the likelihood of an occurrence and the likely consequence if it occurs so it's two parts is it going to happen and if it does happen if somebody got hurt is there going to be extensive property damage right so it's really two parts what's the likelihood of it happening and what's the likely consequence if the likelihood of it happening is really high but the consequence is really low donessa low risk so I want to deal with this question of hazards okay hazard does not equal risk and I want although most of you probably touched one of these today this little bottle cap right now if a child chokes on this bottle cap they're probably going to die this is extremely hazardous if you choked on this bottle cap and I hope you don't right you might die I mean this is an extremely hazardous shape in size but the reality is children don't choke on because of the way it's used because the product said it's on it's how you use the product acting chairman and Buerkle just put it right back on their cap on it honor but honor bottle just like that just as she did that right so we don't have it's not attractive to children it's generally not available to young children it's generally not separated from the bottle even when we dispose of the bottle it doesn't represent an unreasonable risk if you look at the data of the billions of these caps that are in the marketplace versus the injury level it's shockingly low shockingly low so it does not represent an unreasonable low risk so when I want to think about tolerable risk and I would I guess one of my takeaways by the way I have to remember what rich destructions were and that is that hazard does not equal risk that's one take away but when I think about tolerable risk I like to put it into this format so first is I don't know that I can actually use a pointer I don't know if I can is that working no son okay so first is you know there's the severity and we can start with with fatalities and work our way all the way down to complaints okay we start from the top and work our way down right and then there's the likelihood of occurrence and what I tried to do was put this in the format of one in a hundred million that goes back to the one fatality in a hundred million from the exploding airplane engine to one in ten million one in a million and then it all the way down to one in 10,000 okay so and then what I did is I just used my arbitrary sense of what is tolerable from 35 years of studying this right so I arbitrary sense of what I think is tolerable what society tolerates then I use something else oops I'll go back went too far I took a product that is in ninety-eight percent of a hundred and thirty million households in the United States and I went through the available data on fatalities hospitalizations and treated and released injuries and on property damage for the years 2012 through the years 2016 in the United States and that's where that category of product stands and it's interesting because unlike blinds courts or other products no one is saying the standards for this for this product is B I'm not gonna tell you what the product is but I'm saying the standard for this product needs to change everybody seems to be quite acceptable that this is a reasonable standard for this particular product and it's in some 120 plus million homes and used mostly daily right so then I took it looked at a product that has been recalled and I plotted that data it's the same category okay but that product was a voluntary no recall and I sit back and I say hmm was that really necessary because that product is an order of magnitude safer from real data than the category that it sits in so when I think about this I think is this how should we think about tolerable risk and then asking the question how should we be thinking about what's tolerable and what's not tolerable and if we if if this particular category is not tolerable then let's change the standard right but if this particular category is tolerable isn't acceptable and it's not an unreasonable level of risk what is acceptable then let's not beat up on products right that are less hazardous less risky so there's my final thoughts and that's what I'd like to leave you and thank you very much thank you Jane I did take some notes and I do have I have the list of the items that seem to be the ones that the panelists would like the government representatives in the room to pay attention to among others but these are the ones that you called out will get a double star next to the first one and that is work together the three agencies work together with standards development organizations both all three governments that was mentioned several times another one was that I have to read my writing okay another one was that through the use of transparency and science we can move efficiency forward another one was that there may be value in developing an innovative product process standard and although you weren't explicit either Belynda or Jean I think you were implying that the technical staffs from the agencies could be active in that work that's correct okay we could we could send it an engraved invitation if that would be helpful I'm I wouldn't want to comment on whether that would be helpful as I said it's a free country so yeah go ahead and follow through as you see fit and it's always about the science that was another one and I think that came up a couple of times and then finally hazard does not equal risk and I we just saw a graphic illustration on that particular point we we got done actually we got it early believe it or not on this panel we are going to have more than just time for just one or two quick questions we have by my watch we have 14 minutes so we have time for a little bit of chat a little discussion so is there anyone out there who would like to either make a comment to this panel or ask a question or prompt a response from our panelists we have microphones if you hold up your hand someone will bring you a mic I just have a question but the this team you want to put together it for so is this gonna be open to anybody let's participate testing agencies and is this at the meeting or is it something outside the meeting and so it is public information if you go to WWF s org select the Northwest Regional meeting click on schedule and look at Monday afternoon at 4:00 o'clock I will expect to see you there it is absolutely public everyone is welcome no matter question I get it we all get it okay last chance I think happy hour started already yeah I think that's it right well I would really want to thank the panelists for being here did you have a were you trying to make a comment oh okay indeed it is okay well I want to say thank you very much I know we're still gonna hear from the chairman but I wanted to just mention that as as the head of the office responsible for putting this together that I am incredibly proud of the people who work in my office it's not just one person that put time into this it's a team effort and it's not just our team either it was constant work by teams in Ottawa well actually not just Ottawa in several places in Canada actually because they're not all together in one city but teams in Mexico and in Canada who worked together with our team to make it happen and if I didn't say it before I'll say it again I really really am proud of the work that they did it's just amazing so that's all for our panel and I'm Brittany are you gonna jump in now thank you so as we as we prepare to wrap up for today we're going to have one last set of closing remarks so if our three principals would like to take the dance we'll have closing remarks from acting chairman a Marie Buerkle little attorney there doe as well as Robert De Niro as as our final wrap-up and closing remarks I'm not sure where to begin what an impressive day that was put together here so many people to think but I will start with by thanking all of those who agreed to participate in the various panels as I said this morning your engagement and your willingness to share your expertise and your insights really is a key to our success and moving along the concept of product safety you know since I've been at the agency for five years I talk about collaboration every time I open my mouth if you've heard me you're probably tired of hearing it but I firmly believe that we can accomplish safety in a way when we're all at the table and we'll all we're all sharing our safety and our expertise and as rich said we the government don't have all the answers we just don't we don't have the resources we don't have any of what we need to get to have all the answers and so that's why your your input and your expertise with all of us is so key to our success and I sincerely thank all of those who took the time to travel here than to spend their day here to understand product safety and to hear from our three countries as I said earlier today we're building on solid accomplishments the joint statement that will be published right after we conclude the summit will be an accurate reflection of our accomplishments accomplishments as well as the ambitious work we intend to undertake and setting forth for our three agencies I truly believe that all consumers and we are all consumers I thought that that was such a great way to start the presentation we are all consumers and if we think about it that way I think that's breaking down some of the silos and rather than yelling back and forth at each other we're really trying to solve the problem but I believe that all consumers and stakeholders are better served by the product safety cooperation among our three governments I would be remiss and I will say it again just about the excellent panel discussions we've had here today and again I want to thank all of the participants for being here finally as I said this morning these events just don't happen they take a tremendous amount of work and commitment by all three of our staffs the staffs this morning we recognized all three of the staffs but this afternoon I want to in particular thank Tilghman Bernal where is she children has worked tirelessly for so many weeks to put these last two days together and her work has not gone unnoticed and certainly the success of these two days and our summit was reflective of all of the work she has done as I joked with her yesterday said you probably put less time into planning your wedding and it's these these events are a tremendous amount of work and she deserves such a tremendous amount of credit and as rich said earlier the International Group in our agency is small and so when one undertakes a project everyone undertakes a project and so you saw the entire team here over the past two days helping to make today and yesterday work so well and I appreciate what they have done so so very much again so I will I think at this point turn it over to Robert thank you and good afternoon again everyone and thank you again for being here and spending today with us truly impressed with such a constructive and informative summit first off I know folks are probably getting a bit tired of hearing all the thanks but on behalf of Health Canada I did want to express our sincere gratitude to you and Marie and your staff your amazing team for being such great hosts and putting on such such an impressive event you have not only been a gracious host but you've been so generous in welcoming us not only as colleagues but as true friends and I have no doubt that I I speak for my colleagues at profile as well so it's truly been an impressive day the presentations were quite informative and I think it did give us an opportunity to share and to showcase some of the great work that we've been doing trilaterally through the summit's and I'll speak to that in just a few moments no doubt the presentations on e-commerce were very informative as well as the panel this afternoon on high energy high lithium lithium ion batteries particularly enjoyed the last panel on stakeholders and and obviously how when an important role they play and how we can continue to improve our work as regulators and collaborating and coordinating our efforts with our broad range of stakeholders I left the Consumer Product Safety Bureau in 2011 and I had spent a good number of years in the area of a consumer product safety before leaving in 2011 and I can tell you that the amount of cross jurisdictional cooperation and collaboration has taken place since I've left is is honestly outstanding it's astonishing when I was in Consumer Product Safety I think the international office here at the CPSC was made up of one individual by the name of Collin Church some of you who have been around for a while may even remember him so I think obviously a lot has changed since then and that is obviously led to the significant achievements that we've seen starting from our first summit in 2011 and as we sit here and conclude our fourth I think what that does show and demonstrate is the commitment that each of our jurisdictions is placing on the importance of collaboration and coordination across our three regulatory organizations I think it's really important to note that trilateral cooperation across our regulatory agencies does not only benefit industry consumers and broad stakeholders but it benefits our roles as regulators and simply put it's good for us too without that collaboration and coordination we've heard countless times today the rate of introduction of products from conception to market entry and to the fact that ecommerce is driving so many sales in the world today and believe it or not we as three regulators do have limited resources that are interjurisdictional cooperation and collaboration is key for us to be successful and in fact it's my belief from Health Canada that we would not be as successful as we have been in achieving the important responsibilities and mandate of protecting the health and safety of our citizens in our respective jurisdictions if we did not have that level of cooperation and collaboration so one key takeaway from me and there's many and I don't want to repeat many of the things that has already been said but one of the areas that I do feel is a is an error that we can focus in going forward is in areas where we may not have any requirements or we maybe haven't identified hazards or risks and I agree there's a difference I think there's an opportunity for the three jurisdictions to come together at very early stages at initial stages from the ground up to work together to compare knowledge to compare data to compare expertise and to the greatest extent possible work together at the earliest stages whether or not that includes the innovative product process standard I think that may fall into that type of category at Health Canada and under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act we have 34 regulations that from time to time need to get updated and need to get modernized based on latest standards latest test methodology changes an incident data whatever the case may be and when we review those requirements I think it goes without saying that we look at other jurisdictions and update and modernize those regulations to try to align them as much as possible and that is in fact what we've done and I can just give you three quick examples that are quite recent first of all lead in children's jewelry and then soon-to-be final publication in our Canada Gazette part two or playpens and small magnets and toys so I think we've got some very recent examples and I hope our stakeholder today realize that we hear you loud and clear that when possible we align our requirements aligning those requirements so I would say is not the only area that we can collaborate and coordinate we have many programmatic elements that we've talked about be it recall or trying to coordinate better on say a fast-track recall process or on import there are many programmatic elements beyond just our regulatory frameworks I would be remiss if I didn't just take a moment to note though that from time to time this is my big caveat there's going to be differences and those differences could exist for a variety of reasons it could come from the fact that we have come to conclusions and a risk assessment that have made different conclusions or we may conclude that the best approach to manage risks in those products may be different than some of our colleagues but I think it's fair to say that those should not be the norm and ideally would be limited to the greatest extent possible and I think to date we've demonstrated that so with that and marine rajulio you and your staff have brought no doubt positive energy enthusiasm to all of your work and that has been reflected I think in the discussions that we've had not only today but as we spent time yesterday together it's been a truly productive and constructive summit and I know that our teams have a lot of work to do going ahead and we look forward to to continue to build on the momentum to date and just to conclude I like to say that Health Canada is very much looking forward to hosting the next North American consumer product safety summit in Ottawa Ontario so stay tuned for those details and we'll be excited to report on the progress that we will have made in the next three years so thank you again merci gracias thank you very much Robert royally Oh buenas tardes alcira desta cuarta Cumbre so Brazoria productos de consumo es necesario Y estamos octo table God owes

colleagues and their staffs for making the trip here to the United States to Bethesda Maryland to engage with us for this trilateral summit not only have we had just an excellent two days with a lot learned and a lot of tasks laid out before us but I think we have forged some friendships and relationships that I am confident that we will continue the conversations and the relationships only to strengthen product safety throughout our continent at this time I just would wish both of my colleagues safe travels and all of their staff safe travels this has been a wonderful two days congratulations to all of the organizers and thank you for your service this Ensign concludes our summit Britany i think i turn it over to you yeah thank you and quickly just a few closing remarks we're gonna if we would ask for the three principals to stay here they're gonna have some photographs before we leave today so thanks to everyone for coming just one last piece that I wanted to make sure everybody aware it was aware of there were a few questions regarding the slides on the CPSC slides that you saw today will be available later I guess probably next week on the CPSC website so if anybody was interested in getting a copy of the slides presentations from the CPSC staff today please check the website and then there was another question regarding the entire summit today that has been taped and it will also be available next week on our youtube channel so you can find that on youtube.com forward slash CPSC so with that I'd like to thank everybody for being here today thank you for attention and I wish everyone a safe travels and have a wonderful weekend and I would like to note that we're finished before 5:00 for the people who were concerned about happy hours so thank you
