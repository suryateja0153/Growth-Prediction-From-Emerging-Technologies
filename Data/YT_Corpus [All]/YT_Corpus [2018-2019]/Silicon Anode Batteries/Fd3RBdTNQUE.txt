 iron is a chemical element with symbol PHA from Latin theorem and atomic number 26 it is a metal in the first transition series it is by mass the most common element on earth forming much of Earth's outer and inner core it is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high mass stars where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova which scatters the iron into space like the other group eight elements ruthenium and osmium iron exists in a wide range of oxidation states minus 2 to plus 7 although plus 2 and plus 3 are the most common elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments but is reactive to oxygen and water fresh iron surfaces of pure lustrous silvery gray but oxidized in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides commonly known as rust unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion iron metal has been used since ancient times although copper alloys which have lower melting temperatures were used even earlier in human history pure iron is relatively soft but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities in particular carbon from the smelting process a certain proportion of carbon between 0.002% and 2.1 percent produces steel which may be up to 1,000 times harder than pure iron crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron which has a high carbon content further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel Steel's and iron alloys formed with other metals alloy Steel's are by far the most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties an iron bearing Rock is abundant iron chemical compounds have many uses iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction used in welding and purifying ores iron forms binary compounds with the Hal and the cow surgeons among its organometallic compounds as ferrocene the first sandwich compound discovered iron plays an important role in biology forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins and vertebrates iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals in adult human males are some 3.8 grams of iron and 2.3 grams in females for whom iron is distributed in hemoglobin and throughout the body iron is a critical element in the metabolism of hundreds of proteins and enzymes involved in diverse body functions such as oxygen transport DNA synthesis and cell growth topic characteristics you topic mechanical properties the mechanical properties of iron and it's alloys can be evaluated using a variety of tests including the Brinell test rockwell test and the vickers hardness test the data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests however the mechanical properties of iron are significantly affected by the samples purity pure single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium and the purest industrially produced iron 99.99% has a hardness of 20 to 30 Brunell an increase in the carbon content will cause a significant increase in the hardness and tensile strength of iron maximum hardness of 65 RC is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content although the alloy has low tensile strength because of the softness of iron it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium because of its significance for planetary cores the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively the form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected to pressures up to see a 15 giggles before transforming into a high-pressure form as described in the next section topic phase diagram and allotropes you iron represents an example of a lot repiy in a medal at least for allotropic forms of iron are known as Alpha Gamma Delta and Epsilon at very high pressures and temperatures some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable beta phase as molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1500 38 degrees Celsius it crystallizes into its Delta allotrope which has a body centered cubic BCC crystal structure as it cools further to 1394 degrees Celsius it changes to its gamma iron allotrope a face centered cubic FCC crystal structure or austenite at 912 degrees Celsius and below the crystal structure again becomes the BCC alpha iron allotrope finally at 770 degrees Celsius the Curie point TC iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic as it passes through the Curie temperature iron does not change its structure but magnetic domains appear where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin in unmagnetized iron all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation however the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field in magnetised iron the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced although each domain contains billions of atoms they're very small about 10 micrometers across this happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the DZ 2 and D X 2 minus y 2 orbitals which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding thus they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align at pressures above approximately 10 Giga Pascal's and temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin or less alpha iron changes into a hexagonal close-packed HCP structure which is also known as Epsilon iron the higher temperature gamma phase also changes into Epsilon iron but does so at higher pressure the beta phase if it exists would appear at pressures of at least 50 Giga Pascal's in temper of at least 1,500 K and have an orthorhombic or a double HCP structure these high-pressure phases of iron are important as end member models for the solid parts of planetary cores the inner core of the earth is generally presumed to be an iron nickel alloy with epsilon or beta structure somewhat confusingly the term beta iron is sometimes also used to refer to alpha iron above its Curie point when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic even though it's crystal structure has not changed the melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than 50 Giga Pascal's for greater pressures studies put the gamma epsilon liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of Giga Pascal's in 1000 K in the melting point generally speaking molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shockwave experiments suggest higher melting points and a much steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells the melting and boiling points of iron along with its enthalpy of atomization are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium showing the lesson contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus however they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently it's d electrons are not easily delocalized this same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium topic isotopes naturally-occurring iron consists of four stable isotopes 5.8 45% of 54 faye90 1.75 4% of 56 fay 2.11 9% of 57 fay and 0.28 2% of 58 fay of these stable isotopes only 57 FEI has a nuclear spin minus 1/2 the nuclide 54 faith theoretically can undergo double electron captured to 54 CR but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1 times 1,000 22 years has been established point six zero Fei as an extinct radionuclide of long half-life 2.6 million years it is not found on earth but its ultimate decay project as its granddaughter the stable nuclides 16e much of the past work on isotopic composition of iron has focused on the nucleosynthesis of sixty faith through studies of meteorites and/or formation in the last decade advances in mass spectrometry have allowed the detection and quantification of minute naturally-occurring variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron much of this work is driven by the earth and planetary science communities although applications to biological and industrial systems are emerging in phases of the meteorites some marcona and germany cut a correlation between the concentration of 60 me the granddaughter of 60 Faye and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes provided evidence for the existence of 60 Faye at the time of formation of the solar system possibly the energy released by the decay of 60 Fay along with that released by 26 out contributed to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago the abundance of 16 e present in extraterrestrial material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the solar system the most abundant iron isotope 56 Fay is a particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis since 56 me 14 alpha particles is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the Alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernova C silicon burning process it is the endpoint of fusion inside extremely massive stars since addition of another alpha particle resulting in sixty Zn requires a great deal more energy this 56 nee which has a half-life of about six days is created in quantity in these stars but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud first to radioactive 56 co and then to stable 56 fay as such iron is the most abundant element in the core of red giants and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth it is also very common in the universe relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight iron is the sixth most abundant element in the universe and the most common refractory element although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62 nee which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56 fay conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process element production in supernovas and distribution on earth greatly favored iron over nickel and in any case 56 face still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62 nee due to its higher fraction of lighter protons hence elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation involving rapid Neutron capture by starting 56 fay nuclei in the far future of the universe assuming that proton decay does not occur cold fusion occurring via quantum tunneling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse in 256 faint nuclei fission and alpha particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron converting all stellar mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron topic occurrence metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the earth because it tends to oxidize but it's oxides are pervasive and represent the primary ores while it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the earth as a whole iron is consequently the most abundant element on earth but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust after oxygen silicon and aluminium most of the iron in the crust has found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite iron 3 oxide magnetite and siderite iron 2 carbonate many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyro Titan Pentland ight Ferro Parekh lace mg PHA o a solid solution of Perak lace MgO and with staight FeO makes up about 20% of the volume of the lower mantle of the earth which makes it the second most abundant mineral phase in that region after silicate perovskite mg PHA silicon oxide it also is the major host for iron in the lower mantle at the bottom of the transition zone of the mantle the reaction gamma mg PHA - silicon oxide left/right arrow mg PHA silicon oxide plus mg PHA o transforms gama olivine into a mixture of perovskite and Ferro pericles and vice versa in the literature this mineral phase of the lower mantle is also often called magnesia with site silicate perovskite may form up to 93% of the lower mantle and the magnesium iron form mg PHA silicon oxide is considered to be the most abundant mineral in the earth making up 38% of its volume large deposits of iron ore found in banded iron formations these geological formations are a type of rock consisting of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron pour shale and chert the banded iron formations were laid down in the time between three thousand seven hundred million years ago and one thousand eight hundred million years ago the mentioned iron compounds have been used as pigments compare ochre since historical time and contribute as well to the color of various geological formations eg the Bunce and steam british Bunter colored San Steen in the case of the Aizen San Steen a Jurassic iron sandstone eg from Don's Dorf in Germany and Bath stone in the UK iron pigments contribute to the yellowish color of large amounts of historical buildings and sculptures the proverbial red color of the surface of Mars is derived from an iron oxide rich regolith significant amounts of iron occur in the iron sulfide mineral pyrite iron for sulfide but it is difficult to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used in fact iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it during weathering iron tends to leach from sulfide deposits as the sulfate and from silicate deposits as the bicarbonate both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate and even mildly elevated pH as iron 3 oxide about 1 in 20 meteorites consists of the unique iron nickel minerals tonight 35 to 80 percent iron and , site 90 to 95 percent iron although rare iron meteorites are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface according to the International resource panels metal stocks in society report the global stock of iron in use in society as 2200 kilograms per capita more developed countries differ in this respect from less developed countries 7,001 4000 vs. 2000 kilograms per capita topic chemistry and compounds iron shows the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry indeed it was the discovery of an iron compound ferrocene that revolutionized the latter field in the 1950s iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals due to its abundance in the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity it's 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration r3d 64 is two of which the three D and fours electrons are relatively close in energy and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons and there is no clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable iron forms compounds mainly in the +2 and +3 oxidation states traditionally iron 2 compounds are called ferrous and iron 3 compounds ferric iron also occurs in higher oxidation states eg the purple potassium fare 8 K to iron 8 oxide which contains iron in its plus 6 oxidation state although iron 8 oxide iron 8 oxide has been claimed the report could not be reproduced in such a species at least with iron in its +8 oxidation state has been found to be improbable computationally however one form of an ionic iron 8 oxide with iron in its plus seven oxidation state along with an iron VIII peroxo isomer has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4k after co condense a ssin of laser ablated PHA atoms with a mixture of o2 our iron IV is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions numerous organ or on compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1 0-1 or even -2 the oxidation states and other bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of mossbauer spectroscopy many mixed valence compounds contain both iron 2 and iron three centers such as magnetite and Prussian blue pha-4 PHA CN 6 3 the latter is used as the traditional blue in blueprints iron is the first of the transition metals that cannot reach its groupbox nation state of +8 although it's heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium Kent with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron but osmium does not favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes in the second half of the 3d transition series vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry as such iron cobalt and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad the iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are iron ii sulfate iron ii sulfate 7 h 2o and iron 3 chloride iron 3 chloride the former is one of the most readily available sources of iron 2 but is less stable to aerial oxidation than more salt and h4 to iron 4 sulfate 6 h2o iron 2 compounds tend to be oxidized to iron 3 compounds in the air unlike many other metals iron does not form amalgams with mercury as a result mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks 34 kilograms made of iron iron is by far the most reactive element in its group it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids giving fade to plus however it does not react with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid topic binary compounds iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form various oxide and hydroxide compounds the most common or iron to three oxide and iron three oxide iron three oxide iron 2 oxide also exists though it is unstable at room temperature despite their names they are actually all non-stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary these oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron see bloomery and blast furnace they are also used in the production of ferrites useful magnetic storage media in computers and pigments the best-known sulfide is iron pyrite iron for sulfide also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster it is not an iron IV compound but is actually an iron to pull a sulfide containing fade 2 + + s2 - 2 ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure the binary ferrous and ferric halides are well known with the exception of ferric iodide the ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding hydro Halleck acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts Fei + 2 HX facts 2 + h2 x equals f CL bridge i iron reacts with fluorine chlorine and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides ferric chloride being the most common - fate plus 3x - 2 X 3x equals f CL Bridge ferric iodide as an exception being thermodynamically unstable due to the oxidizing power of faith 3 + and the high reducing power of I minus 2 I minus plus - faith 3 plus I 2 plus 2 fate 2 + e 0 equals plus 0.23 volts nevertheless milligram amounts of ferric iodide a black solid may still be prepared through the reaction of iron pentacarbonyl with iodine and carbon monoxide in the presence of hexane and light at the temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius making sure that the system is well sealed off from air and water equals topic solution chemistry equals the standard reduction potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common iron ions are given below the red purple tetrahedral fare 8v anion has such a strong oxidizing agent that it oxidizes nitrogen and ammonia at room temperature and even water itself in acidic or neutral solutions for iron for oxide minus 4 plus 10 h2o for faith 3 plus plus 20 Oh minus plus 302 the faith 3 plus ion has a large simple cationic chemistry although the pale violet hexaco ion fay h2o 6 3 plus is very readily hydrolyzed when pH increases above zero as follows as pH Rises above zero the above yellow hydrolyzed species form and as it rises above two to three reddish-brown hydrous iron 3 oxide precipitates out of solution although faith 3 plus has in d5 configuration it's absorption spectrum is not like that of Minnesota 2 plus with its weak spin forbidden DeeDee bands because faith 3 plus has higher positive charge and is more polarizing lowering the energy of its ligand to metal charge transfer absorptions thus all the above complexes are rather strongly colored with a single exception of the hexaco ion and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region on the other hand the pale green iron 2 hexaco ion Faye h2o 6 2 plus does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added which instead results in white iron 2 carbonate being precipitated out in excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate which occurs commonly in groundwater but it oxidizes quickly in air to form iron 3 oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizable number of streams topic coordination compounds many coordination compounds of iron are known a typical six coordinate anion is hexa-core 4 8 3 iron 6 chloride 3 - found in the mixed salt tetrakis methyl ammonium hexa chlorophyll chloride complexes with multiple bidentate ligands have geometric isomers for example the trans chlorohydrate Obus this one - diphenyl phosphine o ethane iron - complex is used as a starting material for compounds with the PHA DPP e2 moiety the Faerie oxalate ion with 3 oxalate ligands shown at right displays helical chirality with its 2 non super poseable geometries labeled lambda lambda for the left-handed screw axis and delta delta for the right handed screw axis in line with IUPAC conventions potassium fairy oxalate is used in chemical ACTA nama tree and along with its sodium salt undergoes photo reduction applied in old-style photographic processes the dihydrate of iron 2 oxalate has a polymeric structure with coplanar oxalate ions bridging between iron centers with the water of crystallization located forming the caps of each octahedron as illustrated below Prussian blue they for iron 6 cyanide 3 is the most famous of the cyanide complexes of iron it's formation can be used as a simple wet chemistry test to distinguish between aqueous solutions of Fae 2 plus and Fae 3 plus as they react respectively with potassium ferrocyanide and potassium ferrocyanide to form Prussian blue iron 3 complexes are quite similar to those of chromium 3 with the exception of iron 3 as preference for O donor instead of n donor ligands the latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron 2 complexes and often dissociate in water many FeO complexes show intense colours and are used as tests for phenols or emails for example in the ferric chloride test used to determine the presence of phenols iron 3 chloride reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex 3a ROH plus iron 3 chloride PHA or 3 + 3 H CL are equal zaral among the halide and pseudo halide complexes fluoro complexes of iron 3 are the most stable with the I earn five fluoride h2o2 - being the most stable and aqueous solution chloro complexes are less stable and favored tetrahedral coordination as in iron for chloride - iron for bromide - and iron for iodide - are reduced easily to iron two thousand eight is a common test for the presence of iron 3 as it forms the blood-red iron one thiocyanate h2o 5 2 plus like manganese - most iron 3 complexes are high spin the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the spectrochemical series such as cyanide an example of a low spin iron 3 complex as iron 6 cyanide 3 - the cyanide ligands may easily be detached in iron 6 cyanide 3 - and hence this complex is poisonous unlike the iron 2 complex iron 6 cyanide 4 - found in Prussian blue which does not release hydrogen cyanide except when dilute acids are added iron shows a great variety of electronic spin states including every possible spin quantum number value for a D block element from zero diamagnetic to 5 halves 5 unpaired electrons this value is always half the number of unpaired electrons complexes with zero to two unpaired electrons are considered low spin and those with four or five are considered high spin iron two complexes are less stable than iron 3 complexes but the preference for o donor ligands is less marked so that for example they nh3 6 2 plus is known while fey NH 3 6 3 plus is not they have a tendency to be oxidized to iron 3 but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used equals topic organometallic compounds equals cyanide complexes are technically organometallic but more important are carbonyl complexes in sandwich and half sandwich compounds the premier iron zero compound as iron pentacarbonyl Fei Co 5 which is used to produce carbonyl iron powder a highly reactive form of metallic iron thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the tri nuclear cluster tri or in dodeca carbonyl calleman's reagent disodium tetra carbonyl fair rate is a useful reagent for organic chemistry it contains iron in the minus 2 oxidation state cyclopentadienyl or and dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare plus 1 oxidation state ferrocene was an extremely important compound in the early history of the branch of organometallic chemistry and to this day iron is still one of the most important metals in this field it was first synthesized in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the fall Valene c1 oh8 by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene the resulting product was found to have molecular formula C 1 o h1 ofay and reported to exhibit remarkable stability the discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry in part because the structure proposed by Paulson and Keeley shown at Wright was inconsistent with then existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability consequently the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood the shockingly novel sandwich structure they ate a 5 c 5 h v 2 was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952 Robert Burns Woodward and Jeffrey Wilkinson investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule such as benzene Ernst Otto Fischer deduced the sandwich structure and also began synthesizing other metallocenes including cobalt Essene Island and Pepin ski provided x-ray crystallographic confirmation of the sandwich structure applying valence bond theory to ferrocene by considering in fate two plus center and cyclopentadiene ID and ions c5h 5 - which are known to be aromatic according to huckel's rule and hence highly stable allowed correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied and the Dewar Chatt Duncanson model proposed the reasons for farah seems remarkable stability became clear ferrocene was not the first organometallic compound known as Isis salt k PT CL 3 C 2 H 4 h2o was reported in 1831 and Mons discovery of me co 4 occurred in 1888 but it was Farah Singh's discovery that began organometallic chemistry as a separate area of chemistry it was so important that Wilkinson and Fischer shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for chemistry for their pioneering work performed independently on the chemistry of the organometallic so-called Sandwich compounds ferrocene itself can be used as the backbone of a ligand eg 1 1 this diphenyl phosphine o ferrocene DP PF ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the pharisee Miam cation FC plus the ferrocene ferrocene IAM couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry metallocenes like ferrocene can be prepared by reaction of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene with iron ii chloride and base it is an aromatic substance and undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition reactions on the cyclopentadienyl ligands for example friedel-crafts acylation of ferrocene with acetic anhydride yields acetyl ferrocene just as a collation of benzene yields acetophenone under similar conditions iron centred organometallic species are used as catalysts the milker complex for example is a transfer hydrogenation catalyst for ketones topic etymology as iron has been in use for such a long time it has many different names in different languages the source of its chemical symbol PHA as the Latin word Ferrum and its descendants are the names of the element in the romance languages for example French Fair Spanish Hierro and Italian and Portuguese Pharoah the word Ferrum itself possibly comes from the Semitic languages via Etruscan from a root that also gave rise to Old English Bray's brass the English word iron derives ultimately from proto-germanic asterisk s Arnon which is also the source of the German name Ison it was most likely borrowed from Celtic asterisk s Arnon which ultimately comes from proto-indo-european asterisk is e ro powerful holy and finally asterisk ice strong referencing iron strength as a metal Kluger relates asterisk is turned into a lyric in latin ira wrath the balto slavic names for iron for example russian Zilla zou zou Lazo polish is a Lazo lithuanian Jala zis are the only ones to come directly from the proto-indo-european asterisk gown iron in many of these languages the word for iron may also be used to denote other objects made of iron or steel or figuratively because of the hardness and strength of the metal the Chinese Thai traditional Thai simplified Tai derives from proto sino-tibetan Astra's Khaliq and was borrowed into Japanese as G Tatsu which also has the native reading kurogane black metal similar to how I earned is referenced in the English word blacksmith topic history you topic wrought-iron you iron is one of the elements undoubtedly known to the ancient world it has been worked or wrought for millennia however iron objects of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease with which iron corrodes beads made from meteoric iron in 3500 BC or earlier were found in Gaza Egypt by GA Wainwright the beads contain 7.5% nickel which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools for example a dagger made of meteoric iron was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun containing similar proportions of iron cobalt and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area deposited by an ancient meteor shower items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500 BC meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content the first iron production started in the middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze samples have smelted iron from asthma Mesopotamia and tall shigar bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3,000 and 2700 BC the Hittites established an empire in north central Anatolia around 1600 BC they appear to be the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regarded highly in their society the Hittites began to smelt the iron between 1500 and 1200 BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their Empire fell in 1180 BC the subsequent period is called the Iron Age artifacts of smelted iron are found in India dating from 1800 to 1200 BC and in the Levant from about 1500 BC suggesting smelting in Anatolia or the Caucasus alleged references compare history of metallurgy in South Asia to iron in the Indian Vedas have been used for claims of a very early usage of iron in India respectively to date the texts to such the Rig Veda terme use metal probably refers to copper bronze-y liar nor syama a is literally black metal first is mentioned in the post rig Vedic atharvaveda some archaeological evidence suggests iron was smelted in Zimbabwe and South East Africa as early as the 8th century BC iron working was introduced to Greece in the late 11th century BC from which it spread quickly throughout Europe the spread of iron working in Central and Western Europe is associated with Celtic expansion according to Pliny the Elder iron use was common in the Roman era the annual iron output of the Roman Empire is estimated at 84,000 750 T while the similarly populous in contemporary Han China produced around 5000 tea in China iron only appears circus 700 to 500 BC iron smelting may have been introduced into China through Central Asia the earliest evidence of the use of a blast furnace in China dates to the 1st century AD and cupola furnaces were used as early as the warring States Period 403 to 221 BC usage of the blast in cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang dynasties during the Industrial Revolution in Britain Henry Court began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron or bar iron using innovative production systems in 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore it was later improved by others including Joseph Hall topic cast iron cast iron was first produced in China during fifth century BC but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period the earliest cast-iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern LaHaye County jongsu in China cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare agriculture and architecture during the medieval period means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron in this context known as pig iron using finery forges for all these processes charcoal was required as fuel medieval blast furnaces were about ten feet 3.0 meters tall and made of fireproof brick forced-air was usually provided by hand operated Bella's modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger with hearts 14 metres in diameter that allowed them to produce thousands of tons of iron each day but essentially operate in much the same way as they did during medieval times in 1709 Abraham Darby I established a coke fired blast furnace to produce cast iron replacing charcoal although continuing to use blast furnaces the ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution toward the end of the 18th century cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes because it was cheaper carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron cast iron and steel until the 18th century since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative first iron bridge in 1778 this bridge still stands today as a monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution following this iron was used in rails boats ships aqueducts and buildings as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress in various languages eg French Spanish Italian and German referred to railways as iron road topic steal steel with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery blacksmiths in Lorestan in western Persia were making good steel by 1000 BC then improved versions wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed around 300 BC and AD 500 respectively these methods were specialized and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s new methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century in the Industrial Revolution new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel in the late 1850s Henry Bessemer invented a new steel making process involving blowing air through molten pig iron to produce mild steel this made steel much more economical thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities topic foundations of modern chemistry in 1774 antoine lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the conservation of mass which was instrumental in changing chemistry from a qualitative science to a quantitative one topic symbolic role you iron plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore the Greek poet hesiod x' works in days lines 109 to 201 lists different ages of man named after metals like gold silver bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity the iron age was closely related with Rome and in Ovid's metamorphoses the virtues in despair quit the earth and the depravity of man becomes universal and complete hard steel succeeded then an example of the importance of iron symbolic role may be found in the German campaign of 1813 Frederick William the third commissioned then the first iron crosses military decoration Berlin iron jewelry reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815 when the Prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewelry for military funding the inscription gold gapek fur Ison a Geib gold for iron was used as well in later war efforts topic production of metallic iron you topic industrial roots the production of iron or steel as a process consisting of two main stages in the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace alternatively it may be directly reduced in the second stage pig iron is converted to wrought iron steel or cast iron for a few limited purposes when it is needed pure iron is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250 degrees Celsius so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder another method as electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode topic blast-furnace processing Industrial iron production starts with iron ores principally hematite which has a nominal formula iron 3 oxide and magnetite with the formula these ores are reduced to the metal in the carbothermic reaction ie by treatment with carbon the conversion is typically conducted in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2,000 degrees Celsius carbon is provided in the form of coke the process also contains a flux such as limestone which is used to remove silly cassius minerals in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace the coke and limestone are fed into the top of the furnace while a massive blast of air heated to 900 degrees Celsius about 4 tons per ton of iron is forced into the furnace at the bottom in the furnace the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce carbon monoxide 2c plus o2 to Co carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore in the chemical equation below hematite to molten iron becoming carbon dioxide in the process iron 3 oxide plus 3 CO 2 PHA plus 3 CO 2 some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke to iron 3 oxide plus 3 C 4 PHA plus 3 CO 2 the flux present to melt impurities in the ore is principally limestone calcium carbonate and dolomite calcium magnesium carbonate other specialized fluxes are used depending on the details of the ore in the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to calcium oxide also known as quick lime calcium carbonates out plus co2 then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a liquid slag south plus silicon oxide calcium meta silicate the slag melts in the heat of the furnace in the bottom of the furnace the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron and apertures in the site of the furnace are open to run off the iron in the slag separately the iron once cooled is called pig iron while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral poor soils for agriculture topic direct iron reduction owing to environmental concerns alternative methods of processing iron have been developed direct iron reduction reduces iron ore to a ferrous lump called sponge iron or direct iron that is suitable for steelmaking two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process natural gas is partially oxidized with heat and a catalyst to ch4 plus o2 - co2 these gases are then treated with iron ore in a furnace producing solid sponge iron iron 3 oxide plus co plus 2 h 2 - PHA plus CO 2 plus 2 h2o silica is removed by adding a limestone flux as described above topic thermite iron is a byproduct of burning a mixture of aluminum powder and rust powder iron 3 oxide plus 2 al 2 fav plus aluminium oxide topic further processes pig iron is not pure iron but has four to five percent carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur magnesium phosphorus and manganese as the carbon is the major impurity the iron pig iron becomes brittle and hard removing the other impurities results in cast iron which is used to cast articles in foundries such as stoves pipes radiators lamp posts and rails alternatively pig iron may be made into steel with up to about two percent carbon or wrought iron commercially pure iron various processes have been used for this including finery forges puddling furnaces Bessemer converters open hearth furnaces basic oxygen furnace and electric arc furnaces in all cases the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon together with other impurities on the other hand other metals may be added to make alloy steels annealing involves the heating of a piece of steel to 700 to 800 degrees Celsius for several hours and then gradual cooling it makes the steel softer and more workable topic applications you topic metallurgical iron is the most widely used of all the metals accounting for over 90 percent of worldwide metal production it's low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools automobiles the hulls of large ships and structural components for buildings since pure iron is quite soft it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel alpha iron is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon no more than 0.02 one percent by mass at 910 degrees Celsius austenite gamma iron is similarly soft in metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon as much as two point zero four percent by mass at 1146 degrees Celsius this form of iron is used in the type of stainless steel used for making cutlery and hospital and food service equipment commercially available iron is classified based on purity in the abundance of additives pig iron has 3.5 to 4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur silicon and phosphorus pig iron is not a saleable product but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel the reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties such as sulfur and phosphorus yields cast iron containing two to four percent carbon one to six percent silicon and small amounts of manganese pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420 to 1470 k which is lower than either of its two main components and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy white cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite or iron carbide PHA 3c this hard brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons rendering them hard but unresisting to shock the broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron carbide a very pale silvery shiny material hence the appellation cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8 percent carbon slowly below 723 degrees Celsius to room temperature results in separate alternating layers of semen tight and alpha iron which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance rapid cooling on the other hand does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite the steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite the end product below 0.8% carbon content as a pearlite alphaf a mixture and that above 0.8% carbon content as a pearlite seaman type mixture in grey iron the carbon exists as separate fine flakes of graphite and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material a newer variant of grey iron referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids or nodules reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material wrought iron contains less than 0.25 percent carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic it is a tough malleable product but not as fusible as pig iron if hone to an edge it loses it quickly wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag and trapped within the metal wrought iron does more corrosion resistant than steel it has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional wrought iron products and blacksmithing mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron but is cheaper and more widely available carbon steel contains two zero percent carbon or less with small amounts of manganese sulfur phosphorus and silicon alloy Steel's contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals such as chromium vanadium molybdenum nickel tungsten etc their alloy content raises their cost and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses one common alloy steel though is stainless steel recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of micro alloy Steel's also termed HS la or high strength low alloy Steel's containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost apart from traditional applications iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation although it is lighter than another traditional protection material led it is much stronger mechanically the attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph the main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron and most of its alloys suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way a costume outing to over 1% of the world's economy painting galvanization passivation plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic protection the mechanism of the rusting of iron is as follows cathode 3 o2 + 6 h2o + 12 E - 12 o - anode for Fay 4 fate - + + 8 E - 4 fate to +4 faith 3 + + 4 E - overall 4 fate + 3 o2 + 6 h2o for faith 3 + + 12 o - for iron 3 hydroxide or 4f e oo + 4 H - authe electrolyte is usually iron ii sulfate in urban areas formed when atmospheric sulfur dioxide attacks iron and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas topic iron compounds although the dominant use of iron is in metallurgy iron compounds are also pervasive in industry iron catalysts are traditionally used in the haber-bosch process for the production of ammonia and the fischer-tropsch a process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the baizhang production the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline iron 3 chloride finds use in water purification and sewage treatment in the dyeing of cloth as a colouring agent in paints as an additive in animal feed and as an etchant for copper in the manufacture of printed circuit boards it can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of iron which is used as a medicine to stop bleeding in Canaries iron ii sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds it is also used to reduce chromate in cement it is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia iron 3 sulfate is used in settling minut sewage particles in tank water iron ii chloride is used as a reducing flocculating agent in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis topic biological and pathological role you iron is required for life the iron sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation iron containing proteins participate in transport storage and used of oxygen iron proteins are involved in electron transfer examples of iron containing proteins in higher organisms include hemoglobin cytochrome C high valent iron and catalase the average adult human contains about 0.005 percent body weight of iron or about 4 grams of which three-quarters is in hemoglobin a level that remains constant despite only about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day because the human body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content topic biochemistry you iron Acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH thus these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidizing it back to ferric iron in particular bacteria have evolved very high affinity sequestering agents called siderophores after uptake in human cells iron storage is precisely regulated a major component of this regulation as the protein transferrin which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells transferring contains faith' 3 plus in the middle of a distorted octahedron bonded to one nitrogen 3 oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the fayth 3 plus ion it has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up PHA 3 plus ions even from the most stable complexes at the bone marrow transfer and is reduced from Fay 3 plus and fade to plus and stored as Feridun to be incorporated into hemoglobin the most commonly known and studied bio and organic iron compounds biological iron molecules are the heme proteins examples are haemoglobin myoglobin and cytochrome p450 these compounds participate in transporting gases building enzymes and transferring electrons metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubra dachshund many enzymes vital to life contain iron such as catalase lipoxygenase and IR BP hemoglobin as an oxygen carrier that occurs in red blood cells and contributes their color transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose generating energy here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide produced when glucose is oxidized which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin predominantly as bicarbonate and ions back to the lungs where it is exhaled in hemoglobin the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring v by anima dazzle nitrogen in a histidine residue of of the protein chains attached to the heme group and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to when hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen and is then called deoxyhemoglobin the fate 2 plus ion at the center of the heme group in the hydrophobic protein interior is in a high spin configuration it is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring which bends instead into a dome with the fate 2 plus ion about 55 picometers above it in this configuration the 6th coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue when deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen bond with it this results in the fate 2 plus ion switching to a low spin configuration resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring which becomes planar additionally this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule resulting in a FeO o bond angle of around 120 degrees that avoids the formation of fayefaye or FeO to fey bridges that would lead to electron transfer the oxidation of fay to +2 fay 3 + and the destruction of hemoglobin this results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity thus when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen its affinity for more oxygen increases and vice versa myoglobin on the other hand contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur thus while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue as described by the Bohr effect named after Christian Bohr the father of Niels Bohr the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and phosphorus trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen but with much more strength so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide has no carboxyhemoglobin this effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a the cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen the sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen with the exception of cytochrome a which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide here the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one the energy is released step by step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate cytochrome a is slightly distinct as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane binds directly to oxygen and transports protons as well as electrons as follows for CY TC 2 + + o2 + 8 h+ inside 4 cy TC 3 + + 2 h2o + 4 h + outside although the heme proteins are the most important class of iron containing proteins the iron sulfur proteins are also very important being involved in electron transfer which is possible since iron can exist Staveley in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states these have 1 2 4 or 8 iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to 4 sulfur atoms because of this tetrahedral coordination they always have high spin iron the simplest of such compounds as rubra Doctson which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains another important class of iron sulfur proteins as the ferredoxin which have multiple iron atoms transferrin does not belong to either of these classes the ability of c muscles to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles based on synthetic replicas the presence of iron in these structures increased elastic modulus 707 times tensile strength 58 times and toughness 92 times the amount of stress required to permanently damage them increased 76 times topic health and diet iron is pervasive but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat boy stirs lentils beans poultry fish leaf vegetables watercress tofu chickpeas black-eyed peas and blackstrap molasses bread and breakfast cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron iron provided by dietary supplements as often found as iron to fumarate although iron ii sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well elemental iron ore reduced iron despite being absorbed at only one third to two thirds the efficiency relative to iron sulfate is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available for use as a common iron supplement glycine the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements topic dietary recommendations the u.s. Institute of Medicine IOM updated estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances RDA for iron in 2001 the current year for iron for women ages 14 - 18 a 7.9 mg per day 8.1 for ages 19 to 50 and 5.0 thereafter post menopause for men the ear is 6.0 milligrams per day for ages 19 and up the RDA as 15 point Oh milligrams per day for women ages 15 to 18 18 point Oh for 19 to 50 and 8.0 thereafter for men 8.0 milligrams per day for ages 19 and up our das are higher than ears so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements RDA for pregnancy as 27 milligrams per day and for lactation 9 milligrams per day for children ages 1 to 3 years 7 milligrams per day 10 for ages 4 to 8 and 8 for ages 9 to 13 as for safety the IOM also sets tolerable upper intake levels you ELLs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient in the case of iron the all is set at 45 milligrams per day collectively the ears are das and you ELLs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes the European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference values with population Reference intake pri instead of RDA an average requirement instead of year AI and old defined the same as in United States for women the PRI is 13 milligrams per day ages 15 to 17 years 16 milligrams per day for women ages 18 and up who are pre menopausal and 11 milligrams per day postmenopausal for pregnancy and lactation 16 milligrams per day for men the PRI is 11 milligrams per day ages 15 and older for children ages 1 to 14 the PRI increases from 7 to 11 milligrams per day the pre are higher than the u.s. RDA S with the exception of pregnancy the EFSA reviewed the same safety question did not establish at all infants may require iron sub clemont's if they are bottle-fed cow's milk frequent blood donors are at risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake for us food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value percent DV 4 iron labeling purposes 100% of the daily value was 18 milligrams and as of May 27 2016 remained unchanged at 18 milligrams a table of all of the old and new adult daily values as provided at reference daily intake the original deadline to be in compliance was July 28 2018 but on September 29 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1st 2020 for large companies in January 1st 2021 for small companies topic deficiency you iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world when loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake a state of latent iron deficiency occurs which over time leads to iron deficiency anemia if left untreated which is characterized by an insufficient number of red blood cells in an insufficient amount of hemoglobin children premenopausal women women of childbearing age and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease most cases of iron deficiency anemia are mild but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat complications during pregnancy and delayed growth in infants and children topic XS iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals in these people excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders known medically as hemochromatosis many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload and are not aware of a family history of the problem for this reason people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8 percent of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians overdoses of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of free iron in the blood high blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA proteins lipids and other cellular components iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron damage to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels iron typically damages cells in the heart liver and elsewhere causing adverse effects that include coma metabolic acidosis shock liver failure coagulopathy adult respiratory distress syndrome long term organ damage and even death humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20 milligrams for every kilogram of body mass 60 milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose over consumption of iron often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under 6 the Dietary Reference intake sets the tolerable upper intake level all for adults at forty five milligrams per day for children under 14 years old the all is 40 milligrams per day the medical management of iron toxicity is complicated and can include use of a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess iron from the body topic cancer the role of iron in cancer defense can be described as a double-edged sword because of its pervasive presence in non pathological processes people having chemotherapy may develop iron deficiency in anemia for which intravenous iron therapy is used to restore iron levels iron overload which may occur from high consumption of red meat may initiate tumor growth and increased susceptibility to cancer onset particularly for colorectal cancer topic see also l mutant in Bolivia where 10% of the world's accessible iron ore is located iron nanoparticle iron platinum nanoparticle iron fertilization proposed fertilization of oceans to stimulate phytoplankton growth iron oxidizing bacteria list of countries by iron production pelletizing process of creation of iron ore pellets rust proof iron steel
