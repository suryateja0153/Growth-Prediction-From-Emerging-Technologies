These components are classified as either discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or ICs, in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit. ICs may be divided into two general categories, digital and analog. Digital circuits, such as memory devices and microprocessors, generally process on-off electrical signals, represented by binary digits, “1” and “0”. In contrast, analog ICs monitor, condition, amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties, such as temperature, pressure, weight, light, sound or motion, and play an important role in bridging between real world phenomena and a variety of electronic systems. Analog ICs also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems.2Organizational Structure          In fiscal 2014, our organizational structure included a product group focused on core technology development and leadership in converters, amplifiers and RF, MEMS, power management and DSP and an end market-focused organization dedicated to understanding, selecting, and resourcing initiatives that are more customized to a particular market or application.  We are in the process of changing our organizational structure  to support our core strategy of technology-driven, market-focused innovation. We will be organized into two business groups. The first group will have responsibility for the communications infrastructure and automotive electronics markets, as well as the radio frequency/microwave, high-speed converters, and digital signal processing technology areas. The second will have responsibility for the industrial, healthcare, and consumer markets, and the precision converters, high-performance linear, and sensor technology areas.           The sales and marketing operations will be integrated and chartered with unifying the customer experience across direct, distribution, and digital channels. Manufacturing, finance, legal, and human resources are managed as separate functional operations providing support across the Company.  Principal ProductsWe design, manufacture and market a broad line of high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. Our product portfolio includes both general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications, as well as application-specific products designed for specific clusters of customers in key target markets. By using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing more customized ICs, our standard products often provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume applications. However, for some industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications products, we focus on working with leading customers to design application-specific solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in data conversion, amplification, RF and microwave, MEMS, power management and DSP, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers. Because we have already developed the core technology for our general-purpose products, we can create application-specific solutions quickly.We produce and market several thousand products and operate in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments, one of which was added as a result of our acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation (Hittite), which closed on July 22, 2014. Our ten highest revenue products, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 9% of our revenue for fiscal 2014. A breakdown of our fiscal 2014 revenue by product category follows.

Our analog signal processing ICs are primarily high-performance devices, offering higher dynamic range, greater bandwidth, and other enhanced features. The principal advantages these products have as compared to competitors’ products include higher accuracy, higher speed, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer components, resulting in improved performance and reliability. Our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems.Converters — We are a leading supplier of data converter products. Data converters translate real-world analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals. Data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family and an area where we are continuously innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their products. Our converter products combine sampling rates and accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package size required by industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications electronics.3Amplifiers/Radio Frequency — We are also a leading supplier of high-performance amplifiers. Amplifiers are used to condition analog signals. High performance amplifiers emphasize the performance dimensions of speed and precision. Within this product portfolio we provide precision, instrumentation, high speed, intermediate frequency/RF, broadband, and other amplifiers. We also offer an extensive portfolio of precision voltage references that are used in a wide variety of applications. Our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of high performance RF ICs covering the entire RF signal chain, from industry-leading stand-alone RF function blocks such as phase locked loops, frequency synthesizers, mixers, modulators, demodulators, and power detectors, to highly integrated broadband and short-range single chip transceiver solutions. Our high performance RF ICs support the high performance requirements of cellular infrastructure and a broad range of applications in our target markets.Other Analog — Also within our analog technology portfolio are products that are based on MEMS technology. This technology enables us to build extremely small sensors that incorporate an electromechanical structure and the supporting analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. Our MEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to sense rotation and inertial measurement units used to sense multiple degrees of freedom combining multiple sensing types along multiple axes. The majority of our current revenue from MEMS products is derived from the automotive end market. The consumer and, to a lesser extent, the industrial end markets, accounted for the balance of revenue from MEMS products in fiscal year 2014. In addition to our MEMS products, our other analog product category includes isolators that enable designers to implement isolation in designs without the cost, size, power, performance, and reliability constraints found with optocouplers. Our isolators have been designed into hundreds of applications, such as universal serial bus isolation in patient monitors, where it allows hospitals and physicians to adopt the latest advances in computer technology to supervise patient health and wirelessly transmit medical records. In smart metering applications, our isolators provide reliable electrostatic discharge performance that helps reduce meter tampering. Likewise, in satellites, where any malfunction can be catastrophic, our isolators help protect the power system while enabling designers to achieve small form factors.Power Management & Reference — Power management & reference products make up the balance of our analog sales. Those products, which include functions such as power conversion, driver monitoring, sequencing and energy management, are developed to complement analog signal chain components across core market segments from micro power, energy-sensitive battery applications to efficient, high performance power systems in infrastructure and industrial applications.Digital Signal Processing ProductsDigital Signal Processing products (DSPs) complete our product portfolio. DSPs are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases, from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSPs are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs are designed to provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively using software. Our general-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third-party suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in families of products that share common architectures and therefore can execute the same software across a range of products. We support these products with easy-to-use development tools, which are designed to reduce our customers’ product development costs and time-to-market. Our customers use our products to solve a wide range of signal processing challenges across our core market and segment focus areas within the industrial, automotive, consumer and communications end markets. As an integrated part of our customers' signal chain, there are typically many other Analog Devices products connected to our processors, including converters, audio and video codecs and power management solutions.4Markets and ApplicationsThe breakdown of our fiscal 2014 revenue by end market is set out in the table below.

Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes, and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes. We spent approximately $560 million during fiscal 2014 on the design, development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes, compared to approximately $513 million during fiscal 2013 and approximately $512 million during fiscal 2012.Our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies of converters, amplifiers and RF and microwave, MEMS, power management, and DSP. In support of our research and development 6activities, we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world.Patents and Other Intellectual Property RightsWe seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, mask works and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. As of November 1, 2014, we held approximately 2,150 U.S. patents and approximately 700 non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2014 through 2034. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. It is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions, if we determine other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, to be more advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine Analog Devices components.Sales ChannelsWe sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. We have direct sales offices, sales representatives and/or distributors in over 40 countries outside North America.We support our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute product catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products. We also provide this information and sell products via our website. We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products. In addition, we offer a variety of web-based tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers.We derived approximately 55% of our fiscal 2014 revenue from sales made through distributors. These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell products that compete with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. In all regions of the world, we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. We make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in Note 2n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Segment Financial Information and Geographic InformationWe operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of six operating segments.Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal 2014, we derived approximately 71% of our revenue from customers in international markets. Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign governments. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies.7Revenue by geographic region, based on the primary location of our customers' design activity for our products, for fiscal 2014 was as follow:  Percent of  Fiscal 2014Geographic Area  RevenueUnited States 29%Rest of North/South America 3%Europe 32%Japan 11%China 16%Rest of Asia 9%For further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry, segment and geographic areas, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 4 in the related Notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us, see the Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.CustomersWe have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012 revenue. These customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial, automotive, consumer and communication markets. Our largest single customer, excluding distributors, represented approximately 4% of our fiscal 2014 revenue. Our 20 largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for approximately 32% of our fiscal 2014 revenue.SeasonalitySales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season. In general, the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry.Production and Raw MaterialsMonolithic IC components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form. The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging.We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high-performance analog, DSP, mixed-signal and MEMS ICs. We also use bipolar and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, wafer fabrication processes.Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. Our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at third-party wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS processes. We currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington, Massachusetts and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate test facilities located in the Philippines and use third-party subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products.Capital spending was approximately $178 million in fiscal 2014, compared with approximately $123 million in fiscal 2013. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $150 million to $165 million of which approximately $20 million relates to new buildings we are constructing.Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials and external foundry services, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers, primarily TSMC. If TSMC or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us, on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in 8manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of components, materials and external foundry services from time to time, these items have generally been available to us as needed.BacklogBacklog at the end of fiscal 2014 was approximately $538 million, up from approximately $345 million at the end of fiscal 2013. We define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.Government ContractsWe estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2014 revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S. government and U.S. government contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm, fixed-price subcontracts. Most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election o
