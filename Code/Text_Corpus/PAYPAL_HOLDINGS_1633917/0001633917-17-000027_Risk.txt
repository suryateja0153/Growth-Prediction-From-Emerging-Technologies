Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. However, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Unfavorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact)$(196) $(527)Hedging impact119 182Unfavorable impact to net revenues (77) (345)Favorable impact to operating expense86 310Net impact to operating income$9 $(35)Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.  The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign  currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. Financial ResultsNet revenuesRevenue descriptionWe earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified  into the following two categories: •Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payments Volume (“TPV”), processed through our Payments Platform.  We define TPV as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries).•Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale of participation interests in certain consumer loans 40Table of Contentsreceivable, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following: •The mix of merchants, products and services;•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;•Geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and•The amount of PayPal Credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.Net revenues analysisThe components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction revenues$9,490 $8,128 $7,107 17% 14%Other value added services1,352 1,120 918 21% 22%Net revenues$10,842 $9,248 $8,025 17% 15%Transaction revenuesTransaction revenues increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and by $1.0 billion, or 14%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015 growth rate. The increase in transaction revenues in 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to the growth in TPV and in the number of payment transactions, both of which were due primarily to increased engagement from our customers (measured by payment transactions per active account) and the increase in our active customer accounts. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2016 were $119 million, compared to $182 million in 2015. Refer to “Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program. The following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV and related metrics: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Active customer accounts(1)197 179 162 10% 11%Number of payment transactions(2)6,129 4,928 3,964 24% 24%Payment transactions per active account(3)31.1 27.5 24.5 13% 12%Total TPV(4)$354,014 $281,764 $234,635 26% 20%Percent of cross-border TPV22% 22% 24% **  ** All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.1 An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months.2 Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.3 Number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period4 Total Payment Volume or “TPV” is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. ** Not meaningfulThe percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2016 due primarily to a higher portion of person-to-person (“P2P”) transactions (including our Venmo products) for which we earn 41Table of Contentslower rates, and a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume. The percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2015 due to a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on higher transaction volume and a lower mix of cross-border transactions. Cross-border transactions generally provide higher revenues than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market. The percent of TPV generated by large merchants increased in 2016 and 2015. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2016 or 2015.Other value added servicesNet revenues from other value added services increased by $232 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and by $202 million, or 22%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Growth in net revenues from other value-added services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 29%. The increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our PayPal Credit products, revenue share earned under our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial, and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased, as described further below.In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial. As a result of the amendment, we recognized $78 million of additional revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Financial was terminated. We retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term. In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivable related to our PayPal Credit products with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. As a result of the arrangement, the impact to net revenues from other value added services during 2015 was a net decrease of $35 million compared to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and fees on the participation interests sold, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the participation interest (inclusive of the gain of $26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately $708 million in certain consumer loans receivable) and servicing fees. Operating ExpensesBeginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better align our external and internal financial reporting.  These classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense, sales and marketing expense and product development expense. Our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting purposes.  As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods presented, and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the separation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated statement of income. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts. 42Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction expense$3,346 $2,610 $2,170 28% 20 %Transaction and loan losses1,088 809 646 34% 25 %Customer support and operations1,267 1,110 991 14% 12 %Sales and marketing969 937 954 3% (2)%Product development834 792 747 5% 6 %General and administrative1,028 873 733 18% 19 %Depreciation and amortization724 608 516 19% 18 %Restructuring— 48 — **  ** Total operating expenses$9,256 $7,787 $6,757 19% 15 %Transaction expense rate10.95% 0.93% 0.92%    Transaction and loan loss rate20.31% 0.29% 0.28%    1 Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV2 Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV** Not MeaningfulTransaction expenseTransaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. For example, in connection with our customer choice initiatives, we expect that our transaction expense rate will increase.  The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Transaction expense increased $736 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in transaction expense in 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV, which increased 26% in 2016. Transaction expense increased by $440 million, or 20%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in transaction expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV, offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our transaction expense rate in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due primarily to changes in funding mix. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 45%, 45%, and 48% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Our transaction expense rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to higher assessments charged by payments processors and other financial institutions partially offset by cost efficiencies from our Payments Platform and a more favorable funding mix. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.Transaction and loan lossesTransaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. We expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal Credit products and working capital advances to select merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administered and 43Table of Contentsfunded on behalf of eBay, which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $27 million and $43 million, respectively. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 (In millions, except percentages)Transaction losses$655 $511 $408 28% 25%Loan losses433 298 238 45% 25%Transaction and loan losses$1,088 $809 $646 34% 25%Transaction and loan losses increased $279 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and increased $163 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Transaction losses increased by $144 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, in 2016 was flat compared to 2015. The growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher than the growth in TPV in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution. Transaction losses increased by $103 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily attributable to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to lower recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred. Loan losses increased $135 million, or 45%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $60 million, or 25%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in loan losses in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in the current period due to increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 28%. The increase in loan losses in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year.  The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 8% in 2015, including the sale of additional participation interests to certain investors in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in consumer loans receivables in 2016 and 2015 was due to the growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable balance:  December 31, 2016 2015Weighted average U.S. consumer FICO scores(1)682 686Percentage of loans receivable with FICO scores > 680(1)52.1% 53.6%Percentage of loans receivable with FICO scores < 599(1)11.1% 9.4%Percent of loans and interest receivable current90.0% 90.1%Percent of loans and interest receivable > 90 days(3)4.1% 3.9%Net charge off rate(2)6.4% 5.9%(1) Excludes certain outstanding consumer loans outside of the U.S., for which no FICO scores are available, with an outstanding balance of $117 million and $70 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   (2) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year. (3) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.44Table of ContentsWe offer credit products to certain existing small and medium-sized merchants through our PayPal Working Capital product. The total PayPal Working Capital advances and fees receivable (“merchant receivables”) outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $558 million and $421 million, respectively, reflecting a year over year increase of 33% due to the increase  in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally. To assess a merchant seeking a PayPal Working Capital advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the principal balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance. The PRM uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay a working capital advance. Primary drivers of the model include the merchant's annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of 350 to 750. We generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose less credit risk. We assess a participating merchant’s PRM score on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 625 and 630, respectively.The determination of the number of days our merchant receivables are outstanding is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. We generally calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's estimated future payment volume so that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. We monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment period. In the second quarter of 2016, we refined our estimate of the original expected repayment period to take into account the variability in repayment patterns. Prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this change. The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables: December 31, 2016 2015Percentage of merchant receivables with PRM scores > 61067.7% 69.1%Percentage of merchant receivables with PRM scores < 52512.9% 10.7%Percent of merchant receivables within original expected repayment period(1)82.8% 87.2%Percent of merchant receivables > 90 days outstanding(1)7.5% 4.0%(1) Amounts in the prior periods were updated to reflect changes in our estimate of the original expected repayment period.The changes in percentage of merchant receivables past their expected repayment period at December 31, 2016 over December 31, 2015 were due primarily to the increase in longer duration merchant loans in 2016 compared to the prior year, which increased the seasonality of repayments trends.  Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal Credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans.Customer support and operationsCustomer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred in our operations centers. Customer support and operations costs increased $157 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and $119 million, or 12%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2015 was predominantly related to an increase in headcount to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform and an increase in expenses to operate as an independent public company offset in part by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  Sales and marketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015.  The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to Xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global brand recognition. Sales and marketing expense decreased by $17 million, or 2%, in 45Table of Contents2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses and favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, offset in part by higher marketing spend. Product developmentProduct development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.Product development expenses increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $45 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in contractor related expenses. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to investments in our Payments Platform, creating new mobile experiences for our customers and supporting our strategic initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses. General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal proceedings, case settlements and judgments, and regulatory proceedings and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.For periods prior to the separation, our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses that were incurred by eBay have been allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the periods presented, a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses.General and administrative expenses increased $155 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $140 million, or 19%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and continued investments in compliance programs. The increase in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and an increase in expenses associated with professional services, including contractor related expenses, and regulatory matters. In 2015, $121 million of corporate costs and expenses allocated to us by eBay were included in general and administrative expenses compared to $207 million in 2014, representing a decrease of $86 million, or 42%, compared to 2014. Depreciation and AmortizationThe primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, amortization of equipment used to deliver our services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $116 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $92 million, or 18%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increases in 2016 and 2015 were due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platform and in 2015, an increase in capital expenditures to operate as an independent public company. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $150 million, $93 million and $84 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to our acquisitions.46Table of ContentsRestructuringIn January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016 or 2014.  Income Tax ExpenseOur effective tax rate was 14% in 2016, 17% in 2015, and 67% in 2014. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of a U.S. deferred tax liability of approximately $650 million on $1.9 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.Non-GAAP Financial InformationNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that are different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
