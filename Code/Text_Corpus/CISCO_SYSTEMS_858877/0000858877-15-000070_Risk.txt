Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.  We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.  In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness.  Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in60Table of Contentsaccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):  DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 25, 2015 $0.80 $4,086 155 $27.22 $4,234 $8,320July 26, 2014 $0.72 $3,758 420 $22.71 $9,539 $13,297July 27, 2013 $0.62 $3,310 128 $21.63 $2,773 $6,083Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO:   July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,344 $5,157 $187DSO38 38 —Our accounts receivable net, as of July 25, 2015 increased by approximately 4% compared with the end of fiscal 2014. Our DSO as of July 25, 2015 was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2014, as factors that drive DSO such as shipment linearity and collections were similar for the periods presented.Inventory Supply Chain  The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns):   July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,627 $1,591 $36Annualized inventory turns12.1 12.7 (0.6)Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,078 $4,169 $(91)Inventory as of July 25, 2015 increased by 2% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2014, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 2%.  On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 1% compared with the end of fiscal 2014. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.61Table of ContentsFinancing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 25, 2015, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCING GUARANTEES  July 25, 2015LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables Financed ServiceContracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total TOTALFinancing receivables and guarantees$3,395 $1,763 $3,573 $8,731 $288 $129 $417 $9,148Allowance for credit loss(259) (87) (36) (382) — — — (382)Deferred revenue(5) (13) (1,853) (1,871) (127) (107) (234) (2,105)Net balance sheet exposure$3,131 $1,663 $1,684 $6,478 $161 $22 $183 $6,661Financing Receivables  Financing receivables less unearned income increased by 4% compared with the end of fiscal 2014. The change was primarily due to an 11% increase in financed service contracts and other, and a 5% increase in loan receivables, partially offset by a 4% decrease in lease receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services.  Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees  In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.  The volume of channel partner financing was $25.9 billion, $24.6 billion, and $23.8 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.2 billion as of each of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014.  We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed.  Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.62Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes  The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Senior notes:      Floating-rate notes:      Three-month LIBOR plus 0.05%September 3, 2015 $850 $850 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.28%March 3, 2017 1,000 1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.31%June 15, 2018(1)900 — Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 500 500 Fixed-rate notes:      2.90%November 17, 2014 — 500 5.50%February 22, 2016 3,000 3,000 1.10%March 3, 2017 2,400 2,400 3.15%March 14, 2017 750 750 1.65%June 15, 2018(1)1,600 — 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 2.125%March 1, 2019 1,750 1,750 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020(1)1,500 — 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 3.00%June 15, 2022(1)500 — 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025(1)500 — 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total  $25,250 $20,750 (1) In June 2015, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion.Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 25, 2015.We repaid the fixed-rate notes (2.90%) due on November 17, 2014, for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million upon maturity.We repaid the floating-rate notes due on September 3, 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of $850 million upon maturity.Other Debt  Other debt as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $4 million and $12 million as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, respectively.Commercial Paper  In fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014.Credit Facility  On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.  63Table of ContentsWe may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022.  We were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. This credit facility replaces our prior credit facility that was entered into on February 17, 2012, which was terminated in connection with its entering into the new credit facility. Deferred Revenue   The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions):   July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Service$9,757 $9,640 $117Product5,426 4,502 924    Total$15,183 $14,142 $1,041Reported as:     Current$9,824 $9,478 $346Noncurrent5,359 4,664 695    Total$15,183 $14,142 $1,041Deferred product revenue increased 21% primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements and also, to a lesser extent, to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of July 25, 2015.  The product categories of Collaboration, Security, and Wireless were the key contributors to the increase. The increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2015 was driven by the timing of multiyear arrangements, an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. Contractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 25, 2015 (in millions):  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 25, 2015Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,142 $346 $435 $178 $183Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,078 4,078 — — —Other purchase obligations2,012 604 815 536 57Long-term debt including the current portion25,251 3,850 6,651 8,250 6,500Other long-term liabilities1,213 — 350 72 791Total by period$33,696 $8,878 $8,251 $9,036 $7,531Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,122        Total$35,818        Operating Leases   For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers   We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 25, 2015, the liability for these purchase commitments was $156 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.64Table of ContentsOther Purchase Obligations   Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services.  Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt   The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities   Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,876 million  and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $246 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market.  As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology.  Immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, we owned approximately 83% of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this investment, we entered into a put/call option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme.  In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. The acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products.  During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recorded compensation expense of $207 million and $416 million, respectively, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. Continued vesting and changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense in future periods. Based on the terms of the agreement, we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $843 million (which includes the $623 million that has been expensed to date), net of forfeitures.  The milestone payments, to the extent earned, are expected to be paid primarily during the first half of each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.Other Funding Commitments  We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $205 million as of July 25, 2015, compared with $255 million as of July 26, 2014.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 25, 2015 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”65Table of ContentsSecurities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was $0.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.  66Table of Contents
