Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 94Table of Contents(b)Stock Repurchase ProgramIn September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. As of July 27, 2019, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $13.5 billion, with no termination date. A summary of the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts):Years Ended Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share AmountJuly 27, 2019 418 $49.22 $20,577July 28, 2018 432 $40.88 $17,661July 29, 2017 118 $31.38 $3,706There were $40 million, $180 million and $66 million in stock repurchases pending settlement as of July 27, 2019, July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively.The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or increase to accumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.(c)Preferred StockUnder the terms of our Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of our authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.15.Employee Benefit Plans  (a)Employee Stock Incentive PlansStock Incentive Plan Program Description    As of July 27, 2019, we had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof. Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with Cisco. The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of Cisco, government regulations, and other factors. Our primary stock incentive plan is summarized as follows: 2005 Plan    The 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the vesting of which may be time-based or upon satisfaction of performance goals, or both, and/or other conditions.  Employees (including employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. As of July 27, 2019, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan over its term was 694 million shares. The 2005 Plan may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time and for any reason, and is currently set to terminate at the 2021 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended by the shareholders prior to or on such date.Under the 2005 Plan’s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) stock options and SARs and (ii) “full value” awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or terminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of additional shares, if any, that counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan at the time of grant as a result of the application of the share ratio described above, will become available again for issuance under the 2005 Plan.95Table of Contents(b)Employee Stock Purchase PlanWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 721.4 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance as of July 27, 2019. Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to exercised purchase rights. We issued 19 million, 22 million, and 23 million shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of July 27, 2019, 159 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.(c)Summary of Share-Based Compensation ExpenseShare-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock, and RSUs granted to employees. The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Cost of sales—product$90 $94 $85Cost of sales—service130 133 134Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales220 227 219Research and development540 538 529Sales and marketing519 555 542General and administrative250 246 236Restructuring and other charges62 33 3Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses1,371 1,372 1,310Total share-based compensation expense$1,591 $1,599 $1,529Income tax benefit for share-based compensation$542 $558 $451As of July 27, 2019, the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $3.3 billion, which is expected to be recognized over approximately 2.8 years on a weighted-average basis. (d)Share-Based Awards Available for GrantA summary of share-based awards available for grant is as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Balance at beginning of fiscal year245 272 242Restricted stock, stock units, and other share-based awards granted(67) (70) (76)Share-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired18 18 78Shares withheld for taxes and not issued23 25 28Other1 — —Balance at end of fiscal year220 245 272For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance.

The total number of in-the-money stock options exercisable as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 were 2 million and 4 million, respectively. As of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, 2 million and 4 million outstanding stock options were exercisable and the weighted-average exercise price was $6.75 and $6.84, respectively.97Table of Contents(g)Valuation of Employee Share-Based AwardsTime-based restricted stock units and PRSUs that are based on our financial performance metrics or non-financial operating goals are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the present value of expected dividends. On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return (TSR) component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions for the valuation of time-based RSUs and PRSUs are summarized as follows:RESTRICTED STOCK UNITSYears EndedJuly 27, 2019July 28, 2018July 29, 2017Number of shares granted (in millions)434343Grant date fair value per share$47.75$35.81$28.38Weighted-average assumptions/inputs:        Expected dividend yield2.7%3.2%3.5%   Range of risk-free interest rates0.0% – 2.9%0.0% – 2.7%0.0% – 1.5% PERFORMANCE BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITSYears EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Number of shares granted (in millions)2 3 7Grant date fair value per share$47.00 $32.69 $28.94Weighted-average assumptions/inputs:        Expected dividend yield2.8% 3.5% 3.4%   Range of risk-free interest rates2.1% – 3.0% 1.0% – 2.7% 0.1% – 1.5%   Range of expected volatilities for index13.0% - 65.2% 12.5% - 82.8% 16.7% – 46.8%The PRSUs granted during the fiscal years presented are contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics, our comparative market-based returns, or the achievement of financial and non-financial operating goals. For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a three-year performance period. Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period. Each PRSU recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics or our comparative market-based returns, and 0% to 100% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non-financial operating goals.  The assumptions for the valuation of employee stock purchase rights are summarized as follows: EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTSYears EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Weighted-average assumptions:        Expected volatility20.4% 22.1% 24.6%   Risk-free interest rate1.9% 1.3% 0.7%   Expected dividend3.0% 3.1% 3.2%   Expected life (in years)1.3 1.3 1.3Weighted-average estimated grant date fair value per share$9.06 $7.48 $6.52The valuation of employee stock purchase rights and the related assumptions are for the employee stock purchases made during the respective fiscal years.  We used third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in our Black-Scholes model. We are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share-based payment awards. We used the implied volatility for traded options (with contract terms corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock purchase rights. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts at the grant date.98Table of Contents(h)Employee 401(k) PlansWe sponsor the Cisco Systems, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for our employees. As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary contributions and after-tax contributions for eligible employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 75% of their annual eligible earnings to the Plan on a pretax and after-tax basis, including Roth contributions. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match pretax and Roth employee contributions up to 100% of the first 4.5% of eligible earnings that are contributed by employees. Therefore, the maximum matching contribution that we may allocate to each participant’s account will not exceed $12,600 for the 2019 calendar year due to the $280,000 annual limit on eligible earnings imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. All matching contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to the Plan totaled $283 million, $269 million, and $265 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.The Plan allows employees who meet the age requirements and reach the Plan contribution limits to make catch-up contributions (pretax or Roth) not to exceed the lesser of 75% of their annual eligible earnings or the limit set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions. In addition, the Plan provides for discretionary profit-sharing contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are allocated among eligible participants in the proportion of their salaries to the total salaries of all participants. There were no discretionary profit-sharing contributions made in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.We also sponsor other 401(k) plans as a result of acquisitions of other companies. Our contributions to these plans were not material to Cisco on either an individual or aggregate basis for any of the fiscal years presented.(i)Deferred Compensation PlansThe Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, became effective in 2007. As required by applicable law, participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to a select group of our management employees. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is an unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation arrangement, a participant may elect to defer base salary, bonus, and/or commissions, pursuant to such rules as may be established by Cisco, up to the maximum percentages for each deferral election as described in the plan. We may also, at our discretion, make a matching contribution to the employee under the Deferred Compensation Plan. A matching contribution equal to 4.5% of eligible compensation in excess of the Internal Revenue Code limit for qualified plans for calendar year 2019 that is deferred by participants under the Deferred Compensation Plan (with a $1.5 million cap on eligible compensation) will be made to eligible participants’ accounts at the end of calendar year 2019. The total deferred compensation liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan, together with deferred compensation plans assumed from acquired companies, was approximately $678 million and $651 million as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively, and was recorded primarily in other long-term liabilities. 99Table of Contents16.Comprehensive Income (Loss)  The components of AOCI, net of tax, and the other comprehensive income (loss), excluding noncontrolling interest, are summarized as follows (in millions): Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for-Sale Investments Net Unrealized  Gains (Losses) Cash Flow Hedging Instruments Cumulative Translation Adjustment and Actuarial Gains and Losses Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)BALANCE AT JULY 30, 2016$413 $(59) $(680) $(326)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications attributable to Cisco Systems, Inc.(164) 22 318 176(Gains) losses reclassified out of AOCI87 79 16 182Tax benefit (expense)37 (10) (13) 14Total change for the period(40) 91 321 372BALANCE AT JULY 29, 2017373 32 (359) 46Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications attributable to Cisco Systems, Inc.(543) 21 (159) (681)(Gains) losses reclassified out of AOCI(287) (68) 7 (348)Tax benefit (expense)93 4 (8) 89Total change for the period(737) (43) (160) (940)Effect of adoption of accounting standard54 — (9) 45BALANCE AT JULY 28, 2018(310) (11) (528) (849)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications attributable to Cisco Systems, Inc.560 — (267) 293(Gains) losses reclassified out of AOCI13 (3) 2 12Tax benefit (expense)(95) — 15 (80)Total change for the period478 (3) (250) 225Effect of adoption of accounting standards(168) — — (168)BALANCE AT JULY 27, 2019$— $(14) $(778) $(792)The net gains (losses) reclassified out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with line item location, during each period were as follows (in millions):  July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017  Comprehensive Income Components Income Before Taxes Line Item in Statements of OperationsNet unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments $(13) $287 $(87) Other income (loss), net         Net unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments        Foreign currency derivatives 2 — — RevenueForeign currency derivatives — 16 (20) Cost of salesForeign currency derivatives 1 52 (59) Operating expenses  3 68 (79)           Cumulative translation adjustment and actuarial gains and losses — (7) (16) Operating expensesCumulative translation adjustment and actuarial gains and losses (2) — — Other income (loss), net         Total amounts reclassified out of AOCI $(12) $348 $(182)  100Table of Contents17.Income Taxes(a)Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Federal:     Current$1,760 $9,900 $1,300Deferred(84) 1,156 (42) 1,676 11,056 1,258State:     Current302 340 86Deferred(2) (232) 56 300 108 142Foreign:     Current1,238 1,789 1,416Deferred(264) (24) (138) 974 1,765 1,278Total$2,950 $12,929 $2,678Income before provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017United States$7,611 $3,765 $2,393International6,960 9,274 9,894Total$14,571 $13,039 $12,287The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes consist of the following:Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Federal statutory rate21.0 % 27.0 % 35.0 %Effect of:     State taxes, net of federal tax benefit2.0 0.6 1.1Foreign income at other than U.S. rates(4.5) (5.2) (13.4)Tax credits(1.7) (2.5) (1.2)Foreign-derived intangible income deduction(1.3) — —Domestic manufacturing deduction— (0.5) (0.4)Stock-based compensation(0.6) (0.1) 1.4Impact of the Tax Act6.1 80.1 —Other, net(0.8) (0.2) (0.7)Total20.2 %99.2 % 21.8 %On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate (“federal tax rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion related to the Tax Act. The provisional tax expense included an $863 million benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year. As previously disclosed, the benefit could be subject to reduction or elimination by subsequent government action. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded an $872 million charge, which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018, as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter.101Table of ContentsThe total tax charge as a result of the Tax Act was $11.3 billion, consisting of $9.0 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement. The Tax Act includes a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provision that imposes U.S. tax on certain foreign subsidiary income in the year it is earned. Our accounting policy is to treat tax on GILTI as a current period cost included in tax expense in the year incurred.Foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided on a cumulative total of $6.6 billion of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2019. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in such foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we could be subject to additional foreign taxes. The amount of potential unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is approximately $711 million.As a result of certain employment and capital investment actions, our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates. A portion of these incentives expired at the end of fiscal 2015. The remaining tax incentives expired at the end of fiscal 2019. The gross income tax benefit attributable to tax incentives was estimated to be $0.3 billion ($0.08 per diluted share) in fiscal 2019. As of the end of fiscal 2018 and 2017, the gross income tax benefits attributable to tax incentives were estimated to be $0.9 billion and $1.3 billion ($0.19 and $0.25 per diluted share) for the respective years. The gross income tax benefits were partially offset by accruals of U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings.  Unrecognized Tax Benefits The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Beginning balance$2,000 $1,973 $1,627Additions based on tax positions related to the current year185 251 336Additions for tax positions of prior years84 84 180Reductions for tax positions of prior years(283) (129) (78)Settlements(38) (124) (43)Lapse of statute of limitations(23) (55) (49)Ending balance$1,925 $2,000 $1,973As of July 27, 2019, $1.7 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if realized. During fiscal 2019, we recognized $30 million of net interest expense and $6 million of penalty expense. During fiscal 2018, we recognized $10 million of net interest expense and no net penalty expense. During fiscal 2017, we recognized $26 million of net interest expense and a $4 million reduction in penalties. Our total accrual for interest and penalties was $220 million, $180 million, and $186 million as of the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audit for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2010. We are no longer subject to foreign or state income tax audits for returns covering tax years through fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2008, respectively.We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. We believe it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months. Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits at July 27, 2019 could be reduced by $50 million in the next 12 months.(b)Deferred Tax Assets and LiabilitiesThe following table presents the breakdown for net deferred tax assets (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Deferred tax assets$4,065 $3,219Deferred tax liabilities(95) (141)Total net deferred tax assets$3,970 $3,078102Table of ContentsThe following table presents the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018ASSETS   Allowance for doubtful accounts and returns$127 $285Sales-type and direct-financing leases176 171Inventory write-downs and capitalization409 289Investment provisions— 54IPR&D, goodwill, and purchased intangible assets1,427 63Deferred revenue1,150 1,584Credits and net operating loss carryforwards1,241 1,087Share-based compensation expense164 190Accrued compensation342 370Other419 408Gross deferred tax assets5,455 4,501Valuation allowance(457) (374)Total deferred tax assets4,998 4,127LIABILITIES   Purchased intangible assets(705) (753)Depreciation(141) (118)Unrealized gains on investments(70) (33)Other(112) (145)Total deferred tax liabilities(1,028) (1,049)Total net deferred tax assets$3,970 $3,078As of July 27, 2019, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $676 million, $1 billion, and $756 million, respectively. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. If not utilized, the federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. We have provided a valuation allowance of $111 million for deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not expected to be realized.As of July 27, 2019, our federal, state, and foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $25 million, $1.1 billion, and $5 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. The majority of state and foreign tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. We have provided a valuation allowance of $346 million for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign tax credits that are not expected to be realized. 18.Segment Information and Major Customers (a)Revenue and Gross Margin by SegmentWe conduct business globally and are managed on a geographic basis consisting of three segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. Our management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from our internal management system. Sales are attributed to a segment based on the ordering location of the customer. We do not allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our segments in this internal management system because management does not include the information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include this information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments. 103Table of ContentsSummarized financial information by segment for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, based on our internal management system and as utilized by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), is as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Revenue:     Americas$30,927 $29,070 $28,351EMEA13,100 12,425 12,004APJC7,877 7,834 7,650Total$51,904 $49,330 $48,005Gross margin:     Americas$20,338 $18,792 $18,284EMEA8,457 7,945 7,855APJC4,683 4,726 4,741Segment total33,479 31,463 30,880Unallocated corporate items(813) (857) (656)Total$32,666 $30,606 $30,224Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.Revenue in the United States was $27.4 billion, $25.5 billion, and $25.0 billion for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
