Risk Factors” in this report.62Table of ContentsWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.  We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.  In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness.  Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):  DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 27, 2013 $0.62 $3,310 128 $21.63 $2,773 $6,083July 28, 2012 $0.28 $1,501 262 $16.64 $4,360 $5,861July 30, 2011 $0.12 $658 351 $19.36 $6,791 $7,449On September 3, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per common share to be paid on October 23, 2013 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 3, 2013.Accounts Receivable, Net   The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO:   July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,470 $4,369 $1,101DSO40 34 6Our accounts receivable net, as of July 27, 2013 increased by approximately 25% compared with the end of fiscal 2012. Our DSO as of July 27, 2013 was higher by 6 days compared with the end of fiscal 2012, primarily due to the timing of product shipments, as a higher proportion of shipments were made in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013.Inventory Supply Chain   The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns):   July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,476 $1,663 $(187)Annualized inventory turns13.8 11.7 2.1Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,033 $3,869 $164Inventory as of July 27, 2013 decreased by 11% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2012, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 4%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat compared with the end of fiscal 2012. The inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of manufactured finished goods, which in turn was due in part to inventory sold as part of the sale of our Linksys product line. The increase in purchase commitments in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was driven primarily by new product introductions and an increase in customer demand. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, 63Table of Contentsand adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees  We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 27, 2013, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCINGGUARANTEES TOTALJuly 27, 2013LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables Financed ServiceContracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total  Gross amount less unearned income$3,507 $1,649 $3,136 $8,292 $438 $237 $675 $8,967Allowance for credit loss(238) (86) (20) (344) — — — (344)Deferred revenue(41) (32) (2,036) (2,109) (225) (191) (416) (2,525)Net balance sheet exposure$3,228 $1,531 $1,080 $5,839 $213 $46 $259 $6,098Financing Receivables   Gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9% compared with the end of fiscal 2012. The change was primarily due to a 10% increase in lease receivables and an 18% increase in financed service contracts and other, partially reduced by an 8% decline in loan receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees   In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees  The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.64Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes    The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions):   July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Senior notes:   Floating-rate notes, due 2014$1,250 $1,2501.625% fixed-rate notes, due 20142,000 2,0002.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2014500 5005.50% fixed-rate notes, due 20163,000 3,0003.15% fixed-rate notes, due 2017750 7504.95% fixed-rate notes, due 20192,000 2,0004.45% fixed-rate notes, due 20202,500 2,5005.90% fixed-rate notes, due 20392,000 2,0005.50% fixed-rate notes, due 20402,000 2,000Total$16,000 $16,000Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 27, 2013.Other Debt Other debt includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements, notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and notes related to our investment in Insieme Networks, Inc. (“Insieme”). The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $31 million and $41 million as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, respectively.Commercial Paper In fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. As of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program.Credit Facility On February 17, 2012, we terminated our then-existing credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2017. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 27, 2013, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to February 17, 2019. Deferred Revenue   The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions):   July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Service$9,403 $9,173 $230Product4,020 3,707 313    Total$13,423 $12,880 $543Reported as:     Current$9,262 $8,852 $410Noncurrent4,161 4,028 133    Total$13,423 $12,880 $543The increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially reduced by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements.65Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 27, 2013 (in millions):  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 27, 2013Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years More than5 YearsOperating leases$1,149 $367 $439 $160 $183Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,033 4,033 — — —Other purchase obligations1,085 516 491 77 1Long-term debt16,021 3,260 3,510 751 8,500Other long-term liabilities635 — 101 433 101Total by period$22,923 $8,176 $4,541 $1,421 $8,785Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,147        Total$25,070        Operating Leases  For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers   We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 27, 2013, the liability for these purchase commitments was $172 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations   Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services.  Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.Long-Term Debt   The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities   Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,748 million  and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $399 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $263 million as of July 27, 2013, compared with $120 million as of July 28, 2012.Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment includes $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. In addition, pursuant to a November 2012 amendment to the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, we agreed to invest an additional $35 million in Insieme upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of July 27, 2013, we owned approximately 84% of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements.66Table of ContentsIn connection with this investment, we have entered into a put/call option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme.  In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events.  If we acquire the remaining interests of Insieme, the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. We will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned, which may occur in the first half of fiscal 2014.  When such a determination is made, the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned, pursuant to a vesting schedule. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense. The maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $863 million. This amount was increased from a previous maximum of $750 million as a result of the November 2012 amendment, as the parties recognized that higher staffing levels may be necessary to perform additional product development. The milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2013 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.VCE is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with EMC Corporation (“EMC”), with investments from VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) and Intel Corporation. VCE helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware to enable the transformation to cloud computing.  As of July 27, 2013, our cumulative gross investment in VCE was approximately $507 million, inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35%. During fiscal 2013, we invested approximately $93 million in VCE.  We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method, and our portion of VCE’s net loss is recognized in other income (loss), net.  As of July 27, 2013, we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from VCE of $422 million. Our carrying value in VCE as of July 27, 2013 was $85 million. Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we expect that we will make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership.From time to time, EMC and Cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of VCE to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. Such guarantees were not material as of July 27, 2013.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Securities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2013 and 2012 was $0.7 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, pending acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for capital resources.  67Table of Contents
