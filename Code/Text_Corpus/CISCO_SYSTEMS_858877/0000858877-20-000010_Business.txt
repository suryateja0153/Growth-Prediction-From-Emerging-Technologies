Business.”Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 (in millions):   Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019Cash and cash equivalents and investments $29,419 $33,413Cash provided by operating activities $15,426 $15,831Deferred revenue $20,446 $18,467Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $2,619 $20,577Dividends  $6,016 $5,979Inventories $1,282 $1,38335Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2020. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 36Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $72.8 billion for the Americas, $51.6 billion for EMEA, and $31.3 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 19.7%, 20.2%, and 99.2% in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recorded a total tax charge of $11.3 billion, consisting of $9 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement as a result of the Tax Act. 37Table of ContentsSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 37 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on September 5, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.cisco.com. RevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019  July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent (1)Revenue:          Product $35,978 $39,005 $36,709 $(3,027) (8)%Percentage of revenue 73.0% 75.1% 74.4%    Service 13,323 12,899 12,621 424 3 %Percentage of revenue 27.0% 24.9% 25.6%    Total $49,301 $51,904 $49,330 $(2,603) (5)%(1) Total revenue and product revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year decreased 5% and 7%, respectively. Service revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year increased 3%. We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019  July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue:          Americas $29,291 $30,927 $29,070 $(1,636) (5)%Percentage of revenue 59.4% 59.6% 58.9%    EMEA 12,659 13,100 12,425 (441) (3)%Percentage of revenue 25.7% 25.2% 25.2%    APJC 7,352 7,877 7,834 (525) (7)%Percentage of revenue 14.9% 15.2% 15.9%    Total $49,301 $51,904 $49,330 $(2,603) (5)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Product revenue decreased by 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. Our total revenue reflected declines across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 25% product revenue decline, with decreases in India, China, Mexico and Brazil.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. 39Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019  July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue:          Americas $21,006 $22,754 $21,088 $(1,748) (8)%Percentage of product revenue 58.4% 58.3% 57.5%    EMEA 9,647 10,246 9,671 (599) (6)%Percentage of product revenue 26.8% 26.3% 26.3%    APJC 5,326 6,005 5,950 (679) (11)%Percentage of product revenue 14.8% 15.4% 16.2%    Total $35,978 $39,005 $36,709 $(3,027) (8)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. AmericasProduct revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 8%. The product revenue decrease was across all of our customer segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 7% in the United States, 13% in Canada, 27% in Mexico and 14% in Brazil. EMEAThe decrease in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 6% was driven by declines in the service provider, commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by growth in the public sector market. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 4%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, decreased by 6%. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in the United Kingdom and France by 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 2% in Germany.APJCProduct revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 11%, driven by declines across all of our customer segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in Australia, India and China by 16%, 29% and 34%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 8% in Japan.40Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. We report our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Products. This aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019  July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue:          Infrastructure Platforms $27,122 $30,099 $28,286 $(2,977) (10)%Applications 5,568 5,803 5,036 (235) (4)%Security 3,154 2,821 2,388 333 12 %Other Products 135 281 999 (146) (52)%Total $35,978 $39,005 $36,709 $(3,027) (8)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Infrastructure PlatformsThe Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue decreased by 10%, or $3.0 billion. This was the product area most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the second half of fiscal 2020. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had revenue growth in our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series. We experienced a decrease in sales of routing products, with declines primarily in the service provider and enterprise markets. Revenue from wireless products declined, although we saw revenue growth in our Meraki and WiFi6 products. Revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products.ApplicationsThe Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category decreased by 4%, or $235 million, with a decline in Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence partially offset by double digit growth in AppDynamics and growth in IoT software offerings and Webex.SecurityRevenue in our Security product category increased 12%, or $333 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. Revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings.Other ProductsThe decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the SPVSS business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.41Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019Years EndedJuly 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue:         Americas$8,285 $8,173 $7,982 $112 1%Percentage of service revenue62.2% 63.4% 63.3%    EMEA3,012 2,854 2,754 158 6%Percentage of service revenue22.6% 22.1% 21.8%    APJC2,026 1,872 1,885 154 8%Percentage of service revenue15.2% 14.5% 14.9%    Total$13,323 $12,899 $12,621 $424 3%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

Gross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Gross margin:           Product$22,779 $24,142 $22,282 63.3% 61.9% 60.7%Service8,904 8,524 8,324 66.8% 66.1% 66.0%Total$31,683 $32,666 $30,606 64.3% 62.9% 62.0%Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020:  Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2019 61.9 %Productivity (1) 1.9 %Product pricing (1.3)%Mix of products sold 0.9 %Impact from divestiture of SPVSS business 0.1 %Others (0.2)%Fiscal 2020 63.3 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points driven by productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing. In the second half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we incurred additional logistics costs, such as freight which had a negative impact on product gross margin. Our product gross margin benefited slightly from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency 42Table of Contentsin manufacturing operations. The negative pricing impact, which was higher than the year-over-year impact we experienced in fiscal 2019, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments. The favorable product mix impact was driven by impacts from each of our product categories. Service Gross MarginOur service gross margin percentage increased by 0.7 percentage point primarily due to higher sales volume.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Gross margin:            Americas $19,547 $20,338 $18,792 66.7% 65.8% 64.6%EMEA 8,304 8,457 7,945 65.6% 64.6% 63.9%APJC 4,688 4,683 4,726 63.8% 59.5% 60.3%Segment total 32,538 33,479 31,463 66.0% 64.5% 63.8%Unallocated corporate items (1) (855) (813) (857)      Total $31,683 $32,666 $30,606 64.3% 62.9% 62.0% (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. Product gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the gross margin in this geographic segment.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. 43Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):  Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019  July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,347 $6,577 $6,332 $(230) (3)%Percentage of revenue 12.9% 12.7% 12.8%    Sales and marketing 9,169 9,571 9,242 (402) (4)%Percentage of revenue 18.6% 18.4% 18.7%    General and administrative 1,925 1,827 2,144 98 5 %Percentage of revenue 3.9% 3.5% 4.3%    Total $17,441 $17,975 $17,718 $(534) (3)%Percentage of revenue 35.4% 34.6% 35.9%    R&D ExpensesR&D expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower contracted services spending, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D.  Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary spending and contracted services spending.G&A ExpensesG&A expenses increased due to the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista Networks, Inc. (“Arista”) in fiscal 2019 and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of property that had been held for sale, lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services spending, and lower share-based compensation expense. Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, compared with fiscal 2019.  Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Amortization of purchased intangible assets:      Cost of sales $659 $624 $640Operating expenses 141 150 221Total $800 $774 $861The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.44Table of ContentsRestructuring and Other ChargesIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan, which includes a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $900 million. We expect the plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021 and estimate it will generate cost savings of approximately $1.0 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters.The following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions):Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses $481 $322 $358We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $255 million during fiscal 2020. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021.We incurred total restructuring and other charges of $481 million in fiscal 2020. We incurred charges of $255 million related to the restructuring plan initiated
