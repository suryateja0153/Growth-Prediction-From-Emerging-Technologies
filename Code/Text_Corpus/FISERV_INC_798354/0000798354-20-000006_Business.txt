GBS revenues and earnings are impacted by the number of transactions and payment volume, the mix of consumer use of credit and debit cards and the size of the merchant or other business client.Global Financial Solutions (“GFS”)The businesses within GFS provide financial institutions, which include bank and non-bank issuers such as retailers with proprietary card portfolios, with a broad range of technology solutions that enable them to offer financial products and solutions to their customers.

Financial institutions and other companies have increasingly relied on third-party providers for those products and services, primarily on an outsourced basis. This is driven by the increasing number of payment transactions being completed electronically as our clients’ customers seek the convenience of 24-hour digital access to their financial accounts. Within the Payments segment, we primarily provide electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, account-to-account transfers, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, payments infrastructure services and other electronic payments software and services.

By licensing software from third parties or outsourcing their processing requirements by contracting with third-party processors, financial institutions are typically able to reduce costs and enhance their products, services, capacity and capabilities. For example, the licensing of software reduces the need for costly technical expertise within a financial institution, and outsourcing processing operations reduces the infrastructure and other costs required to operate systems internally. Within the Financial segment, we provide financial institutions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Many of the products and services that we sell are integrated with solutions from our Payments segment such as electronic bill payment and presentment, internet and mobile banking, debit processing and network services, and person-to-person payments. Our products and services in the Financial segment include:Account ProcessingWe provide account servicing and management technology products and services to our depository institution clients, as well as a range of integrated, value-added banking products and services.

These solutions also include extensive security, report generation and other features that financial institutions need to process transactions for their customers, as well as to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations. Although many of our clients contract to obtain a majority of their processing requirements from us, our software design allows clients to start with one application and, as needed, add applications and features developed by us or by third parties. We support a broad range of client-owned peripheral devices manufactured by a variety of vendors, which reduce a new client’s initial conversion expenses, enhance existing clients’ ability to change technology and broaden our market opportunity.The principal account processing solutions used by our bank clients are Cleartouch®, DNA®, Precision®, Premier® and Signature®.

We seek to be an innovation leader, utilizing our assets and capabilities to be at the forefront of our industry and enable our clients to deliver best-in-class results.Servicing the MarketThe financial technology industry is highly dynamic, with new innovations entering the market and driving the expectations of our clients globally. The markets for our solutions have specific needs and requirements, with strong emphasis placed by clients on quality, security, service reliability, timely introduction of new capabilities and features, flexibility and value. This requires us to continue our strong emphasis on solution development to meet and exceed the specific needs of our clients.

In developing our products, we use current software development principles, such as service-oriented architecture, to create efficiencies, and we stress interaction with and responsiveness to the needs of our clients.Intellectual PropertyWe regard our software, transaction processing services and related products as proprietary, and we use a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, internal security practices and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property assets. Our patents cover innovations relating to numerous financial software products and services, and we continue, where appropriate, to seek and secure patents with respect to our ongoing innovations. We believe that we possess all proprietary rights necessary to conduct our business.CompetitionThe market for technology products and services in the financial industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other vendors of financial services technology, data processing affiliates of large companies, and processing centers owned and operated as user cooperatives. Outside the U.S., our primary competitors include global and local IT product and services companies, as well as payment service providers and processors. We expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand their product lines and services. Some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do and have substantial flexibility in competing with us, including through the use of integrated product offerings and through pricing. Competitive factors for our business include product quality, security, breadth of features and functionality, integration with other product lines, global reach, multiple distribution channels, service reliability, timely introduction of new products and features, platform scalability and flexibility and value. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Additional information about competition in our segments is provided below.First DataThe businesses in our First Data segment compete with merchant acquirers, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS”) and Global Payments Inc. (“Global Payments”), as well as with financial institutions that provide acquiring and processing services to businesses on their own, such as Paymentech, LLC (“Paymentech”) , Elavon Inc. (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp) and Barclaycard. In many cases, our alliance and commercial partners compete against each other. Additionally, payment networks such as Visa Inc. (“Visa”) and Mastercard Incorporated (“Mastercard”) are increasingly offering products and services that compete with our suite of merchant acquiring solutions. We also compete with card issuer processors, such as Global Payments, FIS and Worldline SA, the card issuer processing businesses of the global payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, as well as various software or custom designed solutions that some financial institutions use to perform these services in-house. We compete with networks such as Visa, Mastercard and Discover Financial Services, Inc. for debit network services, and with FIS for debit network and check verification and guarantee services.PaymentsThe businesses in our Payments segment compete with a number of traditional and emerging competitors that provide a wide range of POS and non-POS payments solutions. Existing and potential financial institution and biller clients could also develop and use their own in-house systems instead of our products and services. In addition, many companies that provide solutions to the financial services industry are consolidating, creating larger competitors with greater resources and broader product lines.FinancialOur products and services in the Financial segment compete in several different market segments and geographies, including with large, diversified software and service companies and independent suppliers of software products. Existing and potential financial institution clients could also develop and use their own in-house systems. In addition, we compete with vendors that offer similar transaction processing products and services to financial institutions, including Computer Services, Inc., Finastra Limited, FIS, Infosys Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation, Jack Henry and Associates Inc., NCR Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and Temenos AG.7Table of ContentsGovernment Regulation Our operations, and the products and services that we offer, are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the U.S., and to other rules, such as those promulgated by various payment networks and banking authorities. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of service and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. In addition, we may be required, among other things, to make significant additional investments to comply with such rules and regulations, to modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided, or to limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate. The Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the United States resulted in significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new, independent regulatory agency known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, “federal consumer financial laws,” some of which apply to products and services offered by our clients. The CFPB conducts direct examinations of, and has issued guidance that applies to, “supervised banks and nonbanks” as well as “supervised service providers” like us. Separately, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act: debit interchange rates for card issuers operating in the United States with assets of $10 billion or more have been capped; debit payment card networks are banned from prohibiting an issuer from contracting with any other payment card network that may process an electronic debit transaction involving an issuer’s debit cards; card issuers and payment networks are prohibited from limiting the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any network that can process the transaction; all debit card issuers in the United States are required to participate in at least two unaffiliated debit payment card networks; and network exclusivity arrangements are generally prohibited for prepaid card and healthcare debit card issuers. These Dodd-Frank Act regulations impact our card processing businesses and our clients’ ability to generate revenue.Association and Network Rules.
