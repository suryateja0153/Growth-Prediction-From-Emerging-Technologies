“Risk Factors—We may not have the ability to repurchase the Convertible Debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, or to pay cash upon the conversion of Convertible Debentures; Occurrence of certain events related to our Convertible Debentures might have significant adverse accounting, disclosure, tax, and liquidity implications,” of this Form 10-K. Grants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of December 31, 2012, there are a total of 2.9 million unvested RSUs and outstanding stock options which represent potential dilution of 1.9%. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all RSUs vest and are settled. There were no stock options granted in 2012 or 2011. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and RSU programs; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes. 42Table of Contents
