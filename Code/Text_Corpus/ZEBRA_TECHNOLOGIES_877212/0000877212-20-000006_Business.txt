We provide products and services in approximately 180 countries, with 124 facilities and approximately 8,200 employees worldwide.Through innovative application of our technologies, we are leading an evolution of the traditional AIDC market into EAI, which encompasses solutions that sense information from enterprise assets, including packages moving through a supply chain, equipment in a factory, workers in a warehouse, and shoppers in a store. Operational data from enterprise assets, including status, location, utilization, and preferences, is then analyzed to provide actionable insights. Finally, with the benefits of mobility, these insights can be delivered to the right user at the right time to drive more effective actions. As a result, our solutions and technologies enable enterprises to “sense, analyze, and act” more effectively to improve operational effectiveness and achieve critical business objectives.The evolution of the AIDC market is being driven by strong underlying secular trends in technology. These trends include the internet of things (“IoT”), cloud-based data analytics, and mobility, as well as artificial intelligence and automation. The IoT is enabling a proliferation of smart, connected devices. Newer solutions, which include these smart, connected devices, capture a much broader range of information than is possible with traditional AIDC solutions and communicate this information in real-time. Cloud computing and expanded data analytics are allowing enterprises to make better business decisions through improved timeliness and visibility to information and workflows. While traditional AIDC solutions sporadically capture limited amounts of data and populate static enterprise systems, EAI solutions continuously analyze real-time data from many sources to generate actionable insights. The continued rapid growth of mobile devices and applications are also significantly expanding mobile computing use cases in the enterprise. With this expanded mobility, end-users can consume or act upon dynamic enterprise data and information anytime and anywhere. Computer vision solutions, which enable the automatic extraction and understanding of useful information from a digital image or video, are also driving the expansion of intelligent automation, which leverages our sense-analyze-act framework to improve workflows with or without a human operator.Zebra Technologies Corporation is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as the successor to an Illinois corporation, Data Specialties, Inc., organized in 1969.
