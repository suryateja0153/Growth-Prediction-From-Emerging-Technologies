BusinessThe CompanyWe are a global leader in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (“AIDC”) market. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), barcode printing, and other automation products and services. The Company’s solutions are proven to help our customers and end-users achieve their mission critical strategic business objectives, including improved operational efficiency, optimized workflows, increased asset utilization, and better customer experiences. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of AIDC products, including: mobile computers, barcode scanners, RFID readers, specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification, real-time location systems (“RTLS”), related accessories and supplies, such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables, and utilities and application software. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair and managed services, including cloud-based subscriptions. End-users of our products and services include those in the retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, health care, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, and education industries around the world. We provide 3Table of Contentsour products and services globally through a direct sales force and extensive network of channel partners. We provide products and services in over 170 countries, with approximately 120 facilities and 6,500 employees worldwide.Through innovative application of our technologies, we are leading an evolution of the AIDC market into Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions.  Specifically, EAI encompasses solutions which “sense” information from enterprise assets, including packages moving through a supply chain, equipment in a factory, workers in warehouse, and shoppers in a store. Operational data from enterprise assets, including status, location, utilization, or preferences, is then analyzed to provide actionable insights. Finally, with the benefits of mobility, these insights can be delivered to the right worker at the right time to drive more effective actions. As a result, our solutions and technologies enable enterprises to “sense, analyze, and act” more effectively to improve operational effectiveness and achieve critical business objectives.The evolution of the AIDC market toward a more strategically oriented EAI focus is being driven by strong underlying secular trends in technology. These trends include internet of things (“IoT”), cloud-based data analytics, and mobility.  The IoT is enabling a proliferation of smart, connected devices. EAI solutions, which include these smart, connected devices, capture a much broader range of information than is possible with traditional AIDC solutions and communicate this information in real-time. Cloud computing and expanded data analytics are allowing enterprises to make better business decisions through improved timeliness and visibility to information and workflows. While AIDC solutions sporadically capture limited amounts of data and populate static enterprise systems, EAI solutions continuously analyze real-time data from many sources to generate actionable insights. Finally, the continued rapid growth of mobile devices and applications are significantly expanding mobile computing use cases to levels of near ubiquity in the enterprise. With expanded mobility, end-users are able to consume or act upon dynamic enterprise data and information anytime and anywhere. The broad availability of wireless and internet connectivity also supports the adoption and deployment of the Company’s solutions to enable organizations to collect more data in real-time on the location, movement, and condition of their assets. Acquisition of Enterprise BusinessIn October 2014, the Company acquired the Enterprise business (“Enterprise”), excluding its iDEN or Integrated Digital Enhanced Network Business, from Motorola Solutions, Inc. (“MSI”) for $3.45 billion in cash (the “Acquisition”). Enterprise is an industry leader in mobile computing and advanced data capture technologies and services, which complement the Company’s printing and RFID products. Its products include rugged and enterprise-grade mobile computers, barcode scanners and RFID readers, WLAN solutions, and accessories, software, and services that are associated with these products. Enterprise service revenues include sales arising from maintenance, repair, product support, system installation and integration services, and other services. The Acquisition expanded the Company’s product lines with complementary products that together are employed by customers to obtain greater visibility and insights into their operations. It enables us to deliver end-to-end solutions supporting the IoT in targeted industries. The expanded capabilities of the combined company make us a more valued strategic supplier to end-users, as well as a more important supplier of products and solutions to our channel partners.The Company funded the Acquisition through a combination of cash on hand of $250 million, the sale of 7.25% senior notes due 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion (the “Senior Notes”), and a new credit agreement with various lenders that provided a term loan of $2.2 billion (the “Term Loan”) due 2021. A $250 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) was included as part of the new credit agreement (the Senior Notes and, together with the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, the “Debt Agreements”). Integration of Enterprise BusinessSince closing the Acquisition in October 2014, integration activities by the Company have focused on creating “One Zebra” by integrating the operations of Enterprise with Zebra to create a single business with common sales, service, supply chain, marketing, finance, information technology (“IT”), and other functions. Our priorities have centered on maintaining business continuity while identifying and implementing cost synergies, operating efficiencies, and integration of functional organizations and processes. Another key focus of the integration has been to conclude MSI-provided transition service agreements (“TSAs”) related primarily to IT support services. These TSAs are an interim measure to continue the operations of the Enterprise business without disruption while integration activities are in process. During 2016, significant progress was made in the areas of culture development and integration of IT infrastructure and business systems, including those to support our global network of channel partners and our Asia-Pacific regional operations. These efforts resulted in the elimination of more than 75% of our TSAs, driven by Enterprise IT applications. In addition, the Company consolidated legacy channel programs of the Legacy Zebra and Enterprise businesses that culminated into the launch of the Company’s PartnerConnect channel program in April 2016.4Table of ContentsAdditional business system integration work remains including completion of the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. Until such time that the Company is able to complete its transition to common systems, Legacy Zebra and Enterprise will continue to operate largely on separate systems, including separate ERP systems. The IT integration, when completed, will result in a modernized and right-sized IT network and streamlined business processes. Completion of the IT integration, including a common ERP system, is expected before the end of 2017 and will enable us to terminate the remaining TSAs. As a result of our integration efforts, we expect a more efficient and cost effective IT infrastructure, improved operational efficiency, and reduced operating costs.DispositionsOn October 28, 2016, the Company concluded its Asset Purchase Agreement with Extreme Networks, Inc.
