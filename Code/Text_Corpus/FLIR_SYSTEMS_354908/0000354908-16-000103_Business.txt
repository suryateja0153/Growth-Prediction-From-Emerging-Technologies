International revenue accounted for approximately 47 percent, 49 percent and 50 percent of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue in the future. We have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies. Factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in Europe, significant sales denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the United States dollar, euro, Swedish kronor and British pound sterling. The impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements, and primarily due to the United States dollar strengthening in 2015, there was a meaningful impact on our results of operations in 2015, including a reduction of approximately $63 million in revenue and reductions in the carrying values of our foreign net assets when translated from foreign currencies to United States dollars.We experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles, such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the United States and certain foreign governments, the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations, and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. Such events have resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in quarterly results in the future. As a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.We expect that macroeconomic factors, including reduced spending by United States government agencies and economic weaknesses in certain geographic markets, will continue to present challenges for us and render predictions regarding future performance difficult to make.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, goodwill, warranty obligations, contingencies and income taxes on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.32Revenue recognition.  Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title and risk of loss to the customer as indicated by the contractual terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations.We design, market and sell our products primarily as commercial, off-the-shelf products. Certain customers request different system configurations, generally based on standard options or accessories that we offer. In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria. In those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to shipment. For any contracts with multiple elements (i.e., training, installation, additional parts, etc.) we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each element in the arrangement. If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use an estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements. In addition, judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured.Allowance for doubtful accounts.  Our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer. Where appropriate, we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors. When a customer’s account balance becomes past due, we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business, we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available. Actual write-offs during the past three years have not been material to our results of operations.We also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2015, our accounts receivable balance of $326.1 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $6.9 million. We believe our reported allowances at December 31, 2015 are adequate. If the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate, however, resulting in their inability to make payments, we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made.Inventory.  Our policy is to record inventory write-downs when conditions exist that indicate that our inventories are likely to be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. Purchasing requirements and alternative usages are evaluated within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure. When recorded, our write-downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis. As of December 31, 2015, our inventories of $393.1 million are stated net of inventory write-downs. If actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future.Goodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. We assess goodwill for potential impairment at the reporting unit level during the third quarter of each year, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We may assess qualitative factors to make this determination, or bypass such a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. Qualitative factors we may consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance.  If there are indicators that goodwill has been impaired we proceed to a two-step impairment test, whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. The second step is performed if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded. Our impairment test in the current year did not indicate an impairment of goodwill in any of our reporting units.33Product warranties.  Our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time, generally twelve to twenty-four months, at no cost to our customers. Our policy is to record warranty liabilities at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized. We believe that our recorded liability of $16.5 million at December 31, 2015 is adequate to cover our future cost of materials, labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date. If actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly.Contingencies.  We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals and disclosures should be adjusted.Income taxes.  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized in the future. In making that determination, on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data. Future levels of taxable income are dependent upon, but not limited to, general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control. As of December 31, 2015, we have determined that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $2.6 million is required. If we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded in the period such determination is made.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions, and in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. While we believe the positions we have taken are appropriate, we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that are being challenged or that could be challenged by the tax authorities. We record a benefit on a tax position when we determine that it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained, we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized when it is effectively settled, using information that is available at the reporting date. We review the tax reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as changes in available facts arise that affect our potential liability for additional taxes.34Consolidated Operating ResultsThe following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue: Year Ended December 31,(1) 2015 2014 2013Revenue100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold51.6 51.0 50.7Gross profit48.4 49.0 49.3Operating expenses:     Research and development8.5 9.3 9.9Selling, general and administrative20.1 21.7 21.6Restructuring expenses0.1 1.1 1.7Total operating expenses28.8 32.1 33.2Earnings from operations19.6 16.9 16.1Interest expense0.9 1.0 0.9Interest income(0.1) (0.1) (0.1)Other (income) expense, net(0.8) (0.2) (0.1)Earnings before income taxes19.6 16.3 15.3Income tax provision4.1 3.2 3.5Net earnings15.5 % 13.1 % 11.8 %_______________ (1)Totals may not recompute due to rounding.The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations for 2015, 2014 and 2013. Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level. Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months.35Revenue.  Revenue for 2015 totaled $1,557.1 million, an increase of 1.7 percent from 2014 revenue of $1,530.7 million. Year over year revenue growth was primarily due to increases in our Security and Detection segments, partially offset by declines in our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets, and Maritime segments.  The revenue increase was negatively impacted by year over year changes in foreign currency rates, particularly in our Instruments and Maritime segments.  On a constant currency basis, revenue for 2015 would have been an increase of approximately 5.8 percent over 2014 revenue.Revenue for 2014 totaled $1,530.7 million, an increase of 2.3 percent over 2013 revenue of $1,496.4 million. Most of our operating segments reported increases in year over year revenues.   Revenue from the United States government customers declined by $44.5 million from 2013 to 2014.International revenue in 2015 totaled $734.2 million, representing 47.2 percent of revenue. This compares with international revenue in 2014 which totaled $747.0 million, representing 48.8 percent of revenue, and $740.7 million in 2013, representing 49.5 percent of revenue. While the sales mix between United States and international sales may fluctuate from year to year, we expect revenue from customers outside the United States to continue to comprise a significant portion of our total revenue on a long-term basis.Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $803.5 million and $780.3 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the increase in revenues year over year as discussed above and changes in product mix. Cost of goods sold in 2014 was $780.3 million, compared to cost of goods sold of $759.4 million in 2013. The year over year increase in cost of goods sold primarily relates to the higher year over year revenues and changes in product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, cost of goods sold included $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of inventory write downs related to our restructuring activities.Cost of goods sold includes materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products and services sold in the period as well as warranty costs. Material costs include raw materials, purchased components and sub-assemblies, outside processing and inbound freight costs. Labor and overhead costs consist of direct and indirect manufacturing costs, including wages and fringe benefits, operating supplies, depreciation and amortization, occupancy costs, and purchasing, receiving and inspection costs.Gross profit.  Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $753.6 million compared to $750.4 million in 2014. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased slightly from 49.0 percent in 2014 to 48.4 percent in 2015 primarily due to changes in product mix and the negative impact of year over year changes in foreign currency rates. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $750.4 million compared to $737.0 million in 2013.  Gross margin decreased from 49.3 percent in 2013 to 49.0 percent in 2014. Research and development.  Research and development expenses were $132.9 million, or 8.5 percent of revenue, in 2015, compared to $142.8 million, or 9.3 percent of revenue, in 2014, and $147.7 million, or 9.9 percent of revenue, in 2013. We believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business. We expect research and development expenses to be approximately 8 to 10 percent of revenue on a long-term basis.Selling, general and administrative expenses.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $313.5 million, or 20.1 percent of revenue, in 2015 compared to $332.0 million, or 21.7 percent of revenue, in 2014 and $322.7 million, or 21.6 percent of revenue, in 2013. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $15.6 million decrease in corporate expenses primarily related to 2014 legal expenses incurred for litigation matters and costs of a regulatory settlement.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increases in marketing spending and a $13.8 million increase in corporate expenses due to the 2014 factors previously mentioned. While selling, general and administrative expenses may be affected in the future by acquisitions with different cost structures, we anticipate selling, general and administrative expenses to increase at a slower rate than revenue in our existing businesses.36Restructuring expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $1.4 million, $17.0 million and $27.5 million, respectively. Of the restructuring expenses recorded in 2014, $16.4 million was recorded in operating expenses and $0.6 million was recorded in costs of goods sold.  Of the restructuring expenses recorded in 2013, $25.8 million was recorded in operating expenses and $1.7 million was included in costs of goods sold. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a realignment plan that included closing six not-to-scale sites in the United States and Europe and a transfer of those operations to larger facilities. We also consolidated our optics and laser manufacturing businesses to better realize the benefits of vertical integration in these areas. The benefits from these actions are reflected in our operating results.  As of December 31, 2015, we have completed the majority of the actions in our realignment plan. Interest expense.  Interest expense totaled $14.1 million, $14.6 million and $14.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due September 1, 2016 and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of the notes and the $150 million term loan that was drawn on April 5, 2013.Other (income) expense, net. Other income totaled $12.6 million, $3.5 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in other income during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributed to the gain on the sale of our cost basis investment in a private technology company. Income taxes.  Our income tax provision was $63.8 million, $49.3 million and $52.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 20.9 percent, 19.7 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively. The mix in taxable income between our United States and international operations has a significant impact on our annual income tax provision and effective tax rates. Our effective tax rate is lower than the United States federal tax rate of 35 percent because of lower foreign tax rates, the effect of foreign, federal and state tax credits and other discrete items.  In 2015, the discrete items included a $12.1 million release of a previously recorded tax valuation allowance, and in 2014, the discrete items included a $9.4 million release of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits that were no longer required due to closure of the applicable statute. We expect the effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 26 percent excluding discrete items. At December 31, 2015, we had United States tax net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $4.6 million which expire between 2019 and 2031. In addition, we have various state net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $39.2 million which expire between 2016 and 2033. The federal and state net operating losses were primarily generated by ICx Technologies, Inc. prior to being acquired by us in 2010. Finally, we have various foreign net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $71.1 million, a portion of which expire between 2018 and 2033 and a portion of which have an indefinite carry-forward period.Tax benefits as described above are recorded as assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized. To the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is required to be recorded. As of December 31, 2015, we have determined that a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $2.6 million is required, primarily related to certain acquired net operating losses. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carry-back and carry-forward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies, when evaluating whether the deferred tax assets will be realized.On January 11, 2016, the European Commission announced a decision concluding that certain rules under Belgian tax legislation are deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations on state aid. As a result of this decision, the European Commission has directed the Belgian Government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which the Company expects to impact one of its subsidiaries covering a three-year period which concluded with the expiration of an agreement in July 2015. Negotiations are ongoing between the Belgian Government and the European Commission to agree on a methodology to calculate the applicable amounts for each company impacted by the decision. Although the Company has not received a request for payment or other official notice, the Company has evaluated the potential impact of the European Commission's decision in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," noting the recent decision could significantly increase the Company's unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.  However, due to the ongoing negotiations and uncertainty surrounding the calculation methodology and litigation process, the Company is currently unable to estimate the range of the potential increase.  While the Company is unable to estimate the range of potential impact on unrecognized tax benefits, such impact could be material to the 2016 tax provision.37Segment Operating ResultsWe have six operating segments.  Effective January 1, 2015, the Personal Vision Systems Product line was transferred from the OEM & Emerging Markets segment to the Surveillance segment.  The results for those two segments for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The following discusses the operating results of each of our segments for that three year period.SurveillanceSurveillance operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$503.0 $520.0 $554.6Earnings from operations145.6 127.2 135.6Operating margin29.0% 24.5% 24.4%Backlog309 297 282Surveillance revenue decreased by 3.3 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the continued reductions in demand from United States government funded customers and decreases in airborne and integrated systems product line revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenues in the land product line. Earnings from operations increased by 14.5 percent primarily due to lower operating expenses and higher gross margins, partially offset by the decrease in revenues.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, Surveillance had restructuring charges of $0.2 million, compared to $5.2 million in 2014.Revenue decreased by 6.2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the reductions in demand from United States government funded customers.  Earnings from operations decreased by 6.1 percent primarily due to the lower revenues, partially offset by cost savings generated as a result of restructuring activities.  In 2013, Surveillance had restructuring charges of $5.4 million.InstrumentsInstruments operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Revenue$347.5 $354.1 $337.5Earnings from operations112.4 99.0 81.1Operating margin32.3% 27.9% 24.0%Backlog27 35 27Instruments segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by 1.9 percent compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The year over year decrease in revenue was primarily due to a revenue decline in the Americas region, partially offset by an increase in the Asia Pacific region; on a product line basis, declines in our higher end thermography and in our optical gas imaging product lines were partially offset by increases in our science, test and measurement, and fire product lines.  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were also negatively impacted by year over year changes in currency exchange rates.  On a constant currency basis, Instruments revenues in 2015 increased by 4.9 percent compared to 2014. The increase in earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to lower restructuring expenses and costs savings associated with restructuring activities.  As a large portion of segment expenses are incurred in Europe, the segment experienced a favorable impact on its operating expenses from the changes in foreign currency rates which largely offset the associated decline in revenues in that region.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, Instrument had restructuring charges of $1.2 million compared to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.38Instruments segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 4.9 percent, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.  The year over year increase in revenue is primarily due to increased deliveries in most geographic regions and across most product lines, particularly for products introduced late in 2013 and in 2014.  The increase in earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher revenues, lower restructuring expenses and cost savings generated from those restructuring activities.  During 2013, the segment incurred restructuring charges of $15.5 million. SecuritySecurity operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Revenue$226.6 $179.1 $141.0Earnings from operations28.1 24.9 17.3Operating margin12.4% 13.9% 12.3%Backlog16 18 10Security segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 26.5 percent over the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased deliveries across all product families and in the Americas and Europe geographic regions.  The increase of earnings from operations of 13.1 percent was primarily due to the increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in sales and marketing support operating expenses. Security segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 27.0 percent compared to the prior year primarily due to increased deliveries in all product families and expanded distribution.  The increase in earnings from operations in 2014 of 43.4 percent over 2013 was primarily due to the increase in year over year revenues, partially offset by increased marketing, customer technical support and product development expenses.  The increase in backlog was primarily due to an increase in orders from international customers which often have longer delivery times.  OEM & Emerging MarketsOEM & Emerging Markets operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013   (as reclassified) (as reclassified)Revenue$186.7 $199.1 $184.0Earnings from operations41.1 50.2 39.3Operating margin22.0% 25.2% 21.3%Backlog140 129 129OEM & Emerging Markets segment revenue decreased by 6.2 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the loss of approximately $8.8 million in 2014 revenue from our former optical components group which was sold in August 2014 and the negative impacts of changes in currency exchange rates.  Earnings from operations declined in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the decrease in revenue and lower gross margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.Revenue increased by 8.2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to increased deliveries to customers in the United States, particularly of uncooled camera cores and newly introduced mobile accessories.  Earnings from operations increased by 28.0 percent due to the increase in revenues and cost savings from restructuring activities. 39MaritimeMaritime operating results are as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Revenue$177.9 $192.6 $189.1Earnings from operations13.6 24.5 22.3Operating margin7.6% 12.7% 11.8%Backlog28 17 11Maritime segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by 7.6 percent compared to 2014 primarily due to the negative impact of year over year changes in currency exchange rates in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions.  On a constant currency basis, 2015 revenue increased by 2.2 percent compared to 2014.  Since the majority of the segment's costs of goods sold are incurred in United States dollars, those costs did not receive the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates.  Consequently, the decrease in earnings from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the revenue decline. Maritime segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 1.9 percent compared
