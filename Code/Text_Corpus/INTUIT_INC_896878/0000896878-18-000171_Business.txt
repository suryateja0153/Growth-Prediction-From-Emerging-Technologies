Our customers include consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed. Working with a broad array of vital partners – accountants, developers, financial institutions, schools, governments and other platform companies, such as Apple and Google – we strive to deliver three benefits that matter most to our customers:•Helping consumers save money, and enabling small businesses and the self-employed to grow and prosper.•Turning drudgery into time for what matters most.•Providing peace of mind when making financial or compliance decisions.We build durable competitive advantage by delivering personalized experiences via our trusted open platform that builds connections between customers, partners and products, as described in our Growth Strategy below.       Intuit Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K 4                  Tables of ContentsOur Business PortfolioWe organize our businesses into three reportable segments: Small Business & Self-Employed:  This segment targets small businesses and the self-employed around the globe, and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them. Our offerings include QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses. Consumer:  This segment targets consumers and includes do-it-yourself and assisted TurboTax income tax preparation products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada. Our Mint and Turbo offerings target consumers and help them understand and improve their financial lives by offering a view of their financial health.Strategic Partner:  This segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online.  Our Growth StrategyAt Intuit, our strategy starts with a focus on our customers. We listen to our customers, understand their challenges, and then use technology to develop innovative solutions designed to solve their problems and help them prosper. For more than three decades, we have reinvented and disrupted ourselves to better serve our customers, as we continue to transform to a global platform and product company. Our assessment of external trends – the emergence and influence of the digital generation, and the growth in the self-employed workforce – reveals significant opportunities to drive future growth. The result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are manual in nature to more automated, interconnected services that work on platforms and increasingly rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our strategy is built on the strength of our One Intuit Ecosystem, a connected, one-stop destination for customers to make their financial lives easier. Our evolving strategy focuses on three elements: •Personalized experiences: With customer provided data and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can create increasingly valuable personalized and easy to use experiences that delight and serve our customers. For example, our TurboTax solutions use machine learning to create a customized interview, asking questions uniquely tailored to each individual situation. By delivering an amazing end-to-end experience, we offer customers the value they expect from our offerings as quickly and easily as possible.•Trusted open platform: Our open platform allows our customers to use and share their financial data with us and third party partners to help improve their financial lives. One example of this is our QuickBooks open platform, where small businesses and accountants can install apps created by third-party developers to enhance the functionality and personalization of the QuickBooks experience.•Indispensable connections: Within our One Intuit Ecosystem, we strive to build connections between customers, partners, and products on our platform. For example, our TurboTax Live offering connects our TurboTax customers with tax experts. Additionally, QuickBooks offers a match-making service that connects small businesses with accountants, helping small businesses succeed and accountants grow their practices.As part of our strategy, we also develop relationships with strategic partners that enable us to serve consumers, the self-employed and small businesses globally. Strategic partners include financial institutions, enterprise platforms, educational institutions and accountants, and our strategy allows us to co-create indispensable connections by sharing expertise, product integrations, and new solutions to solve more customer problems.We are well positioned to succeed in this evolving environment with our online service offerings. Our total service and other revenue was $4.5 billion, or 75 percent, of our total revenue in fiscal 2018.SummaryAs the external environment evolves, we adapt our strategy to meet these changes. Our commitment remains consistent and has been our success formula for more than 30 years: a focus on developing innovative financial and compliance products and services that are easy to use and are available where and when customers need them. As a result, our customers actively recommend our products and solutions to others, which is one important way that we measure the success of our strategy.      Intuit Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K 5                  Tables of ContentsPRODUCTS AND SERVICESDuring fiscal 2018 we offered our products and services in the three segments described in “Business Overview” above.

A growing number of companies offer applications built for our QuickBooks platform, including PayPal, Shopify, Square, and Bill.com. In addition to our core QuickBooks offering, we also offer specific solutions for the following customer segments:•Enterprise. Our QuickBooks Enterprise and QuickBooks Advanced offerings are designed for larger small businesses that have outgrown our QuickBooks product.

The financing process provides small businesses the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital.  ConsumerOur TurboTax products and services are designed to enable individuals to prepare and file their own federal and state personal income tax returns quickly and accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. Most of these offerings are available on both desktop and mobile devices.Tax Return Preparation Offerings. For the 2017 tax season, we offered a range of software products and services that included TurboTax Basic, for simple returns; TurboTax Deluxe, for taxpayers who itemize deductions; TurboTax Premier, for taxpayers who own investments or rental property; and TurboTax Home and Business and TurboTax Self-Employed, for small business owners. We also offered TurboTax Free Edition for the simplest returns. We launched a new offering in the 2017 tax season, TurboTax Live, which provides live tax advice to customers. TurboTax AnswerXchange is an online forum where participants can learn from and share information with other users while preparing their income tax returns. For the 2017 tax season, our online tax preparation and filing services were offered through the websites of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. Our TurboTax U.S. and Canada offerings consist of desktop, online, and mobile offerings.Electronic Filing and Other Services.

We also offered audit defense, audit support, identity restoration services, and credit scores.Intuit Tax Freedom Project. Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, we provide online federal and state income tax return preparation and electronic filing services at no charge to eligible taxpayers. For the 2017 tax season, we provided approximately 1.2 million free federal returns under this initiative. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government to provide free online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible taxpayers. See also “Competition – Consumer Segment” later in this Item 1 for more information on the Free File Alliance.Other Consumer Offerings. Our Mint and Turbo offerings target consumers and help them understand and improve their financial lives by offering a view of their financial health.Strategic PartnerOur Strategic Partner segment includes our professional tax offerings and targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online and enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of consumer, small business, and commercial federal and state tax returns with both desktop and online offerings.

We also offer a variety of tax-related services that complement the tax return preparation process including year-round document storage and access, collaboration services, e-signature, and bank products.PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTSince the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.We develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.      Intuit Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K 7                  Tables of ContentsWhile our traditional desktop software products – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, and ProSeries – tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles, as we move to more online offerings and mobile applications, the development cycles are becoming more rapid. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including new mobile and global offerings, and significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings. Our research and development expenses were $1.2 billion or 20% of total net revenue in fiscal 2018; $998 million or 19% of total net revenue in fiscal 2017; and $881 million or 19% of total net revenue in fiscal 2016.SEASONALITYOur Consumer offerings have significant seasonal patterns. As a result, during each of the last three fiscal years the total consolidated revenue for our third quarter ended April 30 has represented nearly half of our annual total consolidated revenue for those years. We expect the seasonality of our Consumer business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELSMarkets Our primary target customers are consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed. We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners to help us reach small business customers. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the widespread usage of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.Real-time, personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods, and other changes in the way we do business.Marketing ProgramsWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; mobile marketing through online app stores; email marketing; offline marketing such as TV, radio, billboard, magazine and newspaper advertising; retail marketing; public relations; and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross sell additional offerings.Sales and Distribution ChannelsMulti-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers use the web and mobile devices to research products and services. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices. Others research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy model.Direct Sales Channel. We sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers. Direct, online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, via other online content or word of mouth recommendations. Telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions.      Intuit Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K 8                  Tables of ContentsRetail Channel. We sell our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the United States and on retailer websites. We sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores, warehouse clubs, consumer electronics retailers, general mass merchandisers, online retailers, and catalogs. In Canada, we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel. The retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailer-sponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot and online traffic. This channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products, services, and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost.Mobile Application Stores.  We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. These include the Apple App Store, which provides apps for the Apple iPhone and iPad, and Google’s Play Store, which provides apps for Android-compatible smartphones and tablets. Other Channels. We sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners and accountants that help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. Solution providers combine our products and services with value-added marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. As we expand our mobile and global offerings, we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business. COMPETITIONOverviewWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete. This is particularly true for online and mobile products and services, where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services. To attract customers, many online and mobile competitors are offering free or low-priced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies.Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours. However, for many of our products and services, other important competitive alternatives for customers are third-party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses. Manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software, are also important competitive alternatives. Competition Specific to SegmentsSmall Business & Self-Employed Segment. QuickBooks is the leading small business financial management software in the U.S. Our small business desktop products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as The Sage Group plc, which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers. Our small business online products and services face competition from online accounting offerings from companies such as Xero and FreshBooks, free or low-cost online accounting offerings, and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others. In our payroll business we compete directly with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Paychex, Gusto, and many other companies with payroll offerings, including online payroll offerings. In our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America and with many payment processors, including First Data Corporation, Elavon, Global Payments, Fidelity National Information Services, PayPal, and Square. Consumer Segment. In our Consumer segment, our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the self-preparation tax category or to our new assisted offering, TurboTax Live, from tax stores and other tax preparers. In the U.S. private sector we face intense competition from H&R Block, which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering. We also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers, from a myriad of small tax preparers, and from numerous online self-preparation offerings, including Blucora’s TaxAct and Credit Karma. Some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers. In Canada, our TurboTax Canada offerings face competition from H&R Block, SimpleTax, StudioTax, and UFile. These competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the U.S. and Canada.We also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government. Under this agreement, the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users, and the federal government has agreed not to provide a duplicative or competing service. Approximately 23 states have also adopted Free File Alliance public-private agreements while approximately 19 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services with no fees to qualified taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support successful public-private partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system. However, future administrative, regulatory, or       Intuit Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K 9                  Tables of Contentslegislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation by government agencies which could harm our Consumer business.Strategic Partner Segment. In the U.S., Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax functionality. These include CCH’s ProSystems fx Office Suite and Thomson Reuters’ CS Professional Suite and GoSystems Tax. Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s ATX and TaxWise offerings, Drake, and other smaller providers. In Canada, our ProFile professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s Cantax and Taxprep offerings, TaxCycle, and Thomson Reuters’ DTMax and UFile Pro offerings. We also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the U.S. and Canada, which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals.Competitive FactorsWe believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, and ProSeries – are ease of use, product features, size of the installed customer base, brand name recognition, value proposition, cost, reliability, security, and product and support quality. Access to distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software products. In addition, support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our QuickBooks products. Productivity is an important competitive factor for the full-service accounting firms to which we market our Lacerte software products. We believe
