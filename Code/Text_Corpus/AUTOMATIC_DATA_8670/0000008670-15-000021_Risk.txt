Risk Factors," should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Employers around the world rely on us for cloud-based solutions and services to help manage their most important asset - their people.  We embrace new technology and innovation to deliver exceptional products and services that meet the needs of our clients across all of our markets.  Our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients, whether a small, midsized or large organization in one or multiple countries.  We believe our success in human capital management ("HCM") requires deep expertise and outstanding service to help our clients not just manage their employees, but build better workforces. Our business strategy is based on strategic pillars, which are predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence, and attract, build, and retain the right talent to position ADP as the global market leader in HCM services.  Our strategic pillars are to:•grow a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions;•invest to grow and scale our HR Business Process Outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and•leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM solutions where they do business.19During the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015"), we more narrowly focused our attention on our global HCM strategy and our results continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model and our success in the market.  The increased focus is evidenced by the separation of our former Dealer Services business into its own independent, publicly traded company called CDK Global, Inc. ("CDK") on September 30, 2014 and our investments in product innovation and our salesforce.  Our increased focus on product development, the high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the United States of America ("U.S."), led our salesforce to deliver exceptionally strong new business bookings, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients in Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") Services.  We are pleased with the financial performance of our business segments which have driven solid organic revenue growth and pretax margin expansion.  This was achieved despite pressure on Employer Services revenues from foreign currency translation, margin pressure from our high-margin client funds interest revenue (which grew at a slower rate than overall revenue), and increased selling expenses which were driven by an exceptionally strong new business booking performance.  Revenue retention remains at record levels and we continue to benefit from the strength of the pays per control in our client base, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of the U.S. geographic regions. Consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015 increased 7%, to $10,938.5 million, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 ("fiscal 2014").  Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10%, to $2,070.7 million, as compared to fiscal 2014 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, to $1,376.5 million, as compared to fiscal 2014.  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12% to $2.89 in fiscal 2015, as compared to $2.57 in fiscal 2014.Despite pressure from foreign currency translation and higher selling expenses to support our exceptionally strong new business bookings in our Employer Services segment, our business segment results were solid. Employer Services' revenues increased 5% to $8,897.3 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 7% to $2,694.2 million. PEO Services' revenues increasing 17% to $2,647.2 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 30% to $303.6 million in fiscal 2015.  Total new business bookings grew 13% worldwide to over $1.6 billion in fiscal 2015. Our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model, with our Employer Services' worldwide client revenue retention rate remaining strong at 91.4% and our pays per control increasing 3.0% in fiscal 2015.  Although interest on funds held for clients increased for the first time in seven years, to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $373.4 million in fiscal 2014, we still felt the pressure from declining interest rates on our client funds investment portfolio.  This decline in the average interest rate earned to 1.7% in fiscal 2015, as compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2014, was more than offset by growth in average client funds balances of 5% resulting from the continued strength and growth of our Employer Services segment. We invest our funds held for clients in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines, where the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. The portfolio is predominantly invested in AAA/AA rated fixed-income securities. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.  Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2015, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.7 billion. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,905.6 million in fiscal 2015, as compared to $1,821.4 million in fiscal 2014.  This increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was due to the sale of notes receivable related to our Dealer Services financing arrangements and lower pension contributions.  The change in cash used in investing activities of $4,573.6 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, partially offset by the receipt of an $825.0 million tax-free dividend received from CDK in connection with the spin-off earlier this fiscal year.  The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $3,974.9 million is primarily due to the net change in client fund obligations, partially offset by the timing of cash received and repaid under our commercial paper issuances and an increase in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2015.We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues with strong client retention, good margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, and low capital expenditure requirements.  We continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2015 paid dividends of $927.6 million and returned $1,557.2 million in cash through our share buyback program. These share repurchases were partially funded by the $825.0 million dividend we received 20from CDK earlier this fiscal year.  In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced our common stock outstanding by approximately 5% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs.  We have also raised the quarterly dividend per share for 40 consecutive years.

Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and PEO Services.  For fiscal 2015, total revenue was negatively impacted two percentage points by unfavorable foreign currency translation.Total revenues in fiscal 2015 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.7 million, as compared to $373.4 million in fiscal 2014.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average client funds balance of 5%, to $21.8 billion in fiscal 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.7% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2014.  Total interest on funds held for clients was impacted one percentage point from unfavorable foreign currency translation. Total ExpensesTotal expenses increased 6% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased costs to service our expanding client base and support our growing revenue.  Total expenses also increased due to additional investments in product innovation and expenses directly related to the increase in new business bookings.  For fiscal 2015, our total expense growth decreased two percentage points from foreign currency translation.Operating expenses include the costs directly attributable to servicing our clients.  Additionally, operating expenses include PEO Services pass-through costs that are re-billable and which include costs for benefits coverage, workers’ compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  These pass-through costs were $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,627.1 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $388.8 million.  These pass-through costs were $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,383.3 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $352.7 million. Systems development and programming costs increased $44.2 million in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to increased investment and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $126.6 million due to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced traction from our increased focus on product development, high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA, improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the U.S., partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.22Other Income, net       (In millions)      Years ended June 30, 2015 2014 $ ChangeInterest income on corporate funds $(56.9) $(53.7) $3.2Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (6.8) (20.4) (13.6)Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 1.9 3.9 2.0Gain on sale of notes receivable (1.4) — 1.4Other income, net $(63.2) $(70.2) $(7.0)Other income, net in fiscal 2015 includes a $1.4 million gain on the sale of notes receivable related to our Dealer Services financing agreements. The increase in interest income on corporate funds resulted from higher average daily corporate funds, which increased from $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014 to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2015, partially offset by lower average interest rates of 1.3% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 1.4% in fiscal 2014. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10% due to increases in revenues and expenses discussed above and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point.  Overall margin increased from 18.4% in fiscal 2014 to 18.9% in fiscal 2015.  This increase was due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing slower than our revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher selling expenses to support our new business bookings. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 33.5% and 33.9%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to adjustments to the tax liability, the usage of foreign tax credits in a planned repatriation of foreign earnings, and a change in the tax law during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2014.Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased 11% on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate, as described above.  Net earnings from continuing operations growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point by foreign currency translation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12% to $2.89 in fiscal 2015, as compared to $2.57 in fiscal 2014.  Diluted earnings per share growth was unfavorably impacted $0.04 due to foreign currency translation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 18.2 million shares in fiscal 2015 and 9.0 million shares in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Total RevenuesOur total revenues increased $784.4 million, or 8%, to $10,226.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 8%, or $607.0 million, to $8,506.0 million and PEO Services of 15%, or $297.7 million, to $2,270.9 million. Total revenues for fiscal 2014 include interest on funds held for clients of $373.4 million, as compared to $420.4 million in fiscal 2013.  The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.8% during fiscal 2014, as compared to 2.2% for fiscal 2013, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 8%, to $20.7 billion in fiscal 2014.  23Total ExpensesOur total expenses increased $591.1 million, or 8%, to $8,417.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The increase in our total expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $407.2 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $169.9 million, and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $54.6 million, partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge of $42.7 million in fiscal 2013.Our total costs of revenues increased 8%, to $6,041.0 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to an increase in operating expenses of $407.2 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $54.6 million.Operating expenses increased $407.2 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass-through costs that are re-billable and which include costs for benefits coverage, workers’ compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  These pass-through costs were $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,383.3 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $352.7 million. These pass-through costs were $1,513.5 million for fiscal 2013, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,193.2 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $320.3 million.  The increase in operating expenses is also due to higher labor-related expenses in Employer Services of $65.9 million, as compared to fiscal 2013. Systems development and programming costs increased $54.6 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $169.9 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The increase in expenses was related to an increase in selling expenses of $81.8 million resulting from investments in our salesforce, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $35.1 million, and $15.9 million higher severance expenses in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.

The decrease was due to a decrease in realized gains on available-for-sale securities of $11.7 million and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $9.2 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted from lower average interest rates of 1.5% in fiscal 2013 to 1.4% in fiscal 2014 and lower average daily corporate funds, which decreased from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014.  In addition, we recognized gains of $2.2 million pertaining to the sale of two buildings during fiscal 2013. 24Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $169.1 million, or 10%, to $1,879.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $1,710.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013.  Overall margin increased approximately 30 basis points from 18.1% in fiscal 2013 to 18.4% in fiscal 2014.  This increase was due to margin improvements in our business segments, partially offset by approximately 80 basis points of margin decline related to the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients discussed above and 30 basis points of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs.  Overall margin in fiscal 2014 also benefited approximately 50 basis points from the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013.  Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesAdjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $126.4 million, or 7%, to $1,879.2 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,752.8 million for fiscal 2013 due to increased revenue and margin improvement in our business segments, partially offset by the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients.  Margin, adjusted for the the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge related to our ADP AdvancedMD business, decreased 20 basis points from 18.6% to 18.4%.  Margin improvements in our business segments were offset primarily by approximately 80 basis points of margin decrease related to the continued decline in interest on fund held for clients discussed above and 30 basis points of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rates in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were 33.9% and 34.4%, respectively.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 includes the effect of a non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $42.7 million that increased our effective tax rate by 0.8 percentage points percentage points in the period.  The remaining increase is due to an increase in foreign taxes and reduced foreign tax credits available, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters.Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased $120.4 million, or 11%, to $1,242.6 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $1,122.2 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.57 in fiscal 2014, as compared to $2.30 in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations    Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased $77.7 million, or 7%, to $1,242.6 million, in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,164.9 million for fiscal 2013, and the adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 8%, to $2.57 for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.39 for fiscal 2013.  The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 reflects the increase in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.25ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTSRevenues from Continuing Operations(In millions)  Years ended June 30, $ Change % Change  2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2015 2014Employer Services $8,897.3 $8,506.0$7,899.0 $391.3 $607.0 5% 8%PEO Services 2,647.2 2,270.9 1,973.2 376.3 297.7 17% 15%Other (12.4) (0.9) 1.7        Reconciling item:              Client fund interest (593.6) (549.6) (431.9)          $10,938.5 $10,226.4 $9,442.0 $712.1 $784.4 7% 8% Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes(In millions)  Years ended June 30,  $ Change % Change  2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2015 2014Employer Services $2,694.2 $2,517.3 $2,215.7 $176.9 $301.6 7% 14%PEO Services  303.6 234.4 199.7 69.2 34.7 30% 17%Other (333.5) (322.9) (273.4)        Reconciling item:              Client fund interest (593.6) (549.6) (431.9)          $2,070.7 $1,879.2 $1,710.1 $191.5 $169.1 10% 10%Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the reportable segments at a standard rate for management reasons.

During fiscal 2015, Employer Services' revenue growth was negatively impacted two percentage points by unfavorable foreign currency translation.  Our worldwide client revenue retention rate remained at a record level of 91.4% in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 and our U.S. pays per control increased 3.0% in fiscal 2015. 26Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 7% due to the increase in revenues from continuing operations of $391.3 million discussed above, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $214.4 million.  This growth includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point.  Expenses increased in fiscal 2015, as compared to 2014, due to labor-related costs to support our growing revenues and an increase in selling expenses as we experienced traction from our increased focus on product development, high demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA, improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the U.S.  Overall margin increased approximately 70 basis points from 29.6% to 30.3% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing at a slower rate than our revenues, partially offset by an increase in selling expense due to higher new business bookings.Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Revenues from continuing operationsEmployer Services' revenues from continuing operations increased $607.0 million, or 8%, to $8,506.0 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  Revenues from continuing operations increased due to new business started during the year from new business bookings growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls, and the impact of price increases.  Our worldwide client revenue retention rate in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 10 basis points to 91.4%, as compared to our rate in fiscal 2013, and our U.S. pays per control increased 2.8% in fiscal 2014. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEmployer Services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $301.6 million, or 14%, to $2,517.3 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The increase was due to the increase in revenues of $607.0 million discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $305.4 million.  In addition to an increase in expenses related to increased revenues, expenses increased in fiscal 2014 due to investments in our salesforce and labor-related costs coupled with the effects of acquisitions.  Overall margin increased approximately 150 basis points from 28.1% to 29.6% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to increased operating scale.PEO ServicesFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 RevenuesPEO Services' revenues increased 17% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.  Such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015 and $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  The increase in revenues was due to a 14% increase in the average number of worksite employees, resulting from an increase in the number of new clients and growth in our existing clients.  Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesPEO Services’ earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 30% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.  The increase was due to increased revenues of $376.3 million discussed above, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $307.1 million.
