Risk Factors,” and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2020 include:The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve and our priority has been and continues to be the safety of our associates and the needs of our clients. In March 2020, we implemented our Business Continuity Plan and took steps to shift over 98% of our workforce to work from home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service to our clients across our solutions. While we are well-prepared to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis. Our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually; however, we are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in certain geographies to the extent our employees, clients, and prospects are ready to do so. We announced for our employees, excluding corporate officers, a one-time global associate assistance payment of $1,000 (or equivalent, based on the average wage parity in each country) in response to COVID-19, totaling $50.4 million. We are also deeply embedded in our local communities and continue to support COVID-19 relief efforts through financial donations and donations of medical supplies for hospital workers globally.As a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) technology solutions to employers around the world, we have continued to process payroll and tax obligations and provide other HCM services to our clients, despite the unexpected challenges that our clients and their employees around the world are facing. ADP's efforts have been focused on providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate the governmental relief that has been adopted globally. For example, the federal government in the United States enacted the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (“FFCRA”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. ADP has been working to provide support to all employers on the relief available under both laws. This includes an Employer Preparedness Toolkit that helps explain the federal and state government relief, as well as a website dedicated to providing critical information about the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). During the second half of fiscal 2020, we rolled out a range of tools and reports to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. We implemented over 1,000 feature changes to our products in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries, and we also had approximately 400,000 clients run over 2 million PPP reports for total loan values up to $115 billion dollars. Many of those clients have also now run the necessary payroll reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. As the global economy and landscape continues to evolve for our clients, whether due to legislative changes or other factors, ADP is committed to supporting our clients to help them navigate these challenges. The significant impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our clients and the broader economy is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics. Despite the fact that we have seen improvement as countries and states are in various stages of reopening and businesses gradually begin to bring a portion of their workers back, we've seen the impact on our full year fiscal 2020 results. Employer Services New Business Bookings was down 21% for fiscal 2020 as we saw bookings decline significantly and rapidly in mid-March due to the global social distancing guidelines coupled with the delayed decision making of our clients and prospects which continued into the fourth quarter. We also adjusted gross bookings as a result of client delays on implementation and the expectation that fewer client employees would come on board compared to when the business was originally signed. The PEO average number of Worksite Employees increased 4% for fiscal 2020. Our pays per control metric, which represents growth of the employee base for a large portion of our client base, showed a decline in the fourth quarter resulting in annual growth of negative 1.0% for fiscal 2020. In addition, we saw deterioration in Employer Services retention in fiscal 2020 of 20 basis points to 90.5% due to an increase in out-of-business losses.While the challenges presented by COVID-19 may affect the timing of our execution of parts of our strategy, we remain on a transformation journey, and our initiatives are yielding efficiencies and are focused on changing how we work. In fiscal 2020, we executed on our Workforce Optimization program and Procurement Transformation initiatives. For fiscal 2021, we are moving forward with a digital implementation and servicing initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our February 2020 Innovation Day. Despite a challenging end to fiscal 2020, we continued to deliver profit growth during the year ended June 30, 2020. We will continue to monitor macro trends based on externally and internally available data and are using these indicators to drive real-time decisions as we remain committed to our long-term strategy. We have a strong business model, a highly cash generative business with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our reinvestments, our longer term strategy, and our commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2020 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.RESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSTotal RevenuesFor the year ended June 30, respectively:Growth:á3%Organic constant currency:á4%Revenues for fiscal 2020 increased due to new business started from New Business Bookings, partially offset by business losses. Our revenue growth includes one percentage point of pressure from foreign currency. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services. Total revenues in fiscal 2020 include interest on funds held for clients of $545.2 million, as compared to $561.9 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in our average interest rate earned to 2.1% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2019. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balances of 2.1% to $26.0 billion in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.

Additionally, operating expenses increased due to a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity and a one-time global associate assistance payment in response to COVID-19 (“associate assistance payment”). The increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, reduced incentive compensation costs and reduced costs due to certain cost actions as a result of our transformation initiatives including procurement transformation initiatives in fiscal 2020. Systems development and programming costs increased for fiscal 2020 due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by capitalization of costs related to our strategic projects, including our next gen platforms. Depreciation and amortization expense increased related to the amortization of our acquisitions of intangibles and internally developed software.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal 2020 due to reduced incentive compensation costs, broad-based efficiencies as a result of our transformation initiatives including procurement transformation initiatives, a decrease in net charges related to our transformation initiatives, reduced facilities costs as a result of COVID-19, and impact of foreign currency. The decrease was partially offset by increased selling expenses, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of $26.0 million as a result of an increase in estimated credit losses related to the impact of COVID-19 on our clients (“increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts”), severance cost as a result of COVID-19 of $25.4 million, a legal settlement accrual of $25.0 million, and an associate assistance payment.

See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on non-service components of pension (income)/expense, net. In fiscal 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges of $29.9 million, which is comprised of $25.3 million as a result of recognizing certain owned facilities at fair value given intent to sell and accordingly classified as held for sale and vacating certain leased locations early and recorded total impairment charges of $4.6 million to operating right-of-use assets and certain related fixed assets associated with the vacated locations. In fiscal 2019, the Company wrote down $12.1 million of internally developed software which was determined to have no future use due to redundant software identified as part of a recent acquisition.In fiscal 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $15.7 million in relation to the sale of an investment held at cost acquired in prior years and subsequently sold during fiscal 2019.  Earnings before Income Taxes ("EBIT")For the year ended June 30:Growth:á6%á50bpsEarnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2020 due to the increases in revenues partially offset by the increases in expenses discussed above.  Overall margin increased in fiscal 2020 as a result of our continued successful execution of our broad-based transformation initiatives including our procurement transformation initiatives as well as operating efficiencies. In addition, our margin improvement was aided by reduced incentive compensation costs, lower transformation initiative related charges of $60.9 million, and reduced facilities costs as result of COVID-19. These were partially offset by incremental pressure from growth in our zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in selling expenses, an increase in amortization expense, a change in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity, an associate assistance payment, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, severance costs as a result of COVID-19, and a legal settlement accrual.Adjusted EBITFor the year ended June 30:Growth:á6%á60bpsAdjusted EBIT excludes certain interest amounts, net charges related to our transformation initiatives, the impact of the severance charges related to COVID-19, accrual for legal settlement, and the gain on sale of assets in the respective periods. For fiscal 2020, adjusted EBIT increased due to increases in revenues offset by the increases in expenses discussed above. Our adjusted EBIT margin reflects changes described above in our EBIT margin excluding the net charges noted above.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 22.5% and 23.7%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, a reduction in the operating tax rate due to the mix between domestic and foreign earnings, the benefit of a foreign tax law change and lower reserves for uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2020 partially offset by favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities during fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 22.6% and 23.8%, respectively. The drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share For the year ended June 30:Growth:á8%á9%For fiscal 2020, the net earnings reflect the changes described above in our earnings before income taxes and our effective tax rate.For fiscal 2020, diluted EPS increased as a result of an increase in net earnings and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 6.2 million shares in fiscal 2020 and 6.5 million shares in fiscal 2019, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per ShareFor the year ended June 30:Growth:á7%á9%For fiscal 2020, adjusted net earnings reflect the changes described above in our adjusted EBIT and our adjusted effective tax rate.For fiscal 2020, our adjusted diluted EPS reflects the changes described above in our adjusted net earnings and shares outstanding.ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTSRevenuesYears EndedJune 30,% Change 20202019As ReportedOrganic Constant CurrencyEmployer Services$10,086.6  $9,942.8  1 %2 %PEO Services4,511.5  4,177.7  8 %8 %Other(8.3) (10.3) n/mn/m$14,589.8  $14,110.2  3 %4 %Earnings before Income TaxesYears EndedJune 30,% Change 20202019As ReportedEmployer Services$3,063.0  $2,960.9  3 %PEO Services 605.5  616.2  (2)%Other(485.9) (571.5) n/m$3,182.6  $3,005.6  6 %n/m - not meaningfulEmployer ServicesRevenuesRevenues increased in fiscal 2020 due to new business started from New Business Bookings, partially offset by business losses and a decrease in interest earned on funds held for clients. Our revenue growth includes one percentage point of pressure from foreign currency. Our revenue growth was also partially offset by a decrease in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as our pays per control decreased 1.0% in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. Our pays per control metric measures the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions. In addition, the Employer Services client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2020 declined 20 basis points to 90.5% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2019, driven by an increase in out-of-business losses. Earnings before Income TaxesEmployer Services’ earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2020 due to increased revenues discussed above and partially offset by increased expenses due to an increase in selling expenses, an increase in amortization expense, and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts. These increases in expenses were partially offset by reduced incentive compensation costs, impact from foreign currency and operating efficiencies as a result of our transformation initiatives including our procurement transformation initiatives.For the year ended June 30, respectively:Growth:á60bpsEmployer Services' overall margin increased for fiscal 2020 as a result of the continued successful execution of our broad-based transformation initiatives including our procurement transformation initiatives, as well as operating efficiencies and reduced incentive compensation costs. This increase was partially offset by an increase in selling expenses, amortization expense and our allowance for doubtful accounts.PEO ServicesRevenuesPEO RevenuesYears EndedChangeJune 30, 20202019$%PEO Services' revenues$4,511.5  $4,177.7  $333.8  8 %Less: PEO zero-margin benefits pass-throughs2,907.7  2,647.5  260.2  10 %PEO Services' revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs$1,603.8  $1,530.2  $73.6  5 %PEO Services' revenues increased 8% in fiscal 2020 due to a 4% increase in the average number of Worksite Employees in fiscal 2020 driven by an increase in the number of new PEO Services clients and growth in our existing clients. Additionally, PEO Services' revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, increased 5% in fiscal 2020 and includes pressure from lower workers compensation and State Unemployment Insurance (“SUI”) costs and related pricing. Earnings before Income TaxesPEO Services’ earnings before income taxes decreased 2% in fiscal 2020 due to the increase in expenses partially offset by the increase in revenues discussed above. The increase in expenses was due to the increase in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs of $260.2 million described above and a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. For the year ended June 30, respectively:Growth:â130bpsPEO Services' overall margin decreased for fiscal 2020 due to a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.ADP Indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2020 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $39 million in fiscal 2019, which were primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. Beginning in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity during these policy years.  Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. We believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. During fiscal 2020, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $215 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb Limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2020 policy year to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $240 million in July 2020 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2021 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2020 reinsurance policy.OtherThe primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, an associate assistance payment, a legal settlement accrual, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest expense. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods: Adjusted Financial MeasuresU.S. GAAP MeasuresAdjusted EBITNet earnings  Adjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxesAdjusted net earnings  Net earnings  Adjusted diluted earnings per share  Diluted earnings per shareAdjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rateOrganic constant currencyRevenuesWe believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.Years EndedJune 30,% Change20202019As ReportedNet earnings$2,466.5  $2,292.8  8 %Adjustments:Provision for income taxes716.1  712.8  All other interest expense (a)59.2  59.9  All other interest income (a)(20.5) (32.4) Gain on sale of assets(0.2) (15.7) Transformation initiatives (b)77.4  138.3  COVID-19 related charges (c)25.4  —  Legal settlement (d)25.0  —  Adjusted EBIT$3,348.9  $3,155.7  6 %Adjusted EBIT Margin23.0 %22.4 %Provision for income taxes$716.1  $712.8  — %Adjustments:Gain on sale of assets (e)(0.1) (3.9) Transformation initiatives (e)19.2  34.5  COVID-19 related charges (e)6.3  —  Legal settlement (e)6.2  —  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (f)—  0.5  Adjusted provision for income taxes$747.7  $743.9  1 %Adjusted effective tax rate (g)22.6 %23.8 %Net earnings$2,466.5  $2,292.8  8 %Adjustments:Gain on sale of assets(0.2) (15.7) Income tax provision on gain on sale of assets (e)0.1  3.9  Transformation initiatives (b)77.4  138.3  Income tax benefit for transformation initiatives (e)(19.2) (34.5) COVID-19 related charges (c)25.4  —  Income tax benefit for COVID-19 related charges (e)(6.3) —  Legal settlement (d)25.0  —  Income tax benefit for legal settlement (e)(6.2) —  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (f)—  (0.5) Adjusted net earnings$2,562.5  $2,384.3  7 %Diluted EPS$5.70  $5.24  9 %Adjustments:Gain on sale of assets (e)—  (0.03) Transformation initiatives (b) (e)0.13  0.24  COVID-19 related charges (c) (e)0.04  —  Legal settlement (d) (e)0.04  —  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (f)—  —  Adjusted diluted EPS$5.92  $5.45  9 %(a) We include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.

Unlike certain other severance charges in prior periods that are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiatives. (c) Represents severance charges related to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike other severance charges in prior periods that are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide initiatives to address excess capacity across our business and functions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.(d) Represents a legal settlement accrual related to the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act matter.

(e) The income tax provision/(benefit) was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.(f) There was no impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in fiscal 2020.  (g) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction.  The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2020 and have sufficient liquidity as note above; however, given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our financial condition and liquidity.  For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks, including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper. Operating, Investing and Financing Cash FlowsOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the years ended 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows: Years ended June 30,20202019$ ChangeCash provided by (used in):Operating activities$3,026.2  $2,688.3  $337.9  Investing activities3,156.3  (2,197.7) 5,354.0  Financing activities(5,890.6) (207.7) (5,682.9) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents(34.5) (28.8) (5.7) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents$257.4  $254.1  $3.3  Net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include cash payments for reinsurance agreements of $215.0 million and $218.0 million, respectively, which represent the policy premium for the entire fiscal year. The increase in operating cash provided is primarily due to growth in our business supplemented by a growth in non-cash expenses within operating activities and net favorable change in the components of working capital as compared to fiscal 2019. Net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $5,256.9 million, proceeds from the sale of assets and lower payments related to acquisitions of business, partially offset by payments related to acquisitions of intangibles and payments related to capital expenditures in fiscal 2020.Net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $4,909.2 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, more cash returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and a net repayment of reverse repurchase agreements in fiscal 2020. We purchased approximately 6.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $160.61 during fiscal 2020, as compared to purchases of 6.5 million shares at an average price per share of $143.02 during fiscal 2019. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.   Capital Resources and Client Fund ObligationsOn July 15, 2020, the Company gave notice to the current holders of our intention to redeem the $1.0 billion 2.25% Senior Notes due September 15, 2020 on the call date of August 15, 2020. It is the Co
