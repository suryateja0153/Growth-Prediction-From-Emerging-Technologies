EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are one of the largest providers of cloud-based Human Capital Management ("HCM") solutions - including payroll, talent management, Human Resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world.  As a leader in this industry, we are focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their HCM needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity. Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017") include:•Worldwide new business bookings declined 5% from the year ended June 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016") to $1.65 billion for fiscal 2017.•Revenue grew 6% which includes one percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our COBRA and CHSA businesses and foreign currency translation.•Pre-tax margin increased approximately 130 basis points to 20.4%; Adjusted EBIT margin increased 30 basis points to 19.8%.•Net earnings from continuing operations increased 16%; Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 11%.•Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 13% to $3.70. •We continued our shareholder friendly actions by returning $1.3 billion via share repurchases, and approximately $1 billion via dividends, which increased on a per-share basis for the 42nd consecutive year. We have fully distributed the proceeds from our fiscal 2016 debt issuance.22During fiscal 2017, we continued to focus on our global HCM strategy by investing to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for sustainable long-term growth. Our robust and diverse product offerings are the result of our continued investment in product innovation and service. Our results in fiscal 2017 reflect the stability of our underlying business model and our disciplined strategy for profitable growth while maintaining our focus on shareholder friendly actions.Our new business bookings were down 5% during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due to high demand in fiscal 2016 for our solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act ("ACA").  We remain optimistic of our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products, as well as our sales force's ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"). The causes of our client losses and resulting impact on our revenue retention continue to be a point of internal focus. Our Employer Services revenue retention was down 50 basis points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower retention on our legacy client platforms coupled with the anticipated loss of a large client within our former CHSA business at the beginning of the fiscal year.   We are seeing strong retention on our strategic platforms.  We continue to upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new cloud-based solutions and focus on improving the client experience.  We believe upgrading our clients from legacy platforms is an important aspect of our long-term strategy, giving our clients our most innovative and seamless products.Our implementation team's ability to implement our services as well as our sales force's ability to sell to clients and prospects drove revenue growth during fiscal 2017. Our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions.During fiscal 2017, we incurred $90.0 million in charges for a previously announced multi-year Service Alignment Initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms. In connection with this Service Alignment Initiative, we anticipate incurring total pre-tax charges of about $30 million in the year ended June 30, 2018.In November 2016, we completed the sale of our Consumer Health Spending Account ("CHSA") and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") businesses which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $205 million.  This disposition, and subsequent partnership with the acquiring company, allows us to further sharpen our focus on our core capabilities while continuing to deliver a full suite of HCM solutions to current and future clients in a seamless fashion. The historical results of operations of this business are included in the Employer Services segment.  In January 2017, we acquired The Marcus Buckingham Company ("TMBC"). TMBC is a provider of talent management technology, coaching, and consulting solutions. The acquisition reflects our commitment to innovation and enhances our core HCM capabilities, allowing us to deepen our offering in this critical area of talent management. The results of operations of this business will be included in the Employer Services segment.  We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, good margins, the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.8 billion. We continue to make investments in our sales force and are pleased with the operational improvements of our organization, our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients, and the ability of our service organization to support these new services and strategic platforms.  Our pipeline for future new business bookings remains strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic platforms and our strong, tenured sales force.  We believe that our focus on these areas will continue to drive our growth and success in the future.23RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSPrior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations (refer to Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).(In millions, except per share amounts)  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Dollar Basis  2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2017 2016               Total revenues from continuing operations $12,379.8 $11,667.8 $10,938.5 6% 7% 6% 8%               Costs of revenues:              Operating expenses 6,416.1 6,025.0 5,625.3 6% 7% 7% 9%Systems development and programming costs 627.5 603.7 595.4 4% 1% 4% 4%Depreciation and amortization 226.2 211.6 206.9 7% 2% 7% 5%Total costs of revenues 7,269.8 6,840.3 6,427.6 6% 6% 7% 8%               Selling, general and administrative costs 2,783.2 2,637.0 2,496.9 6% 6% 6% 7%Interest expense 80.0 56.2 6.5 n/m n/m n/m n/mTotal expenses  10,133.0 9,533.5 8,931.0 6% 7% 7% 8%               Other income, net (284.3) (100.4) (63.2) n/m n/m n/m n/m               Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $2,531.1 $2,234.7 $2,070.7 13% 8% 13% 9%Margin 20.4% 19.2% 18.9%                       Provision for income taxes $797.7 $741.3 $694.2 8% 7% 7% 8%Effective tax rate 31.5% 33.2% 33.5%                       Net earnings from continuing operations $1,733.4 $1,493.4 $1,376.5 16% 8% 16% 10%               Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations $3.85 $3.25 $2.89 18% 12% 18% 13%n/m - not meaningfulNote 1.  Non-GAAP measuresIn addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods: 24    Adjusted Financial MeasureU.S. GAAP MeasuresAdjustments/ExplanationAdjusted EBITNet earnings from continuing operations- Provision for income taxes- Gains/losses on non-operational transactions such as sales of businesses and assets- All other interest expense and income- Certain restructuring charges See footnotes (a) and (b)Adjusted net earnings from continuing operationsNet earnings from continuing operationsPre-tax and tax impacts of:- Gains/losses on non-operational transactions such as sales of businesses and assets- Certain restructuring charges See footnotes (b), (c), and (d)Adjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxesTax impacts of:- Gains/losses on non-operational transactions such as sales of businesses and assets- Certain restructuring chargesSee footnotes (c) and (d)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operationsDiluted earnings per shareEPS impacts of:- Gains/losses on non-operational transactions such as sales of businesses and assets - Certain restructuring charges See footnote (b)Adjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rateSee footnote (e)Constant Dollar Basis U.S. GAAP P&L line itemsSee footnote (f)    We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.25  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Dollar Basis (f)  2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2017 2016Net earnings from continuing operations $1,733.4 $1,493.4 $1,376.5 16% 8% 16 % 10%Adjustments:              Provision for income taxes 797.7 741.3 694.2        All other interest expense (a) 59.3 47.9 1.5        All other interest income (a) (22.4) (13.6) (10.7)        Gain on sale of businesses (205.4) (29.1) —        Gain on sale of building — (13.9) —        Workforce Optimization Effort (b) (5.0) 48.2 —        Service Alignment Initiative (b) 90.0 — —        Adjusted EBIT $2,447.6 $2,274.2 $2,061.5 8% 10% 7 % 11%Adjusted EBIT Margin 19.8% 19.5% 18.8%                       Provision for income taxes $797.7 $741.3 $694.2 8% 7% 7 % 8%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of businesses (c) (84.0) (7.3) —        Gain on sale of building (d) — (5.3) —        Workforce Optimization Effort (d) (1.8) 16.4 —        Service Alignment Initiative (d) 33.8 — —        Adjusted provision for income taxes $745.7 $745.1 $694.2 —% 7% — % 8%Adjusted effective tax rate (e) 30.9% 33.3% 33.5%                       Net earnings from continuing operations $1,733.4 $1,493.4 $1,376.5 16% 8% 16 % 10%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of businesses (205.4) (29.1) —        Gain on sale of building — (13.9) —        Workforce Optimization Effort (b) (5.0) 48.2 —        Service Alignment Initiative (b) 90.0 — —        Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of business (c) 84.0 7.3 —        Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of building (d) — 5.3 —        Benefit/(Provision) for income taxes for Workforce Optimization Effort (d) 1.8 (16.4) —        Income tax benefit for Service Alignment Initiative (d) (33.8) — —        Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $1,665.0 $1,494.8 $1,376.5 11% 9% 11 % 10%               Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $3.85 $3.25 $2.89 18% 12% 18 % 13%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of businesses (0.27) (0.05) —        Gain on sale of building — (0.02) —        Workforce Optimization Effort (b) (0.01) 0.07 —        Service Alignment Initiative (b) 0.12 — —        Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $3.70 $3.26 $2.89 13% 13% 13 % 14%(a) We continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."(b) The majority of charges relating to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort represent severance charges.  Severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results.  Unlike 26severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to our broad-based, company-wide Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort.  The fiscal 2017 Workforce Optimization Effort adjustment totaling approximately $5 million represents a reversal of the fiscal 2016 estimate.(c) The taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.  The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended June 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.(d) The tax benefit/provision on the Service Alignment Initiative, Workforce Optimization Effort, and the gain on the sale of the building was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.(e) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.(f) "Constant dollar basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations.  "Constant dollar basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Total RevenuesOur revenues, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and foreign currency translation.  Revenue increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings.  Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") Services.Total revenues in fiscal 2017 include interest on funds held for clients of $397.4 million, as compared to $377.3 million in fiscal 2016.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.7% to $23,023.5 million in fiscal 2017.Total ExpensesOur total expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO services pass-through costs, the restructuring and dual operations costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative, and increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue.  These increases were partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses during fiscal 2017.Operating expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million.  Additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including dual operation costs associated with our Service Alignment Initiative, partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses.Systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily related to investments in our sales organization.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to additional restructuring charges which primarily relate to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort. 27Other Income, net(In millions)      Years ended June 30, 2017 2016 $ ChangeInterest income on corporate funds $(76.7) $(62.4) $14.3Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (5.3) (5.1) 0.2Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 3.1 10.1 7.0Gain on sale of businesses (see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) (205.4) (29.1) 176.3Gain on sale of building — (13.9) (13.9)Other income, net $(284.3) $(100.4) $183.9Other income, net, increased $183.9 million in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the gain on sale of the AdvancedMD ("AMD") business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million in fiscal 2016.Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 13% due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses as well as the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016.  Overall margin increased from 19.2% in fiscal 2016 to 20.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, and operating efficiencies, partially offset by the net charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort in fiscal 2017 and 2016, the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of AMD in fiscal 2016, and additional interest expense related to our September 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance in fiscal 2016.Adjusted EBITAdjusted EBIT excludes certain interest amounts, the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and the Workforce Optimization Effort, and the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of the AMD business in fiscal 2016.Adjusted EBIT increased 8% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased from 19.5% in fiscal 2016 to 19.8% in fiscal 2017 due to operating efficiencies partially offset by 20 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative.                                                 Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 31.5% and 33.2%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (as further explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements), which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017.  These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017. Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate, adjusted for the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort, the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of the AMD business in fiscal 2016, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 30.9% and 33.3%, respectively.  The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 220 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (as further explained in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements), which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. This decrease was offset by a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017. 28Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations, as reported, increased 16% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the reduction in our effective tax rate described above, when compared to fiscal 2016.Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85 in fiscal 2017, as compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2016.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing OperationsAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in adjusted EBIT and reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2017, our Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations reflects the increase in Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of 13.5 million shares during fiscal 2017 and the repurchase of 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by shares issued under our employee benefit plans.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Total RevenuesOur revenues, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, despite two percentage points of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the disposition of the AMD business in September 2015, primarily due to new business started during the past twelve months from new business bookings growth.  Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and PEO Services.Total revenues in fiscal 2016 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.3 million, as compared to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015.  The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.8% to $22,418.7 million in fiscal 2016.Total ExpensesOur total expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO services pass-through costs as well as an increase in selling and implementation expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for additional HCM solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the ACA.  Total expenses also increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and an increase in severance expenses, primarily related to our Workforce Optimization Effort.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,627.1 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $388.8 million.  Additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to implement and service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including products that assist with ACA compliance which contributed to our strong new business bookings over the past several quarters.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.Systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 1% in fiscal 2016, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects and the impact of foreign currency translation.29Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  The increase was primarily related to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for our HCM products, particularly those that are designed to assist businesses in complying with the ACA.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to $57.6 million of additional severance charges, of which $48.2 million relate to our Workforce Optimization Effort, and a $10.7 million reversal of reserves in fiscal 2015 related to our former Dealer Services business financing arrangements which were sold to a third party.  These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.Other Income, net(In millions)      Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 $ ChangeInterest income on corporate funds $(62.4) $(56.9) $5.5Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (5.1) (6.8) (1.7)Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 10.1 1.9 (8.2)Gain on sale of notes receivable — (1.4) (1.4)Gain on sale of AMD (29.1) — 29.1Gain on sale of building (13.9) — 13.9Other income, net $(100.4) $(63.2) $37.2Other income, net, increased $37.2 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  The increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the AMD business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million.Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 8% due to increases in revenues and expenses discussed above and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point.  Overall margin increased from 18.9% in fiscal 2015 to 19.2% in fiscal 2016 due to the gain on the sale of the AMD business, the gain on the sale of the building and decreased selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  These increases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our September 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance, investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth, and the charges related to our Workforce Optimization Effort.  Adjusted EBITAdjusted EBIT, which excludes certain interest amounts, the impact of the AMD business sale, the gain on the sale of a building and the charges related to our Workforce Optimization Effort, increased 10% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased from 18.8% in fiscal 2015 to 19.5% in fiscal 2016 due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth. Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 33.2% and 33.5%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2015.Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate, adjusted for the impact of the Workforce Optimization Effort, sale of the AMD business, and a gain on the sale of a building, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 33.3% and 33.5%, respectively.  The decrease in the Adjusted effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2015.30Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased 8% on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate, as described above.  Net earnings from continuing operations growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point by foreign currency translation in fiscal 2016.
