As a leader in this industry, we deliver on our global HCM strategy and make investments in highly strategic areas and technology in order to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for continued growth. Highlights from the year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018") include:•Worldwide new business bookings increased 8% to $1.8 billion•Revenue grew 8% in fiscal 2018; Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") decreased 5% to $3.66, while adjusted diluted EPS increased 18% to $4.35•Our shareholder friendly actions continued as we raised our quarterly declared cash dividend by 21% and returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases •Completed migrations of our mid-market clients to latest version of Workforce Now•Executed on a VERP and created a Transformation Office to continue driving broad-based transformation initiativesAt ADP we innovate by anticipating how the world of work is transforming and how trends, such as the rising of the gig economy, impact the needs of our clients and the evolving workforce. We are reshaping the HCM industry through organic innovative development such as our next-gen platforms and our strategic acquisitions such as Global Cash Card, WorkMarket, and more recently, Celergo, Inc., a leading provider of international payroll management services.  With these investments we are enhancing our position as the only global HCM provider that can help businesses address the entire worker spectrum from full-time to freelancer and hire to retire.  As the payroll market continues to rapidly evolve, we continue to be focused on staying ahead of the curve. Through our investments in technology, service, and distribution, we intend to continue to build on our momentum heading into fiscal 2019.Our new business bookings increased 8% during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, validating the renewed momentum in our sales force following fiscal 2017.  We are confident that the investments in our sales force and products will continue to drive solid results.  We remain optimistic in our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products, as well as our sales force's ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending June 30, 2019 ("fiscal 2019").During fiscal 2018, we continued to migrate clients to our strategic platforms while making investments in R&D to provide best-in-class cloud-based HCM technology solutions to our clients.  Employer Services retention was positively impacted by our focus on improving the client experience and was positively impacted by the loss of a large client within our former Consumer Health Spending Account ("CHSA") business during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017").  This focus translated into strong retention on our strategic platforms and as a result, we saw Employer Services revenue retention improve 50 basis points during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.Simultaneously, we continue to streamline our service organization.  We remain focused on delivering results and executing on our strategy to transform our business for continued success within the competitive global HCM environment.  During fiscal 2018, we incurred $20.5 million in charges for a previously announced multi-year Service Alignment Initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms.  Building upon our Service Alignment Initiative in support of our transformation goals, we are executing upon a voluntary early retirement program and have also identified additional operational improvement initiatives through the formation of our Transformation Office.  These transformation initiatives support ADP’s ongoing strategy which is aimed at streamlining our operations and extending our world class distribution while leveraging our talent and culture. We have a strong business model and operate in a growing global market. We continue to maintain a high percentage of recurring revenues and healthy margins, and retain our ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows.   Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2018, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.2 billion. We have benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") signed into law in late December 2017.  With this increased operating cash flow and greater access to our cash worldwide, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation decisions, including assessing reinvestments into the business, potential acquisitions, and/or returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, among other potential uses.  23RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSPrior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations (refer to Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).(In millions, except per share amounts)  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Currency Basis  2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2018 2017               Total revenues $13,325.8 $12,379.8 $11,667.8 8 % 6% 7 % 6%               Costs of revenues:              Operating expenses 6,937.9 6,416.1 6,025.0 8 % 6% 7 % 7%Systems development and programming costs 630.2 627.5 603.7 — % 4% (1)% 4%Depreciation and amortization 274.5 226.2 211.6 21 % 7% 20 % 7%Total costs of revenues 7,842.6 7,269.8 6,840.3 8 % 6% 7 % 7%               Selling, general and administrative costs 2,971.5 2,783.2 2,637.0 7 % 6% 6 % 6%Interest expense 102.7 80.0 56.2 n/m n/m n/m n/mTotal expenses  10,916.8 10,133.0 9,533.5 8 % 6% 7 % 7%               Other expense/(income), net 237.9 (284.3) (100.4) n/m n/m n/m n/m               Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $2,171.1 $2,531.1 $2,234.7 (14)% 13% (15)% 13%Margin 16.3% 20.4% 19.2%                       Provision for income taxes $550.3 $797.7 $741.3 (31)% 8% (32)% 7%Effective tax rate 25.3% 31.5% 33.2%                       Net earnings from continuing operations $1,620.8 $1,733.4 $1,493.4 (6)% 16% (8)% 16%               Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $3.66 $3.85 $3.25 (5)% 18% (6)% 18%n/m - not meaningfulNote 1.  Non-GAAP measuresIn addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods: 24    Adjusted Financial MeasureU.S. GAAP MeasuresAdjustments/Explanation - as applicable in the periodsAdjusted EBIT from continuing operationsNet earnings from continuing operations- Provision for income taxes- Gains/losses on sales of businesses and assets- All other interest expense and income- Transformation initiatives - Non-operational costs related to proxy contest mattersSee footnotes (a), (b), and (c)Adjusted net earnings from continuing operationsNet earnings from continuing operationsPre-tax and tax impacts of:- Gains/losses on sales of businesses and assets- Transformation initiatives- Non-operational costs related to proxy contest matters- Tax Cuts and Jobs ActSee footnotes (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f)Adjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxesTax impacts of:- Gains/losses on sales of businesses and assets- Transformation initiatives- Non-operational costs related to proxy contest matters- Tax Cuts and Jobs ActSee footnotes (c), (d), (e), and (f)Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operationsDiluted earnings per shareEPS impacts of:- Gains/losses on sales of businesses and assets - Transformation initiatives- Non-operational costs related to proxy contest matters- Tax Cuts and Jobs ActSee footnotes (b), (c), and (f)Adjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rateSee footnote (g)Constant Currency Basis U.S. GAAP P&L line itemsSee footnote (h)We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.25  Years Ended % Change  June 30, As Reported Constant Currency Basis (h)  2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2018 2017Net earnings from continuing operations $1,620.8 $1,733.4 $1,493.4 (6)% 16% (8)% 16%Adjustments:              Provision for income taxes 550.3 797.7 741.3        All other interest expense (a) 59.4 59.3 47.9        All other interest income (a) (25.5) (22.4) (13.6)        Gain on sale of businesses — (205.4) (29.1)        Gain on sale of assets — — (13.9)        Transformation initiatives (b) 404.8 85.0 48.2        Proxy contest matters (c) 33.3 — —        Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations $2,643.1 $2,447.6 $2,274.2 8 % 8% 7 % 7%Adjusted EBIT Margin 19.8% 19.8% 19.5%                       Provision for income taxes $550.3 $797.7 $741.3 (31)% 8% (32)% 7%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of businesses (d) — (84.0) (7.3)        Gain on sale of assets (e) — — (5.3)        Transformation initiatives (e) 122.1 32.0 16.4        Proxy contest matters (c) 10.4 — —        Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (f) (1.7) — —        Adjusted provision for income taxes $681.1 $745.7 $745.1 (9)% —% (10)% —%Adjusted effective tax rate (g) 26.1% 30.9% 33.3%                       Net earnings from continuing operations $1,620.8 $1,733.4 $1,493.4 (6)% 16% (8)% 16%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of businesses — (205.4) (29.1)        Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of business (d) — 84.0 7.3        Gain on sale of assets — — (13.9)        Provision for income taxes on gain on sale of assets (e) — — 5.3        Transformation initiatives (b) 404.8 85.0 48.2        Income tax benefit for transformation initiatives (e) (122.1) (32.0) (16.4)        Proxy contest matters (c) 33.3 — —        Income tax benefit for proxy contest matters (e) (10.4) — —        Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (f) 1.7 — —        Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $1,928.1 $1,665.0 $1,494.8 16 % 11% 15 % 11%               Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $3.66 $3.85 $3.25 (5)% 18% (6)% 18%Adjustments:              Gain on sale of businesses  — (0.27) (0.05)        Gain on sale of assets — — (0.02)        Transformation initiatives (b) 0.64 0.12 0.07        Proxy contest matters (c) 0.05 — —        Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (f) — — —        Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $4.35 $3.70 $3.26 18 % 13% 16 % 13%(a) Our Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations continues to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The 26adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "All other interest expense" and "All other interest income."(b) The charges within transformation initiatives for fiscal 2018 includes $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program ("VERP"), severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative of $20.5 million, and other transformation initiatives of  $47.2 million which primarily consist of severance charges totaling $41.9 million for fiscal 2018. Charges for transformation initiatives for periods prior to fiscal 2018 primarily represent severance charges related to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort.  Unlike severance charges in prior periods, which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiative. Refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of charges associated with the VERP. (c) Represents non-operational costs relating to proxy contest matters. (d) The taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.  The tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended June 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended June 30, 2016 due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.(e) The tax benefit/provision on the transformation initiatives, the gain on the sale of the assets, and non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.(f) The one-time net provision from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is comprised of a one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, accrued foreign withholding taxes on future distributions of earning and profit that may no longer be utilizable as foreign tax credits, and the recording of a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized offset by the application of the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rates to our U.S. deferred tax balances.  We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining calculations, which could potentially result in the re-measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to future adjustments.(g) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.(h) "Constant currency basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations.  "Constant currency basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Total RevenuesOur revenues, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2018.  Our revenue growth includes two percentage points of combined benefit from foreign currency and acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses in fiscal 2017.  Revenues in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings.  Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") Services.Total revenues in fiscal 2018 include interest on funds held for clients of $466.5 million, as compared to $397.4 million in fiscal 2017.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average interest rate earned to 1.9% in fiscal 2018, as compared to 1.7% in fiscal 2017, coupled with the increase in our average client funds balances of 5.7% to $24.3 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.Total ExpensesOur total expenses, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO Services pass-through costs, increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and increases in selling expense.  Total expenses also increased due to costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018, the impact of foreign currency, and costs related to proxy contest matters in fiscal 2018.  27Operating expenses, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,945.5 million for fiscal 2018, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,463.1 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $482.4 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  Additionally, operating expenses increased due to costs related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018, higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue as well as the impact of foreign currency. Systems development and programming costs, as reported, remained flat in fiscal 2018, when compared to the prior year, due to increased investments in product innovation and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products,  impact of foreign currency translation, offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  The increase was primarily due to increases in selling expense to support our 8% new business bookings growth, charges related to our transformation initiatives, costs related to acquisitions, costs related to proxy contest matters, and the impact of foreign currency translation, offset by charges related to our transformation initiatives in fiscal 2017.Other Expense/(Income), net(In millions)      Years ended June 30, 2018 2017 $ ChangeInterest income on corporate funds $(83.5) $(76.7) $6.8Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (2.0) (5.3) (3.3)Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 4.5 3.1 (1.4)Gain on sale of businesses (see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) — (205.4) (205.4)Gain on sale of assets (0.7) — 0.7Voluntary Early Retirement Program (see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) 319.6 — (319.6)Other expense/(income), net $237.9 $(284.3) $(522.2)Other expense/(income), net, decreased $522.2 million in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017.  The decrease was primarily due to a charge for certain special termination benefits for those associates who opted into the VERP of $319.6 million in fiscal 2018 and the gain on sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017. Earnings before Income TaxesEarnings before income taxes decreased 14% primary due to $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our VERP in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses in fiscal 2017 offset by the increases in revenues and increases in expenses discussed above.  Overall margin decreased from 20.4% in fiscal 2017 to 16.3% in fiscal 2018 primarily due to $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our VERP in fiscal 2018, the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses in fiscal 2017, acquisitions completed and incremental pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues in fiscal 2018. These drivers were offset by operational and selling efficiencies in fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITIn fiscal 2018, adjusted EBIT increased 8% due to the increases in revenues offset by the increases in expenses discussed above.  Overall adjusted EBIT margin increased slightly due to operational and selling efficiencies offset by pressure from fiscal 2018 acquisitions and incremental pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 25.3% and 31.5%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the impacts of the Act and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions partially offset by the impact in the prior period of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impact of the benefit due to tax incentives associated with the 28domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit in fiscal 2017.  Refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 26.1% and 30.9%, respectively.  The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to the reduction in the blended federal corporate statutory tax rate to 28.1% from 35% as a result of the Act and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2018, partially offset by the impact of a benefit due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit in fiscal 2017.Net Earnings and Diluted EPS Net earnings, as reported, decreased 6% in fiscal 2018 due to $319.6 million related to the special termination benefit charges and $17.5 million of other charges related to our VERP in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses in fiscal 2017 offset by the reduction in our effective tax rate described above and an increase in our underlying earnings before income taxes, when compared to fiscal 2017.Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $3.66 in fiscal 2018, as compared to $3.85 in fiscal 2017.  Diluted earnings per share reflects the decrease in net earnings offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 8.5 million shares in fiscal 2018 and 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPSAdjusted net earnings increased 16% in fiscal 2018 due to the increase in adjusted EBIT combined with the reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2017.For fiscal 2018, our adjusted diluted EPS reflects the changes described above in our net earnings and shares outstanding.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Total RevenuesOur revenues, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and foreign currency translation.  Revenue increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings.  Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, Employer Services and PEO Services.Total revenues in fiscal 2017 include interest on funds held for clients of $397.4 million, as compared to $377.3 million in fiscal 2016.  The increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.7% to $23,023.5 million in fiscal 2017.Total ExpensesOur total expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in PEO Services pass-through costs, the restructuring and dual operations costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative, and increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue.  These increases were partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses during fiscal 2017.Operating expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  PEO Services pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  These pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million.  Additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including dual operation costs associated with our Service Alignment Initiative, partially offset by the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses.29Systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.Selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily related to investments in our sales organization.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to additional restructuring charges which primarily relate to our Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort.

The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses of $205.4 million in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the gain on sale of the AdvancedMD ("AMD") business of $29.1 million and the gain on the sale of a building of $13.9 million in fiscal 2016.Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 13% due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses as well as the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above, partially offset by the net impact of the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort charges in fiscal 2017 and 2016.  Overall margin increased from 19.2% in fiscal 2016 to 20.4% in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, and operating efficiencies, partially offset by the net charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort in fiscal 2017 and 2016, the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale of AMD in fiscal 2016, and additional interest expense related to our September 2015 $2.0 billion senior note issuance in fiscal 2016.Adjusted EBITAdjusted EBIT excludes certain interest amounts, the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and the Workforce Optimization Effort, and the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale of the AMD business in fiscal 2016.Adjusted EBIT increased 8% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above.  Overall Adjusted EBIT margin increased from 19.5% in fiscal 2016 to 19.8% in fiscal 2017 due to operating efficiencies partially offset by 20 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our Service Alignment Initiative.                                                 Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 31.5% and 33.2%, respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of  Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017.  These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses and a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017. Adjusted Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate, adjusted for the gain on the sale of the CHSA and COBRA businesses, the impact of the charges related to the Service Alignment Initiative and Workforce Optimization Effort, the gain on the sale of the assets and the gain on the sale 30of the AMD business in fiscal 2016, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 30.9% and 33.3%, respectively.  The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 220 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017.
