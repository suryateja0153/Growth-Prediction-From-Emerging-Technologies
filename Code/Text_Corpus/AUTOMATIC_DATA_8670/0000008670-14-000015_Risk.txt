Risk Factors," should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.17EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW      On April 10, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan to separate our Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company through a tax-free spin-off of 100% of Dealer Services to ADP shareholders.  We expect to receive at least $700 million in connection with the spin-off, which we plan to return to our shareholders after the spin-off through share repurchases, depending upon market conditions.  Following the spin-off, we intend to increase the dividend annually, subject to Board of Director approval, keeping intact our 39-year track record of consecutive dividend increases.  However, we expect to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our pre-separation target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% in about two years.  We believe that the separation of the Dealer Services business will allow both companies to focus on their respective businesses, industries, and strategic opportunities and we will further direct our attention and resources to our mission and three strategic pillars discussed below.  We expect to complete the separation by October 2014.ADP's mission is to help organizations unlock their business potential with our insightful solutions.  We seek to embrace new technology and innovation to deliver market leading products and services that meet the needs of our clients across all of our markets.  Our commitment to service excellence lies at the core of our relationship with each of our clients, whether a small, midsized or large organization in one or multiple countries.  Our business strategy is based on strategic pillars, which are predicated on our ability to drive innovation and service excellence, and attract, build, and retain the right talent to position ADP as the global market leader in human capital management (HCM) services.  Our strategic pillars are to:•grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market;•invest to grow and scale our HR Business Process Outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and•leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions where they do business.Our results during fiscal 2014 continue to reflect the strength of our underlying business model, including the diversity of our client base and products.  Our focus on product innovation and improvements in salesforce productivity led to growth in new business bookings.  We are pleased with the performance of our business segments, which have continued to drive good revenue growth and pretax margin expansion. Revenue retention improved across our business segments and we continue to benefit from the strength of our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions.  During fiscal 2014, we were impacted by the decline in high-margin client interest revenues as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance. We expect this high-margin client interest revenue to increase in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, but at a slower rate than our underlying processing revenue.Consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014 increased 8%, to $12,206.5 million, as compared to fiscal 2013.  Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10%, to $2,274.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2013 and net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, to $1,502.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2013.  Our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 11% to $3.11 in fiscal 2014, as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2014 results include $14.9 million of incremental costs directly attributable to our planned separation of our Dealer Service business and our fiscal 2013 results include a $42.7 million non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to our ADP AdvancedMD business.  Excluding these items, our earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 8%, to $2,289.5 million, as compared to $2,118.8 million for fiscal 2013, and net earnings from continuing operations increased 8%, to $1,517.5 million, compared to $1,400.8 million for fiscal 2013.  Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9%, to $3.14 for fiscal 2014 from $2.88, as adjusted, for fiscal 2013, due to increased adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and fewer shares outstanding. Our business segment results were solid with Employer Services' revenues increasing 8% to $8,535.2 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14% to $2,517.8 million, PEO Services' revenues increasing 15% to $2,270.9 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 17% to $234.3 million, and Dealer Services' revenues increasing 7% to $1,951.4 million and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increasing 14% to $428.1 million in fiscal 2014.  Employer Services' and PEO Services' new business bookings, which represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales orders to new and existing clients, grew 7% worldwide, to over $1.4 billion in fiscal 2014. Dealer Services' new business bookings showed strength as we continued to experience the effects of a stronger automotive industry and increased penetration of applications within our base.  Our key business metrics continue to reflect the core strength of our business model, with our Employer Services' worldwide client revenue retention rate increasing to an all-time high of 91.4% and our pays per control metric increased 2.8% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 from the twelve months ended June 30, 2013.  18Interest on funds held for clients decreased approximately 11%, or $47.2 million, to $373.7 million from $420.9 million in fiscal 2013.  The decrease in the consolidated interest on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2013, partially offset by growth in average client funds balance of 8% resulting from the continued strength and growth of our Employer Services segment. We invest our funds held for clients in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines, where the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. The portfolio is predominantly invested in AAA/AA rated fixed-income securities. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations.  Our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at June 30, 2014, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $4.1 billion, of which $2.2 billion related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings.  These borrowings were a normal part of our client funds extended investment strategy.  Our net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,821.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,577.2 million in fiscal 2013.  This increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was due to higher net earnings in fiscal 2014, favorable changes in timing differences on the net components of working capital, and lower pension contributions.  The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $2,391.7 million is due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations, partially offset by the timing of purchases and sales of corporate and client fund marketable securities.  The increase in cash used in financing activities of $2,509.2 million is primarily due to the timing of cash received from items such as proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, and payments made related to client funds as compared to the prior year.We have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, excellent margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements.  We continue to enhance value to our shareholders, and in fiscal 2014 returned excess cash of $883.1 million through dividends and $667.3 million through our share buyback program. In the last five fiscal years, we have reduced the Company's common stock outstanding by approximately 4% through share buybacks, net of the effect of common stock issued under employee stock-based compensation programs.  We have also raised the dividend payout per share for 39 consecutive years.     19RESULTS OF OPERATIONSANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSPrior period amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations.(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years ended June 30, $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2014 2013              Total revenues $12,206.5 $11,287.6 $10,595.4 $918.9 $692.2 8 % 7 %              Costs of revenues:             Operating expenses6,248.6 5,731.5 5,355.2 517.1 376.3 9 % 7 %Systems development and    programming costs718.0 654.3 592.7 63.7 61.6 10 % 10 %Depreciation and amortization254.8 252.7 256.0 2.1 (3.3) 1 % (1)%Total costs of revenues7,221.4 6,638.5 6,203.9 582.9 434.6 9 % 7 %              Selling, general and    administrative costs2,762.4 2,617.4 2,452.9 145.0 164.5 6 % 7 %Separation costs14.9 — — 14.9 — 100 % — %Goodwill impairment— 42.7 — (42.7) 42.7 (100)% 100 %Interest expense6.1 9.1 7.7 (3.0) 1.4 (33)% 18 %Total expenses 10,004.8 9,307.7 8,664.5 697.1 643.2 7 % 7 %              Other income, net(72.9) (96.2) (170.8) (23.3) (74.6) (24)% 44 %              Earnings from continuing    operations before income taxes$2,274.6 $2,076.1 $2,101.7 $198.5 $(25.6) 10 % (1)%Margin18.6% 18.4% 19.8%                      Provision for income taxes$772.0 $718.0 $726.5 $54.0 $(8.5) 8 % (1)%Effective tax rate33.9% 34.6% 34.6%                      Net earnings from continuing     operations$1,502.6 $1,358.1 $1,375.2 $144.5 $(17.1) 11 % (1)%              Diluted earnings per share from    continuing operations$3.11 $2.79 $2.79 $0.32 $— 11 % — %20Note 1.

The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 1.8% in fiscal 2014, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2013, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 8%, to $20.7 billion, in fiscal 2014.Total ExpensesOur total expenses increased $697.1 million, or 7%, to $10,004.8 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The increase in our total expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $517.1 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $145.0 million, an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.7 million and separation costs related to the planned separation of our Dealer Services business of $14.9 million in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge of $42.7 million in fiscal 2013.  Total expenses would have increased approximately 8% without the impact of the 2014 separation costs related to the Dealer Services separation and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge.  Our total costs of revenues increased $582.9 million, or 9%, to $7,221.4 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $517.1 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $63.7 million.Operating expenses increased $517.1 million, or 9% in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass-through costs that are re-billable and which include costs for benefits coverage, workers’ compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  These pass-through costs were $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,383.3 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $352.7 million.  These pass-through costs were $1,513.5 million for fiscal 2013, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,193.2 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $320.3 million.  The increase in operating expenses is also due to higher labor-related expenses in Employer Services of $65.9 million. Systems development and programming costs increased $63.7 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $145.0 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The increase in expenses was related to an increase in selling expenses of $81.8 million resulting from investments in our salesforce and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $29.7 million, and $17.9 million higher severance expenses in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.Separation costs represent the incremental costs associated with our planned separation of Dealer Services and totaled $14.9 million for fiscal 2014. We expect to incur separation costs of between $40 million and $50 million during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015"). Other Income, netYears ended June 30,      (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 $ Change       Interest income on corporate funds $(56.2) $(64.5) $(8.3)Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (20.4) (32.1) (11.7)Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 3.9 3.5 (0.4)Gains on sales of buildings — (2.2) (2.2)Other, net (0.2) (0.9) (0.7)Other income, net $(72.9) $(96.2) $(23.3)Other income, net, decreased $23.3 million in fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013.  The decrease was due to a decrease in realized gains on available-for-sale securities of $11.7 million and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $8.3 million in the fiscal 2014, as compared to the fiscal 2013.  The decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted 22from lower average interest rates of 1.5% in fiscal 2013 to 1.4% in fiscal 2014 and lower average daily corporate funds, which decreased from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2014.  In addition, we recognized gains of $2.2 million pertaining to the sale of two buildings during fiscal 2013. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $198.5 million, or 10%, to $2,274.6 million in fiscal 2014, which includes the effect of the $14.9 million of separation costs directly attributable to the proposed separation of our Dealer Services business, compared to $2,076.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge.  Overall margin increased approximately 20 basis points from 18.4% in fiscal 2013 to 18.6% in fiscal 2014.  This increase was due to margin improvements in our business segments, partially offset by approximately 70 basis points of margin decline related to the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients discussed above and 30 basis points of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs.  Overall margin also benefited 20 basis points from the lower costs related to the incremental separation costs of $14.9 million included in fiscal 2014 compared to the $42.7 million charge related to the goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013.  Adjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes    Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased $170.7 million, or 8%, to $2,289.5 million, in fiscal 2014, compared to $2,118.8 million for fiscal 2013, due to increased revenue and margin improvement in our business segments, partially offset by the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients.  Margin, adjusted for the fiscal 2014 separation costs directly attributable to the proposed separation of our Dealer Services business and the fiscal 2013 goodwill impairment charge related to our ADP AdvancedMD business, remained flat at 18.8%.  Margin improvements in our business segments were offset, primarily by approximately 70 basis points of margin decrease related to the continued decline in interest on fund held for clients discussed above and 30 basis of margin decline due to increased stock-based compensation costs.   Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 33.9% and 34.6%, respectively.  The effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 includes a 0.2 percentage point increase due to the non tax-deductible separation costs related to our planned separation of our Dealer Services business and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 includes a 0.7 percentage point increase due to the fiscal 2013 non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.  The remaining decrease of 0 basis points is due to the resolution of certain tax matters and the reversal of a valuation allowance, partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and reduced foreign tax credits available.Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations increased $144.5 million, or 11%, to $1,502.6 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $1,358.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 11% to $3.11 in fiscal 2014, as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased $116.7 million, or 8%, to $1,517.5 million, in fiscal 2014, as compared to $1,400.8 million for fiscal 2013, and the adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9%, to $3.14 for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.88, for fiscal 2013.  The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 reflects the increase in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.23Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Total RevenuesOur total revenues increased $692.2 million, or 7%, to $11,287.6 million in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, due to an increase in revenues in Employer Services of 6%, or $475.5 million, to $7,924.9 million, PEO Services of 11%, or $201.8 million, to $1,973.2 million, and Dealer Services of 9%, or $144.0 million, to $1,820.2 million. Total revenues would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of recently completed acquisitions and the impact to revenues pertaining to the sale in fiscal 2012 of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform.  In addition, revenues decreased $61.3 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Total revenues for fiscal 2013 include interest on funds held for clients of $420.9 million, as compared to $493.3 million in fiscal 2012.  The decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned to 2.2% during fiscal 2013, as compared to 2.8% for fiscal 2012, partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balance of 7%, to $19.2 billion in fiscal 2013.  Total ExpensesOur total expenses increased $643.2 million, or 7%, to $9,307.7 million in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.  The increase in our total expenses was due to an increase in operating expenses of $376.3 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $164.5 million, and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $61.6 million.  Total expenses would have increased approximately 6% without the impact of recently completed acquisitions.Our total costs of revenues increased 7%, to $6,638.5 million in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in operating expenses of $376.3 million and an increase in systems development and programming costs of $61.6 million.Operating expenses increased $376.3 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012 due to the increase in revenues described above, including the increases in PEO Services, which has pass-through costs that are re-billable and which includes costs for benefits coverage, workers’ compensation coverage and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  These pass-through costs were $1,513.5 million for fiscal 2013, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,193.2 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $320.3 million. These pass-through costs were $1,363.6 million for fiscal 2012, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,060.3 million and costs for workers’ compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $303.3 million.  The increase in operating expenses is also due to expenses related to businesses acquired of $84.4 million and higher labor-related expenses in Employer Services of $69.4 million, partially offset by a decrease of $34.0 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Systems development and programming costs increased $61.6 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, due to increased costs to develop, support, and maintain our products and increased costs related to businesses acquired of $6.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $6.7 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $164.5 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.  The increase in expenses was related to an increase in selling expenses of $72.9 million resulting from investments in our salesforce and an increase in expenses of businesses acquired of $16.3 million, partially offset by a decrease of $24.6 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Additionally, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $24.1 million due to lower severance expenses in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.24 Other Income, netYears ended June 30,      (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 $ Change       Interest income on corporate funds $(64.5) $(85.2) $(20.7)Realized gains on available-for-sale securities (32.1) (32.1) —Realized losses on available-for-sale securities 3.5 7.7 4.2Impairment losses on available-for-sale securities — 5.8 5.8Impairment losses on assets held for sale — 2.2 2.2Gains on sales of buildings (2.2) — 2.2Gain on sale of assets — (66.0) (66.0)Other, net (0.9) (3.2) (2.3)Other income, net $(96.2) $(170.8) $(74.6)Other income, net, decreased $74.6 million in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.  The decrease was due to a $66.0 million gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform in fiscal 2012 and a decrease in interest income on corporate funds of $20.7 million in fiscal 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012.  The decrease in interest income on corporate funds resulted from lower average interest rates from 2.1% in fiscal 2012 to 1.5% in fiscal 2013, partially offset by increasing average daily corporate funds, which increased from $4.0 billion in fiscal 2012 to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013.  Such decreases were partially offset by gains of $2.2 million pertaining to the sale of two buildings in fiscal 2013, a $5.8 million impairment loss on available-for-sale securities in fiscal 2012, and an impairment loss of $2.2 million related to assets previously classified as assets held for sale in fiscal 2012.Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income TaxesEarnings from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $25.6 million, or 1%, to $2,076.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge, compared to $2,101.7 million in fiscal 2012, which includes the effect of a $66.0 million gain on the sale of assets related to the rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform.  Overall margin decreased approximately 140 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal 2012 to 18.4% in fiscal 2013 with approximately 40 basis points of margin decrease attributable to the goodwill impairment charge, 20 basis points of margin decrease attributable to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2012, and 90 basis points related to the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients discussed above.  In addition, overall margin decreased approximately 60 basis points due to the fiscal 2012 gain on the sale of assets related to the rights and obligations to resell a third-party management platform.  These decreases were partially offset by margin improvements in our business segments.

Margin, adjusted for the 2013 goodwill impairment charge related to our ADP AdvancedMD business and a gain on the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform in fiscal 2012, decreased approximately 40 basis points from 19.2% in fiscal 2012 to 18.8% in fiscal 2013 due to approximately 90 basis points of margin decline related to the continued decline in interest on funds held for clients discussed above, partially offset by margin improvements in our business segments.Provision for Income TaxesThe effective tax rates in both fiscal 2013 and 2012 were 34.6%.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 includes the effect of a non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $42.7 million that increased our effective tax rate by 0.7 percentage points in the period.  The 0.7 percentage point increase was offset by a reduction in foreign taxes and the availability of higher foreign tax credits in fiscal 2013, as compared to 2012.25Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing OperationsNet earnings from continuing operations decreased $17.1 million, or 1%, to $1,358.1 million in fiscal 2013, which includes the effect of the $42.7 million goodwill impairment charge, compared to $1,375.2 million in fiscal 2012, which included the effect of an after tax gain on the sale of assets of $41.2 million.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was flat in fiscal 2013, as compared to $2.79 in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the decrease in net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.Adjusted Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations    Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased $66.8 million, or 5%, to $1,400.8 million, in fiscal 2013, as compared to $1,334.0 million for fiscal 2012, and the adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6%, to $2.88 for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.71 for fiscal 2012.  The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2013 reflects the increase in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the net impact of cumulative share repurchases, offset by the issuances of shares under our stock-based compensation programs.ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTSRevenues from Continuing Operations(Dollars in millions)  Years ended June 30, $ Change % Change  2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2014 2013Employer Services $8,535.2 $7,924.9$7,449.4 $610.3 $475.5 8% 6%PEO Services 2,270.9 1,973.2 1,771.4 297.7 201.8 15% 11%Dealer Services 1,951.4 1,820.2 1,676.2 131.2 144.0 7% 9%Other (0.9) 1.7 5.5        Reconciling items:              Client fund interest (550.1) (432.4) (307.1)          $12,206.5 $11,287.6 $10,595.4 $918.9 $692.2 8% 7% 26 Earnings from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes(Dollars in millions)  Years ended June 30,  $ Change % Change  2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2014 2013Employer Services $2,517.8 $2,216.8 $2,054.6 $301.0 $162.2 14% 8 %PEO Services  234.3 199.7 171.1 34.6 28.6 17% 17 %Dealer Services 428.1 375.3 322.1 52.8 53.2 14% 17 %Other (355.5) (283.3) (139.0)        Reconciling items:              Client fund interest (550.1) (432.4) (307.1)          $2,274.6 $2,076.1 $2,101.7
