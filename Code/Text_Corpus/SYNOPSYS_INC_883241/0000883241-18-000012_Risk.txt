Risk Factors.Despite global economic uncertainty, we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases or increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.Our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market. As we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software security and quality space, and as hardware product sales grow, we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue.  In addition, due to our adoption of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019, as further described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements will increase the variability in our total revenue from period to period.  Nevertheless, this accounting impact will not affect our cash generation or change the way we operate our business. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year.  Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2018. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 52-week years ending on October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, respectively. Fiscal 2019 will be a 52-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2018 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, our financial performance reflects the following:•Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of $396.2 million or 15%, primarily driven by the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher TSL revenue, acquisitions, and professional services revenue. The increase also included additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to the extra week in fiscal 2018;  •Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.8 billion, an increase of $383.5 million or 16%, primarily due to increases in headcount, including those from acquisitions. The increase also included one additional week of expenses of approximately $33.7 million;•Higher operating income of $360.2 million, an increase of $12.7 million or 4%; and•Benefit for income taxes of $69.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to provision for income taxes of $246.5 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the expense recorded for repatriation in fiscal 2017, 29Table of Contentscompared to the benefit recorded for restructuring of foreign IP rights, and a decrease in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in fiscal 2018.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses and to a lesser extent, hardware products, maintenance and services. Time-based products revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products, and professional services fees. Upfront products revenue includes hardware revenue consisting of sales of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based emulation and prototyping products and perpetual software licenses. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract, our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs, or projects, in different phases of the design. During this time, the customer looks to us to release state-of-the-art technology as we keep up with the pace of change, to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications, to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design, including the final manufacturing of the chip (the tape-out stage), and other important services.  With respect to software licenses, we primarily utilize two license types: •Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer with limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The majority of our arrangements are TSLs due to the nature of the business and customer requirements. In addition to the licenses, the arrangements also include: post-contract customer support, which includes providing frequent updates and upgrades to maintain the utility of the software due to rapid changes in technology; other intertwined services such as multiple copies of the tools; assistance to our customers in applying our technology in their development environment; and rights to remix licenses for other licenses.•Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the two software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: •TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of 30Table of Contentsthe maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products, and professional services fees. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customers as needed. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.Hardware revenue consists of sales of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, such as royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services, that require significant modification or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as "maintenance and service revenue" in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software-related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. With respect to TSL arrangements, due to the complexity of the tools, the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services, the license, maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit. Additionally, we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate the fee between these services. Therefore, we recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue recognition involves certain judgments. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: •Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us, or a 31Table of Contentspurchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. •Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. •The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. •Collectability Is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.Valuation of Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities including contingencies assumed, and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Any excess fair value of purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.  The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make estimates and assumptions, based in part on our judgments, in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, future cash flows of an acquired business, other assumptions and the appropriate discount rate. These estimates are inherently difficult, subjective and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the fair value allocation to the acquired intangible assets could be different. Therefore, our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.32Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. Determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets require assumptions, judgments, and estimates.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.  In fiscal 2018, we also considered the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $397.4 million, which are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2018, based on current tax law, will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset or a valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period that such determination is made.Uncertain tax positions are recorded by applying a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.  The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of OperationsRevenue BackgroundWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses, maintenance and services, and to a lesser extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. •In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The weighted-average term of the TSLs is typically three years, but varies from quarter to quarter due to the nature and timing of the arrangements entered into during the quarter. The weighted-average term of the TSLs we entered into in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was 2.7 years, 2.7 years and 3.0 years, respectively. •Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of modification or development. •Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped and when title is transferred. •Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs.•Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).•Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized as the services are performed. •Infrequently, we enter into certain license arrangements wherein licenses are provided for a finite term without any other services or rights, including rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We recognize revenue from these term licenses in full upon shipment of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met.33Table of ContentsOur revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based products, upfront products, and maintenance and services revenues for the period. We derive time-based products revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront products revenue directly from perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31, $ Change     % Change     $ Change     % Change    2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017(dollars in millions)$3,121.1 $2,724.9 $2,422.5 $396.2 15% $302.4 12%The overall growth of our business, including contributions from acquisitions, has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals.  For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP consulting projects, royalties, and variability in hardware sales, and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due. As revenue from hardware sales is recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such hardware may result in increased variability of our total revenue.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business, mainly due to higher TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, an increase in professional services, additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and contributions from acquired companies.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues, hardware sales, and IP consulting projects and, to a lesser extent, due to revenue from acquired companies.For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.34Table of ContentsTime-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions) $2,303.3 $2,021.8 $1,910.9 $281.5 14% $110.9 6%Percentage of total revenue74% 74% 79%        The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods, including contributions from acquired companies, and additional revenue due to an extra week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions) $357.7 $338.2 $248.1 $19.5 6% $90.1 36%Percentage of total revenue11% 12% 10%        Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements.Upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate modestly based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales.

The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, including those from acquisitions, and related fixed charges including facilities, as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, or fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$448.4 $413.2 $346.9 $35.2 9% $66.3 19 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue203.5 164.9 94.0 38.6 23% 70.9 75 %Amortization of intangible assets84.0 76.1 102.1 7.9 10% (26.0) (25)%Total$735.9 $654.2 $543.0 $81.7 12% $111.2 20 %Percentage of total revenue24% 24% 22%        We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. We expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.36Table of ContentsAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $47.7 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in costs related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, and an increase of $7.9 million in amortization of intangible assets, as well as one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 mi
