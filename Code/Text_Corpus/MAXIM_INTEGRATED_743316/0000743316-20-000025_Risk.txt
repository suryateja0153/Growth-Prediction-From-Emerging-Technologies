A review of our fiscal year 2019 performance compared to fiscal year 2018 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019 under the caption "Results of Operations". Net RevenuesWe reported net revenues of $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net revenues in fiscal year 2020 decreased by 5% compared to our net revenues in fiscal year 2019. Revenue from consumer products was down 21% due to lower demand in cell phone products, partially offset by a higher demand in wearable products. Revenue from communications and data center products was up 11% due to higher demand for base station 28and data center products, partially offset by lower demand in network and datacom products. Revenue from automotive products was down 5% due to lower demand in auto body electronics and infotainment products, partially offset by higher demand in safety and security products. These results include net revenues for the fiscal year 2019 that align with our revised end-market categories.Approximately 89% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, were derived from shipments to customers located outside the United States, primarily in Asia and Europe. Less than 1% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net revenues and our results of operations for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were immaterial.Gross MarginOur gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4% in fiscal year 2020 compared to 64.8% in fiscal year 2019. Despite the decrease in net revenue in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, gross margins as a percentage of net revenue was higher due to lower inventory reserves and lower amortization expenses recognized in cost of goods sold in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses were $440.2 million and $435.2 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represented 20.1% and 18.8% of net revenues, respectively. The $4.9 million increase in research and development expenses was due to higher salaries and other personnel related costs. The level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period depending, in part, on the level of net revenues and on our success in recruiting the technical personnel needed for our new product introductions and process development. We view research and development expenditures as critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions, which in turn are critical to our plans for future growth.Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expenses were $296.7 million and $308.6 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represented 13.5% and 13.3% of net revenues, respectively. The $11.9 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to lower depreciation and travel expenses. The level of selling, general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period, depending on the level of net revenues and our success in recruiting sales and administrative personnel needed to support our operations. Interest and Other Income (Expense), NetInterest and other income (expense), net was $(8.3) million in fiscal year 2020 and $7.3 million in fiscal year 2019, which represented (0.4)% and 0.3% of net revenues, respectively. The change in interest income (expense) is due to lower interest income, partially offset by lower interest expense. Interest income is lower by $17.6 million due to lower investment yields from cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense is lower by $7.7 million due to repayment of $500.0 million of notes in November 2018. Provision (Benefit) for Income TaxesOur annual income tax expense (benefit) was $23.4 million and ($73.1) million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate was 3.5% and (9.7)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was enacted. The Act included a one-time tax on accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”). SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act was not completed. Provisional amounts must be adjusted within a one-year measurement period from the enactment date of the Act. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a $236.9 million provisional Transition Tax charge. During the measurement period we gathered information and analyzed available guidance and in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 recorded a $22.1 million Transition Tax charge, which increased the Company’s fiscal year 2019 tax rate by 2.9%. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 accounting for income tax effects of the Act was completed.29The Act included Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which first impact us in fiscal year 2019. The GILTI provisions effectively subject income earned by our foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits. We elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.In fiscal year 2019, we reversed $221.5 million of uncertain tax position reserves and $30.1 million of related interest reserves, net of federal and state benefits, primarily due to the fiscal fourth quarter settlement of an audit of our fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2011 federal corporate income tax returns, which also settled intercompany buy-in license payment issues for fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2019. Fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2018 advance tax payments made in June 2018 of $140.7 million were applied to additional federal tax liabilities generated by the settlement. The reversal of uncertain tax position reserves for intercompany transfer pricing issues increased accumulated unremitted foreign earnings, which resulted in an additional Transition Tax charge of $47.7 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.In fiscal year 2020, we reversed $40.5 million of uncertain tax position reserves and $10.7 million of related interest reserves, net of federal and state benefits, primarily due to the fiscal fourth quarter settlement of an audit of our fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2014 federal corporate income tax returns. The reversal of uncertain tax position reserves for intercompany transfer pricing issues increased accumulated unremitted foreign earnings, which resulted in an additional Transition Tax charge of $6.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.Our federal statutory tax rate is 21%. Our fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the $51.2 million reversal of uncertain tax position and related interest reserves, and earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates. These impacts were partially offset by tax generated by GILTI provisions and a $6.5 million Transition Tax charge.Our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the $251.6 million reversal of uncertain tax position and related interest reserves, and earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates. These impacts were partially offset by tax generated by GILTI provisions and a $68.7 million Transition Tax charge.We have various entities domiciled within and outside the United States. The following is a breakout of our U.S. and foreign income (loss) before income taxes: For the Year Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 (in thousands)Domestic pre-tax income $72,854 $103,016 $149,056Foreign pre-tax income605,242 651,405 675,829Total$678,096 $754,421 $824,885A relative increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland, may lower our consolidated effective tax rate, while a relative increase in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, such as the United States, may increase our consolidated effective tax rate. However, after fiscal year 2018 the consolidated effective tax rate impact of earnings changes in various tax jurisdictions is not as significant due to the reduction of the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Act and the GILTI provisions, which effectively subject income earned by our foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRefer to our discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements as included in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and financial statement schedules, Note 2: “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancial Condition30Cash flows were as follows: For the Year Ended June 27, 2020 June 29, 2019 June 30, 2018 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$800,855 $875,840 $819,464Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities(32,049) 856,911 (710,066)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(940,720) (1,518,893) (812,035)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $(171,914) $213,858 $(702,637)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities was $800.9 million in fiscal year 2020, a decrease of $75.0 million compared with fiscal year 2019. This decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in net income of $172.8 million and changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by a decrease in changes in income tax payable, accrued salary and related expenses, and other liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in changes in accounts receivable, inventory and other assets.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases and maturities, and acquisitions.Cash used in investing activities was $32.0 million in fiscal year 2020, a decrease of $889.0 million compared with fiscal year 2019. The change was due to a $1.0 billion decrease in maturities of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a $214.6 million decrease in purchases of available-for-sale securities. The Company also paid $69.3 million, net of cash acquired, for an acquisition during fiscal year 2020. Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of new borrowings, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of notes payables, payment of dividends to stockholders, proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan and withholding tax payments associated with net share settlements of equity awards.Net cash used in financing activities was $940.7 million in fiscal year 2020, a decrease of $578.2 million compared with fiscal year 2019. Cash used in financing activities was lower due to a payment of $500.0 million of debt in fiscal year 2019 and a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $98.3 million, partially offset by an increase in dividend payments of $11.6 million. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operating activities resulting from net income and management of working capital. As of June 27, 2020, our available funds consisted of $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In January 2019, the Company terminated its $350.0 million revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders.In November 2018, the Company repaid $500.0 million of principal and related outstanding interest of the Company's 2.5% coupon notes.On October 30, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock. During the years ended June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of $440.8 million and $539.2 million, respectively, of the Company's common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the ADI Merger Agreement, the Company suspended its repurchase program on July 13, 2020, the date we announced our planned merger with ADI. 31We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures and debt repayments for at least the next twelve months.A cash dividend of $0.48 per share will be paid on September 11, 2020, to stockholders of record on August 27, 2020. The Company will neither declare nor pay a dividend in any of the next succeeding four fiscal quarters, as provided in the ADI Merger Agreement.. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of June 27, 2020, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payment due by period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years (in thousands)Outstanding debt obligations (1)$1,000,000 $— $500,000 $— $500,000Inventory-related purchase obligations (2)352,960 54,206 91,599 83,152 124,003Transition tax (3)264,088 26,927 53,855 117,807 65,499Interest payments associated with debt obligations (4)166,437 34,125 64,031 34,500 33,781Operating lease obligations (5) 65,545 12,144 20,730 15,588 17,083Contingent liability14,165 10,000 4,165 — —Total $1,783,485 $115,258 $709,485 $235,459 $723,283(1) Outstanding debt represents amounts due for our long-term notes.(2) We order materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities. We are obligated to pay for the materials and supplies when received. (3) Transition tax on accumulated unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, paid in eight interest-free installments beginning in September 2018.(4) Interest payments calculated based on contractual payment requirements under the debt agreements.(5) We lease facilities under non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through fiscal year 2031.Purchase orders for the purchase of the majority of our raw materials and other goods and services are not included above. Our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short-term requirements. As of June 27, 2020, our gross unrecognized income tax benefits were $174.3 million which excludes $24.6 million of accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments of these amounts, if any, in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing or outcomes of either actual or anticipated tax audits. As a result, these amounts are not included in the table above.Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsAs of June 27, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
