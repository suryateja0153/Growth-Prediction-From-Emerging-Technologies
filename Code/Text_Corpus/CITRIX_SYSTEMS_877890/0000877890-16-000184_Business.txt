Business OverviewFor 27 years, Citrix has innovated and delivered products consistent with a vision of a workplace where people can securely and easily collaborate across boundaries of time, place and device, creating better business outcomes, improving productivity, and making businesses far more agile and responsive to change - both in information technology change as well as business change.Proposed Spin-off TransactionOn November 17, 2015, we announced a plan to spinoff our "GoTo" family of products into a separate, publicly traded company. The proposed separation, which is intended to be a tax-free spinoff to our stockholders, is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016. Upon completion of the separation, Chris Hylen, who currently serves as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Mobility Apps business unit, will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the new company. The company established as a result of the spinoff will be made up of the following Mobility Apps products and services: GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice. Immediately following the separation, Citrix shareholders will own shares in two publicly traded companies. The new spinoff company will more effectively allocate resources in line with its own market opportunity, unique growth priorities and go-to-market capabilities, as well as adapt more quickly to SaaS market and customer dynamics; and, Citrix post-spinoff, will focus on its strategic solutions for secure and reliable delivery of applications and data.The spinoff will be subject to customary closing conditions and final approval by our Board of Directors.
