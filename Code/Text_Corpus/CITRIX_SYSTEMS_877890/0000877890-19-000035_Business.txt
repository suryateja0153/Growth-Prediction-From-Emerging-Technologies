BUSINESSBusiness OverviewCitrix Systems, Inc., or Citrix, the Company, we or us, is a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 17, 1989. Citrix aims to power a better way to work by delivering the experience, security, and choice people and organizations need to unlock innovation, engage customers, and be productive - anytime, anywhere. It is our vision to deliver a general purpose digital workspace that empowers all users with unified, secure, and reliable access to all apps and content needed to be productive - anytime, anywhere. We help customers reimagine the future of work by delivering unified digital workspace, networking, and analytics solutions that improve employee experience and productivity, while also simplifying IT’s ability to adopt and manage complex cloud environments.Digital transformation is occurring in every industry at a rapid pace. Businesses today are adopting cloud services and software as a service, or SaaS, apps on a broad basis. Many businesses are juggling multiple cloud providers and dozens of new SaaS apps. Yet, we believe many organizations will still be managing legacy infrastructure and on-premises workloads for many years to come. This combination of increased complexity with mobility and new workstyles results in a fragmented user experience, an increase in security risks, and IT teams challenged to properly manage the technology needs of organizations.As a result of this convergence of cloud, legacy systems, and newer technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, organizations are now seeking to adopt multi-cloud, hybrid-cloud strategies for their IT infrastructure, so that they can provide flexibility to navigate all systems and security to address ever-expanding attack surfaces, all without sacrificing experience for their end users.As we continue on our journey of cloud transformation as an organization, we are focused on three strategic priorities. First, we are accelerating our move to a subscription-based business model and to offer all of our solutions as cloud services to give organizations flexibility in how they work. Second, we are continuing to unify our portfolio to simplify user and IT experience. Finally, to help meet the expected demands of the future, we are expanding our opportunities with adjacent technologies to help extend value to our customers and meet their needs in the future. In 2018, Citrix made acquisitions in two such areas, acquiring Cedexis for Intelligent Traffic Management to boost the capabilities of our networking solutions, and Sapho to expand Intelligent Workflow capabilities into the Citrix Workspace solutions. In 2018, we retired all of our point product brand names to simplify our positioning and product naming to make our solutions easier to understand, sell and buy. Citrix simplified its solutions naming to three categories: Digital Workspace, Networking, and Analytics. We moved all products to a functional descriptor naming mechanism, such as Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, Citrix ADC, Citrix SD-WAN, Citrix Endpoint Management, etc. We market and license our solutions through multiple channels worldwide, including selling through resellers and direct over the Web. Our partner community comprises thousands of value-added resellers, or VARs known as Citrix Solution Advisors, value-added distributors, or VADs, systems integrators, or SIs, independent software vendors, or ISVs, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and Citrix Service Providers, or CSPs.Separation of GoTo BusinessOn January 31, 2017, we completed the separation and subsequent merger of the GoTo family of service offerings of our wholly-owned subsidiary, GetGo, Inc., or GetGo, to LogMeIn, Inc., or LogMeIn, pursuant to a pro rata distribution to our stockholders of 100% of the shares of common stock of GetGo, pursuant to a Reverse Morris Trust, or RMT, transaction. The GoTo family of service offerings consisted of GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToTraining, GoToMyPC, GoToAssist, Grasshopper and OpenVoice, or collectively the GoTo Business, and had historically been part of our GoTo Business segment. As a result, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related financial information reflect the GoTo Business operations, assets and liabilities, and cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 3Solutions and ServicesWe are enabling the future of work by delivering digital workspace, networking, and analytics solutions that help customers drive innovation and be productive anytime, anywhere.
