BusinessOur CompanyLeidos Holdings, Inc. ("Leidos") is a holding company. Its principal operating company, Leidos, Inc. was formed in 1969 by a small group of scientists led by physicist Dr. Robert Beyster. Since our founding 46 years ago, we have applied our expertise in science, research and engineering in rapidly evolving technologies and markets to solve complex problems of national concern.Leidos is an applied technology company delivering solutions and services that leverage expertise in the national security, health and engineering markets. We bring domain-specific capability to each of our markets, including imagery and signals intelligence, advanced sensing phenomenology, intelligence collection methods, life sciences and power grid engineering. In addition to market-specific capability, we have three core areas of technical expertise: data analytics, systems engineering and cybersecurity. Customer needs in our markets span these three core areas of expertise, enabling cross-market innovations for our entire customer set. We provide these solutions and services to government and commercial customers, both domestically and internationally. Leidos' technically advanced solutions have enabled us to build strong ties with our key customers. These customers include agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"), other U.S. Government civil agencies, state and local government agencies, and government agencies of U.S. allies abroad. With a focus on delivering mission-critical solutions, Leidos generates over 79% of our total revenues from U.S. Government contracts. A majority of that work supports the U.S. intelligence community.Building on our foundation in offering innovative services and solutions to U.S. Government customers, Leidos is expanding into international government and broader commercial markets. By leveraging expertise in multiple disciplines, tailoring our solutions to the particular needs of our targeted markets, and using advanced analytics, we work to securely deliver solutions that not only meet customers’ current goals, but also support their future endeavors. On September 27, 2013 (the "Distribution Date"), Leidos completed the spin-off of our technical services and enterprise information technology services business into an independent, publicly traded company named Science Applications International Corporation ("New SAIC"). The separation was effected through a tax-free distribution to Leidos' stockholders of 100% of the shares of New SAIC's common stock. On the Distribution Date, New SAIC's common stock was distributed, on a pro rata basis, to Leidos' stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 19, 2013, the record date. Each holder of Leidos common stock received one share of New SAIC common stock for every seven shares of Leidos common stock held on the record date. Prior to the Distribution Date, Leidos Holdings, Inc. was named SAIC, Inc. and Leidos, Inc. was named Science Applications International Corporation.As a result of the spin-off, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of New SAIC have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. References to financial data are to our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.Immediately following the spin-off, Leidos effectuated a one-for-four reverse stock split of its shares of common stock, so that every four shares of Leidos common stock issued and outstanding were combined and converted into one share of Leidos common stock. Each reference to the number of shares outstanding or per share amounts has been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented.For additional discussion and analysis related to recent business developments, see “Business Environment and Trends” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer collectively to Leidos Holdings, Inc., Leidos, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise noted, references to fiscal years are to fiscal years ended the Friday closest to January 31. For example, fiscal 2015 began on February 1, 2014 and ended on January 30, 2015.

Our total revenues are largely attributable to prime contracts or to subcontracts with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. Government, with remaining being customers across a variety of commercial markets including healthcare, energy, manufacturing and transportation. Within the U.S. Government, our revenues are diversified across many agencies, including various intelligence agencies, the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force, research agencies like DARPA, DHS, NASA and others. The percentage of total revenues for the U.S. Government its agencies and other customers comprising more than 10% of total revenues in any of the three years ended January 30, 2015, January 31, 2014, and January 31, 2013 were as follows: Year Ended January 30, 2015 January 31, 2014 January 31, 2013U.S. Government79% 78% 81%U.S. DoD67% 68% 70%U.S. Army16% 19% 23%Maryland Procurement Office10% 8% 8%These customers have a number of subsidiary agencies that have separate budgets and procurement functions. Our contracts may be with the highest level of these agencies or with the subsidiary agencies of these customers.Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report 5PART I   Employees As of January 30, 2015, we employed approximately 19,000 full and part-time employees. The experience and expertise of our employees makes Leidos capable of solving the most daunting problems facing our customers. Approximately 40% of our employees have degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics fields, close to 1,000 employees have doctoral degrees, and nearly 50% of our employees possess security clearances. The highly technical and complex services and products that we provide are dependent upon the availability of professional, administrative and technical personnel having high levels of training and skills and, in many cases, security clearances. Due to the increased competition for qualified personnel, we have experienced and may continue to face some difficulties in attracting and retaining employees with certain specialized skillsets. We continue to devote significant resources to recruit, develop and retain qualified employees.Leidos has a framework of values, beliefs, and expectations that guide the company’s employees. The company has three tenants that define the actions and behaviors of its employees:•Employees are inspired to make a difference. We solve the world’s toughest problems; connect cross-enterprise knowledge and technology; and unlock creativity and innovation by embracing differences.•Employees are passionate about customer success. We make customer needs our own; create market-leading solutions; and deliver superior results.•Employees are united as a team. We behave with ethics and integrity; trust one another; collaborate and share ideas; and create value for our employees, shareholders and communities.Research and Development We conduct research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded internal research and development ("IR&D") funds. IR&D efforts consist of projects involving basic research, applied research, development, and systems and other concept formulation studies. IR&D expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to U.S. Government contracts. In fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, our company-funded IR&D expense was $37 million, $45 million, and $47 million, respectively, which as a percentage of sales was 0.7%, 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively. We charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues for those contracts.Patents and Proprietary Information Our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, although we do selectively seek patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected by copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, contracts and other means. We selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties.In connection with the performance of services, the U.S. Government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. Government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. Government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor may also have certain rights to the programs and products that we develop under the subcontract.Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report 6PART I   CompetitionCompetition for contracts is intense, and we often compete against a large number of established multinational corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition, financial resources, and larger technical staffs. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas, as well as the U.S. Government’s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. Government and our commercial customers, we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts, and bid against these same companies in other situations. We believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies:•the engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors that provide U.S. Government IT services in addition to other hardware systems and products, including companies such as The Boeing Company, General Dynamics Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, BAE Systems plc, L-3 Communications Corporation and Raytheon Company;•contractors focused principally on technical services, including U.S. Government IT services, such as Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., Engility Holdings, Inc., CACI International Inc, ManTech International Corporation, Serco Group plc, SRA International, Inc. and MITRE Corporation;•diversified commercial and U.S. Government IT providers, such as Accenture plc, Computer Sciences Corporation ("CSC"), HP Enterprise Services, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Unisys Corporation;•contractors that provide engineering, consulting, design and construction services, such as Jacobs Engineering Group, URS Corporation, KBR, Inc. and CH2M Hill Companies Ltd.;•contractors focused on supplying homeland security product solutions, including American Science and Engineering, Inc., OSI Systems, Inc., L-3 Communications Corporation, General Electric Company and Smiths Group plc;•contractors providing supply chain management and other logistics services, including Agility Logistics Corp.; and•companies focused on providing health solutions and services to the U.S. Government and hospitals, including Accenture, IBM, CSC, Cerner Corporation, Epic Systems and Allscripts.We compete on various factors, including our technical expertise and qualified professional and/or security-cleared personnel; our ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner; successful program execution; our reputation and standing with customers, pricing, and the size and geographic presence of our company.The U.S. Government has indicated that it intends to increase competition for future procurement of products and services, which has led to fewer sole source awards and more emphasis on cost-competitiveness and affordability. In addition, procurement initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus priorities, and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole, which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs.Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report 7PART I   Contract Procurement Our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other contracts. The U.S. Government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Today, U.S. Government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. Government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. Government agencies procure services and products include the following:•Single Award Contracts. U.S. Government agencies may procure services and products through single award contracts which specify the scope of services or products purchased and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services or products. When an agency has a requirement, the agency will issue a solicitation or request for proposal to which interested contractors can submit a proposal. The process of issuing solicitations or request for proposals and evaluating contractor bids requires the agency to maintain a large, professional procurement staff and the bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. For the contractor, this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single successful awardee.•Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity ("IDIQ") Contracts. The U.S. Government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. Government then issues task orders under the IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single-award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are awarded to one pre-selected contractor. Under a multiple-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-selected contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multiple-award IDIQ contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as “government-wide acquisition contracts”. IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, therefore enabling, but not committing, the U.S. Government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the award of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. Government will purchase under the contract, and in the case of a multiple-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made.•U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA") Schedule Contracts. The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreed-upon prices for use throughout the U.S. Government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule contract to meet its requirements, the agency, or the GSA on behalf of the agency, conducts the procurement. The user agency, or the GSA on its behalf, evaluates the user agency’s requirements and initiates a competition limited to GSA Schedule qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. Government will purchase under the contract.We often team with other parties, including our competitors, to submit bids for large U.S. Government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract. Our relationships with our teammates, including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor, vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the Leidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report 8PART I   program, contract or customer requirements, as well as the relative size, qualifications, capabilities, customer relationships and experience of our company and our teammates.Contracting with the U.S. Government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks, including the U.S. Government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the U.S. Government issues a termination for convenience. These regulations and risks are described in more detail below under “Business–Regulation” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Contract Types Generally, the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. Government and may depend on certain factors, including the type and complexity of the work to be performed, degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance, the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following:•Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee. This type of contract is generally used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk, but generally require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and amount of costs.•Time-and-materials ("T&M") contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty of the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. On T&M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts.•Fixed-pr
