Payment TermsPayment terms vary worldwide, depending on the arrangement. Generally, contract payment terms range from 30 to 45 days from the invoice date within North America and typically do not exceed 90 days from the invoice date in regions outside of North America. A portion of the contracts within our Government segment include implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation and system acceptance, which generally take 30 to 180 days to complete. Invoicing the customer is dependent on completion of the milestone.We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price. 5Regulatory Matters The use of wireless voice, data and video communications systems requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”).  We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. These include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or hand held devices. Consequently, our results could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC, NTIA or regulatory agencies in other countries. Our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum.  The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities, and consequently, the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. As television transmission and reception technology transitions from analog to more efficient digital modes, various countries around the world are examining, and in some cases already pursuing, the redevelopment of portions of the television  spectrum. In the U.S., pursuant to federal legislation, analog television stations ceased operation in the broadcast television spectrum on June 12, 2009. As a result of this transition, 108 MHz of spectrum historically used for broadcast television,  known as the 700MHz band, has been redeveloped and deployed for new uses (the so-called “digital dividend” spectrum), including broadband and narrowband wireless communications.  The 700 MHz band spectrum is open nationwide and according to FCC records, over 193 public safety agencies throughout over 31 states have been deploying narrowband operations at 700 MHz and others are in the planning stages.  These deployments create opportunities for our narrowband ASTRO solutions.  For example, in August 2013, the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System Authority (LA-RICS) selected Motorola Solutions to develop a radio system that will provide mission critical communications for the region’s more than 34,000 law enforcement, fire service and health service professionals and more than 80 public safety agencies.    Thirty-four MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band is now allocated to support new public safety narrowband and broadband communications systems.  This includes 24 MHz of spectrum previously allocated by the FCC and an additional ten MHz of spectrum (the “D block”) allocated in February 2012.  The latter ten MHz allocation is the result of congressional action responding to public safety requests for additional broadband spectrum.  The resulting law, Public Law 112-96, also identified up to $7 billion in funding for the nationwide public safety broadband network with $2 billion of that available near-term.  Pursuant to this law, a governance structure and entity known as the First Responder Network Authority ("FirstNet") was established in August 2012 to manage deployment and operation of the network.  Additional work, currently ongoing in FirstNet, is required to enable deployment of the nationwide public safety broadband network.  During 2013, FirstNet released multiple Requests for Information ("RFI’s") seeking information concerning this initiative.  In response, Motorola Solutions has provided input based on its experience in designing and deploying public safety communications systems.  FirstNet and the FCC have also enabled the early deployment of broadband systems in several areas so that field experience can be gained regarding the benefits of broadband communications for public safety operations. In September 2012, the State of Texas received a Special Temporary Authorization ("STA") for deployment of 14 broadband sites in the Harris County area around Houston, and that authorization was extended through 2013 and they are currently in negotiations with Firstnet.  The State of Texas and Harris County, with assistance from Motorola Solutions, have deployed broadband equipment and applications and successfully demonstrated the benefits such systems can bring to FirstNet and other officials.  FirstNet also entered into a spectrum lease with LA-RICS, the State of New Mexico, the State of New Jersey, and Adams County, Pennsylvania, to enable early deployments of  broadband equipment.  Such early deployments would help speed interoperable broadband capabilities for first-responders and the experience gained regarding public safety broadband operation should benefit FirstNet in developing and implementing its plan to deploy the nationwide network.  The planned implementation of a nationwide public safety network and any additional early deployments may also create opportunities for our broadband solutions. In March 2012, Canada released a decision to allocate ten MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety broadband.  Subsequently, in August 2012, Canada proposed that an additional and adjacent ten MHz also be allocated to public safety for broadband use.  A decision on that additional ten MHz of spectrum is expected in 2014.  If adopted, this would harmonize Canada's 700 MHz band plan with that in the U.S.In June 2013, in Mexico, the Constitutional Reform in Telecommunications Law went into effect which requires the federal government to build a nationwide broadband network through a public-private partnership, using 90 MHz from the 700 MHz band.  Deployment of this network is expected to start in 2014 and is targeted for completion by the end of 2018.  It is anticipated that broadband for public safety will be part of this network.  Currently, the government of Mexico is drafting regulations related to the implementation of this law.   6Internationally, the ITU World Radio Conference ("WRC") was held in Geneva during the first quarter of 2012.  During this conference, leaders from United Nations member countries considered a number of initiatives, including whether to allocate additional spectrum for commercial broadband use as well as whether to allocate spectrum dedicated for public safety broadband.  The WRC agreed to consider spectrum for public safety broadband.  Studies are underway to assess whether and how much spectrum is needed  and to develop recommendations on where in the spectrum range the spectrum should be allocated (taking into account regional and global harmonization to the extent practicable).  The issue made it onto the agenda for the next WRC in 2015.  The result could be future allocations for dedicated broadband spectrum for public safety which will provide opportunities for us in the future.  In addition, certain countries already have spectrum landscapes that would permit country administrations to allocate public safety spectrum today.  A WRC initiative can spur individual countries to act sooner, which may also create opportunities for our broadband solutions in the nearer term.Other Regulatory Matters Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
