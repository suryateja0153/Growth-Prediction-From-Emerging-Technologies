Less predictable software license fees, paid by customers implementing our software solutions in-house, and hardware sales, including all non-software products  that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources.JHA’s gross revenue has grown from $742.9 million in fiscal 2008 to $1,027.1 million in fiscal 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate during this challenging five-year period of 7 percent.

According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), there were more than 7,300 commercial banks and savings institutions in this asset range as of December 31, 2011. Jack Henry Banking currently supports over 1,330 of these banks with its core information processing platforms and complementary products and services.  Symitar serves credit unions of all asset sizes. According to the Credit Union National Association (“CUNA”), there were more than 7,300 domestic credit unions as of December 31, 2011.

ProfitStars currently supports nearly 11,000 institutions with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs.The FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 15 percent from the beginning of calendar year 2008 to the end of calendar year 2011. Although the number of banks declined at a 3 percent compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 5 percent and totaled $12.6 trillion as of December 31, 2011. Comparing calendar years 2011 to 2010, new bank charters decreased 73 percent and mergers increased 1 percent.CUNA reports the number of credit unions also declined 15 percent from the beginning of calendar year 2008 to the end of calendar year 2011.

Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer’s delivery channel of choice. Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers/members in today’s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near and long term performance goals are often technology-dependent. Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to:•Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information;•Offer the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional competitors and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry;•Enhance the customer/member experience at varied points of contact;•Expand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services;•Capitalize on new revenue and deposit growth opportunities;•Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs;•Implement e-commerce strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today’s financial services industry;•Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure;•Protect customers/members from fraud and related financial losses;•Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments; and•Ensure full regulatory compliance.JHA’s extensive product and service offering enables diverse financial institutions to capitalize on these business 5opportunities and respond to these business challenges. We strive to establish a long-term, value-added technology partnership with each customer, and to continually expand our offering with the specific solutions our customers need to prosper in the evolving financial services industry.Mission StatementJHA’s mission is to protect and increase the value of its stockholders' investment by providing quality products and services to our customers by:•Concentrating our activities on what we know best - information systems and services for financial institutions;•Providing outstanding commitment and service to our customers so that the perceived value of our products and services is consistent with the real value; and•Maintaining a work environment that is personally, professionally, and financially rewarding to our employees.Business StrategyOur fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by:•Providing commercial banks and credit unions with core software systems that provide excellent functionality, and support in-house and outsourced operating environments with identical functionality.•Expanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems.•Maintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention.•Capitalizing on our focused diversification acquisition strategy.Focused Diversification Acquisition StrategyJHA’s acquisition strategy, which complements and accelerates our organic growth, focuses on successful companies that provide in-demand products and services, excellent customer relationships, and strong management teams and employee bases.Historically, our acquisition strategy focused on companies that:    •Expanded our base of core financial institution customers,•Expanded our suite of complementary products and services that were cross sold to existing customers,  •Enabled our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry; and/or•Provided additional outsourcing capabilities/opportunities.In 2004, we adopted our focused diversification acquisition strategy and began acquiring companies and highly specialized products that are:•Sold to existing core customers;•Sold outside JHA’s base of core bank and credit union customers to financial services organizations of all charters and asset sizes;•Selectively sold outside the financial services industry to diverse corporate entities; and•Selectively sold internationally.Since our focused diversification strategy was adopted, JHA has completed 19 acquisitions that support it and assembled three distinct product brands that enable users to:•Generate additional revenue and growth opportunities,•Increase security and mitigate operational risks, and /or•Control operating costs.These products and services enable us to expand our reach well beyond our traditional markets with solutions that are appropriate for virtually any financial services organization, including thousands of institutions that we previously did not sell to.Following are the acquisitions that have been made in the last five fiscal years to support JHA’s focused diversification:  6Fiscal YearCompany or Product NameProducts and Services2010iPay TechnologiesInternet and telephone bill payment services2010PEMCO Technology ServicesPayment processing solutions for credit unions2010Goldleaf Financial SolutionsIntegrated technology and payment processing solutions2008AudioTelCheck and document imaging and electronic banking2008Gladiator TechnologyInformation Technology Security ServicesSolutionsOur proprietary solutions are marketed through three business brands:  •Jack Henry Banking supports commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation.

Our credit union solutions also have state-of-the-art functional capabilities, and we can provide the hardware required by each software system. Our credit union solutions can be delivered in-house or through outsourced implementation, and are also backed by our company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service.  •ProfitStars is a leading provider of specialized products and services assembled through our focused diversification acquisition strategy. These solutions are compatible with a wide variety of information technology platforms and operating environments, and include proven solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security and mitigating operational risks, and/or controlling operating costs. ProfitStars’ products and services are enhancing the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities with nearly 11,000 domestic and international customers. These distinct products and services can be implemented individually or as solution suites to address specific business problems and enable effective responses to dynamic industry trends.We will continue to develop and maintain functionally robust, integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels; regularly enhanced using an interactive customer enhancement process; compliant with relevant regulations; updated with proven advances in technology; and consistent with JHA’s reputation as a premium product and service provider.Core Software SystemsCore software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and to maintain centralized customer/member information.Jack Henry Banking markets three core software systems to banks and Symitar markets two core software systems to credit unions. These core systems are available for in-house installation at customer sites or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to JHA based on the core processing solution most compatible with their specific operational requirements.Jack Henry Banking’s three core banking platforms are:  •SilverLake® is a robust IBM® System i™-based system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $500 million to $30 billion. However, an increasing number of progressive smaller banks, including de novo, or recently chartered start-up banks, are now selecting SilverLake. This system has been implemented by over 420 banks, and now automates approximately 6 percent of the domestic banks with assets less than $30 billion.•CIF 20/20® is a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports nearly 690 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $2 billion. CIF 20/20 is the most widely used IBM System i-based core processing system in the community bank market.7•Core Director® is a Windows®-based, client/server system that now supports over 220 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $1 billion. Core Director is a cost-efficient operating platform and provides intuitive point-and-click operation.Symitar’s two functionally distinct core credit union platforms are:  •Episys® is a robust IBM System p™-based system primarily designed for credit unions with more than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by over 570 credit unions and is ranked as the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative.•Cruise® is a Windows-based, client/server system designed primarily for credit unions with less than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by more than 180 credit unions, is cost-efficient, and provides intuitive point-and-click, drag-and-drop operation.Customers electing to install our solutions in-house license the proprietary software systems based on initial license fees. The large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We also re-market the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions; and we contract to perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. In-house customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location.Customers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by in-house installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to JHA. Our outsourcing services are provided through a national network of data centers in five physical locations and four image-enabled item processing centers. Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five or more years that include transaction-based processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period.We support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. JHA also serves each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability.Complementary Products and Services  We provide more than 100 complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers, and selectively sold by our ProfitStars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems.These complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions sold by ProfitStars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs. As part of ProfitStars, iPay Technologies, our most recent acquisition, provides a configurable electronic payments platform and turnkey online bill payment solutions that can integrate with any online banking platform.JHA regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients, and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and containing costs. The Company’s Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, formally evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. JHA’s new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances.Hardware SystemsHardware sales support our software systems and include non-JHA products that we re-market.Our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation, Avnet, Inc., and other hardware providers that allow JHA to purchase hardware at a discount and resell it directly to our customers. We currently sell the IBM Power Systems and System x servers; Lenovo workstations; Dell servers and workstations; Burroughs, RDM, Panini, Digital Check, Canon check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions.Implementation and TrainingWhile it is not essential, the majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation 8and training services in connection with their in-house systems.A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the JHA system being implemented. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed.Implementation and training services also are provided in connection with new customers outsourcing their information processing to JHA.We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. Know-It-All Education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of JHA’s core and complementary products, to optimize ongoing system enhancements, and to fully understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements. Each basic, intermediate, and advanced course is delivered by system experts, supported by professional materials and training tools, and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach. Know-It-All Education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels, including classroom-based courses offered in JHA’s regional training centers, Internet-based live instruction, eLearning courses, on-site training, and train-the-trainer programs.Support and ServicesWe serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. The Company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates:•Exacting service standards;•Trained support staffs available 24 hours-a-day, 365 days-a-year;•Assigned account managers;•Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology; and•A best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting more than 11,900 diverse clients.JHA’s experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform also provides highly effective change management and control processes.Most in-house customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for JHA. These support services are typically priced at approximately 18 to 20 percent of the respective product’s software license fee. These fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees are typically billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with pro-ration for new product implementations that occur during the year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or JHA gives notice of termination at least 60 days prior to contract expiration.High levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for in-house customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees.JHA regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and online surveys initiated each year by routine support requests. This process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ service-related expectations.BacklogBacklog consists of contracted in-house products and services that have not been delivered. Backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multi-year outsourcing contracts, and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period.Backlog as of June 30, 2012 totaled $435.3 million, consisting of $92.7 million for in-house products and services, and $342.6 million for outsourcing services. Approximately $268.3 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of June 30, 2012 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2013 due to the long-term nature of many outsourcing contracts. Backlog as of June 30, 2011 totaled $358.8 million, consisting of $79.1 million for in-house products and services, and $279.7 million for outsourcing services.Our in-house backlog is subject to seasonal variations and can fluctuate quarterly. Our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multi-year contracts, and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2013, the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities.9Research and DevelopmentWe invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services, and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. Our core and complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers, and reduce related costs.Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $60.9 million, $63.4 million, and $50.8 million, respectively. Capitalized software for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $37.9 million, $27.0 million, and $25.6 million, respectively.Sales and MarketingJHA serves established, well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities.Jack Henry Banking sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions to domestic commercial banks with assets up to $30.0 billion. Symitar sells core processing systems and integrated complementary solutions to domestic credit unions of all asset sizes. The marketing and sales initiatives within these business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. Jack Henry Banking also has been successfully selling its core and complementary solutions to a significant number of the de novo banks chartered in recent years. ProfitStars sells specialized niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters.Dedicated sales forces support each of JHA’s three business brands. Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Brand-specific sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. A centralized marketing department supports all three business lines with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. JHA also hosts annual national user group meetings which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services.jhaDirect sells specific complementary solutions, and business forms and supplies that are compatible with JHA’s software solutions. jhaDirect’s offering consists of more than 4,000 items, including tax and custom forms, ATM and teller supplies, check imaging and reader/sorter supplies, magnetic media, laser printers and supplies, loan coupon books, and much more. New items are regularly added in response to dynamic regulatory requirements and to support JHA’s ever-expanding product and service suite.JHA sells select products and services in the Caribbean and, as a result of recent acquisitions, Europe and South America.  International sales account for less than one percent of JHA’s total revenue in each of the three years ended June 30, 2012, 2011, and 2010.CompetitionThe market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of JHA’s current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing customer references. For more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future.Jack Henry Banking and Symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; Open Solutions, Inc.; and Harland Financial Solutions – Ultradata.  ProfitStars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities.Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks  Although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications 10for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, resellers, customers, and potential customers. Access to and distribution of our Company’s source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or technology. We cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.Regulatory ComplianceJHA maintains a strict corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by the federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given. JHA’s comprehensive compliance program is provided by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience, and a thorough working knowledge of
