BUSINESSJack Henry & Associates, Inc. (JHA) was founded in 1976 as a provider of core information processing solutions for community banks. Today, the Company’s extensive array of products and services includes processing transactions, automating business processes, and managing information for over 9,000 financial institutions and diverse corporate entities.JHA provides its products and services through three business brands:•Jack Henry Banking is a leading provider of integrated data processing systems to approximately 1,080 banks ranging from community banks to multi-billion dollar institutions with assets of up to $50 billion.  Our banking solutions support both in-house and outsourced operating environments with three functionally distinct core processing platforms and more than 100 integrated complementary solutions.•Symitar is a leading provider of core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, with approximately 820 credit union customers. Symitar markets two functionally distinct core processing platforms and more than 50 integrated complementary solutions that support both in-house and outsourced operating environments.•ProfitStars is a leading provider of highly specialized core agnostic products and services to financial institutions that are primarily not core customers of the Company. ProfitStars offers highly specialized financial performance, imaging and payments processing, information security and risk management, retail delivery, and online and mobile solutions. ProfitStars’ products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities with over 9,000 domestic and international customers.Our products and services enable our customers to implement technology solutions that can be tailored to support their unique growth, service, operational, and performance goals. Our solutions also enable financial institutions to offer the high-demand products and services required to compete more successfully, and to capitalize on evolving trends shaping the financial services industry.We are committed to exceeding our customers’ service-related expectations. We measure and monitor customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and online surveys initiated each day randomly by routine support requests. The results of this extensive survey process confirm that our service consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates excellent customer retention rates.We also focus on establishing long-term customer relationships, continually expanding and strengthening those relationships with cross sales of additional products and services, earning new traditional and nontraditional clients, and ensuring each product offering is highly competitive.The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring electronic payment solutions and outsourcing services that both generally have contract terms of five years or greater, and support and services provided to our in-house customers that are typically on a one year contract.  Less predictable software license fees, paid by customers implementing our software solutions in-house, and hardware sales, including all non-software products that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources.JHA ended fiscal 2017 with $1,431.1 million in revenue.  This has increased from $1,017.7 million at the end of fiscal 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate during this five-year period of 7%.  Net income has grown from $152.0 million to $245.8 million during this same five-year period, representing a compound annual growth rate of 10%.  Information regarding the classification of our business into separate segments serving the banking and credit union industries is set forth in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Item 8).JHA’s progress and performance have been guided by the focused work ethic and fundamental ideals fostered by the Company’s founders 41 years ago:•Do the right thing,•Do whatever it takes, and•Have fun.We recognize that our associates and their collective contribution are ultimately responsible for JHA’s past, present, and future success.  Recruiting and retaining high-quality employees is essential to our ongoing growth and financial performance, and we have established a corporate culture that sustains high levels of employee satisfaction.Industry Background    Jack Henry Banking primarily serves commercial banks and savings institutions with up to $50 billion in assets. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), there were more than 5,870 commercial banks and 5savings institutions in this asset range as of December 31, 2016.  Jack Henry Banking currently supports approximately 1,080 of these banks with its core information processing platforms and complementary products and services.  Symitar serves credit unions of all asset sizes. According to the Credit Union National Association (“CUNA”), there were more than 6,000 domestic credit unions as of December 31, 2016.  Symitar currently supports approximately 820 of these credit unions with core information processing platforms and complementary products and services.ProfitStars serves financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters and other diverse corporate entities.  ProfitStars currently supports over 9,000 institutions with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs.The FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 20% from the beginning of calendar year 2012 to the end of calendar year 2016, due mainly to mergers.  Although the number of banks declined at a 4% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 4% and totaled $15.6 trillion as of December 31, 2016.  There were no new bank charters issued in calendar year 2016, compared to one in the 2015 calendar year.  Comparing calendar years 2016 to 2015, mergers decreased 17%.CUNA reports the number of credit unions declined 18% from the beginning of calendar year 2012 to the end of calendar year 2016.  Although the number of credit unions declined at a 4% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 6% and totaled $1.3 trillion as of December 31, 2016.Community and mid-tier banks and credit unions are important in the communities and to the consumers they serve.  Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer’s delivery channel of choice.  Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers/members in today’s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near and long term performance goals are often technology-dependent.  Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to:•Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information;•Offer the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional competitors and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry;•Enhance the customer/member experience at varied points of contact;•Expand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services;•Capitalize on new revenue and deposit growth opportunities;•Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs;•Implement e-commerce, mobile, and digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today’s financial services industry;•Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure;•Protect customers/members with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses;•Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments; and•Ensure full regulatory compliance.JHA’s extensive product and service offering enables diverse financial institutions to capitalize on these business opportunities and respond to these business challenges.  We strive to establish a long-term, value-added technology partnership with each customer, and to continually expand our offering with the specific solutions our customers need to prosper in the evolving financial services industry.Mission StatementJHA’s mission is to protect and increase the value of its stockholders' investment by providing quality products and services to our customers.  We perform this mission by:•Concentrating our activities on what we know best - information systems and services for financial institutions;•Providing outstanding commitment and service to our customers so that the perceived value of our products and services is consistent with the real value; and•Maintaining a work environment that is personally, professionally, and financially rewarding to our employees.Business StrategyOur fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by:6•Providing commercial banks and credit unions with core operating systems that provide excellent functionality, and support in-house and outsourced delivery environments with identical functionality.•Expanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems.•Maintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention.•Capitalizing on our acquisition strategy.Acquisition StrategyWe have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with strategic acquisitions, including 29 acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999.  We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to: •Expand our suite of complementary products and services;•Provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core customers and outside our base to new customers; and /or•Provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry. We have completed one acquisition in the last 3 years.  After 41 years in business we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues.  In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions. We have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders, such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers, repurchases of our stock, and continued payment of dividends.Our five most recent acquisitions were:Fiscal YearCompany or Product NameProducts and Services2016Bayside Business SolutionsPortfolio management systems and factoring software2014BannoMobile banking, web development and data-enriched marketing technology2010iPay TechnologiesElectronic bill payment and P2P services2010PEMCO Technology ServicesPayment transaction processing solutions for credit unions2010Goldleaf Financial SolutionsIntegrated technology and payment processing solutionsSolutionsOur proprietary solutions are marketed through three business brands:  •Jack Henry Banking supports commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation.

These core systems are available for in-house installation at customer sites, or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to JHA.Jack Henry Banking’s three core banking platforms are:  •SilverLake®, a robust IBM Power System™ (i/OS) based system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $500 million to $50 billion. However, some progressive smaller banks and start-up banks also select SilverLake. This system is in use by over 390 banks, and now automates approximately 6.7% of the domestic banks with assets less than $50 billion.•CIF 20/20®, a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports over 490 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $2 billion. CIF 20/20 is the most widely used IBM Power System™ (i/OS) core processing system in the community bank market.•Core Director®, a Windows®-based, client/server system that now supports nearly 200 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $1 billion. Core Director is a cost-efficient operating platform and provides intuitive point-and-click operation.Symitar’s two core credit union platforms are:  •Episys®, a robust IBM Power System™ (AIX®) based system primarily designed for credit unions with more than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by nearly 660 credit unions and is ranked as the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative system.•CruiseNet®, a Windows-based, client/server system designed primarily for credit unions with less than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by nearly 160 credit unions, is cost-efficient, and provides intuitive point-and-click, drag-and-drop operation.Customers electing to install our solutions in-house license the proprietary software systems. The large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We also re-market the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions; and we contract to perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. In-house customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully-paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location.Customers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by in-house installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to JHA.  Our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four data centers located in three physical locations.  We also provide image item processing services from two host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country.  We print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers.  Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for five or more years that include transaction-based processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period.8We support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. JHA also serves each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability.Complementary Products and Services  We provide more than 100 complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers, and selectively sold by our ProfitStars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems.These complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions sold by ProfitStars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs.JHA regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients, and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and containing costs. The Company’s Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. JHA’s new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances.Electronic Payment SolutionsElectronic payment solutions provides our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovations with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing, attract profitable retail and commercial accounts, increase operating efficiencies, comply with regulatory mandates, and proactively mitigate and manage payments-related risk.Jack Henry identifies three components of Electronic Payment Solutions:•Card Services provides a comprehensive suite of Automated Teller Machine ("ATM"), debit, and credit card transaction processing and fraud management solutions.  Our card processing solutions, which include loyalty/ rewards, multiple fraud detection programs, and cardholder alert and controls, as well as other key components that are fully integrated with JHA's core and complementary solutions, facilitate seamless transaction processing.•Bill Pay and Mobile banking platforms are offered through our iPay and Banno product offerings. iPay offers iPay Business Bill Pay™, a full suite of online financial management solutions designed to meet the distinct needs of small businesses, as well as iPay Consumer Bill Pay™, a solution that supports single or recurring payments, allows customers to receive full bills electronically, and easily integrates with any internet banking provider.  Banno Mobile™ offers a native mobile banking application for both iOS and Android that offers innovative and cost-effective mobile services that can be marketed with customer's own brand identity.  It allows customers to aggregate all of their account balances and transactional data from multiple financial institutions and empowers them with the convenience of anytime, anywhere account access.•Processing/ Other includes Enterprise Payment Solutions (EPS), a comprehensive payments engine and the leading total payments solution on the market today. EPS offers an integrated suite of remote deposit capture, ACH and card transaction processing solutions, risk management tools, reporting capabilities, and more for financial institutions of all sizes. EPS helps financial institutions succeed in today’s competitive market to increase revenue, improve efficiencies, better manage compliance, and enhance customer relationships. Furthermore, Commercial Lending Solutions help financial institutions securely transition from a traditional lending portfolio (focused on real estate-based consumer lending) to a more fully-diversified portfolio developed via commercial and industrial lending. Our solutions also provide reliable ways to retain creditworthy business customers facing financial hurdles, without the risk of loan loss.Hardware SystemsOur software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation (fulfilled directly and through IBM distributors), and many other hardware providers that allow JHA to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers.  We currently sell IBM Power Systems; Lenovo, Dell, and HP servers and workstations; Canon, Digital Check, Epson, and Panini check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions.9 Implementation and TrainingThe majority of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products.A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the JHA system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed.We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. Know-It-All Education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of JHA’s core and complementary products, to optimize ongoing system enhancements, and to fully understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements. Each basic, intermediate, and advanced course is delivered by system experts, supported by professional materials and training tools, and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach. Know-It-All Education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels, including classroom-based courses offered in JHA’s regional training centers, Internet-based live instruction, eLearning courses, on-site training, and train-the-trainer programs.Support and ServicesWe serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. The Company’s comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates:•Exacting service standards;•Trained support staff available 24 hours-a-day, 365 days-a-year;•Assigned account managers;•Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology;•Broad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform; •Highly effective change management and control processes; and•A best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting over 9,000 diverse clients.Most in-house customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for JHA. These support services are typically priced at approximately 18% to 20% of the respective product’s software license fee. The subsequent years' service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees are typically billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with pro-ration for new product implementations that occur during the year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or JHA gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration.High levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for in-house customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees.JHA regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests. This process shows that we consistently exceed our customers’ service-related expectations.BacklogBacklog consists of contracted in-house products and services that have not been delivered. Backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multi-year outsourcing contracts, and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period.Backlog as of June 30, 2017 totaled $630.3 million, consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software, hardware, and implementation services (in-house backlog) of approximately $78.9 million, and $551.4 million for outsourcing services.  Approximately $426.0 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of June 30, 2017 is not expected to be realized during fiscal 2018 due to the long-term nature of our outsourcing contracts. Backlog as of June 30, 2016 totaled $620.6 million, consisting of $95.6 million for future delivery of in-house software, hardware, and implementation services (in-house backlog), and $525.0 million for outsourcing services.10The in-house backlog does not include amounts related to items that have been delivered but cannot be recognized as revenue due to accounting rules for software revenue recognition; those amounts are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet to the extent that they have been billed to the customer as of June 30, 2017 and 2016.Our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multi-year contracts, and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2018, the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships and new contracting activities.Research and DevelopmentWe invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services, and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. Our core and the majority of our complementary systems are typically enhanced once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers, and reduce related costs.Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $84.8 million, $81.2 million, and $71.5 million, respectively. Capitalized software for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $89.6 million, $96.4 million, and $76.9 million, respectively.Sales and MarketingJHA serves established, well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities.The marketing and sales initiatives within the Jack Henry Banking and Symitar business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. ProfitStars sells specialized core agnostic niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters.Dedicated sales forces support each of JHA’s three marketed brands. Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Brand-specific sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing department supports all three brands with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. JHA also hosts annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services.JHA has sold select products and services in the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, and South America.  International sales account for less than 1% of JHA’s total revenue in the year ended June 30, 2017, and were approximately 1% of total revenue in fiscal years 2016 and 2015.CompetitionThe market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of JHA’s current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing
