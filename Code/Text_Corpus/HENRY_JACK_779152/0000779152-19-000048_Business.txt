There were eight new bank charters issued in calendar year 2018, compared to five in the 2017 calendar year.

Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer’s delivery channel of choice.  Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers/members in today’s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near-term and long-term performance goals are often technology-dependent.  Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to:•Implement e-commerce, mobile, and digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today’s financial services industry;•Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information;•Offer the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional competitors and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry;•Enhance the customer/member experience at varied points of contact;•Expand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services;•Capitalize on new revenue and deposit growth opportunities;•Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs;•Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure;•Protect customers/members with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses;•Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments; and•Ensure full regulatory compliance.JHA’s extensive product and service offering enables diverse financial institutions to capitalize on these business opportunities and respond to these business challenges.  We strive to establish a long-term, value-added technology partnership with each customer, and to continually expand our offering with the specific solutions our customers need to prosper in the evolving financial services industry.Mission StatementOur mission is to protect and increase the value of our stockholders' investment by providing quality solutions and industry-leading service to our customers. In accomplishing this, we feel that it is important to:•Maintain a work environment that is personally, professionally, and financially rewarding for our employees.•Concentrate our activities on what we know best - technology solutions and services for financial institutions.•Provide outstanding commitment and service to our customers so that the perceived value of our solutions and services is consistent with the real value.Business StrategyOur fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by:6•Providing commercial banks and credit unions with core operating systems that provide excellent functionality, and support in-house and outsourced delivery environments with identical functionality.•Expanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems.•Providing highly specialized core agnostic complementary products and services to financial institutions, including institutions not utilizing a Jack Henry core operating system, and diverse corporate entities.•Maintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention.•Capitalizing on our acquisition strategy.Acquisition StrategyWe have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 33 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999.  We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to: •Expand our suite of complementary products and services;•Provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core customers and outside our base to new customers; and /or•Provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry. We have completed four acquisitions in the last 3 years.  After 43 years in business, we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues.  In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions. We have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. Until we identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to find alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders, such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers, repurchases of our stock, and continued payment of dividends.Our five most recent acquisitions were:Fiscal YearCompany or Product NameProducts and Services2019BOLTS Technologies, IncDeveloper of boltsOPEN, a digital account opening solution2019Agiletics, Inc.Provider of escrow, investment, and liquidity management solutions for banks serving commercial customers2018Ensenta CorporationReal-time, cloud-based solutions for mobile and online payments and deposits2018Vanguard Software GroupUnderwriting, spreading, and online decisioning of commercial loansSolutionsOur proprietary solutions are marketed through three primary business brands:  •Jack Henry Banking supports commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation.

Profitstars has over 9,000 customers, including over 7,200 non-core customers.

These core systems are available for in-house installation at customer sites, or financial institutions can outsource ongoing information processing to JHA.Jack Henry Banking’s three core banking platforms are:  •SilverLake®, a robust IBM Power System™ (i/OS) based system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $500 million to $50 billion. However, some progressive smaller banks and de novo  (start-up) banks also select SilverLake. This system is in use by over 410 banks, and now automates over 7% of the domestic banks with assets less than $50 billion.•CIF 20/20®, a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports over 410 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $2 billion.  CIF 20/20 is among the most widely used IBM Power System™ (i/OS) core processing systems in the United States ("U.S.") community bank market.•Core Director®, a Windows®-based, client/server system that now supports nearly 200 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets exceeding $1 billion. Core Director is a cost-efficient operating platform and provides intuitive point-and-click operation.Symitar’s two core credit union platforms are:  •Episys®, a robust IBM Power System™ (AIX®) based system primarily designed for credit unions with more than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by nearly 680 credit unions and according to National Credit Union Administration data, is the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative system.•CruiseNet®, a Windows-based, client/server system designed primarily for credit unions with less than $50 million in assets. It has been implemented by over 150 credit unions, is cost-efficient, and provides intuitive point-and-click, drag-and-drop operation.Customers electing to install our solutions in-house license the proprietary software systems. The large majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We also re-market the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by our software solutions; and we contract to perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. In-house customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully-paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location.Customers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by in-house installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by outsourcing these functions to JHA.  Our core outsourcing services are provided through a national network of four data centers located in four physical locations.  We also provide image item processing services from two host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country.  We print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers.  Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts 8for five or more years that include transaction-based processing fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period.We support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. JHA also serves each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability.Complementary Products and Services  We provide more than 140 complementary products and services that are sold to our core bank and credit union customers, and selectively sold by our ProfitStars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems.These complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions sold by ProfitStars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs.JHA regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients, and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and/or containing costs. The Company’s Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. JHA’s new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances.Implementation and TrainingMost of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products.A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities to help manage the process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the JHA system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed.We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. Know-It-All Education is a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of JHA’s core and complementary products, to optimize ongoing system enhancements, and to fully understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements. Each basic, intermediate, and advanced course is delivered by system experts, supported by professional materials and training tools, and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach. Know-It-All Education supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels, including classroom-based courses offered in JHA’s regional training centers, Internet-based live instruction, eLearning courses, on-site training, and train-the-trainer programs.Support and ServicesWe serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. Our comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates:•Exacting service standards;•Trained support staff available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year;•Assigned account managers;•Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology;•Broad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform; •Highly effective change management and control processes; and•A best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting over 9,000 diverse clients.Most in-house customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for JHA. These support services are typically priced at approximately 20% of the respective product’s software license fee. The subsequent years' service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as 9additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees are typically billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with pro-ration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or JHA gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration.High levels of support are provided to our outsourced customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for in-house customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly outsourcing fees.JHA regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests. We believe this process confirms that we consistently exceed our customers’ service-related expectations.Hardware SystemsOur software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation (fulfilled directly and through IBM distributors), and many other hardware providers that allow JHA to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers.  We currently sell IBM Power Systems; Lenovo, Dell, and HP servers and workstations; Canon, Digital Check, Epson, and Panini check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions.Electronic Payment SolutionsElectronic payment solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovation with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing, attract profitable retail and commercial accounts, increase operating efficiencies, comply with regulatory mandates, and proactively mitigate and manage payment-related risk.Jack Henry identifies four components of Electronic Payment Solutions:•Card Services provides a comprehensive suite of Automated Teller Machine ("ATM"), debit / credit card transaction processing and fraud management solutions.  The card processing solutions include loyalty / rewards, fraud detection, cardholder alert and controls, and other key components that are fully integrated with JHA's core and complementary solutions.•Bill Pay and Mobile banking platforms are offered through our iPay and Banno product offerings. iPay offers iPay Business Bill Pay™, a full suite of online financial management solutions designed to meet the distinct needs of small businesses, as well as iPay Consumer Bill Pay™, a solution that supports single or recurring payments, allows customers to receive full bills electronically, and easily integrates with any internet banking provider.  Banno Mobile™ offers a native mobile banking application for both iOS and Android that offers innovative and cost-effective mobile services that can be marketed with customer's own brand identity.  It allows customers to aggregate all of their account balances and transactional data from multiple financial institutions and empowers them with the convenience of anytime, anywhere account access.•Faster Payments includes the development of JHA PayCenter, a payments hub that provides streamlined, secure payment capabilities for sending and receiving transactions instantly 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through JHA’s core and complementary solutions with direct connections to real-time networks. •Processing/ Other includes Enterprise Payment Solutions (EPS), a comprehensive payments engine and one of the leading total payments solutions on the market today. EPS offers an integrated suite of remote deposit capture, ACH and card transaction processing solutions, risk management tools, reporting capabilities, and more for financial institutions of all sizes. EPS helps financial institutions succeed in today’s competitive market to increase revenue, improve efficiencies, better manage compliance, and enhance customer relationships. Furthermore, Commercial Lending Solutions help financial institutions securely transition from a traditional lending portfolio (focused on real estate-based consumer lending) to a more fully-diversified portfolio developed via commercial and industrial lending. Our solutions also provide reliable ways to retain creditworthy business customers facing financial hurdles, without the risk of loan loss.BacklogBacklog consists of contracted in-house products and services that have not been delivered. Backlog also includes the minimum monthly payments for the remaining portion of multi-year outsourcing contracts, and typically includes the minimum payments guaranteed for the remainder of the contract period.Backlog as of June 30, 2019 totaled $785.2 million, consisting of contracts signed for future delivery of software, hardware, and implementation services (in-house backlog) of $77.6 million, and outsourcing services of $707.6 million.  Approximately $514.0 million of the outsourcing services backlog as of June 30, 2019 is not expected to be realized 10during fiscal 2020 due to the long-term nature of our outsourcing contracts. Backlog as of June 30, 2018 totaled $676.2 million, consisting of $76.3 million for future delivery of in-house software, hardware, and implementation services (in-house backlog), and $599.9 million for outsourcing services.Our outsourcing backlog continues to experience growth based on new contracting activities and renewals of multi-year contracts, and although the appropriate portion of this revenue will be recognized during fiscal 2020, the backlog is expected to trend up gradually for the foreseeable future due to renewals of existing relationships, existing in-house customers electing to migrate to the outsourced model, and new contracting activities.Research and DevelopmentWe invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services, and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. Our core and complementary systems are enhanced a minimum of once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers, and reduce related costs.Research and development expenses for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $96.4 million, $90.3 million, and $84.8 million, respectively. We recorded capitalized software in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 of $111.1 million, $96.6 million, and $89.6 million, respectively.Sales and MarketingJHA serves established, well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities.The marketing and sales initiatives within the Jack Henry Banking and Symitar business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. ProfitStars sells specialized core agnostic niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters.Dedicated sales forces support each of JHA’s three primary marketed brands. Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Brand-specific sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing department supports all of our brands with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. JHA also hosts annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services.JHA has sold select products and services in the Caribbean, Canada, Europe, and South America.  International sales accounted for less than 1% of JHA’s total revenue in the fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.CompetitionThe market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of JHA’s current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing customer references. For more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future.Jack Henry Banking and Symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; and Finastra. ProfitStars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities.Intellectual Proper
