Risk Factors, the applicability and impact of these new tax provisions, and of other international tax law changes effective for fiscal 2020 and beyond, will likely require us to respond by making change(s) to our international trading structure. The net impact of such change(s) is uncertain but is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in years beyond fiscal 2020. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $173.3 million, $196.2 million and $172.9 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 29, 2019, November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017 were recognized, $127.0 million, $145.2 million and $135.0 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $25.1 million and $24.6 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $20 million.In addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. 49Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)November 29, 2019 November 30, 2018Cash and cash equivalents$2,650.2 $1,642.8Short-term investments$1,526.8 $1,586.2Working capital$(1,696.0) $555.9Stockholders’ equity$10,530.2 $9,362.1Working CapitalWorking capital as of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018 was $1.70 billion of a deficit and $555.9 million of a surplus, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of $3.15 billion total carrying value of our $2.25 billion term loan due April 30, 2020 (“Term Loan”) and $900 million 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”) to current liabilities. We intend to refinance our Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates. A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$4,421.8 $4,029.3 $2,912.9Net cash used for investing activities(455.6) (4,685.3) (442.9)Net cash used for financing activities(2,946.1) (5.6) (1,183.7)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(12.7) (1.7) 8.5Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,007.4 $(663.3) $1,294.8 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities of $4.42 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in deferred revenue, which was offset in large part by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by increases related to Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services and Digital Experience hosted services. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses with certain vendors, sales commissions paid and capitalized, advanced payments related to income taxes and increase in long-term contract assets.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities of $455.6 million was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Allegorithmic. These cash outflows were offset primarily by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $2.95 billion primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.  50Table of ContentsOther Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2020 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct costs and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of November 29, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 29, 2019, we have a $2.25 billion Term Loan outstanding and $1.9 billion senior notes outstanding, consisting of our 2020 Notes and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes and Term Loan rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the 2020 Notes as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the Term Loan as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 29, 2019, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was $899.6 million which includes the fair value of the related interest rate swap and is net of debt issuance costs, and the carrying value of the Term Loan was $2.25 billion, net of unamortized original issuance discount. We intend to refinance the Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our Term Loan and 2020 Notes, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon debt issuance.Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, municipal securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our investment portfolio. Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.75 billion, $2.05 billion, and $1.10 billion, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount.  51Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of our structured stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:(shares in thousands and total cost in millions) 2019 2018 2017Board approval dates Shares Average per share Shares Average per share Shares Average per shareJanuary 2015 — $— — $— 4,263 $118.00January 2017 — $— 8,686 $230.43 3,923 $151.80May 2018 9,883 $270.23 — $— — $—Total shares 9,883 $270.23 8,686 $230.43 8,186 $134.20Total cost $2,671 $2,002 $1,099For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 29, 2019, November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 29, 2019, $229.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to November 29, 2019, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $850 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $850 million stock repurchase agreement, $4.25 billion remains under our May 2018 authority. See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 29, 2019.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 29, 2019 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 29, 2019:(in millions)   Payment Due by Period  Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsTerm Loan and Notes, including interest $4,373.3 $3,227.0 $65.0 $65.0 $1,016.3Operating lease obligations, net 711.5 88.7 158.0 126.9 337.9Purchase obligations  2,036.5 545.0 935.8 555.7 —Total $7,121.3 $3,860.7 $1,158.8 $747.6 $1,354.2As of November 29, 2019, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. Based on the LIBOR rate at November 29, 2019, our estimated maximum commitment for interest payments was $23.2 million for the remaining duration of the Term Loan.As of November 29, 2019, the carrying value of our Notes payable was $1.89 billion. Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 29, 2019, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $200.1 million for the remaining duration of our Notes.Our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement contain similar financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 29, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. 52Table of ContentsUnder the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Transition Taxes LiabilityAs a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, an accrued transition tax liability of approximately $427.1 million as of November 29, 2019 is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesSee Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above and Note10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
