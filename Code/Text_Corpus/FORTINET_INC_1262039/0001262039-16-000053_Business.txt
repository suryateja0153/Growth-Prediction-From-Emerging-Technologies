For information regarding our revenue by customer based on billing address, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 4Table of ContentsOne distributor, Exclusive Networks Group, which distributed our solutions to a large group of resellers and end-customers, accounted for 18%, 15% and 12% of total revenue during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Sales and MarketingWe primarily sell our products and services through a distribution model. We sell to distributors that sell to networking security and enterprise-focused resellers and service providers, who, in turn, sell to our end-customers. In certain cases, we sell directly to government-focused resellers, as well as to very large service providers who have large purchasing power and unique customer deployment demands. We work with many technology distributors, including Exclusive Networks Group, Fine Tec Computer, Ingram Micro Inc. and Arrow Electronics, Inc., and enterprise security-focused resellers including Westcon and Tech Data.We support our channel partners with a dedicated team of experienced channel account managers, sales professionals and sales engineers who provide business planning, joint marketing strategy, and pre-sales and operational sales support. Additionally, our sales team often helps drive and support large enterprise and service provider sales through a direct touch model. Our sales professionals and engineers typically work closely with our channel partners and directly engage with large end-customers to help address their unique security and deployment requirements. Our sales cycle for an initial end-customer purchase may require approximately six months but can be longer for large enterprises, service providers and government organizations. To support our broadly dispersed global channel and end-customer base, we have sales offices in over 70 countries around the world.Our marketing strategy is focused on building our brand and driving end-customer demand for our security solutions. We use a combination of internal marketing professionals and a network of regional and global channel partners.

We intend to continue investing in sales and marketing in order to capture additional market share in the enterprise market. Manufacturing and SuppliersWe outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers. Our current manufacturing partners include Flextronics International Ltd., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., Adlink Technology, Inc., Senao Networks, Inc., and a number of Taiwan-based manufacturers. We submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured, the delivery date and other delivery terms. Once our products are manufactured, they are sent to either our warehouse in California, or to our logistics partner in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, where accessory packaging and quality-control testing are performed. We believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies. Our proprietary FortiASICs, which are the key to the performance of our appliances, are built by contract manufacturers including  Faraday Technology Corporation, Kawasaki Microelectronics America, Inc. (“K-Micro”), and Renesas Electronics Corporation (“Renesas”). These contract manufacturers use foundries operated by either United Microelectronics Corporation (“UMC”) or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”).The components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers. Some of the components important to our business, including specific types of CPUs from Intel Corporation (“Intel”), network chips from Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”), Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (“Marvell”) and Intel, and solid-state drives (silicon-based storage devices) from OCZ Technology Group, Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., are available from a limited or sole source of supply.We have no long-term contracts related to the manufacturing of our ASICs or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms.Research and DevelopmentWe focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems, and adding new features to existing products and systems. Our development strategy is to identify features, products and systems for both software and hardware that are, or are expected to be, important to our end-customers. Our success in designing, developing, manufacturing and  5Table of Contentsselling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors, including the identification of market demand for new products, product selection, timely implementation of product design and development, product performance, effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing.Intellectual Property We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of December 31, 2015, we had 278 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 236 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.Despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. We typically indemnify our end-customers, distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties.SeasonalityFor information regarding seasonality in our sales, see the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quarterly Results of Operations—Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Competition The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the following: •product performance, features, effectiveness, interoperability and reliability;•our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise;•compliance with industry standards and certifications;•price of products and services and total cost of ownership;•brand recognition;•customer service and support;•sales and distribution capabilities;•size and financial stability of operations; and•breadth of product line.Among others, our competitors include BlueCoat Systems, Inc. (“BlueCoat”), Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) (through its acquisition of SourceFire, Inc. (“SourceFire”)), Dell Inc. (through its acquisition of SonicWALL, Inc. (“SonicWALL”)), F5 Networks, Inc. (“F5 Networks”), FireEye, Inc. (“FireEye”), Intel (through its acquisition of McAfee, Inc. (“McAfee”)), Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper”), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (“Palo Alto Networks”) and Sophos Group Plc (“Sophos”).We believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance, reliability and breadth, our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise. Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and  6Table of Contentsleverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality.Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance, market their products better, or achieve greater market acceptance than us. In addition, our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers in these markets, and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2015, our total headcount was 4,018 employees and contractors. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union; however, our employees in certain European countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain up-to-date union membership. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.Available InformationOur web site is located at www.fortinet.com, and our investor relations web site is located at http://investor.fortinet.com.
