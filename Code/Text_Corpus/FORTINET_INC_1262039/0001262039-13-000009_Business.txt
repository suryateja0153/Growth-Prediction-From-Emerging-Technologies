Additional features include Virtual Domain (“VDOM”), capabilities and traffic queuing and shaping, enabling administrators to set the appropriate configurations and policies that meet their infrastructure needs. FortiOS also provides capabilities for logging of traffic for forensic analysis purposes which are particularly important for regulatory compliance initiatives like PCI DSS. FortiOS’s packet classification, queue disciplines, policy enforcement, congestion management, and other traffic optimization functionality are designed to help control network traffic in order to optimize performance.Our FortiOS incorporates the following eight core security and networking technologies: •Firewall. Our firewall technology delivers high performance network and application firewalling, including the ability to enforce policies based on application behavior and content. Our technology identifies traffic patterns independent of port or protocol used, and links them to the use of specific applications, enabling visibility and control over application behavior (explained in more detail below). By coupling application intelligence with firewall technology, the FortiGate platform is able to deliver real-time security with integrated application content level inspection, thereby simplifying security deployments. •Virtual Private Network. Our advanced VPN technology provides secure communications between multiple networks and hosts, through both secure socket layer (“SSL”), and IPsec VPN technologies, leveraging our custom FortiASIC to provide hardware acceleration for high-performance communications and data privacy. 2Table of Contents•Application Control. Our application control technology allows our end-customers to define granular network-based application policies in over 2,400 applications, providing additional visibility and control over application access, user behavior within applications, and application content.  •Anti-malware. Our anti-malware technology provides protection against malware, including viruses, spyware and trojans.  •Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). Our IPS technology provides protection against current and emerging network level threats.  •Web Filtering. Our Web filtering automation technology works in concert with our research team to collect, analyze and categorize websites to provide real-time protection through website ratings and categorization. Our Web filtering technology is a pro-active defense feature that identifies known locations of malware and blocks access to these malicious sources.  •Anti-spam. We employ a variety of anti-spam techniques to detect and block spam. These techniques include a hosted service performing algorithmic validations of messages against known spam messages, sophisticated reputation service designed to evaluate and track valid email sources and destinations, intelligent image scanning to evaluate the validity of images and dynamic heuristic rules to allow messages to be evaluated based on content within each message.  •WAN Acceleration. Our storage-enabled and storage-ready FortiGate appliances provide the ability to accelerate network traffic across the wide area network by implementing a combination of application content caching and protocol optimization techniques. In addition to the eight core security and networking functions mentioned above, we also incorporate additional technologies within FortiGate appliances that differentiate our UTM/NGFW solution, including:•Data Leakage Prevention (DLP). Our DLP technology provides the ability to define rules based on corporate policies, and consequently detect and help prevent confidential data from being distributed outside of the corporate network.  •Traffic optimization. Our traffic optimization technology combines quality of service techniques with traffic shaping to provide better service to selected network traffic based on customer policies without causing interruptions to other traffic. •SSL inspection. Our SSL inspection technology provides the ability to decrypt SSL application content for processing by FortiOS. The ability to inspect encrypted SSL content enables our customers to ensure protection from malware that would be otherwise hidden from traditional security products, and enforce the full complement of security and networking features available within FortiOS.•Vulnerability Management. Our vulnerability management technology enables the FortiGate platform to perform network scans to discover systems on a network, identity vulnerabilities and recommend steps for remediation. The FortiGate devices can store the results of the scans locally, or send the results from multiple FortiGate devices to a central FortiAnalyzer for aggregation and analysis.•Wireless Controller. Our wireless controller technology provides the ability to deploy FortiAP wireless access points to create a secure wireless network. FortiAP access points tunnel all wireless traffic to FortiGate or FortiWiFi platforms, enabling end-customers to use a single security platform to manage all wired and wireless network traffic.ProductsOur core product offerings consist of our FortiGate UTM/NGFW product family, along with our FortiManager central management and FortiAnalyzer central logging and reporting product families, both of which are typically purchased to complement a large FortiGate deployment.3Table of ContentsFortiGateOur flagship FortiGate physical and virtual appliances offer a broad set of security and networking functions, including firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration.
