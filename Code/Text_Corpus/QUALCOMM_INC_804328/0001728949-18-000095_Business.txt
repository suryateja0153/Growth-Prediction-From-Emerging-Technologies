Business” of this Annual Report. Seasonality. Many of our products and/or much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. As a result, QCT has tended historically to have stronger sales toward the end of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for major holiday selling seasons. Similarly, because QTL has historically recognized royalty revenues when royalties are reported by licensees, QTL has tended to record higher royalty revenues in the first calendar quarter when licensees report their sales made in the fourth calendar quarter. These trends may or may not continue in the future, in part depending on the amount of QCT revenues from modem sales for iPhone products and QTL royalties on sales of Apple’s products, both of which have been significant drivers of our historical seasonality. Further, starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, seasonal trends for QTL will be impacted by the adoption of the new guidance related to revenue recognition pursuant to which we will be required to estimate and recognize sales-based royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition by one quarter compared to the current method. We have also experienced fluctuations in revenues due to the timing of conversions and expansions of 3G and 4G networks by wireless operators and the timing of launches of flagship wireless devices and consumer demand for wireless devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property. The seasonal trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees.

In fiscal 2018 and 2017, combined revenues from GuangDong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp. Ltd. and vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd., and their respective affiliates, also comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, revenues from Samsung Electronics and suppliers to Apple Inc. each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues. QCT and QTL segment revenues related to the products of these customers/licensees comprised 52%, 58% and 54% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues from customers in China (including Hong Kong) and South Korea comprised 67% and 14%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2018, compared to 65% and 16%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, and 57% and 17%, respectively, for fiscal 2016. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits for a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.Costs and Expenses (in millions)      2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeCost of revenues$10,244 $9,792 $9,749 $452 $43Gross margin 55% 56% 59%    2018 vs. 2017The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:-decrease in higher margin QTL licensing revenues as a proportion of total revenues-reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2018 related to a portion of a business arrangement that resolved a legal dispute+reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration2017 vs. 2016The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to:-decrease in higher margin QTL licensing revenues as a proportion of total revenues-reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration+increase in QCT marginOur margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of segment results as well as products sold, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors, including disputes and/or resolutions with licensees.  43 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeResearch and development$5,625 $5,485 $5,151 $140 $334% of revenues25% 25% 22%    2018 vs. 2017The dollar increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:+$168 million, net of cost decreases driven by actions initiated under our Cost Plan, in higher costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technologies and RFFE technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and related software products-$30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in fiscal 20172017 vs. 2016The dollar increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to:+$372 million, net of cost decreases driven by actions initiated under our 2015 Strategic Realignment Plan, in higher costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technologies and RFFE technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and related software productsIn fiscal 2018, all of the costs ($474 million) related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies will be included in segment results. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that have historically been included in our QCT segment will be allocated to our QTL segment. The net effect of these changes is expected to negatively impact QTL’s EBT in fiscal 2019 by approximately $500 million and to not have a significant impact on QCT EBT in fiscal 2019.  2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeSelling, general and administrative$2,986 $2,658 $2,385 $328 $273% of revenues13% 12% 10%    2018 vs. 2017The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:+$325 million in higher litigation costs, with total litigation costs of $554 million and $229 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively +$45 million in bad debt expense recorded in fiscal 2018+$42 million in higher professional fees and costs related to other legal matters, which was primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal, partially offset by lower third-party acquisition and integration services fees-$40 million in lower amortization, primarily from our RF360 Holdings joint venture-$37 million in lower share-based compensation expense, primarily due to actions initiated under our Cost Plan2017 vs. 2016The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to:+$136 million in higher professional services fees, primarily related to third-party acquisition and integration services resulting from the proposed acquisition of NXP+$70 million in higher costs related to litigation and other legal matters+$33 million in higher employee-related expenses, primarily related to our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeOther$3,135 $1,742 $(226) $1,393 $1,968 442018Other expenses in fiscal 2018 consisted of:+    $2.0 billion charge related to the NXP termination fee +    $1.2 billion charge related to the EC fine +    $629 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan-    $676 million benefit related to the settlement of the TFTC investigation2017Other expenses in fiscal 2017 consisted of:+$927 million charge related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine, including related foreign currency losses+    $778 million charge related to the TFTC fine+    $37 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our 2015 Strategic Realignment Plan2016Other income in fiscal 2016 consisted of:+    $380 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum+    $48 million gain on the sale of our business that provided augmented reality applications-    $202 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our 2015 Strategic Realignment PlanInterest Expense and Investment and Other Income, Net (in millions)       2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeInterest expense$768 $494 $297 $274 $197          Investment and other income, net         Interest and dividend income$625 $619 $611 $6 $8Net realized gains on marketable securities41 456 239 (415) 217Net realized gains on other investments83 74 49 9 25Impairment losses on marketable securities and other investments(75) (177) (172) 102 (5)Equity in net losses of investees(145) (74) (84) (71) 10Net gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions37 (30) — 67 (30)Net (losses) gains on derivative instruments(27) 32 (8) (59) 40 $539 $900 $635 $(361) $265The increases in interest expense in fiscal 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes in May 2017 (May 2017 Notes), of which $4.0 billion were repaid between May and August 2018, and fees related to the Bridge and Term Loan Facilities entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which terminated in July 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began divesting a substantial portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to finance, in part, the then proposed acquisition of NXP. As a result, we recorded net realized gains and impairment losses on such marketable securities that we sold and expected to sell before their anticipated recovery, respectively, in fiscal 2017. The net gains on foreign currency transactions in fiscal 2018, which were partially offset by losses on derivative instruments, were primarily attributable to currency exchange rate movements on amounts accrued for the EC and TFTC fines, as well as the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain monetary assets and liabilities of our RF360 Holdings joint venture.Income Tax Expense (in millions)      2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeIncome tax expense$5,377 $555 $1,131 $4,822 $(576)Effective tax rateN/M 18% 17%  N/M - Not meaningful 45The following table summarizes the primary factors that caused our annual tax provision to differ from the expected income tax provision at the United States federal statutory rate (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate$127 $1,057 $2,392State income tax provision, net of federal benefit2 8 19Toll Charge from U.S. tax reform5,236 — —Benefits from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates(834) (963) (1,068)Valuation allowance on deferred tax asset related to NXP termination fee494 — —Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in statutory rate due to U.S. tax reform438 — —Benefits related to research and development tax credits(136) (81) (143)Nondeductible charges and reversals related to the EC, KFTC and TFTC investigations(119) 363 —Taxes on undistributed foreign earnings87 — —Impact of changes in tax reserves and audit settlements for prior year tax positions— 111 —Worthless stock deduction of domestic subsidiary— — (101)Other82 60 32Income tax expense$5,377 $555 $1,131The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation) in the United States enacted on December 22, 2017 significantly revised the United States corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the Toll Charge). As a fiscal-year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Legislation impacted us in fiscal 2018, including the change in the corporate income tax rate and the Toll Charge, while other provisions will be effective starting at the beginning of fiscal 2019, including the implementation of a modified territorial tax system. Accordingly, our federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflected a blended rate of approximately 25%.As a result of the Tax Legislation, we recorded a charge of $5.7 billion to income tax expense in fiscal 2018, comprised of $5.2 billion related to the estimated Toll Charge and $438 million resulting from the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities that existed at the end of fiscal 2017 at a lower enacted corporate income tax rate, which included a  $135 million tax benefit in fiscal 2018 related to the remeasurement of a U.S. deferred tax liability that was established as a result of a change in one of our positions due to Tax Legislation. Income tax expense for fiscal 2018 was further negatively impacted by the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the termination fee paid to NXP, which did not result in a tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 income tax expense was also impacted by the EC, KFTC and TFTC fines, and settlement with the TFTC, which are not deductible for tax purposes and portions of which were attributable to foreign jurisdictions and to the United States. These impacts were partially offset in fiscal 2018 and 2017 by lower U.S. revenues primarily related to decreased royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers and, for fiscal 2017, the BlackBerry arbitration. Income tax expense for fiscal 2017 also reflected the increase in our Singapore tax rate as a result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentives in March 2017, which was substantially offset by tax benefits resulting from the increase in our Singapore tax rate that will be in effect when certain deferred tax assets are scheduled to reverse. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a new tax incentive agreement in Singapore that results in a reduced tax rate from March 2017 through March 2022, provided that we meet specified employment and investment criteria in Singapore. Our Singapore tax rate will increase in March 2022 as a result of expiration of these incentives and again in March 2027 upon the expiration of tax incentives under a prior agreement. As a result of this new tax incentive, our income tax expense for fiscal 2018 was reduced by approximately $130 million.Unrecognized tax benefits were $217 million and $372 million at September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an agreement with the IRS related to tax positions on the classification of income in our fiscal 2016 federal income tax return. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2018 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months. 46As a result of the Tax Legislation, in fiscal 2019, several of our foreign subsidiaries will make tax elections to be treated as U.S. branches for federal income tax purposes (commonly referred to as “check-the-box” elections) effective beginning in fiscal 2018 and 2019. We believe that, by these foreign subsidiaries being treated as U.S. branches for federal income taxes, rather than controlled foreign corporations, we will significantly reduce the risk of being subject to GILTI (global intangible low-taxed income) and BEAT (base-erosion anti-abuse tax) taxes, both of which are effective for us starting in fiscal 2019. As a result of making these check-the-box elections in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect to record an estimated tax benefit of $525 million to $575 million due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the difference between the GAAP basis and the U.S. federal tax carryover basis of the existing assets and liabilities of those foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to customer incentive liabilities that have not been deducted for tax purposes. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are currently under examination by various tax authorities worldwide, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. As of September 30, 2018, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provision and the related accruals. Segment ResultsThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 results of operations for each reportable segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Equipment and services revenues mostly relate to sales of Mobile Station Modem (MSM) and accompanying Radio Frequency (RF), Power Management (PM) and wireless connectivity integrated circuits. Approximately 855 million, 804 million and 842 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.2018 vs. 2017The increase in QCT equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:+$825 million in higher RFFE product revenues primarily related to revenues from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and reflected the impact of eliminating a one-month reporting lag in fiscal 2018+$737 million in higher MSM and accompanying unit shipments primarily due to by higher demand from OEMs in China, partially offset by a decline in share at Apple-$719 million decrease due to lower average selling prices and unfavorable product mix -$83 million in lower connectivity product revenuesQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2018 primarily due to an unchanged gross margin percentage, driven by the net effect of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, offset by lower average unit costs.QCT accounts receivable decreased by 25% in fiscal 2018 from $1.81 billion to $1.36 billion, primarily due to the timing of integrated circuit shipments. QCT inventories decreased by 17% in fiscal 2018 from $2.02 billion to $1.68 billion primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand. 472017 vs. 2016The increase in QCT equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to:+$676 million in higher RFFE revenues, primarily related to revenues from our RF360 Holdings joint venture+$492 million increase due to higher shipments of connectivity products primarily related to adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries+$469 million increase due to the net impact of higher-priced product mix and lower average selling prices-$553 million decrease primarily due to lower MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments driven primarily by a decline in share at Apple, partially offset by higher demand from OEMs in ChinaQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to:+increase in gross margin percentage primarily driven by higher-margin product mix and lower average unit costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices and higher excess inventory charges-a combined increase of 1% in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to our RF360 Holdings joint ventureQTL Segment(in millions)2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeLicensing revenues$5,163 $6,445 $7,664 $(1,282) $(1,219)EBT$3,525 $5,175 $6,528 $(1,650) $(1,353)EBT as a % of revenues68% 80% 85% (12%) (5%)QTL results in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers (who are our licensees). We did not record any revenues in fiscal 2018 or the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s products. QTL revenues in fiscal 2018 included $600 million paid under an interim agreement with the other licensee in dispute. This represents a partial payment for royalties due after the second quarter of fiscal 2017 by that other licensee while negotiations continue, and it does not reflect the full amount of royalties due under the underlying license agreement. We did not record any revenues in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for royalties due on the sales of the other licensee’s products, and the other licensee underpaid royalties due in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which negatively impacted QTL revenues by an estimated amount in excess of $150 million. Royalty revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute were approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and the other licensee in dispute comprised a total of approximately $1.35 billion in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016. 2018 vs. 2017Excluding the impact of the aforementioned continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as the dispute with the other licensee, QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2018 further decreased primarily due to:-$177 million in lower royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods from certain other licenseesQTL EBT as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to:-higher selling, general and administrative expenses resulting primarily from higher litigation costs-lower QTL revenuesQTL accounts receivable decreased by 15% in fiscal 2018 from $1.74 billion to $1.47 billion, primarily due to the timing of the collection of payments from certain of our licensees.2017 vs. 2016Excluding the impact of the aforementioned continued dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as the with the other licensee, QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2017 increased primarily due to:+higher royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods+higher revenues per unit-recognition of revenues in fiscal 2016 relating to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensees-lower recognition of unearned license feesQTL EBT as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the decrease in QTL revenues. 48QSI Segment(in millions)2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 Change 2017 vs. 2016 ChangeEquipment and services revenues$100 $113 $47 $(13) $66EBT$24 $65 $386 $(41) $(321)2018 vs. 2017The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:- $14 million decrease in net gains on investments- $14 million increase in our share of losses in equity method investments- $13 million decrease resulting from lower revenues from certain development contracts with one of our equity method investees2017 vs. 2016The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to:- $380 million gain recorded in fiscal 2016 from the sale of wireless spectrum +$41 million increase resulting from higher revenues and costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our equity method investeesLooking ForwardIn the coming years, we expect continued growth in consumer demand for 3G/4G multi-mode and 4G products and services and new consumer demand for 5G products and services around the world, driven primarily by smartphones. We also expect growth in new device categories and industries, driven by the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking.As we look forward to the next several months and beyond, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a cost plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets. As part of this plan, we continue to execute on a series of targeted actions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business. We expect these cost reductions to be fully captured in fiscal 2019. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur additional restructuring and restructuring-related charges of up to $100 million, and we incurred $687 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges in fiscal 2018.•Regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions continue to investigate our business practices, and other regulatory authorities may do so in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business with remedies that include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees, including Apple, have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have in the past had a material adverse effect on our business and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business including, among others, monetary damages, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents, and/or portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable. These activities have required, and we expect that they will continue to require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and we expect that they will continue to result, in increased legal costs until the respective matters are resolved. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies” and “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report.•We are currently in dispute with Apple surrounding what we believe is an attempt by Apple to reduce the amount of royalties that its contract manufacturers (who are our licensees) are required to pay to us for use of our intellectual property. In fiscal 2018, such contract manufacturers did not fully report, and did not pay, royalties due on sales of Apple products. We have taken action against Apple’s contract manufacturers to compel them to pay the required royalties, and against Apple, as described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We did not record any revenues in fiscal 2018 or in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s products, and as a result, QTL revenues and EBT were negatively impacted by these continued disputes. We expect these companies will continue to take such actions in the future, resulting in increased legal costs and negatively impacting our future revenues, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows until the respective disputes are resolved. In the third  49quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into an interim agreement with the other licensee in dispute in which that licensee agreed to pay $700 million as partial payment for royalties due after the second quarter of fiscal 2017. That licensee paid $600 million in fiscal 2018 as a partial payment while negotiations continue. This payment does not reflect the full amount of royalties due under the underlying license agreement. If we do not reach a final agreement with that other licensee, it may not make any other payments or may not make full payments under the underlying license agreement, which may result in increased legal costs, due to exercising the dispute resolution provision in the license agreement, and will negatively impact our future revenues, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows until the dispute is resolved.•To position QTL for stability on a long-term basis, we have announced that our cellular standard-essential patent only licensing terms, including 3G, 4G and 5G through Release 15 for both single mode and multi-mode devices worldwide, will remain at the same rate, consistent with our licensing program established in China for 3G and 4G devices. A number of our licensees have entered into cellular standard-essential patent only agreements on a worldwide basis, and we expect more of our licensees may enter into such cellular standard-essential patent only agreements in the future. In addition, in fiscal 2018, we have reduced the per unit royalty cap on smartphones, which is the base on which our royalties are calculated. While we expect these developments to enhance stability for the long term, they will negatively impact QTL royalty revenues.•We expect our business, particularly QCT, to continue to be impacted by industry dynamics, including:•Concentration of device share among a few companies within the premium tier, resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those companies, and exacerbating the negative impact to our business and financial results if any of those companies do not utilize our chipsets;•Decisions by companies to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, including by bundling with other products, increasing competition;•Decisions by certain companies to utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in all or a portion of their devices. For example, we have not been the sole supplier of modems for iPhone products beginning with products that launched in September 2016, as Apple utilizes modems from one or more of our competitors in a portion of such devices. Apple is solely using one or more of our competitors’ modems, rather than our modems, in its 2018 iPhone release and may take similar actions in the future. Accordingly, QCT revenues from modem sales for iPhones have declined in fiscal 2018, are expected to further decline in fiscal 2019 and may fluctuate in the future, in part depending on the extent o
