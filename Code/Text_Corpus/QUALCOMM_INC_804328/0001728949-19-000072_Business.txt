Business” of this Annual Report. Seasonality. Many of our products and/or much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance of and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when the related royalties were recognized, which prior to fiscal 2019 was when licensees reported their sales and beginning in fiscal 2019 was when the licensees’ sales occurred. Our historical trends were impacted by our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers, which was settled in April 2019. We expect to begin recording revenues for new chipset models under our recently announced multi-year chipset agreement with Apple in the second half of fiscal 2020. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and/or may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings, including the lawsuit filed against us by the FTC. 42Results of OperationsRevenues (in millions)      2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeEquipment and services$14,611 $17,400 $16,647 $(2,789) $753Licensing9,662 5,211 5,611 4,451 (400) $24,273 $22,611 $22,258 $1,662 $3532019 vs. 2018The increase in revenues in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:+$4.7 billion in licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers (which were not allocated to our segment results)-$2.7 billion in lower equipment and services revenues from our QCT segment-$451 million in lower licensing revenues from our QTL segment2018 vs. 2017The increase in revenues in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:+$962 million reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration (which was not allocated to our segment results)+$745 million in higher equipment and services revenues from our QCT segment-$1.4 billion in lower licensing revenues from our QTL segment-$100 million reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2018 related to a portion of a business arrangement that resolved a legal dispute (which was not allocated to our segment results)Costs and Expenses (in millions, except percentages)     2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeCost of revenues$8,599 $10,244 $9,792 $(1,645) $452Gross margin 65% 55% 56%    2019 vs. 2018The increase in margin percentage in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:+higher licensing revenues resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers in fiscal 20192018 vs. 2017The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:-decrease in higher margin QTL licensing revenues as a proportion of total revenues-reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2018 related to a portion of a business arrangement that resolved a legal dispute+reduction to licensing revenues recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitrationOur margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of segment results as well as products sold, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors, including disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings, including the lawsuit filed against us by the FTC.  2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeResearch and development$5,398 $5,625 $5,485 $(227) $140% of revenues22% 25% 25%     432019 vs. 2018The dollar decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:-$221 million decrease primarily driven by actions taken under our Cost Plan, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense and higher employee cash incentive programs2018 vs. 2017The dollar increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:+$168 million, net of cost decreases driven by actions taken under our Cost Plan, in higher costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technologies and RFFE technologies from the formation of RF360 Holdings in the second quarter of fiscal 2017-$30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in fiscal 2017In fiscal 2018, all of the costs ($474 million) related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses. Beginning in fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies were included in segment results. Additionally, beginning in fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that were historically included in our QCT segment were allocated to our QTL segment. The net effect of these changes negatively impacted QTL’s EBT by $489 million in fiscal 2019 and positively impacted QCT’s EBT by $160 million in fiscal 2019. 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeSelling, general and administrative$2,195 $2,986 $2,658 $(791) $328% of revenues9% 13% 12%    2019 vs. 2018The dollar decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:-$287 million in lower professional fees and costs, primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal in fiscal 2018 and our then proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V.

Stock repurchases made under this program have significantly reduced the amount of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, resulting in a decrease to interest and dividend income in fiscal 2019. The increase in net gains on marketable securities in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by gains resulting from the initial public offering of certain non-marketable equity investments.The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $11.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes in May 2017, of which $4.0 billion were repaid between May and August 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began divesting a substantial portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to finance, in part, the then proposed acquisition of NXP. As a result, we recorded net realized gains and impairment losses on such marketable securities that we sold and expected to sell before their anticipated recovery, respectively, in fiscal 2017. Income Tax Expense (in millions. except percentages)     2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeIncome tax expense$3,095 $5,356 $543 $(2,261) $4,813Effective tax rate41% N/M 18%  N/M - Not meaningful 45The following table summarizes the primary factors that caused our annual tax provision to differ from the expected income tax provision at the United States federal statutory rate (in millions): 2019 2018 2017Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate$1,571 $97 $1,045State income tax provision, net of federal benefit10 2 8Derecognition of deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual property2,472 — —Benefits from establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets(570) — —Benefits from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction(419) — —Benefits related to the research and development tax credit(110) (136) (81)Benefits from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates(54) (834) (963)Nondeductible charges (reversals) related to the EC, KFTC and TFTC investigations51 (119) 363Impact of changes in tax reserves and audit settlements for prior year tax positions20 — 111Taxes on undistributed foreign earnings8 87 —Toll Charge from U.S. tax reform— 5,236 —Valuation allowance on deferred tax asset related to NXP termination fee— 494 —Remeasurement of deferred taxes due to changes in statutory rate due to U.S. tax reform— 443 —Other116 86 60Income tax expense$3,095 $5,356 $543The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation), which was enacted during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, significantly revised the United States corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21% and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (the Toll Charge). The Tax Legislation fundamentally changed the taxation of multinational entities, including a shift from a system of worldwide taxation with deferral to a hybrid territorial system, featuring a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion and promote U.S. production. As a fiscal-year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Legislation became effective starting at the beginning of fiscal 2019, including GILTI (global intangible low-taxed income), a new tax on income of foreign corporations, BEAT (base-erosion and anti-abuse tax) and FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). In response to the Tax Legislation and to better align our profits with our activities, we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2019, substantially all of our income is in the U.S., of which a significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment as FDII at a 13% effective tax rate. The impact of GILTI and BEAT is negligible. Accordingly, our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 reflected the effects of these provisions of the Tax Legislation. Our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflected a blended federal statutory rate of approximately 25%.As a result of the Tax Legislation, in fiscal 2019, several of our foreign subsidiaries made tax elections to be treated as U.S. branches for federal income tax purposes (commonly referred to as “check-the-box” elections) effective beginning in fiscal 2018 and 2019. As a result of making these check-the-box elections, we recorded a tax benefit of $570 million in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, the United States Treasury Department issued new temporary regulations that resulted in a change to the deductibility of dividend income received by a U.S. stockholder from a foreign corporation. As a result of this change, pursuant to an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, we relinquished the federal tax basis step-up of intellectual property that was distributed in fiscal 2018 by one of our foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. subsidiary. Therefore, the related deferred tax asset was derecognized, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense in fiscal 2019.Income tax expense for fiscal 2019 also reflected benefits from our FDII deduction (including the impact of the Apple settlement) and research and development credits, as well as the impact of the 2019 EC fine, which is not deductible for tax purposes.In fiscal 2018, as a result of the Tax Legislation, we recorded a charge of $5.7 billion to income tax expense, comprised of $5.2 billion related to the estimated Toll Charge and $438 million resulting from the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities that existed at the end of fiscal 2017 at a lower enacted corporate income tax rate, which included a $135 million tax benefit in fiscal 2018 related to the remeasurement of a U.S. deferred tax liability that was established as a result of a change in one of our positions due to the Tax Legislation.  46Income tax expense for fiscal 2018 was also impacted by the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the termination fee paid to NXP, which did not result in a tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 income tax expense was impacted by the EC, KFTC and TFTC fines, and settlement with the TFTC, which were not deductible for tax purposes (or taxable in the case of the settlement) and portions of which were attributable to foreign jurisdictions and to the United States. These impacts were partially offset in fiscal 2018 and 2017 by lower U.S. revenues primarily related to decreased royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers and, for fiscal 2017, a payment to BlackBerry in connection with an arbitration decision.Income tax expense for fiscal 2017 also reflected the increase in our Singapore tax rate as a result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentives in March 2017, which was substantially offset by tax benefits resulting from the increase in our Singapore tax rate in effect when certain deferred tax assets reversed. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a new tax incentive agreement in Singapore that results in a reduced tax rate from March 2017 through March 2022, provided that we meet specified employment and investment criteria in Singapore. Our Singapore tax rate will increase in March 2022 as a result of expiration of these incentives and again in March 2027 upon the expiration of tax incentives under a prior agreement. Without these tax incentives, our fiscal 2018 income tax expense would have been higher. During fiscal 2018, one of our Singapore subsidiaries distributed certain intellectual property to a U.S. subsidiary, substantially reducing the benefit of these tax incentives going forward. Unrecognized tax benefits were $1.7 billion and $217 million at September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our plan to apply for a refund of Korean withholding tax (which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision) as a result of recent court rulings in Korea, among other factors. If successful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are currently under examination by various tax authorities worldwide, primarily related to transfer pricing. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. As of September 29, 2019, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provision and the related accruals. Segment ResultsThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 results of operations for each reportable segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

Beginning in fiscal 2019, we combined our Small Cells business, which sells products designed for the implementation of small cells to address the challenge of meeting the increased demand for mobile data, into our QCT segment. Revenues and operating results related to the Small Cells business were included in nonreportable segments through the end of fiscal 2018. Prior period segment information has not been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation as such adjustments are insignificant. Equipment and services revenues mostly relate to sales of Mobile Station Modem (MSM™), Radio Frequency (RF), Power Management (PM) and wireless connectivity integrated circuits. MSM integrated circuits include our stand-alone Mobile Data Modems and Snapdragon platforms, including processors and modems. Approximately 650 million, 855 million and 804 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 472019 vs. 2018The decrease in QCT equipment and services revenues was primarily due to:-$2.7 billion in lower MSM and accompanying unit shipments, primarily driven by lower modem sales to Apple and a decline in demand from OEMs in China-$515 million in lower connectivity product revenues, primarily driven by a decline in demand for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth products from OEMs in China+$552 million in higher revenues per MSM and accompanying unit shipment, primarily driven by a favorable shift in mix related to our premium-tier productsQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to:-lower QCT revenues+decrease in operating expenses, primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of research and development expense allocated to QCT in fiscal 2019 and actions under our Cost PlanQCT accounts receivable decreased by 33% in fiscal 2019 from $1.36 billion to $908 million, primarily due to the decrease in revenues, as well as the impact of settling certain receivables in connection with the settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers. QCT inventories decreased by 17% in fiscal 2019 from $1.68 billion to $1.40 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the overall quantity of units on hand.2018 vs. 2017The increase in QCT equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:+$825 million in higher RFFE product revenues primarily related to revenues from RF360 Holdings, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and reflected the impact of eliminating a one-month reporting lag in fiscal 2018+$737 million in higher MSM and accompanying unit shipments primarily driven by higher demand from OEMs in China, partially offset by a decline in share at Apple-$719 million decrease due to lower average selling prices and unfavorable product mix -$83 million in lower connectivity product revenuesQCT EBT as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2018 primarily due to an unchanged gross margin percentage, driven by the net effect of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, offset by lower average unit costs.QTL Segment (in millions, except percentages) 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeLicensing revenues$4,591 $5,042 $6,412 $(451) $(1,370)EBT$2,954 $3,404 $5,142 $(450) $(1,738)EBT as a % of revenues64% 68% 80% (4%) (12%)QTL results in fiscal 2019 reflected the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter as compared to prior periods. Prior period results have not been adjusted for the adoption of the new accounting guidance. As a result of the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers, QTL results for fiscal 2019 included royalties from Apple and its contract manufactures for sales made in the June 2019 and September 2019 quarters. Revenues in the first six months of fiscal 2019 and all of fiscal 2018 did not include royalties due on sales of Apple or other products by Apple’s contract manufacturers.QTL revenues in fiscal 2019 included $450 million of royalties due under a second interim agreement with Huawei that concluded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and although negotiations continue, we have not reached a final agreement with Huawei. We did not record any revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for royalties due on the sales of Huawei’s products. QTL revenues in fiscal 2018 included $600 million paid under an interim agreement with Huawei for royalties due after the second quarter of fiscal 2017. These payments represent minimum, non-refundable amounts for royalties due and do not reflect the full amount of royalties due under the underlying license agreement.We did not record any revenues in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for royalties due on the sales of Apple or other products by Apple’s contract manufacturers and Huawei’s products, and Huawei underpaid royalties due in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which negatively impacted QTL revenues. Royalty revenues related to the products of Apple’s contract manufacturers and Huawei were approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. 482019 vs. 2018QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2019, which primarily related to royalties due on sales made by our licensees in the December 2018, March 2019, June 2019 and September 2019 quarters, decreased compared to licensing revenues in fiscal 2018, which primarily related to royalties due on sales made by our licensees in the September 2017, December 2017, March 2018 and June 2018 quarters, primarily due to:-$757 million in lower estimated revenues per unit compared to revenues per reported unit, in part reflecting licensees entering into new 5G multimode license agreements with rights to our cellular standard-essential patents only (compared to previous licenses which also included rights to certain other non-cellular essential patents), and decreases in our per unit royalty caps-$150 million in lower royalty revenues from Huawei under the interim agreements+$484 million increase in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based products (including multimode products) compared to reported sales of 3G/4G-based products, primarily due to the new license agreement with Apple, partially offset by a decline in unit demand and a shift in OEM share towards HuaweiQTL EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to:-higher research and development costs due to an increase in the amount of research and development expense allocated to QTL in fiscal 2019-lower QTL revenues+lower selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily from lower litigation costs and lower bad debt expense QTL accounts receivable increased by 5% in fiscal 2019 from $1.47 billion to $1.54 billion, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, partially offset by the impact of settling approximately $960 million of receivables that were related to the short payment in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of royalties due from Apple’s contract manufacturers in connection with the settlement agreements with Apple and its contract manufacturers.2018 vs. 2017Excluding the impact of the prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as the dispute with Huawei, QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2018 further decreased primarily due to:-$177 million in lower royalty revenues recognized related to devices sold in prior periods from certain other licenseesQTL EBT as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to:-higher selling, general and administrative expenses resulting primarily from higher litigation costs-lower QTL revenuesQSI Segment (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 Change 2018 vs. 2017 ChangeEquipment and services revenues$152 $100 $113 $52 $(13)EBT$344 $24 $65 $320 $(41)2019 vs. 2018The increase in QSI EBT in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:+ $270 million increase in net gains on investments, primarily driven by gains resulting from the initial public offering of certain non-marketable equity investments+$91 million increase resulting from higher revenues and lower costs associated with certain development contracts with an equity method investee- $41 million increase in impairment losses on investments, primarily related to an equity method investeeQSI segment assets, which primarily consist of marketable and non-marketable equity investments, increased by 34% in fiscal 2019 from $1.28 billion to $1.71 billion, primarily due to recording certain non-marketable equity investments at fair value upon becoming publicly traded and acquiring non-marketable equity investments.2018 vs. 2017The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to:- $14 million decrease in net gains on investments- $14 million increase in our share of losses in equity method investments- $13 million decrease resulting from lower revenues from certain development contracts with one of our equity method investeesLooking ForwardIn the coming years, we expect consumer demand for 3G/4G multimode and 4G products and services to decline as new consumer demand for 3G/4G/5G multimode and 5G products and services ramp around the world. We expect growth in new  49device categories and industries, resulting from the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking.As we look forward to the next several months and beyond, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•In May 2019, in United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v. QUALCOMM Incorporated, the court issued an Order ruling against us and imposing certain injunctive relief. We disagree with the court’s conclusions, interpretation of the facts and application of the law. Accordingly, we filed a motion to stay certain of the remedies with, and have appealed the decision to, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). In August 2019, our partial motion to stay was granted in its entirety by the Ninth Circuit. Regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions have investigated our business practices and instituted proceedings against us, and they or other regulatory authorities may do so in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. These activities have required, and we expect that they will continue to require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and we expect that they will continue to result, in increased legal costs until the respective matters are resolved.
