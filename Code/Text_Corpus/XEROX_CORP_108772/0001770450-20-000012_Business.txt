As customers seek to manage information across digital and physical platforms, we deliver a seamless, secure and sustainable experience. Whether inventing the copier, the Ethernet, the laser printer or more, Xerox has long defined the modern work experience and continues to do so with investments in artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and services for Internet of Things (IoT), digital packaging, 3-D printing and Clean Technologies (cleantech). Geographically, our footprint spans approximately 160 countries and allows us to deliver our technology and solutions to customers of all sizes, regardless of complexity or number of customer locations.Xerox Strategy We are focused on growing the company’s revenue and portfolio by increasing our position as a leader in the printer market while investing in key areas of growth including software and services, as well as focused areas of innovation. Our core printer market is estimated at approximately $68 billion1, while our adjacent growth markets of Software and Services are estimated at approximately $34 billion1. Under an enterprise-wide initiative called Project Own It, we are streamlining our operations and increasing efficiency and speed to market while reducing costs. Project Own It objectives are designed to enable us to increase our cash flow and profits while reinvesting in our business and returning capital to shareholders. We have four strategic initiatives that we believe will position Xerox for success:1.Optimize operations for simplicity•Continuously improve operating model for greater efficiency•Optimize the supply chain and supplier competitiveness •Leverage digital technologies to make it easier to do business with Xerox2.Drive Revenue•Enhance the customer experience•Expand integrated solutions comprised of hardware, software and services•Focus on driving growth within the small and midsize businesses (SMB)3.Re-energize the innovation engine•Invest in growing market segments such as 3D printing, AI and IoT•Leverage software capability to launch new services•Monetize new innovations4.Focus on cash flow and increasing capital returns•Maximize cash flow generation •Return at least 50 percent of free cash flow to shareholders (Operating cash flows from continuing operations less capital expenditures)•Focus on ROI and internal rate of return to make capital allocation decisions_______(1) Market estimates are derived from third-party forecasts produced by major industry research firms.Optimize Operations for SimplicityThrough Project Own It, we have delivered approximately $1 billion of savings during the 18 month-period ending December 31, 2019 (including $640 million of savings during fiscal year 2019), consistent with our expectations. We expect to deliver approximately $450 million of cost savings in 2020, and a total of $1.5 billion for the full 3-year program ending in 2021. We expect savings generated by Project Own It to continue to support the expansion of our margins while allowing us to invest in areas of the business that will help us improve our revenue trajectory. Drive Revenue We are a leader in our industry and have a strong, and valuable global brand. We have a three-year revenue roadmap that was outlined in 2019 to deliver flat year-over-year revenue in 2021. This roadmap focuses on five key areas to drive revenue improvement, including:•Improve our core technology business by building on our leadership positions in the market. Within the workplace, our ConnectKey technology and productivity apps transform Xerox multi-function printers (MFPs) into workplace assistants that help users automate time-consuming processes. Within production print, Xerox is unique in being able to pair its industry-leading presses with its ability to offer software that takes clients from document creation to distribution.Xerox 2019 Annual Report      2Table of Contents                                                    •Expand our services and software business by building on our leadership in the Managed Print Services (MPS) market to deliver more intelligent workplace solutions and digital services targeted at specific industry needs, and by growing our software business with a focus on personalization and content management software solutions.•Capitalize on the opportunity in the SMB market by increasing our investments in indirect market channels and in our Xerox Business Solutions (XBS) and similar European sales channels.•Transform the customer experience by building a digital experience and enhancing our e-commerce sales platforms.•Drive innovation and new growth businesses by increasing focus and investment in our four innovation programs: digital packaging and print, AI workflow assistants for knowledge workers, 3D printing and digital manufacturing, sensors and services for IoT, and cleantech.Re-energize the Innovation EngineXerox has long defined the workplace experience and we are continuing to invest in key areas of technology that position us to do so for decades to come. In addition to investing in our core printing technology, we also are investing in key adjacencies that include digital packaging and print, AI workflow assistants for knowledge workers, 3D printing and digital manufacturing, sensors and services for IoT, and cleantech. We also see opportunity in expanding our core into areas such as workflow automation, IT services, customized communication and security technologies.  We expect our investments in innovation for our core and adjacent growth markets will deliver incremental value for our customers and drive profitable revenue growth for our business. Our innovation goals are supported by cross disciplinary research programs in our different research centers. Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), the most prominent of these centers, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox located in Silicon Valley, California. It provides our commercial and government clients with R&D and open innovation services. PARC scientists have deep technological expertise in areas that we consider fundamental to bring high-impact innovations to our customers and the world; such areas include artificial intelligence, intelligent sensing, computer vision, printed electronics, energy and cleantech, and digital design and manufacturing.Refer to the Research, Development and Engineering Expenses (RD&E) section in Item 7 to this 2019 Form 10-K as well as Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding RD&E spending.Focus on Cash Flow and Increasing Capital ReturnsOur business is based on a model where a large portion of revenues are generated by multi-year contractual arrangements, with approximately 75 percent coming from post-sale revenue, our most profitable revenue stream. Additionally, there is low annual capital expenditures (less than 2 percent of revenues) required to support our current business model.  These factors result in stable gross margins and operating margins as well as strong and stable cash flow generation.We will deploy our substantial cash flow to drive shareholder returns through:•A commitment to return at least 50 percent of our free cash flow (Operating cash flows from continuing operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases; and•Selective pursuit of acquisitions in targeted growth areas. We target to manage our core debt (debt excluding financing related debt) to under two times expected annual free cash flow.AcquisitionsOur strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allow us to pursue M&A opportunities to support our growth expectations. We maintain a broad M&A pipeline that includes targets within the industry and adjacent markets. Our current acquisition strategy has been focused on further penetrating the SMB market through acquisitions of local area resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers). During 2019, Xerox acquired Rabbit Office Automation and Heritage Business Systems, Inc., two multi-brand dealers that further our penetration of the SMB market. Further details about our acquisitions can be found in Note 6 - Acquisitions, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2019, Xerox proposed a business combination transaction with HP Inc. (HP). Further details regarding this proposal can be found within the Executive Overview in
