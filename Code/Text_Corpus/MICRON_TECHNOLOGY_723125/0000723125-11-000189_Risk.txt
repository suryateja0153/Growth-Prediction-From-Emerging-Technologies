Risk Factors."  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.The functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the U.S. dollar.  We held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of U.S. $512 million as of September 1, 2011 and U.S. $504 million as of September 2, 2010.  We also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of U.S. $944 million as of September 1, 2011, and U.S. $901 million as of September 2, 2010.  Because the substantial majority of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollar, we do not have significant natural hedges to offset our expenditures denominated in other currencies.  Significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) were as follows (in U.S. dollar equivalents):  2011 2010  Singapore Dollars Yen Euro Other Singapore Dollars Yen Euro Other  (amounts in millions)Cash and cash equivalents $22 $4 $33 $21 $27 $27 $53 $19Receivables 92 25 72 18 52 15 77 23Deferred tax assets — 39 7 1 — 115 6 1Other assets 12 16 88 62 9 13 66 1Accounts payable and accrued expenses (124) (194) (240) (44) (158) (186) (168) (45)Debt (81) — (3) (3) (78) (9) (61) —Other liabilities (15) (8) (128) (104) (14) (75) (100) (7)Net assets (liabilities) $(94) $(118) $(171) $(49) $(162) $(100) $(127) $(8)We estimate that, based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 1, 2011, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in currency gains or losses of approximately U.S. $2 million for the euro and $1 million for the yen and Singapore dollar.  During 2010, we began using derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk.  (See "
