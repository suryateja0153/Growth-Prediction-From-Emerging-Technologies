– Business – Research and Development."Income TaxesOur income taxes reflect operations in tax jurisdictions, including Singapore and Taiwan, where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and the tax rates are significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate; operations outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates; and a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in the United States. Income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:For the year ended 2017 2016 2015Utilization of and other changes in net deferred tax assets of MMJ, MMT, and Inotera $54 $(114) $(80)U.S. valuation allowance release resulting from business acquisition — 41 —Other income tax (provision) benefit, primarily other non-U.S. operations (168) 54 (77)  $(114) $(19) $(157)       Effective tax rate 2.2% (6.8)% 6.0%Income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of $28 million and $58 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions.We have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our U.S. operations. Management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowance. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists.We operate in a number of locations outside the Unites States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030, reduced our tax provision by $742 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.64) for 2017, were not material in 2016, and by $338 million ($0.29 per diluted share) for 2015.(See "
