Business – Overview.”Impact of COVID-19 on Our BusinessEvents surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe, which has affected demand for certain of our products. While we have observed demand increases in some areas of our business that support a stay-at-home economy, such as products used in data center infrastructure, notebook computers, and similar applications, we have also observed demand decreases in other categories such as smartphones, consumer electronics, automotive, desktop PCs, and enterprise markets. The ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will impact demand for our products depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and actions to contain and treat its impacts.  34While all our global sites are currently operating with close to full staff and at normal capacity levels, our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates. We may be required to, or deem it to be in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, to alter our business operations in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment. It is not clear what potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our financial results. We are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and remain committed to the health and safety of our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, distributors, and communities.Our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak include the following:•We have put health screenings in place, required physical distancing, established team separation protocols, and made equipment upgrades at our facilities. We are also prohibiting visitors, have significantly decreased business travel, and are generally requiring team members to work from home where possible. Where work from home is not possible, all on-site team members must pass thermal scanning equipment to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature and must wear a mask at all times.•To respond to changing market conditions, we have shifted some supply from markets which have experienced declines in demand, such as smartphones, consumer electronics, desktop PCs, automotive, and enterprise to markets that have experienced demand increases, such as data center, cloud server, notebooks, and gaming.•We have evaluated our supply chain and communicated with our suppliers to identify supply gaps and taken steps to ensure continuity. In some cases, we have added alternative suppliers and increased our on-hand inventory of raw materials needed in our operations.•We have added assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of captive operations and external partners.•We are evaluating all our construction projects across our global manufacturing operations and enacting protocols to enhance the safety of our team members, suppliers, and contractors.•We have developed strategies and are implementing measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios, such as limitations on new hiring and business travel and reductions of discretionary spending.•We are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements, relevant regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members, while safely continuing operations at our sites across the globe.We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations, but we cannot predict how the steps we, our team members, government entities, suppliers, or customers take in response to the COVID-19 outbreak will ultimately impact our business, outlook, or results of operations.35 | 2020 10-KResults of OperationsConsolidated Results For the year ended202020192018Revenue$21,435 100 %$23,406 100 %$30,391 100 %Cost of goods sold14,883 69 %12,704 54 %12,500 41 %Gross margin6,552 31 %10,702 46 %17,891 59 %Research and development2,600 12 %2,441 10 %2,141 7 %Selling, general, and administrative881 4 %836 4 %813 3 %Other operating (income) expense, net68 — %49 — %(57)— %Operating income3,003 14 %7,376 32 %14,994 49 %Interest income (expense), net(80)— %77 — %(222)(1)%Other non-operating income (expense), net60 — %(405)(2)%(465)(2)%Income tax (provision) benefit(280)(1)%(693)(3)%(168)(1)%Equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees7 — %3 — %(1)— %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(23)— %(45)— %(3)— %Net income attributable to Micron$2,687 13 %$6,313 27 %$14,135 47 %Total Revenue: Total revenue for 2020 decreased 8% as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decline in DRAM sales partially offset by an increase in NAND sales. Sales of DRAM products for 2020 decreased 14% as compared to 2019 as average selling prices declined in the mid-30% range due to challenging market conditions, partially offset by growth in bit shipments in the low-30% range driven by cloud server, enterprise server, and mobile markets. Sales of NAND products for 2020 increased 14% as compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in bit shipments in the mid-20% range driven by sales of SSDs to data center customers and sales of managed NAND products, partially offset by a high-single digit percent decline in average selling prices.The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) enacted broad trade restrictions with respect to Huawei (which represented approximately 10% of our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 12% in 2019) that took effect on September 15, 2020 and currently prevent us from shipping products to Huawei. We cannot predict the duration these restrictions will remain in place and whether the BIS will grant us licenses to ship products to Huawei. We may not be able to replace the lost revenue opportunities associated with such restrictions.Total revenue for 2019 decreased 23% as compared to 2018 primarily due to pricing declines resulting from the challenging memory market environment in 2019. Sales of DRAM products for 2019 decreased 28% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 30% resulting from supply and demand imbalances, customer inventory corrections, and CPU shortages. Sales of NAND products for 2019 decreased 12% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in the mid-40% range resulting from supply and demand imbalances, which were partially offset by significant increases in sales volumes. In addition, demand for our NAND products was adversely affected by the transition from SATA SSDs to NVMe SSDs. The higher NAND sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of high-value mobile managed NAND products as well as discrete NAND products enabled by our execution in ramping 64- and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND.Overall Gross Margin: Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 31% for 2020 from 46% for 2019, primarily due to declines in average selling prices, partially offset by the effect of decreases in non-cash depreciation expense from the revision in estimated useful lives of equipment in our NAND wafer fabrication facilities described below, cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies, and continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs. Our gross margins included the impact of underutilization costs at MTU of $557 million for 2020, $384 million for 2019, and $262 million for 2018. We expect underutilization costs at MTU to gradually decline through 2021 as we redeploy equipment and continue to right-size our capacity.  36Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 46% for 2019 from 59% for 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies and from continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs. We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on our assessment of planned technology node transitions, capital spending, and re-use rates, we revised the estimated useful lives of the existing equipment in our NAND wafer fabrication facilities and our research and development facilities from five years to seven years as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2020. The revision in estimated useful lives reduced NAND manufacturing depreciation expense by approximately $565 million in 2020, of which approximately $165 million remained capitalized in inventory as of the end of 2020. Adjusting for the effect of the reduced amount of depreciation expense remaining in inventory, the revision in estimated useful lives benefited cost of goods sold by approximately $400 million for 2020.Revenue by Business UnitFor the year ended202020192018CNBU$9,184 43 %$9,968 43 %$15,252 50 %MBU5,702 27 %6,403 27 %6,579 22 %SBU3,765 18 %3,826 16 %5,022 17 %EBU2,759 13 %3,137 13 %3,479 11 %All Other25 — %72 — %59 — % $21,435 $23,406 $30,391 Percentages of total revenue may not total 100% due to rounding.Changes in revenue for each business unit for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows:•CNBU revenue decreased 8% primarily due to DRAM price declines driven by imbalances in supply and demand, partially offset by bit sales growth across key markets, particularly in cloud server and graphics markets. In addition, in the second quarter of 2020, we determined that the 3D XPoint technology and product roadmap are more closely aligned with our CNBU strategy than our SBU strategy and 3D XPoint became an integral part of CNBU. Accordingly, we began to report all 3D XPoint activities within CNBU from that date.•MBU revenue decreased 11% primarily due to price declines, partially offset by bit sales growth for high-value mobile MCP products.•SBU revenue decreased 2% primarily due to the decline in 3D XPoint revenue in SBU after the first quarter of 2020 as noted above and NAND selling price declines, partially offset by bit sales growth for SSDs. SBU revenue included products manufactured and sold to Intel under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost, which included 3D XPoint memory and NAND, aggregating $124 million, $682 million, and $541 million, for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.•EBU revenue decreased 12% primarily due to price declines resulting from the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on automotive, industrial, and consumer segments partially offset by bit sales growth from transitions to an increasing mix of high-density DRAM and NAND products.Changes in revenue for each business unit for 2019 as compared to 2018 were as follows:•CNBU revenue decreased 35% due to challenging market conditions in 2019, which led to price declines.•MBU revenue decreased 3% primarily due to price declines offset by strong execution in developing and qualifying mobile managed NAND products and continued content growth in smartphones, which combined to drive a significant increase in shipment volumes.•SBU revenue decreased 24% primarily due to price declines, partially offset by significant growth in shipment volumes as a result of strong execution in ramping 64-layer and 96-layer TLC NAND products. •EBU revenue decreased 10% primarily due to lower sales to consumer markets as a result of weak demand and pricing, partially offset by increases in sales to automotive and industrial markets.37 | 2020 10-KOperating Income (Loss) by Business UnitFor the year ended202020192018CNBU$2,010 22 %$4,645 47 %$9,773 64 %MBU1,074 19 %2,606 41 %3,033 46 %SBU36 1 %(386)(10)%964 19 %EBU301 11 %923 29 %1,473 42 %All Other(2)(8)%13 18 %— — % $3,419 $7,801 $15,243 Percentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue for each business unit.Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows:•CNBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in DRAM pricing and MTU underutilization costs in 2020 related to 3D XPoint.•MBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in low-power DRAM and NAND pricing, partially offset by increases in sales of high-value MCP products and manufacturing cost reductions.•SBU operating margin improved primarily due to lower 3D XPoint underutilization costs, manufacturing cost reductions, increases in sales volumes, and improved product mix, partially offset by declines in selling prices.•EBU operating income decreased as a result of declines in pricing, partially offset by increases in sales volumes to the automotive and industrial markets.Changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2019 as compared to 2018 were as follows:•CNBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in pricing and higher R&D costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions.•MBU operating income decreased primarily due to declines in pricing partially offset by increases in sales of high-value managed NAND products and manufacturing cost reductions.•SBU operating margin declined primarily due to declines in pricing, which were partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and increases in sales volumes. SBU operating results for 2019 and 2018 were adversely impacted by the underutilization costs at IMFT.•EBU operating income decreased as a result of declines in pricing and higher R&D costs partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and increases in sales volumes.Operating Expenses and OtherResearch and Development: R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed, amounts reimbursed under R&D cost-sharing agreements, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for 2020 were 7% higher as compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers, a reduction of R&D reimbursements from our partners, increases in employee compensation, and increases in subcontractor expense, partially offset by lower depreciation expense from the revision of the estimated useful lives of equipment. R&D expenses were reduced by $110 million in 2020 due to the revision of the estimated useful lives of equipment. R&D expenses for 2019 were 14% higher as compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in reimbursements from our R&D cost-sharing arrangements, increases in depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending, and increases in employee compensation.  38We shared the cost of certain product and process development activities with development partners, including agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel. We substantially completed our cost-sharing agreements with Intel to develop 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technology in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Our R&D expenses were reduced by $60 million for 2019 and $201 million for 2018 from reimbursements under these arrangements. Reimbursements were not significant in 2020.Selling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for 2020 were 5% higher as compared to 2019 due to increases in employee compensation and legal costs, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. SG&A expenses for 2019 were 3% higher as compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in legal costs and consulting fees, partially offset by a reduction in employee compensation and sales commissions.Income Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:For the year ended202020192018Income tax (provision) benefit, excluding items below$(117)$(530)$(274)Utilization of and other changes in net deferred tax assets of MMJ, MMT, and MTTW(163)(173)(68)Repatriation Tax, net of adjustments related to uncertain tax positions— 10 (1,030)Release of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations— — 1,337 Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflecting lower U.S. corporate tax rates— — (133)$(280)$(693)$(168)Effective tax rate9.4 %9.8 %1.2 %Our income tax provision decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of reductions in our profit before tax. Our effective tax rate increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the Foreign Minimum Tax. In December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which imposed a one-time transition tax in 2018 (the “Repatriation Tax”) and, beginning in 2019, created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings (the “Foreign Minimum Tax”). We recognize the Foreign Minimum Tax in the period the tax is incurred.We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $215 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.19) for 2020, by $756 million ($0.66 per diluted share) for 2019, and by $1.96 billion ($1.59 per diluted share) for 2018.(See “
