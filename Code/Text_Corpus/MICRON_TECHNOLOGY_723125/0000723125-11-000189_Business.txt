Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Shareholders' Equity" notes.)Joint venturesIn 2011, IM Flash distributed $225 million to Intel.  Timing of future distributions to Intel is subject to market conditions and availability of cash.  In 2011, IM Flash began installing tools at its new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Singapore.  We made contributions to IM Flash of $1,580 million in 2011 and $103 million in September 2011, subsequent to 2011.  Intel did not make any contributions to IM Flash in 2011 but contributed $131 million in September 2011.  We expect to make additional significant contributions to IM Flash in future periods in connection with tool installations and  the further ramp of production at the Singapore facility.  The level of our future capital contributions to IM Flash will depend on market conditions and the extent to which Intel participates with us in future IM Flash capital calls.In the second quarter of 2011, we acquired HP's and Canon's interests in our TECH subsidiary for an aggregate of $159 million and we became a 100% owner of TECH as a result of these transactions.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of September 1, 2011:  Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 yearsNotes payable (1) $2,136 $39 $1,163 $30 $904Capital lease obligations (1) 497 151 158 118 70Operating leases 116 32 42 17 25Purchase obligations 1,781 1,277 486 9 9Other long-term liabilities 559 — 282 152 125Total $5,089 $1,499 $2,131 $326 $1,133           (1) Includes interest          38The obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long-term debt.  The expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information.  Timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices, changes to agreed-upon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations.Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancellable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services ("take-or-pay").  If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table.  If the obligation is cancellable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation.  Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.Pursuant to the Inotera Supply Agreement, we have an obligation to purchase 50% of Inotera’s semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions.  As purchase quantities are based on qualified production output, the Inotera Supply Agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore we did not include our obligations under the Inotera Supply Agreement in the contractual obligations table above.  Our obligation under the Inotera Supply Agreement also fluctuates due to pricing which is based on manufacturing costs and revenues associated with the resale of DRAM products.  We purchased $641 million of DRAM products from Inotera in 2011 under the Inotera Supply Agreement.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsConcurrent with the offering of the 2031 Notes on July 26, 2011, we entered into capped call transactions (the "2011 Capped Calls") that have an initial strike price of approximately $9.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which was set to the initial conversion price of the 2031 Notes.  The 2011 Capped Calls are in four equal tranches, have cap prices of $11.40, $12.16, $12.67 and $13.17 per share, and cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments similar to those contained in the 2031 Notes, an approximate combined total of 72.6 million shares of common stock.  The 2011 Capped Calls expire on various dates between July 2014 and February 2016.  The 2011 Capped Calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2031 Notes.Concurrent with the offering of the 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes") in April 2009, we paid approximately $25 million for three capped call instruments that have an initial strike price of approximately $5.08 per share (the "2009 Capped Calls").  The 2009 Capped Calls have a cap price of $6.64 per share and cover an aggregate of approximately 45.2 million shares of common stock.  The 2009 Capped Calls expire in October and November of 2012.  The 2009 Capped Calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 2013 Notes.Concurrent with the offering of the 2014 Notes in May 2007, we paid approximately $151 million for three Capped Call transactions (the "2007 Capped Calls").  The 2007 Capped Calls cover an aggregate of approximately 91.3 million shares of common stock.  The 2007 Capped Calls are in three equal tranches with cap prices of $17.25, $20.13 and $23.00 per share, respectively, each with an initial strike price of approximately $14.23 per share, subject to certain adjustments.  The 2007 Capped Calls expire on various dates between November 2011 and December 2012.  The 2007 Capped Calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 2014 Notes.(See "
