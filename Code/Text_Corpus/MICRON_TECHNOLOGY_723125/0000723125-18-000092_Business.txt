Higher sales in 2018 for both DRAM and NAND products as compared to 2017 were driven by strong execution in delivering high-value products featuring our 1Xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND technologies combined with strong demand for products across our primary markets. Sales of DRAM products for 2018 increased 64% from 2017 primarily due to an increase in average selling prices of approximately 35% and an increase in sales volumes of approximately 20% as a result of strong market conditions, particularly for cloud, enterprise, mobile, and graphics markets, combined with increased sales into high-value markets. Sales of trade NAND products for 2018 increased 26% from 2017 despite declines in average selling prices primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 40% driven by increases in sales of high-value SSD and mobile managed NAND products enabled by strong demand and our execution in delivering 3D NAND products.Total net sales for 2017 increased 64% as compared to 2016 due to strong conditions across our primary markets, particularly for enterprise, mobile, client, and SSD storage. Sales of DRAM products for 2017 increased 80% from 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 50% and an increase in average selling prices of approximately 20% as a result of the strong market conditions. Sales of trade NAND products for 2017 increased approximately 50% as compared to 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 65% resulting from strong market demand for our 3D NAND products, which was partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Increases in DRAM and NAND sales volumes for 2017 as compared 2016 were enabled by higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology and solid execution. Increases in sales volumes for NAND products for 2017 were also enabled by key customer qualifications of new products.Overall Gross MarginOur overall gross margin percentage increased to 59% for 2018 from 42% for 2017 primarily due to favorable market conditions across key markets combined with strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies, including 1Xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND, enabling manufacturing cost reductions. For 2018 as compared to 2017, pricing for DRAM products increased while manufacturing costs declined and, for NAND products, manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 42% for 2017 from 20% for 2016 primarily due to strong markets that drove favorable pricing conditions and solid execution in manufacturing cost reductions from improvements in product and process technology. For 2017 as compared to 2016, pricing for DRAM products increased while manufacturing costs declined  29and, for NAND products, manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in selling prices. We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we identified factors such as the lengthening period of time between DRAM product technology node transitions, an increased re-use rate of equipment, and industry trends. As a result, we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our DRAM wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. The effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation expense at the time by approximately $100 million per quarter.From January 2013 through December 2015, we purchased all of Inotera's DRAM output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components. After December 2015 through December 6, 2016, the date we acquired the remaining interest in Inotera, the price for DRAM products we purchased from Inotera was based on a formula that equally shared margin between Inotera and us. Under these agreements, we purchased $504 million and $1.43 billion of DRAM products from Inotera in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represented 9% of our aggregate DRAM gigabit production for 2017 and 30% for 2016.

Sales into cloud and graphics markets more than doubled in 2018 as compared to 2017. MBU sales for 2018, which were comprised primarily of mobile LPDRAM and managed NAND products, increased 49% as compared to 2017 primarily due to customer qualifications for LPDRAM and managed NAND products, which combined with higher memory content in smartphones to drive improvements in DRAM pricing and increases in sales volumes. SBU sales of trade NAND products for 2018 increased 13% as compared to 2017 driven by higher sales of SSD storage products, which increased by 72%, partially offset by declines in SBU NAND component sales from a strategic reallocation of supply from component sales to SSD and mobile managed NAND products. Increases in SBU sales volumes for 2018 resulting from strong demand for cloud and enterprise SSD markets more than offset declines in selling prices. SBU sales also include "non-trade" products consisting of products manufactured and sold to Intel through IMFT under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost, which included 3D XPoint memory and NAND products, aggregating $541 million, $553 million, and $501 million, for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. EBU sales for 2018 increased 29% as compared to 2017 primarily due to strong demand across EBU's primary markets including consumer, industrial multimarkets, and automotive. EBU sales were comprised of products incorporating DRAM, NAND, and NOR Flash in decreasing order of revenue.CNBU sales for 2017 increased 90% as compared to 2016 due to increases in average selling prices due to strong demand across key markets, growth in the cloud market driven by significant increases in DRAM content per server, and increases in sales of our GDDR5 and GDDR5X products into the graphics market driven by strong demand from the gaming industry. MBU sales for 2017 increased 72% as compared to 2016 primarily due to significant increases in sales volumes, driven by customer qualifications for LPDRAM and managed NAND products, combined with higher memory content in smartphones and growth in sales of eMCP products. MBU sales growth in 2017 was partially offset by declines in average selling prices for trade NAND products. SBU sales of trade NAND products for 2017 increased 41% as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in sales volumes from strong demand, particularly for component NAND and client and cloud SSD storage products, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. SBU sales of SSD storage products increased by 137% for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the launch of new SSD products incorporating our TLC 3D NAND technology. EBU sales for 2017 increased 39% as compared to 2016 primarily due to strong demand and higher sales volumes for DRAM and eMCP in consumer markets and DRAM and eMMC products in the automotive markets. 30Operating Income (Loss) by Business UnitFor the year ended 2018 2017 2016CNBU $9,773 64% $3,755 44% $(25) (1)%MBU 3,033 46% 927 21% 97 4 %SBU 964 19% 552 12% (123) (4)%EBU 1,473 42% 975 36% 473 24 %All Other — —% 23 35% 28 28 %  $15,243   $6,232   $450  Percentages reflect operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for each business unit.CNBU operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes resulting from strong demand for our products combined with manufacturing cost reductions. MBU operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to increases in pricing and sales volumes for LPDRAM products, higher sales of high-value managed NAND products, and manufacturing cost reductions. SBU operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions enabled by our execution in transitioning to 64-layer TLC 3D NAND products and improvements in product mix. SBU operating income for 2018 was adversely impacted by higher costs associated with IMFT's production of 3D XPoint memory products at less than full capacity. EBU operating income for 2018 increased as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in average selling prices, manufacturing cost reductions, and increases in sales volumes, partially offset by higher R&D costs.CNBU operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to improved pricing from strong market conditions, manufacturing cost reductions, and product mix. MBU operating income for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher R&D costs and declines in average selling prices for trade NAND products. SBU operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. EBU operating income for 2017 increased as compared to 2016 as a result of manufacturing cost reductions, which outpaced declines in average selling prices, and increases in sales volumes.Operating Expenses and OtherSelling, General, and AdministrativeSG&A expenses for 2018 were 9% higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in legal costs, technical and consulting fees, and employee compensation. SG&A expenses for 2017 were 13% higher than 2016 primarily due to increases in employee compensation as well as transaction costs related to the Inotera Acquisition.Research and DevelopmentR&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.R&D expenses for 2018 were 17% higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in employee compensation, volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers, and depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending. R&D expenses for 2017 were 13% higher than 2016 primarily due to higher volumes of development and pre-qualification wafers and increases in employee compensation, partially offset by lower engineering and other professional services costs.We share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel. We continue to jointly develop NAND technologies with Intel through the third generation of 3D NAND, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. In the second quarter of 2018, we and Intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3D NAND in order to better optimize the technology and products for our respective business needs. We continue to jointly develop 3D XPoint technologies with Intel through the second generation of 3D XPoint technology, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. To better optimize 3D XPoint technology for our product roadmap and maximize the benefits for our customers and shareholders, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that we will no longer jointly develop with Intel  31subsequent generations of 3D XPoint technology. As a result of the above actions, we expect reimbursements under our cost-sharing agreements to decrease in early fiscal 2019. Our R&D expenses were reduced by reimbursements under these development partner arrangements by $201 million, $213 million, and $205 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.Income TaxesOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") which lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and significantly affects how income from foreign operations is taxed in the United States. Our U.S. statutory federal rate was 25.7% for 2018 (based on the 35% corporate rate through December 31, 2017 and 21% from that date through the end of fiscal year 2018) and will be 21% beginning in 2019. The Tax Act imposed a one-time transition tax in 2018 on accumulated foreign income (the "Repatriation Tax"); provided a U.S. federal tax exemption on foreign earnings distributed to the United States after January 1, 2018; and beginning in 2019, created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets (the "Foreign Minimum Tax"). The Tax Act allows us to elect to pay any Repatriation Tax due in eight annual, interest-free payments in increasing amounts beginning in December 2018. In connection with the provisions of the Tax Act, we made an accounting policy election to treat the Foreign Minimum Tax provision as a period cost in the period the tax is incurred.SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") allows the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if our analyses of the impacts of the Tax Act have not been completed when our financial statements are issued. The provisional amounts below for 2018 represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which our analysis is not yet complete. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing, and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations, and obtaining additional guidance from the IRS, U.S. Treasury Department, FASB, or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, we may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. At August 30, 2018, there were no provisions for which we were unable to record a reasonable estimate of the impact.Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:For the year ended 2018 2017 2016Provisional estimate for the Repatriation Tax, net of adjustments related to uncertain tax positions $(1,030) $— $—Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflecting lower U.S. corporate tax rates (133) — —Provisional estimate for the release of the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations 1,337 — —Utilization of and other changes in net deferred tax assets of MMJ, MMT, and MTTW (68) 54 (114)U.S. valuation allowance release resulting from business acquisition — — 41Other income tax (provision) benefit (274) (168) 54  $(168) $(114) $(19)       Effective tax rate 1.2% 2.2% (6.8)%Our income taxes reflect various impacts of the Tax Act, including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower U.S. corporate rate of 25.7% for 2018 and 21% for subsequent years and provisional estimates for the Repatriation Tax and the release of a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our U.S. operations. Our income tax rates also include operations outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates. Beginning in 2019, our effective tax rate may increase to the low teens percentage depending on the amount and geographic mix of taxable income. Income taxes for 2018, 2017, and 2016 included tax benefits of $1 million, $28 million, and $58 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions.During 2018, we reassessed our capital structure, including our Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning in 2019, the future cash needs of our global operations, and the effects of the Tax Act. As a result of this reassessment, we deemed a portion of our foreign earnings to be no longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Repatriation Tax, substantially all of our accumulated foreign earnings prior to December 31, 2017  32were subject to U.S. federal taxation. Although these earnings have been subject to U.S. federal income tax under the Repatriation Tax, the repatriation to the United States of all or a portion of these earnings would potentially be subject to foreign withholding and state income tax. As of August 30, 2018, we had a deferred tax liability of $82 million associated with our undistributed earnings.We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions outside the Unites States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2031, that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. The effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.96 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $1.59) for 2018, by $742 million ($0.64 per diluted share) for 2017, and were not material in 2016.(See "
