Risk Factors.”  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   The functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the U.S. dollar.  We held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of U.S. $504 million as of September 2, 2010 and U.S. $229 million as of September 3, 2009.  We also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of U.S. $901 million as of September 2, 2010, and U.S. $742 million as of September 3, 2009.  Significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were as follows (in U.S. dollar equivalents):            September 2, 2010       September 3, 2009           Singapore Dollars       Yen       Euro       Singapore Dollars       Yen       Euro           (amounts in millions)                                              Deferred tax assets    $ --     $ 115     $ 6     $ --     $ 115     $ 4     Other assets      88       55       196       25       17       40     Accounts payable and accrued expenses      (158 )     (186 )     (168 )     (68 )     (141 )     (99 )   Debt      (78 )     (9 )     (61 )     (289 )     (25 )     (4 )   Other liabilities      (14 )     (75 )     (100 )     (8 )     (55 )     (41 )   Net assets (liabilities)    $ (162 )   $ (100 )   $ (127 )   $ (340 )   $ (89 )   $ (100 )     We estimate that, based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as of September 2, 2010, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately U.S. $2 million for the Singapore dollar and U.S. $1 million for the euro and the yen.  During the first quarter of 2010, we began using derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk.  (See
