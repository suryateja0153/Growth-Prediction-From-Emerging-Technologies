This was primarily due to an increase of 15% in product revenues, partially offset by a 3% decrease in software and hardware maintenance and other services revenues.        •  Gross profit margin percentage:  Our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased by one percentage point in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting an increase in gross profit margin on product revenues, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in gross profit margin on hardware maintenance and other services revenues.        •  Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues:  Our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher product gross margin and lower operating expenses as a result of a gain on sale of certain of our properties.        •  Provision for income taxes: Our provision for income taxes increased significantly in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 as a result of significant charges recorded in connection with U.S. tax reform enacted in fiscal 2018.        •  Net income and Diluted income per share:  The 85% decrease in both net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 reflect the factors discussed above. Diluted net income per share was favorably impacted by a 2% decrease in the annual weighted average number of dilutive shares, primarily due to share repurchases.        •  Operating cash flows:  Operating cash flows increased by 50% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income.        •  Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue: Total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue increased $135 million, or 4%, as of fiscal 2018 year end compared to fiscal 2017 year end primarily due to increases in the installed base and aggregate contract values under software and hardware maintenance contracts.        •  Cash Conversion Cycle: Our cash conversion cycle was (15) days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to 15 days in the corresponding period of fiscal 2017, reflecting higher Days Payables Outstanding and lower Days Inventory Outstanding, partially offset by higher Days Sales Outstanding. Stock Repurchase Program and Dividend Activity During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 15 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $51.57 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $794 million. We also declared cash dividends of an aggregate of $0.80 per share in fiscal 2018, for which we paid an aggregate of $214 million. Senior Notes Issuance and Redemption   In September 2017, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Senior Notes due on September 27, 2019 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.30% Senior Notes due on September 29, 2024, for which we received total proceeds of approximately $795 million, net of discount and issuance costs. On November 3, 2017, we extinguished our 2.00% Senior Notes due December 2017 for an aggregate redemption price of $751 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest.    32    Real Estate Transactions   On September 8, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings for a total of $306 million, through two separate and independent closings. On December 7, 2017, the first closing date, we consummated the sale of properties with a net book value of $66 million for cash proceeds of $210 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $142 million.  In fiscal 2016, we entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement of certain of our land and buildings. The arrangement did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting and instead was accounted for as a financing transaction. In December 2017, we terminated the leases and recorded a non-cash sale of properties with a net book value of $54 million, the extinguishment of $130 million in financing obligations, and a gain of $76 million.    Tax Reform     On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Reform Reconciliation Act, originally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), was enacted into law. This tax reform legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. Our net income in fiscal 2018 includes a one-time tax reform-related provisional charge of $858 million.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. The summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. The accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition, Reserves and Allowances We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. Our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of non-essential software products, which generally includes a perpetual license to our software. Non-essential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance services revenues are recognized ratably over their contractual terms, generally from one to five years. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. For our non-software deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price (ESP). For our software maintenance services, we generally use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE). When we are unable to establish VSOE for our software maintenance services, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                   33      •  We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and generally evidenced by a substantial majority of historical stand-alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range. In addition, we consider major service type, customer type, and other variables in determining VSOE. Our revenue estimates and assumptions are based on our ability to assert and maintain VSOE. ESP is generally evidenced by a majority of historical transactions falling within a reasonable price range. We also consider multiple factors, including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, historical pricing practices, customer type and distribution channels. Our revenue estimates and assumptions are based on our ability to maintain consistent ESP.     •  As our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of service offerings and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency required to establish and/or maintain key revenue estimates and assumptions. Additionally, technological changes resulting in variability in product costs and gross margins may require changes to certain estimates and assumptions. Such changes may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple-element arrangements. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.                     •  Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends and our expectations regarding future experience. Additionally, distributors and partners participate in various marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs based on contractual terms and historical experience.     •  If there is insufficient relevant historical data for determining our sales returns estimates, or if we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in market or competitive conditions resulting in higher than expected return rates, or if actual credits received by our distributors and partners deviate significantly from our estimates, our revenues may be adversely impacted.   Inventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals Inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  We periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. Inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.     •  Although we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or obsolescence related to technological developments, new product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings that adversely impact gross margins may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. If there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.                     •  We make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.     •  If the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments which would adversely impact our operating results.   Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair  34  values based on established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. This review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations. We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. For our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount, therefore, found no impairment of goodwill. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired business.     •  While we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation.                     •  Evaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting unit and assets.     •  In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.  Assumptions and estimates about expected future cash flows and the fair values of our reporting unit and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. They can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. Our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.   Product Warranties Estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment. We assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary. 35  The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  Estimated future software and hardware warranty costs are based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, product failure rates, historical and projected materials and logistics costs, distribution and labor costs and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of our typical experience. We also evaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjust the estimates as necessary.     •  Although we engage in product quality programs and processes, if we experience unexpected quality issues resulting in higher failure rates or experience increases in costs to remediate product failures, additional warranty costs may be incurred. Additionally, for new products our warranty liability is based on limited historical experience. If our projections differ from such limited experience, our warranty costs may increase, which could adversely impact our gross margins.   Valuation of Investment Securities Our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, unless they are determined to be other-than-temporary impairments. The ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  The estimated fair value of our debt securities, and the associated accounting for unrealized losses is based on an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time and extent the security’s fair value has been below its amortized cost and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. If we determine that an investment has an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in earnings.     •  The fair value of our investments in debt securities could decrease significantly from uncertainties in the credit and capital markets, credit rating downgrades and/or solvency of the issuer, decreases in the marketability of the securities. If the fair value of our investments decreases significantly and, if because of changes in our ability and intent to continue to hold the securities or other factors, it is determined to be other-than-temporary, we may incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.   36  Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  Our income tax provision is based on existing tax law and advanced pricing agreements or letter rulings we have with various tax authorities.      •  Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by future changes in existing tax laws, such as a change in tax rate, possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.                     •  The determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.     •  Our future profits could differ from current expectations resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. We could adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.                     •  The estimates for our uncertain tax positions are based primarily on company specific circumstances, applicable tax laws, tax opinions from outside firms and past results from examinations of our income tax returns.     •  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.   New Accounting Standards See Note 2 – Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial statements.     37  Results of Operations Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal year 2018, which ended on April 27, 2018, and fiscal year 2017, which ended on April 28, 2017, were each 52-week years. Fiscal year 2016, which ended on April 29, 2016, was a 53-week year. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Net revenues for fiscal 2017 were $5,519 million, a decrease of $27 million, relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016, reflecting lower hardware maintenance and other services revenues, partially offset by higher product revenues and software maintenance revenues. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased one percentage point compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting higher margins on product revenues and slightly higher margins on hardware maintenance and o
