Financial Results and Key Performance Metrics Overview The following table provides an overview of some of our key financial metrics for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions, except per share amounts, percentages and days sales outstanding):             Year Ended             April 24, 2015        April 25, 2014        April 26, 2013       Net revenues     $  6,122.7        $  6,325.1        $  6,332.4       Gross profit     $  3,833.2        $  3,919.1        $  3,761.1       Gross profit margin percentage        63  %        62  %        59  %    Income from operations     $  716.5        $  734.3        $  607.8       Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues        12  %        12  %        10  %    Net income     $  559.9        $  637.5        $  505.3       Diluted net income per share     $  1.75        $  1.83        $  1.37       Operating cash flows     $  1,268.1        $  1,349.6        $  1,386.3                  April 24, 2015        April 25, 2014       Deferred revenue     $  3,197.2        $  3,100.2       Days sales outstanding (DSO)        46           47            ·  Net revenues:  Our net revenues declined 3% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This was primarily due to a decrease of 7% in product revenues, which included the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes during the second half of fiscal 2015, partially offset by a 7% increase in hardware maintenance and other services revenues generated from a higher installed base of our hardware products under maintenance contracts.     ·  Gross profit margin percentage:  Our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher gross margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues.  30      ·  Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues:  Our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues was relatively flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to cost control measures executed during the year.     ·  Net income and Diluted income per share:  The 12% and 4% decrease in net income and diluted net income per share, respectively, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflects lower operating income in dollars, as well as an increase of 7.6 percentage points in our effective tax rate. In addition to these factors, diluted net income per share was favorably impacted by an 8% decrease in the number of dilutive shares, primarily due to the favorable impact of share repurchases.     ·  Operating cash flows:  Operating cash flows decreased 6% in fiscal 2015, reflecting a decrease in net income, as well as unfavorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities.     ·  Deferred revenue:  Total deferred revenue increased $97.0 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due an increase in deferred software and hardware maintenance contract sales and renewals.     ·  DSO:  Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) were 46 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 reflecting seasonal shipment linearity. Stock Repurchase Program and Dividend Activity During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 29.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $39.30 per share, for an aggregate of $1.2 billion. We also declared cash dividends of an aggregate of $0.66 per share in fiscal 2015, for which we paid an aggregate of $207.4 million.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. The summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. The accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition, Reserves and Allowances We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of hardware systems and software components essential to the functionality of the hardware systems is recognized in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. Our product revenues also include revenues from the sale of non-essential software products, which generally includes a perpetual license to our software. Non-essential software sales are subject to industry specific software revenue recognition accounting guidance. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance services revenues are recognized ratably over their contractual terms, generally from one to five years. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables and the non-software deliverables as a group based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement. For our non-software deliverables, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables using estimated selling price (ESP). For our software maintenance services, we generally use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE). When we are unable to establish VSOE for our software maintenance services, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: VSOE if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts. 31  The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for recognizing revenue:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and generally evidenced by a substantial majority of historical stand-alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range. In addition, we consider major service type, customer type, and other variables in determining VSOE. Our revenue estimates and assumptions are based on our ability to assert and maintain VSOE. ESP is generally evidenced by a majority of historical transactions falling within a reasonable price range. We also consider multiple factors, including, but not limited to, cost of products, gross margin objectives, historical pricing practices, customer type and distribution channels. Our revenue estimates and assumptions are based on our ability to maintain consistent ESP.     ·  As our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of service offerings and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency required to establish and/or maintain VSOE or to maintain consistent ESP. Additionally, technological changes resulting in variability in product costs and gross margins may require changes to our ESP model. Changes in ESP may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple-element arrangements. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.                     ·  Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends and our expectations regarding future experience. Additionally, distributors and partners participate in various marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs based on contractual terms and historical experience.     ·  If there is insufficient relevant historical data for determining our sales returns estimates, or if we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in market or competitive conditions resulting in higher than expected return rates, or if actual credits received by our distributors and partners deviate significantly from our estimates, our revenues may be adversely impacted.   Inventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals Inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  We periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. Inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.     ·  Although we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or obsolescence related to technological developments, new product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings that adversely impact gross margins may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. If there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.                     ·  We make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.     ·  If the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments which would adversely impact our operating results.   32  Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. This review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations. We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. For our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed a quantitative test at the reporting unit level and determined the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit and, therefore, found no impairment of goodwill. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired business.     ·  While we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation.                     ·  Evaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting units and assets.     ·  In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.  Assumptions and estimates about expected future cash flows and the fair values of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. They can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. Our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.   Product Warranties Estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment. We assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary. 33  The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  Estimated future software and hardware warranty costs are based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, product failure rates, historical and projected materials and logistics costs, distribution and labor costs and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of our typical experience. We also evaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjust the estimates as necessary.     ·  Although we engage in product quality programs and processes, if we experience unexpected quality issues resulting in higher failure rates or experience increases in costs to remediate product failures, additional warranty costs may be incurred. Additionally, for new products our warranty liability is based on limited historical experience. If our projections differ from such limited experience, our warranty costs may increase, which could adversely impact our gross margins.     Stock-Based Compensation We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our stock-based compensation:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  The fair values of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of such awards include the expected term of the awards, risk free interest rates, future dividend rates and the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards.     ·  To the extent that market conditions or company specific events lead to higher stock price volatility or employee stock option exercise behavior differs from expectations, the estimated fair value and stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly in future periods, which could impact our operating results.                     ·  Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to meet service vesting conditions and is impacted by the estimated forfeiture rate.     ·  If we experience employee turnover different from our historical rates, our stock-based compensation expense in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period.   Valuation of Investment Securities Our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, unless they are determined to be other-than-temporary impairments. The ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  The estimated fair value of our debt securities, and the associated accounting for unrealized losses is based on an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time and extent a security’s fair value has been below its amortized cost and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. If we determine that an investment has an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in earnings.     ·  The fair value of our investments in debt securities could decrease significantly from uncertainties in the credit and capital markets, credit rating downgrades and/or solvency of the issuer, decreases in the marketability of the securities or changes in our ability and intent to continue to hold the securities. If the fair value of our investments decreases significantly and is determined to be other-than-temporary, we may incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.   34  Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     ·  Our income tax provision is based on existing tax law and advanced pricing agreements or letter rulings we have with various tax authorities.      ·  Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by future changes in existing tax laws, such as a change in tax rate, possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.                     ·  Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and there is no plan in the foreseeable future to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon.     ·  We consider the following matters, among others, in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment: the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term; the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest; and any U.S. and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances. If factors change, future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.                     ·  The determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.     ·  Our future profits could differ from current expectations resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. We could adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.                     ·  The estimates for our uncertain tax positions are based primarily on company specific circumstances, applicable tax laws, tax opinions from outside firms and past results from examinations of our income tax returns.     ·  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.   New Accounting Standards See Note 3 – Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial statements.     35  Results of Operations Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. Our fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on April 24, 2015, April 25, 2014 and April 26, 2013, respectively, and were each 52-week years. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal year 2016 will span 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Net revenues for fiscal 2014 were $6,325.1 million, down $7.3 million, or less than 1%, compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting a decrease in product revenues, mostly offset by increases in software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, reflecting higher gross margins on hardware maintenance contract and other services revenues. Gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2015 were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower average selling price (ASP) for configured systems being offset by lower unit materials cost due to changes in product mix. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 3% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to lower unit materials costs due to supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by lower ASPs for total configured systems. Additionally, gross profit was favorably impacted in fiscal 2014 by lower OEM revenues and higher margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 totaled $3,116.7 million, up 2% as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to a slight decrease in costs on a lower revenue denominator. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 totaled $3,096.5 million, down 1% as a percentage of net revenues compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting cost control programs implemented in fiscal 2014, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation due to higher achievement against plan. 36  Net Revenues (in millions, except percentages):             Fiscal Year             2015        2014        % Change        2013        % Change       Net revenues     $  6,122.7        $  6,325.1           (3  )%     $  6,332.4           —  %     The decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a reduction of $289.3 million in product revenues, partially offset by $103.1 million increase in hardware maintenance and other services revenues. Product revenues comprised 60% of net revenues for fiscal 2015, compared to 62% of net revenues for fiscal 2014. The slight decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2014 was due to a decrease of $148.4 million in product revenues, offset by an aggregate increase in software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $141.1 million. Product revenues comprised 62% of net revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 65% of net revenues for fiscal 2013. Sales through our indirect channels represented 80%, 82% and 81% of net revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in indirect channel sales were $472.8 million, $584.7 million and $787.2 million of OEM revenues for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The following customers, each of which is a distributor, accounted for 10% or more of net
