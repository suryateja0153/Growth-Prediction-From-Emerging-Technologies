This was primarily due to an increase of 7% in product revenues, partially offset by a 3% decrease in software and hardware maintenance and other services revenues.        •  Gross profit margin percentage: Our gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased by one percentage point in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting an increase in gross profit margin on product revenues, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in gross profit margin on hardware maintenance and other services revenues.        •  Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues: Our income from operations as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively flat in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018.        •  Provision for income taxes: Our provision for income taxes decreased significantly in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as significant charges were recorded in fiscal 2018 in connection with U.S. tax reform.        •  Net income and Diluted income per share: The increase in both net income and diluted net income per share in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 reflect the factors discussed above. Diluted net income per share was favorably impacted by a 6% decrease in the annual weighted average number of dilutive shares, primarily due to share repurchases.        •  Operating cash flows: Operating cash flows decreased by 9% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income.        •  Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue: Total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue increased $305 million, or 9%, as of fiscal 2019 year end compared to fiscal 2018 year end primarily due to increases in the installed base and aggregate contract values under software and hardware maintenance contracts.        •  Cash Conversion Cycle: Our cash conversion cycle was 3 days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to (14) days in the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, reflecting lower Days Payables Outstanding, higher Days Inventory Outstanding, and higher Days Sales Outstanding. Stock Repurchase Program and Dividend Activity During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 29 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $72.87 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $2.1 billion. We also declared cash dividends of an aggregate of $1.60 per share in fiscal 2019, for which we paid an aggregate of $403 million. Adoption of Revenue Accounting Standard   As of the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new accounting standard Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the full retrospective method of adoption. Accordingly, our prior years consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, as presented herein, have been restated to conform to the new rules. As illustrated in Note 7 – Revenue of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the overall impact of adoption was not significant to prior years. However, application of the new rules to our ELAs resulted in over $100 million of product revenues for such arrangements in fiscal 2019, that are incremental to the amounts we would have recognized under the old standard. Under ASC 606, we recognize the software license fee component of our ELAs up-front, whereas under the prior rules the software license fee was recognized over the term of the ELA.  31  Restructuring Events   During fiscal 2019, we announced two separate restructuring and reduction in workforce plans designed to reduce costs and redirect resources to our highest return activities. In connection with these plans, we reduced our worldwide headcount by less than 3%, and incurred aggregate charges of approximately $35 million, consisting primarily of employee severance costs.  Joint Venture   During fiscal 2019, we formed a joint venture with Lenovo (Beijing) Information Technology Ltd. (“Lenovo”) in China and, in February 2019, contributed assets to the newly formed entity, Lenovo NetApp Technology Limited (“LNTL”), which began operations the same month, in exchange for a non-controlling 49% equity interest. The assets we contributed had an aggregate book value of $7 million, while the fair value of our equity interest in LNTL was determined to be $80 million, resulting in a gain of $73 million. LNTL will be integral to our sales channels strategy in China, acting as a distributor of our offerings to customers headquartered there, and involved in certain OEM sales to Lenovo. It will also endeavor to localize our products and services, and to develop new joint offerings for the China market by leveraging NetApp and Lenovo technologies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), which require management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. The summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. The accounting policies described below reflect the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include the transfer of multiple products and services to the customer. In determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition, we assess which products and services are distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price, which may include fixed and/or variable amounts, among each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties included in this approach:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  We evaluate whether products and services promised in our contracts with customers are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.      •  In certain contracts, the determination of our distinct performance obligations requires significant judgment. As our business and offerings to customers change over time, the products and services we determine to be distinct performance obligations may change. Such changes may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.                     •  In determining the transaction price of our contracts, we estimate variable consideration based on the expected value, primarily relying on our history. In certain situations, we may also use the most likely amount as the basis of our estimate.     •  We may have insufficient relevant historical data or other information to arrive at an accurate estimate of variable consideration using either the “expected value” or “most likely amount” method. Additionally, changes in business practices, such as those related to sales returns or marketing programs, may introduce new forms of variable consideration, as well as more complexity and uncertainty in the estimation process.                   32      •  In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we establish SSPs based on the price at which products and services are sold separately. If SSPs are not observable through  past transactions, we estimate them using available information including, but not limited to, market data and other observable inputs.     •  As our business and offerings evolve over time, modifications to our pricing and discounting methodologies, changes in the scope and nature of product and service offerings and/or changes in customer segmentation may result in a lack of consistency, making it difficult to establish and/or maintain SSPs. Changes in SSPs could result in different and unanticipated allocations of revenue in contracts with multiple performance obligations. These factors, among others, may adversely impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we report in a particular period.     Inventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals Inventories consist primarily of purchased components and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. A provision is recorded when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete in order to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our inventories:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  We periodically perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory. Inventories are written down based on excess and obsolete reserves determined primarily on assumptions about future demand forecasts and market conditions. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.     •  Although we use our best estimates to forecast future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or obsolescence related to technological developments, new product introductions, customer requirements, competition or other factors could have a significant impact on the valuation of our inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings that adversely impact gross margins may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the manufacture of our products. If there are changes to the current regulations, we may be required to make product design changes which may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could adversely impact our operating results.                     •  We make commitments to our third-party contract manufacturers and other suppliers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments when we believe it is probable that the components will not be utilized in future operations.     •  If the actual materials demand is significantly lower than our forecast, we may be required to increase our recorded liabilities for estimated losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments which would adversely impact our operating results.   Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values based on established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents the residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases is measured as the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The carrying values of purchased intangible assets are reviewed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. This review may result in impairment charges or shortened useful lives, resulting in charges to our consolidated statements of operations. We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our reporting unit may exceed its fair value. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill allow us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. For our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we performed a quantitative test and determined the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount, therefore, found no impairment of goodwill. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for estimating the value of our goodwill and  33  purchased intangible assets:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. The valuation of purchased intangible assets is principally based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets from the acquired business.     •  While we employ experts to determine the acquisition date fair value of acquired intangibles, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on significant management assumptions and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and highly subjective and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If different assumptions were to be used, it could materially impact the purchase price allocation.                     •  Evaluations of possible goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment require us to make judgments and assumptions related to the allocation of our balance sheet and income statement amounts and estimate future cash flows and fair market values of our reporting unit and assets.     •  In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or purchased intangible assets.  Assumptions and estimates about expected future cash flows and the fair values of our reporting unit and purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as the adverse impact of unanticipated changes in macroeconomic conditions and technological changes or new product introductions from competitors. They can also be affected by internal factors such as changes in business strategy or in forecasted product life cycles and roadmaps. Our ongoing consideration of these and other factors could result in future impairment charges or accelerated amortization expense, which could adversely affect our operating results.   Product Warranties Estimated future hardware and software warranty costs are recorded as a cost of product revenues at the time of product shipment. We assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and adjust the amount as considered necessary. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for product warranties:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  Estimated future software and hardware warranty costs are based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, product failure rates, historical and projected materials and logistics costs, distribution and labor costs and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of our typical experience. We also evaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of our warranty liability considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjust the estimates as necessary.     •  Although we engage in product quality programs and processes, if we experience unexpected quality issues resulting in higher failure rates or experience increases in costs to remediate product failures, additional warranty costs may be incurred. Additionally, for new products our warranty liability is based on limited historical experience. If our projections differ from such limited experience, our warranty costs may increase, which could adversely impact our gross margins.   Valuation of Investment Securities Our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value and are subject to periodic impairment review. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, unless they are determined to be other-than-temporary impairments. The ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for the valuation of our investment securities:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties  34                       •  The estimated fair value of our debt securities, and the associated accounting for unrealized losses is based on an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security’s issuer, the length of time and extent the security’s fair value has been below its amortized cost and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. If we determine that an investment has an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, we recognize the investment loss in earnings.     •  The fair value of our investments in debt securities could decrease significantly from uncertainties in the credit and capital markets, credit rating downgrades and/or solvency of the issuer, decreases in the marketability of the securities. If the fair value of our investments decreases significantly and, if because of changes in our ability and intent to continue to hold the securities or other factors, it is determined to be other-than-temporary, we may incur impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.   Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The following are the key estimates and assumptions and corresponding uncertainties for our income taxes:          Key Estimates and Assumptions        Key Uncertainties                     •  Our income tax provision is based on existing tax law and advanced pricing agreements or letter rulings we have with various tax authorities.      •  Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by future changes in existing tax laws, such as a change in tax rate, possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and uncertainties as to future renewals of favorable tax agreements and rulings.                     •  The determination of whether we should record or adjust a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding our future profitability.     •  Our future profits could differ from current expectations resulting in a change to our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. We could adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the tax provision in the period in which such determination is made.                     •  The estimates for our uncertain tax positions are based primarily on company specific circumstances, applicable tax laws, tax opinions from outside firms and past results from examinations of our income tax returns.     •  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome or tax court rulings of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals.   New Accounting Standards See Note 2 – Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial statements.     35  Results of Operations Our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal months with calendar months. Fiscal year 2019, which ended on April 26, 2019, fiscal year 2018, which ended on April 27, 2018, and fiscal year 2017, which ended on April 28, 2017, were each 52-week years.

Net revenues for fiscal 2018 were $5,919 million, an increase of $428 million, or 8% compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting higher product revenues, partially offset by slightly lower hardware maintenance and other services revenues. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased by one and a half percentage points compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting higher margins on product revenues and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. Gross profit margins on product revenues in fiscal 2019 increased two and a half percentage points compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher average selling prices (ASPs) and revenue recognized during fiscal 2019 related to the software license components of several ELAs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased by one and a half percentage points compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting higher margins on product revenues, and slightly higher margins on hardware maintenance and other services revenues. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 totaled $2,762 million, or 45% of net revenues, representing a decrease of two percentage points compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year. Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 totaled $2,769 million, or 47% of net revenues, representing a decrease of two and a half percentage points compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net revenues in fiscal 2018, coupled with relatively consistent average headcount in both fiscal years. 36  Net Revenues (in millions, except percentages):                Fiscal Year                2019        2018        % Change        2017        % Change       Net revenues        $  6,146        $  5,919           4  %     $  5,491           8  %     The increase in net revenues for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $230 million in product revenues. Product revenues as a percent of net revenues increased one and a half percentage points in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in net revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $465 million in product revenue
