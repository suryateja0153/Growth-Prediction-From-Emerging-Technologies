 AE Config is an advanced component which allows user to change values of Alarms and Events for the desired variable in Client mode. From the "Indas" component menu, choose "AE Config", add a component to the screen and set the position and size. When a component is selected "AE Config Panel" is shown on the right side of the screen. Check "Is Alarm and Event" or "Is Log" or both checkboxes in Editor to show panel with additional options in the "Client page". Click the "Save" button and go to the "Client page". THE "AE Config" component is shown on the screen. Click on the variable and an additional panel will appear on the right side of the screen. Pagination is below the table with variables. Variables in the table can be filtered by Alarms, Events, and Logs. Also, the user can filter variables with search property and search fields. Select the variable to add new or configure the already entered values. We will insert values for "Variable2", click on checkbox "Event" and type the desired values in fields. The same procedure is for the "Alarm" column. For "Loggable" variables, the user can set "Log interval" time. This time is the period between two logs of a variable. Click the "Save" button to save changes. If we filter the variables now, we will see that "Variable2" will appear in each filtration (Alarm, Event, Log).
