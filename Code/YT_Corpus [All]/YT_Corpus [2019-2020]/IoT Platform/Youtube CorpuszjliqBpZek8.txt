 Using the "Connection Types" tab of the Configurator, user can create suffix variables for chosen Connection Type. To add new Connection Type click on "Add" button below the drop-down box. Popup "Add connection type" will appear on the screen, select the desired connection from "Drive" drop-down box and type Connection name (TestMQTT). Select the created connection and click the "Add" button to insert Sufix variables. Popup "Add suffix variable" is shown, type the desired values for Sufix variables and click "Save" button. We will create three sufix variables which will be added to prefix (in our case, prefix is connection TestMQTT). By click on the sufix variable on the right side of the screen will appear sufix variable property pane. Click on the "Connections" tab and add MQTT connection if it is not created, we have previously created "TestMQTT" connection. Go to "Variables" tab, from "Connection" drop-down box select your connection, in our case that is "TestMQTT". Click on "Add from Connection Type" button, previously created Connection type "TestMQTT" is available, select it and click the "Save" button. Suffix variables are added to the prefix value (in our case prefix is connection TestMQTT).
