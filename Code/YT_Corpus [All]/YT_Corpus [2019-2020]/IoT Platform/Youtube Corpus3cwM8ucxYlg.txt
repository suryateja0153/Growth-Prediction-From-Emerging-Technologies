 hello everybody welcome to pcbway channel  this is lesley this is louisa and today's topic is IoT  the internet of things iot is now making our  house lives more productive ergonomic and   allowing us to manage our time more efficiently  our house are now being turned into smart homes   creating more savings for our energy water  and gas by monitoring our usage and habits   and i've heard that the number of connected  devices is set to increase from 700 million   to 3.2 billion by 2023 in this trend our pcbwayers can make full use of their knowledge   and make more creative projects i  totally agree let's go check them lastly when we talk about iot it could be  necessary to mention esp32 rui santos shows   the way to build an iot shield pcb for esp32 and a  web server dashboard to control it the shield is   equipped with a bme280 sensor an ldr a pir motion  sensor a status led a push button and a terminal   socket to connect the relay module or any other  output wow great yes lesley veerusubbuami"s low-cost iot based ecg & heart monitoring system  with esp32 and ubidots platform is so interesting   these projects only cost less than 15 dollars  but make it easy to monitor a particular   person's heart wow medical using iot project  amazing lesley if you have a smart house which   function would be the most important for you  if my smart house can be more intimate enough   i know the safety must be the most important well  mert built a simple diy pir motion home security   notification system if it detects any motion it  will send a notification to your mobile phone and his voice talking notification  warning system can directly warn a person   a stranger who are going to break out  your house and if we input other kind of   for example into this project it can be a social  business reminder a welcome bell for stores etc    wow louisa i think that the  Debashis's joint alexa boombox is a necessary product   for a smart house alexa voice service integration  is a new feature of aws iot core that enables   device makers to make any connected device and  alex built-in device with a reduction in the   engineering bill of materials cost device makers  can now cost effectively due to new categories   of differentiated voice enabled products such  as light switches thermal states small appliance   and more this allows end-consumers to talk  directly to alexa in a new part of their home   office or hotel rooms for a truly ambient  experiences a standard amazon alexa is a very   popular smart speaker its sound quality is pretty  good but not enough to shake our whole house   so in this video dabashis made his own  alexa enabled smart speaker which is not   only 6 time powerful but also costs only one third of  the original amazon echo great products lesley some  smart appliances like debashis' s alexa boombox   can be easily controlled by smart switch for  energy saving bluino electronics made a blynk switch iot 4ch based on only smartphone android with  link app and esp8266 builder app which can be   easily found on google play store by clicking the  option on the phone we can control lights fast etc   remotely he also uploaded a comprehensive tutorial  helping people make their own cheap diy sonoff 4ch smart switch from hardware to 3d printing to  the final assembly he elaborates the whole process   step by step then is our gardening anak made a  smart gardening system using the system it becomes   possible to monitor soil moisture temperature  and air humidity just by chatting on telegram   besides we can also control the flame of the  water pump to water the plants and control the   light of the plants when we go to the garden at  night lesley now due to our busy life and lots of   things to be done the garden has been forgotten  or always at the second place in our to-do list   but with the help of iot the garden can be well  taken care of yes and you know francesco' s d-diot multi-purpose iot pcb can also test the soil  moisture this small pcb is going to be a   general purpose solution for building any kind of  compact wireless battery power sensor or actuator   so it can also be used as a door window sensor  louisa this project is definitely worth a   try in science class genius that could be fun yeah  then hookups auto garage door store can also be a great   choice for beginners to have a try lesley i've only seen our friend made smart  house on his youtube channel the whole house works  through the owner's instruction on the mobile  phone app or the voice assistance so the way i   control my smart home from my iphone 10s max is a  mixture of three different things i can either use   the whole map which uses homekit siri which also  uses homekit or openhab which connects directly to   the openapp server this can also be done through  home assistant and i'll have guides on it in the   future but for the sake of this video we're going  to be focusing on openhab speaking of guys in the   future we're also going to be focusing on the  cameras so oh check it out my cousin just pulled   up in this car let's go ahead and open the garage  door for we're going to open up the home kit app   here and then we're just going to set the garage  door to open and if you look outside the window   the garage door is opening and for digitblurs  diy smart house series is still on run he has   already made seven videos to show the process  step by step i'll say that under my impression   this series could be a constructive and perfect  enough presentation produced for educational using   louisa why economic condition permits will you  pursue the influence of the quality of life   yes sure definitely the quality of life can bring  great positive effects to us yes i agree with you   different small gadgets can play a big role  in different aspects of our daily life for   example fahad's iot based water quality monitoring  system works really well and can help us monitor   the quality of table water water's electrical  conductivity depends on the concentration of ions   salinity and total dissolved soils  are used to calculate the ec of water   which helps to indicate the water purity the  principle of this project is like that the pure   the water is the lower the conductivity is louisa  as the entry of the covid-19 detect and protect   challenge the project theia wins the grand prix  and i want to introduce project and the team karakoram to our lovely viewers sure project theia is an  easily replicable low connectivity iot platform   that allows developing countries to monitor  combinating viral blooms at a national level   they believe that theia is one of the most effective  solutions to provide a developing country with   limited healthcare services under their own  reliable telecommunication network to triage   their covid-19 outbreaks to send doctors  and nurses where they are most needed that's   what we prepared for you
