 [Music] so thanks for being here welcome to that session on how to accelerate your digital transformation through IOT data analytics and AI my name is Anthony Pye smart I lead the product management team for cloud IOT at Google I'm really happy to be here today I have a few customers who join me on stage during the session I have also a great partner he touch he is going to come on stage and talk about their experience let's go and get started if you're here today it's probably because IOT you know that IOT already is producing value it may already be or you know it can produce value for your business either it's part of a small implementation that you're doing some some use case or it's part of a broader digital transformation initiative inside your company you know IOT is producing value and that you want to learn more about that we've seen that across different industries for example in agriculture how to reduce how to reduce water usage increases yield in oil and gas it's more about predictive maintenance and you know increasing security of workers and those in those oil platforms we see it in logistics where I said tracking we'll talk a little bit about an example there I mean it's really across every industry those are just three industries that I want to point out but it's really across all those industry that we're seeing IOT having an impact today and that impact is pretty undeniable the driver behind those use cases are oftentimes seen through three mega trends those mega trends or smart factories that's a that's a very important one happening right now the rapid urbanization and the digitization of workflows in smart factories you may hear you know manufacturing 4.0 may hear IOT however you call it the factory the manufacturing process is really changing right now it's adding a lot more real-time insights a lot more just-in-time provisioning of the assets of the raw material of the parts just-in-time deliveries you have now robots inside the factories either moving around or stationary doing their work all this is driven by machine learning and AI the addition of machinery Nyonya in factories a rate transform how things are built today and that's a big transformation and a big shift that's driving almost everything in the in the value chain in urbanization there's a pretty staggering statistics by the UN that in 2050 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized means that shift from the rural areas to the urban areas is pretty massive and happening at a rapid pace pace so cities have to get data from sensors either traffic light no traffic buses transportation waste management energy consumption for the city all of those have to be equipped with IOT so the cities can plan better for that growth and can serve their their residents better and increase security also it is a big challenge for those repu organizations that's a big big trend that's happening the last one is almost across every industry it's about the digitization of workflow it's replacing things that were done manually or no really were really difficult or discrete to happen through an automation workflow using machine learning using using AI to really accelerate that so it's about decreasing production cost it's about faster turnaround time it's about increasing efficiency that digitization of workflow can can look like replacing clicks from a call center agent by by a script that just goes through that whole process gets data in a say P and brings him in a case could be that simple but it's it's really happening everywhere and that's really accelerating everything that's happening today the real-time nature of the digitalization of workflow is really important there real-time is something I'll come back a lot during the session because we're seeing that with real-time data you can really realize and maximize the value a few more from you our IT implementation this is a statistics from IDC by 2025 which is not too far from now but a quarter of all data generated in the data sphere will be real-time in nature and what's even more staggering is that ninety-five percent of that quarter of data is driven by IOT so is real-time that's really what's driving all the real-time data in their world so it's a pretty impressive statistics the real-time is an important concept and it's a it's not a surprise to see that you know after a few years I've been that space for quite some time now and I've seen I've seen kind of the hype and the disillusion curve a little bit and it's coming back but it's it's not a surprise to see that that's a study from IOT and I take that 50% of the companies in the next two years are going to start to see value from IOT and that's from truth from 12% into 2018 that's different from the stats you've seen before which were around how people will do an IOT project or will start an IOT project we've seen a lot of those stats this is about generating value from our IT projects that's a shift that's really going from a PLC to production and that's really starting to get the reality of what I would say should be doing which is producing value we see that real-time insights on a real-time value in different different areas obviously reducing cars driving efficiency we've talked about that when in logistics for example we had a customer who's transporting biopsies from healthcare from from a hospital to a lab having visibility of that biopsy having the visibility the temperature of that biopsy throughout the whole the whole know rather than that that sample is takings extremely important if the bio it see as about temperature goes bad during the transport it's useless and it may be a little bit of a problem for the patient obviously so that's that real-time nature of data is really important you can't have that the next day you can't see the next day that other that track was not good in in in manufacturing all in gas we've seen use cases where they won't attract no workers and see if they have their hat on if they have if they're supposed to be in certain areas in the in the plant that's super important for security and safety reason in particular same thing if you don't have the information right there right now that's pretty useless to have that in the next day if there's an accidents too late it's a real-time nature of IOT is really what's driving and we'd argue that it's the time is now it's happening now as you've seen the the stats on the 50% of company will see value we're really seeing it but it's actually pretty complex there still a lot of hurdles to go through you may be sitting there saying okay that's great real-time is great okay all that I get it but how am I doing that how am I going to apply that to my business am i doing the right projects am I thinking broad enough am i maximizing value it's all great to think about all those use case those business cases but you often time overlook the complexity of the infrastructure there's no real standard in IOT it's not it's not great it's pretty it's a pretty fragmented market managing and infrastructure scaling it's curing it all of that is very complex and sometimes it causes delays causes issues it you know even cancels launch we've seen some of those so choosing the provider for your platform for the IOT deployment is really important and keep that complexity in mind try to limit the complexity so you can focus on the right on the right value for you we see IOT as a big data challenge that's really across the board and you know if you want to do machine learning nai you need a lot of data actually the the joke in the data scientist world is how much data do you need to train a model a billion that's always a billion you need a billion stuff to train a model that's there that's what they want so a lot of data to train models and to be able to get access to those real-time insights that are actually accurate know if you want safety if you want security on your devices and you have a large fleet being able to you need to be able to scan that fleet in real time at very high scale so again it's a big data challenge as soon as you start having volume becomes a big data challenge and choosing the right platform to do that and to serve that need is really really important and that's what's gonna make your your deployment or your implementation competitive or not so last year we announced a product called clarity core that was the the main component main ingestion brick of our cloud IOT platform that was in in March I believe of every cloud IOT core is a fully managed service we'll scale automatically up and down and enables you to connect millions of devices securely to the cloud and then from there the data will flow in the rest of the platform and I'll talk a little bit about the different components of that platform a little bit later but the idea is that quality core is your entry point is your device management and beside that is all the data analytics transformation and insights one of our customer called derive system implemented implemented IOT core and clarity platform for their deployment so the right system is a pretty interesting they're in the 18 billion dollar fleet technology business they they actually equip about 2 million vehicles today and put a little ODB dude or db2 dongle into the car to match the engine data and the driver data into a single in single view their goal is to really redefine how the cars are configured and operate in the field it's mostly for fleet the thing that they noticed is the OEM I figure the car manufacturers she millions of car every year with the same software it's the same software for everyone and makes no sense nobody drives the same way nobody drives in the same place different temperature different way of driving different frequency to bring lengths why all the cars are configuring exactly the same it's definitely not optimal and drive system comes with a solution to change that upgrade the car and control them better to fit them to the new to the mission that they have the the output of that is higher safety we'll see an example better sustainability with less emission and the lower cost of you sleep so the way they done is they have that little db2 dongle they plug it in that connects to IOT core and they use no that's just two of the major tool they use bigquery I don't know if you've seen a lot of the announcements for bigquery during the sessions pretty pretty incredible and then cloud machine learning for for deriving insights in real time so they really use that and then they present all that information through a portal through a mobile app who dashboards to the fleet managers the results was pretty staggering so let's look at an example that they did is they wanted to limit the dangerous driving for a major fleet provider so they took two two groups a control group and a another group of pretty bad driver that we're doing speed violation quite often and they plugged that little thing and they'd started tracking what they were doing and as soon as they turned it on and started alerting the drivers about speed limitation speed violation turned out they did zero speed violations that was actually a pretty good result they didn't need to do any training they didn't need to do any coaching and you know it was it was just hey let's plug that in and it's right away that dad I mean that's pretty impressive first it's less accident that's pretty good the safe slice is good they drive safer so they consume less oil for their in gas for their car actually the gas gained here was between eight and twelve percent per year which is pretty interesting and the return investment just on the cost saving justifies the the drive system implementation right away so it's it's actually pretty impressive so I was very concrete output they were really like with that use case so the drive example is pretty cool shows how it could scales to million vehicles it's real-time and let's look a little bit about the the platform itself and kind of the flow of data so as I said IOT core itself is server less and highly scalable but the rest of the cloud IOT platform is also server less it's fully managed you never have to configure the scaling policies the load balancing the region's sometimes even it's also included what you have to focus on and what kind of data do you want and what kind of analytics do you want to do and how are you going to present that so really focusing on your differentiation and your value will go through that process of connecting processing storing and analyzing data through a little bit of a journey for data so let's start with the ingestion of data I talked about IOT core IOT core has a global front-end and that's important because when you configure your devices they only have one URL across the globe you send that device anywhere in the world it will connect to that URL but usually when you have one URL there's a DNS resolution and the data will now hop through the internet to get to that endpoint with IOT core we use the global front end from Google so we used over 100 front end across the globe and you never really hop across the internet you always hit the closest front end the one that serves google search and you and all that you hate that and then you're on our fiber network and go to your region you're not hopping through there it's much faster much more scalable then he lends in two putts up the data lens into pub/sub which is also a global service that means that if the data is generating in Australia in EMEA in in in the US when you pull the data out of pops up you don't have to know where it was posted now I have to know that this vehicle was in Australia and us and what topic do I need to get to you just pull it from the pub subtopic out of your RIT core and you just get all the data so that simplifies a lot pop subscales massively and it's used tremendously inside Google and by our customers so that's pretty cool so that data flows in we even have QoS one on pub/sub for the data and there's seven days of storage including in pubs up for the data so you can always pick it up later then we go in the transformation a transformation historically was done through data flow which will scale also and do do your job processing over a window of time we just announced yesterday I don't know if you saw cloud data fusion in in beta card a diffusion allows you to do data processing pipeline with drag-and-drop blocks they have over 100 100 of those open source block that you can add with sources and destinations and transformation capabilities in the middle of Seoul drag and drop looks like a big rolls engine really really cool so this actually data data fusion is becoming the glue between all the different services on the GCP platform especially for IOT data so that's same thing it's a managed service it's scales you don't have to worry too much about that then you go into the analysis of that data so you went into data fusion fusion is gonna drop it into bigquery and then you can do all your queries that's very high scale petabyte scale type queries in a few minutes I think we'll have an example from from birds a little later who is using a lot of bigquery machine learning will pull the data from bigquery or other sources and do your training and then you'll be able to visualize that data through cloud data studio and there's no IOT value without some kind of act at the end you can ingest transform analyze now you need to act we talked about real-time insights real-time actions you need to act on the data and one one good example that we'd like to talk to our customers about is the application of machine learning model to our own data center for the age backs and how we meant how we manage the cold how to cool - cool the servers in our data centers when we enabled the adaptive control systems for for our data centers we gained 40% of energy using our data centers 40% it was so big that the the team for the data center turned off the machine learning models and the adaptive controls to see if he wasn't something else and he went back up right away this is this is pretty impressive our data centers are probably the most efficient already and that was on top of the very efficient data center that we have so instead of talking about our own use case I wanted to bring Ludovic on stage merely a is from birds it's a subsidiary vilya so thanks for being here Luke thank you very much to you so tell us a little bit about birds and Veolia in particular yeah of course so thank you very much for being here valia is a French major company with 170,000 employees over 50 countries they focus on the three main businesses which are water waste and energy and they are clearly take care about all the all the these resources are used and birds add them to monitor this was fulfilled Burgess a French company a Verya company as you understood and we are designing deploy configure and operates are UT devices we are doing the data collection processing aggregate and delivery or services to our end customers or devices RT devices are designed to last more than 15 years and we are working through lp1 network which is a local network like sick fox laura1 and NB IOT we also have our own own made protocol today we are earning more than 3 million devices 90% of the devices are used for water use cases but we also do tank monitoring electricity and waste management device device management a little bit more about the water usage in particular what kind of value are you bringing there yeah so here's you as you can see there is a water meter and on top of it raised the IOT device and this device just sent us some some data send us from alarms we can we can be alert on leak detection which is very important for the for hand customers sorry yeah we are we have also alarmed from fraud if you remove the IOT devices maybe sometimes people think that if they remove it so they don't they won't be charged and it's not really the case and we have other clever people that remove it and turn the meter fill the swimming pool and see anything they won't be able to see it but it's not the case with you this event we also have some alarming when meter is blocked and when the meter is under or oversized but on top of these alarms so we also have some services coming through the periodic data reversing from these devices we can prevent sanitary risk for example if you have backflow if you think about something like there is a dirty water inside reprieve 8 water network and this this water coming back from the public network it should be something very not very good for water usage so and we also can make some temperature analysis which can also do some Network efficiency to see if there's unbuild water we also can do some conception forecasts using your big data or I mean I mean close match and learning to to have we've just turmeric inception models which and we can make some forecasts and also predictive maintenance so you're talking about customers there who's your customer can you give us an example of some of the value provided to a typical customer than you have yeah we have the city of Liam for example the cities are your customers yes it is and yes it is cosmo yeah so tell us about Leo yeah it's the second-largest city in France yes it is I for me it's the best I'm from Paris is from Leo yeah and verily we have something like four hundred thousand smart meter installed in Leo and we are we have a nice use case at the end of January the weather forecast tell us that we will have a week or two weeks with very very low temperatures so with a risk of damage on meters of course so what we did we took the data we have on a big on victory and beaker we have something like two years of raw data coming from all these meters something like 10 terabytes in some table so we did a little analysis and get all the data temporal data from this bigquery table and we get the list of all the meter which are which we will be under very very low temperature and we give this list to the end to a ton of Leo and they send mails SMS and some maybe some mails and emails and to prove the the hand customer because in France if the meter has some problem if the meter is damaged the hand user have to pay for that so so the city of young make some kind of services to prevent the variant customers so great that's that's concrete value yes so you see companies like birds innovating and so we're trying to on RN we're trying to provide more innovation to to our customers so they can build this kind of use cases what we've done this year we've we've launched quite a few features like the group's feature four devices we've launched advanced logging we've launched camera like fast commands down to the device we can do 100 hundred commands per second two devices also so we're not just ingesting also pushing it so we've launched a bunch of stuff but I wanted to spend time on two major features that we launched last year one of them is the gateway feature and the other one is the token service feature so the gateway feature is something that enables you to declare a gateway in the device manager and declare a bunch of devices behind that gateway and that enables the first gateway to be a proxy for authentication for those devices and what that means is you cannot connect or identify devices that are non IP devices directly to IOT core that means that if you have a Modbus device or a BACnet device or a ZigBee device as long as they can generate a jot token and sign it with their own identity they can pass that job to the Gateway the Gateway will pass the job to IT corps and the device will be seen as an entity as a first party entity and that's really important because usually when you have a gateway the Gateway does the authentication that's proxy all that identity for the devices and the devices have less secure identification with this system the devices are indicating themselves and can be seen can be seen in IOT core that was used for by one of our customers called smart parking they have sensors in parking lots and I have a gateway in arch of theirs partner because they also have their mesh network there and they were mostly seeing the the gateway itself and not I mean they were seeing the sensors but not as different entities with that now they see all those those censors as individual entities and they can act on that so that was a pretty cool use case the other service is token service token service came from a lot of men from customers customers saying hey my device connects to IOT core and using my public key and private key that's great I can afford gate but now I need to download a patch now I need to upload an image in GCS now I need to get a you know a machine learning model update because my model drifted so how do I do that I need another authentication I need a guy ID now in DCP so what's the use of having my token now I have another guy ID for my device so that was that's what token service alls when you authenticate to IOT core you get with your radio jot you can request a token that allows you to authenticate into GCS or cloud functions or do any bunch of other services the container services and things like that to download or upload data without having to have another identity in the rest of the GCP platform so it opens up the entire DCP platform to devices through the authentication of the of IOT core so that was that was a big demand and that's going to be extremely useful in particular for models that need to be refreshed on a fairly regular basis or to do security patches and OTA for example we also integrated with lp1 partners so little big was talking about the fact that Birds is using those lp1 technology they use Laura that you seek for I think you use a bunch of so we actually released integration with cig fox in particular so if you don't know they're very low-power network they're fairly global company right now and you can have the super super low power five year ten year on a battery to connect to the sig Fox networks and then send data to cloud IOT and same thing we did some integration I think with with objects and there's another one on the laura1 technology the TTL network so we have those integration here with a lower one network so those that kind of innovation that we're releasing and we will keep going and adding more and more feature so I want to bring in on stage another customer bill Schwab ole from zebra zebra and you'll tell us what it is that will come bill thank you very much being here at so tell us a bit about what zebra is what is what a zebra it's one of the companies is probably everywhere that maybe you don't know much about us but we do barcode scanning and printing and mobile computers that power frontline workers pretty much in most industries and manufacturing and distribution in retail and transportation logistics and healthcare field mobility as a matter of fact your badge is printed by a zebra printer which could have been embedded with an RFID chip I'm not sure if we did that here but probably would say yes yes of course it is yes you're being tracked but really what we do is we're connecting those frontline workers into our cloud platform platform we call Savannah to create something we call enterprise asset intelligence and essentially tracking those millions of users information from those millions of worker users the assets that whether they're a forklift or some control equipment or the goods themselves so you can think of billions of goods that may be embedded with RFID may have a barcode etc that Enterprise Asset intelligence follows the same trajectory that we talked about earlier with the ingest transform analyze act for us we call it sense analyze act and a lot of what has been happening on the edge has been around sense and really for that to have value you have to go through the other two steps of analyze act okay so you're very much at the edge a little cold so how does the cloud play in there what's the what's the use of a cow for you so the cloud really does two things for us one is it's the main tool to unlock that data that's on the edge so that data is trapped today and it's really that kind of physical world we've built and we're building a digital representation whether it's through the device so we're collect about 250 data points continuously from our devices that tell a lot of things about condition location etc but also the other things that you could see whether it's a visual sensor to look at workflow and how for example somebody could be loading a trailer whether it's assets in a hospital etc so we use that and in kind of facilitate in some use cases whether it's a retail situation where maybe a customer buy something on the internet they need to pick it up in the store how many people have gone to a door and the things not there that's a real-time action that needs to happen in that sense analyze active fulfil on that order same in health care a servings a patient in distress so that's one the second is it becomes a key interface point for our ISV partners we have 2500 IV partners as well as about 10 to 20,000 retail partners that becomes the interface point for them rather than having an interface on the end yeah that's that's actually a good point so how did them Google in particular cloud IOT helped you solve those challenges so we're just beginning our journey with Google Google Cloud IOT and we've been doing some pocs we built our own IOT platform pretty cool you know our group has been you know we're about eight years into our endeavor around IOT but we really looked at it as an opportunity to move into the platform as a service and one of our biggest challenges is operating on the edge so most of these facilities think of a distribution hub or a retail facility or a hospital they're not on the Internet and we need to do a lot of processing on the edge and then seamlessly be able to take that data whether I'm running an inference on the edge running models in the cloud but be able to manage and simplify that that piece cool well that's a pretty cool use case I really like it and thanks for starting with us like that's you know it's the beginning of your journey beginning of the journey well thank you very much bill yeah thank you [Applause] I mean touristy cuz you're seeing the mega train of rapid urbanization that Villas kind of and birds are tackling you're really seeing that no digitization of workflows happening in the manufacturing 4.0 with Bill said you're you're seeing those trends across the different customer use cases so as bill mentioned when when you when you build your solution a lot of a lot I don't know about you in the room specifically but a lot of our customers have tried to do it on their own and that's definitely a way to do if you want to build your own platform you can really build from scratch from virtual machines really I don't advise doing it but you can and you can also use the different services the managed services that we have in the in the cloud IOT platform and build your own solution that's no problem a lot of the customers come to us and say I would like a solution I don't want just bricks to put together I want a solution for my UC so what do you do for a grow what do you do for a manufacturing what do you do for retail what you do for asset tracking those are all its kind of solution that people are coming to us for and we've worked with partners to build solution accelerators we believe that working with partner in that use in that case is actually more important because they know the business actually better than Google it's more of an infrastructure player they know the business they know the vehicles they know the customers and they can build that solution accelerators that are maybe the 80 80 % of what you need out of the gate and then they'll customize that so working with partners is really important part in most implementation that we've seen in IOT there are partners I mean it could be on the hardware could be on the the software that's running on your device it could be the connectivity partner could be DSi could be the ODM could be the platform the cloud will be you know some of the analytics some of the more vertical players there's going to be some partners in there and we we see that as a natural fit for any IOT deployment there are going to be several vendors working with it so what we're trying to do is work with partners to make sure that we're all integrated we've done the groundwork before you actually have to do it yourself so it's cool that you can build the bricks together but if we're doing you solutions from partners they are already pre integrated they're they're already scale and they're already using a lot of the benefits of the Google cloud platform so that's really centrally important for us so we're gonna you're gonna see a lot of the partners coming in and to that and in that case I want to show you three three kind of solution accelerators that we've seen so accent rereleased artificial intelligence visual inspection solution that's really using HTTP you that we announced last year HTTP U is our inference accelerator for tensorflow light models that you can run on devices tiny chip that goes on a device that consumes two to four what only and can do you know 30 40 frames per second machine learning of 30 to 40 frames per second pretty easily on a stream on a video stream and apply these machine learning models there so it's very very efficient chip that were released actually it's available now you can go on Mouser comment bye-bye a module for it so they've been using that module to do a visual inspection so replace somebody looking at different hardware having a camera there and doing the visual inspection they use it on a drone to do powerlines inspections as well and they use it to do analysis of a bacterial samples in healthcare as well so those were usually done manually by a person going up the the power line there and climbing is risk it's dangerous it takes time it costs a lot of money this is a much more efficient so I believe they have a booth where they present that but you have a visual inspection use case using the hgp you in the in the show floor that you can see the second second solution is from deloitte and they've focused more on security so they have two to solution the product security manager which allows you to do a lot of the the scanning of applying the patches scanning the vulnerability of your fleet knowing which I 80 devices is at risk and what kind of patch they have accessor really having a fleet view of your IOT deployments that's really important as your you know every new IOT device is a potential entry point to your network so the more you have the more security risk you have it's not like we have one firewall and everything's behind the you deploy this things in the field there are sometimes accessible physically you have to have a good visibility and security so product security manager is that the technical security testing is a solution to do more of the ongoing scans that we've another really of your fleet would be like scanning your your web servers or your mail servers to see if there are any any problems they do that for IOT devices they have robots also going in your if you have a little data center they can have robots roaming around looking at cables and see if you know the layout of what's plugged in here is is what you're supposed to be and there hasn't been any changes so they try to automate as really in the workflow automation that we discussed earlier so those are two solution for the third one I'm actually honored to have such neck here from Hitachi consulting Shashank is driving digital transformation but it had two consulting which actually tell us about Hitachi process intelligence sure I'm going to talk about Hitachi and Google partnership and then you know talk about the Hitachi process into intelligent solution Hitachi you know all of you know is a really old company they've been around for over hundred years and you know we have used the the deep expertise and experience that we have gained on operational technology and IT in building these solutions so these solutions are powered by Google Cloud and really what we are doing here is helping businesses transform and embark on digital transformation to really drive business improve processes and increase agility HPI or the the process intelligences once a solution anthony's asked me to talk about HP i and take a customer example where Hitachi partnering with google has implemented components of HP i to help accelerate the digital transformation I'm only talking about growth its grow more kits in so does HP HP I for agriculture does this P I HP I work for other industries as well HP I specifically for the smart agriculture space really what it does is it takes advanced processes we combine that with analytics to really support IOT driven decisions for you know agriculture and livestock industry so you have a customer live with this using using HPI and let's grow mark so tell us more about what so this was a pilot project that we've done with Google and really we're you know in the subsequent phases of the project what we've done here is help grow mark implement an IOT and an ml solution what they really wanted to do was to take some of their logistics solutions where they are actually deploying tanks and these are these are fuel tanks propane gasoline and refined fuels this particular solution is focused on propane tanks we are you know it's an IOT solution where we are actually measuring the tank level the inventory in the tank and predicting the demand so you know we are it's a really forecasting the demand and we're looking at a two day forecast for the the level of fuel in the tank just to give you some sense for you know where and how it actually has an impact on the business grow mark works with their members and you know it's a it's a agriculture cooperative very large agricultural cooperative so they work with their members and they deploy these propane tanks in fields and you know imagine having a tank and Sheldon Iowa which is a is a small town of 1,500 people you know and 40 miles away from the nearest interstate right these tanks actually are providing the fuel in the in the winter seasons for these farms to you know for various functions and and as the fuel level depletes what happens in the in the traditional way is its grow mark is actually looking at refilling and in processing the orders with this IOT solution with the the forecast that you can get in two days combined with weather data we are able to predict what the demand looks like and it's really you know automating the the the order and the reorder process excellent so tell us about how Google helped in that case so yeah so I think you know Google obviously played a big part of the the solution so you know when we started having the discussion with Drew mark really you know they wanted to take the solution put it on the cloud and you know for scalability reliability we looked at you know Google's ml and IOT capabilities and that was a no-brainer really you know we we actually proposed that a solution with along with Google and you know you are really looking at being able to scale the solution and being able to provide some real-time actionable insights using ml oh great well thank you very much for sharing that story it gets great thanks for being here we're actually getting to the to the end of the presentation and I was really fortunate to have no real customers coming and talking about their use case it's always better than more slides we like to show what's being possible when it's possible in the platform and what people have done a pretty high scale you know we have three million devices analyzed with birds and two million on the rive system we have zebra starting to deploy that across of course their fleet sheshank with a Hitachi really bringing value to grow mark right away so this is really great you can if you want to learn more there's a there's a few things in the intelligence neighborhood shock floor there's a little demo of DHCP you as I said you can write the number of a little little roll it will do an analysis in a few milliseconds and drop in in the right bucket you can see how a GPU is pretty powerful runs on something that looks like a Raspberry Pi so it's pretty pretty cool you can find a lot of information online as well in the cloud that google.com slash solutions slash IOT you have more information about the platform itself and in /i r t / partners you'll find some of the corner accelerator solutions and some of the hardware as well so thank you very much for being here this morning and i hope that was useful for you and
