 In this tutorial, we will explain how to use "Slider"  component and how to change graphic list states. From "Indas" components menu, choose slider and add it to your screen. Click "Choose Variable" and assign variable, in our case that is  "Bucket Brigade.Int1". Set minimum value to 0 and maximum to 3, because graphic list has 0,1,2,3 states. Click the "Save" button, go to the "Client page" and reload it. Move slider position. Toggle image change images. If we set value in I/O field slider, get that value.
