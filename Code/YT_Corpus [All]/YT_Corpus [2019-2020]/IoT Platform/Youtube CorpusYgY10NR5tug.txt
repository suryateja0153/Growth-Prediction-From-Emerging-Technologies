 The vertical bar is a visual component for graphical presentation SCADA variables. We can use it to display, e.g. tank level. From the "Indas" components menu, choose "Vertical Bar" and add it to your screen. Set component size and position. In the "Vertical Bar Panel" type "Component Name" and "Tooltip" text (this text is shown when the mouse is over component). User can choose bar colour, first, click on the checkbox and then select the desired colour. Minimum and Maximum are the lower and upper value of the component. Now we will create variables for our "Vertical Bar" component. Go to the "Configurator" page, click on Variables and add Internal variables. In this case, we will add three variables. Variable (VerticalTEST) will be used for the current value of Vertical bars. Other two variables (VerticalMIN and VerticalMAX) for changing the bottom and top values of the second Vertical bar(BAR2). Go back to the Editor page. Select first vertical bar (BAR1) click "Choose Variable" and add created variable (VerticalTEST). Create three I/O fields one for each variable, with these fields. We will change the values of variables. Add new Vertical Bar (BAR2) for this Vertical Bar we will change Min and Max values with I/O fields. We will remove Minimum and Maximum values from the Vertical bar Panel. These values will be changed with variables (VerticalMIN and VerticalMAX). Link newly created variables (VerticalMIN and VerticalMAX) with fields (Choose Min Variable and Choose Max Variable) and variable (VerticalTEST) with (Choose Variable) field. Go to the "Client page" (platform.inviewscada.com). The minimum value for the first and second bar is 0. Maximum values are 100 - BAR1 and 200 - BAR2. Enter the desired values and try the functionality.
