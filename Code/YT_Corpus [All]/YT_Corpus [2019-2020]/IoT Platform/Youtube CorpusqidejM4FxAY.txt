 The shipping industry for many, many years focused a lot about the hardware and the assets. At Maersk we are working to become the global integrator of container logistics. So, the visibility needs to go beyond the fact that we ship containers from port to port. We want to provide to customers the insights that they need. We have 4 million containers in our fleet. This is where the digitalization comes into place, in terms of how do you manage the fleet? How do you utilize this the most effectively and efficiently with as limited cost as possible? Refrigerated containers carries perishable goods, mostly. So it's also then linked to a lot of risk in case of something is going wrong. RCM, Remote Container Management provides the ability to monitor the humidity and the temperature of our cargo inside our reefers and we're also able to send certain commands, basically change the operations of the reefer. Our service for RCM ran on a lot of on-premises servers, which, we're using soon to be end of life. It is probably the single biggest cloud migration we've done in the company. Maersk industrial IoT platform consists of the IoT Hub. IoT Hub helps us in ingesting the data from these 380,000 devices. It has a seamless integration with the Device Provisioning Service. We can process the events through Azure Function apps. It is more secured and we can control these devices with improved device management and device provisioning capabilities. We are able to integrate with the different types of devices into one single device provisioning layer and provide the holistic view towards organization. If we are to grow the reefer business in the near future, the scalability is not an issue. We also have the luxury to do an online maintenance. We are getting closer to a 24 by 7, 365 days online system. When we build new solutions, we are looking for ways to leverage as much cloud as possible. Azure plays that role. And we are looking into expanding the number of use cases to cover not only the vessels and the containers, but also the terminals and warehouses. Moving everything into the cloud, we have been able to move a lot faster on the data coming to the customers. The customers are very positive about it because it's the first time that they get real visibility on what is happening while their goods are in transportation, because they are seeing from the data log in the reefer, how the reefer is performing. We also are designing a lot of additional features in co-creation with customers. So we simply want to be in the driver's seat. With every step, we see that there is so much more to explore.
