 Hello, my name is Mohsen Mabrouki I am the manager and founder of Smart eTech Smart eTech is a Tunisian entreprise specialised in IoT Solutions Integration We work since 2017 on a IoT platform That could be connected to any IoT hardware kit We've worked on a water monitoring, air quality index (AQI) and also on warehouse tracking and asset tracking The team worked with me on this project are Khalil Mejdi, an IoT Integrator and a software engineer who developed the software of the platform And Hassene Khelifi, a software and embedded systems developer That integrated IoT Kits to our generic IoT cloud platform In the following section of the video, we will show you a DEMO about our IoT cloud platform the gathered data from the IoT sensors is linked to our databases through Node-RED and then displayed in realtime we can have see the values and data in realtime and we also can get alerts in time mapped with these values subsequently, the values will be showed in graphs with the possibility to combine different sensors together in the graphs and through the time So that we can monitor and analyse the realtime informations gathered from the sensors and from the IoT Kit SCADA mode in our IoT platform that connects the realtime data to the schema of the SCADA One of the main features in our IoT platform is a calculator that help us to combine values of sensors to simulate business rules of the monitored devices to help us understand how it works and how we simulate data based on realtime data gathered from sensors so that we save these data and display it on the time Since our application is a cloud platform, we have a mobile application, that can do some actions on the IoT hardware Kit and can display the realtime gathered data from sensors so that we can with an easy mode use, display and control the data displayed from the sensors We have also an augmented reality feature that uses the camera of the phone to display the realtime values by using some tags attached to the sensors One of the main features also in our IoT platform is the 3D mode Which let us explore the monitored devices and stations and then attach the sensors so that we can see the realtime values by exploring it without any application or complexity needed
