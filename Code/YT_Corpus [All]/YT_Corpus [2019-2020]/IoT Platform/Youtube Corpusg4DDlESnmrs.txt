 In this video tutorial, we will explain how  to use the "Toggle Button" component. We will use it to change states for toggle image  which we added in the previous tutorial. From "Indas" components menu add  "Toggle Button" component. Set text for 0 and 1 states. For 0 set ACTIVATE, for 1 set DEACTIVATE. Click "Choose Boolean Variable" and assign variable, in our case that is "Bucket Brigade.Boolean". Check "Bind with set boolean variable" and click save. If you check this checkbox, you do not need to assign a set variable. Boolean variable display toggle button state and boolean  set variable invert variable value when the user clicks the toggle button. Click the "Save" button, go to "Client page" and reload it. When we click on the toggle button  graphic list change states.
