 Scripts assign values to internal variables depending on conditions inside scripts. We use C# language to write scripts. SCADA executes scripts in the background process. To create new script click "Create new script" "Insert new script" popup is shown. Insert script name, time interval for  script execution and script type. We want to our script executes every one second. For time interval insert 1, and for type "CYCLIC". Click the "Save" button. Choose the previously created script. Now we want to assign value to an internal variable  depending on the OPC variable value. First create new local variable which get  value from OPC variable e.g. TankLevel. You must convert the OPC variable into the required type. We use the integer variable. Convert.ToInt32() convert OPC Variable to int. A variable name must be inside {}. Now we create simple script. If BucketBrigade.Int &lt;10  or 100 TankLevel is 1 else 0. This script sets the alarm if the tank level is not in these limits. We will use a simple if-else loop to assign value to the internal variable. Click the "Compile" button, if script doesn't have errors compile is successful. Click the "Save script" button to save Script.
