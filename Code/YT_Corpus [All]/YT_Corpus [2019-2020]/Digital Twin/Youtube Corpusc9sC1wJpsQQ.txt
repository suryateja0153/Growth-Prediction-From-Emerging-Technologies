 Hi My name is Jon Anders and I am the founder of Bluestone PIM. I've been working in the e-commerce industry since its beginning almost 25 years ago and I like to say that I understand what it is all about. Our company Bluestone PIM was founded 5 years ago on a very clear vision  of what we think the future will look like. And this is the sense of our vision: In the future your customers will not come to you anymore, you need to bring your products to them. And that means that you need to be present with your products in many different sales channels where your customers actually are, digital of course. Imagine that this cup is your actual product, and what you are going to sell in the future. This cup is for sure real, and it exists in the real world but you need this product to exist in the digital world and then you need a digital copy of this and what we call that a digital twin. The digital twin is actually much smarter than your actual product. This cup is for sure totally stupid, but the digital twin is not. The digital knows everything about itself: the price, the color the size, the location, maybe the language it speaks; and It has like videos and pictures of itself and it even knows what other people think about it. The digital twin lives in the cloud, and anyone with the right key can contact it. Your job in the future will be to train your Digital Twins to be excellent, and then you give access to all your sales channels, and the digital twins will more or less sell themselves. Do you understand what I mean? And do you understand why I am so excited about this? This is so fun, this is my job, this is what we do Bluestone PIM makes Digital Twins for Commerce You can implement Bluestone PIM in parallel with your existing business and solutions and you will come out much stronger tomorrow. Please contact us and we will prove it to you.
