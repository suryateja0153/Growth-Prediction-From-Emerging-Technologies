 I'm here with Dan McGrath, the Solution Lead for digital manufacturing and we've got a machine that we've Cognizant have put sensors all over and we're also connecting sensors like this to predictive analytics to help improve machine productivity. How does all this work, Dan? Well there's a lot of untapped value in equipment today; there's data and PLCs but also by adding sensors we can do condition monitoring, take that data and do predictive analytics. So the idea here is that by streaming data from the equipment to the edge extracting the insights and then providing tools like digital twins, augmented reality we can change the workflow. These sensors can reveal a developing problem, have an insight to make a change to avoid downtime and that goes to the bottom line ROI for our customers. Right... okay so it's sensors, artificial intelligence, an actual machine, training people to use the machine all put together in a solution to create value. That's right... we have a concept IoT nerve center bringing dashboards, analytics, process experts all together to mine that data and turn it into value. This is great. Thank you so much Dan. This is one more example of the kind of machine we've got here at Liveworx demonstrating the power of integrating the Industrial Internet of Things with artificial intelligence and data. Thanks. Thank you.
