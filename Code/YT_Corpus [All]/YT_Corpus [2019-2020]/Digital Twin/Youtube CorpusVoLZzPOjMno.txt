 [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's happening everyone kyle d'andrea here for fender i'm here with two of the newest models from the fender tone master lineup the tone master blonde deluxe reverb and twin reverb fender recently debuted the tone master series which replicated every nuance of the classic tube amps including the spring reverb and tremolo sounds as well as many modern features you could never get on those classic amps like direct outs with an impulse response speaker cabinet simulation and power attenuation so you can crank the amp and get that rich breakup we all love even at bedroom volumes the tonemaster blonde series extends the line with features geared towards modern players like celestian neo cream-backed speakers which have a distinct mid-range voicing and rock and roll flavor but sound equally as great with clean tones the line outputs have been updated with new impulse responses using the celestion speakers and have been captured with the shure sm57 and sennheiser md 421 microphones we've also tweaked the firmware with modifications that have typically been performed on the tube versions over the years the virtual bright cap on the deluxe reverb vibrato channel was removed for smoother drive tones and the reverb control has been updated to allow for easier fine tuning at lower settings and of course the updated cosmetics which feature the classic combination of blonde vinyl covering an ox blood grill cloth so let's start with the clean tones i've got my american ultra stratocaster here and i have both the twin reverb and deluxe reverb set pretty much the same power is at 100 i'm going to start with a bit of reverb and add some vibrato from the amps and i'll switch back and forth with an a b switch so you can hear both [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] for those of you not familiar with the tonemaster features as far as wattage the twin reverb has a 200 watt digital power amp section 100 watts for the deluxe and there's a six position output power attenuator on the back that goes from a full 22 watts all the way down to 0.2 watts on the deluxe and a full 85 watts down to 1 watt on the twin it's got vintage correct resonant pine cabinet balance xlr line outputs with impulse response cabinet simulations level control and a ground lift switch lightweight grab-and-go convenience at 33 pounds for the twin and 23 pounds for the deluxe all right now let's take advantage of the attenuator to get that push damp tone but at non ear piercing levels let's turn the deluxe down to 5 watts crank the volume we're gonna roll off the base to retain its clarity and for this one i've got my ultra hss strat in bridge position here we go [Music] so [Music] let's take the twin down to 12 watts crank the volume and again we're going to roll back the base to retain that clarity check it out [Music] [Applause] just as any of the classic deluxe or twin reverb amps the tonemaster amps take pedals really well let's set both to a comfortable room level back to full power and then we'll kick in the fender pedals i'll start with the deluxe and then switch over to the twin [Music] [Music] all right thanks for stopping by to see and hear the tone master blonde deluxe reverb and twin reverb all of the tone and looks of the classic fender amps but with modern features to make them work for any situation stage studio bedroom whatever and wherever you need to take them and as always if you have any further questions on specs please visit fender.com to learn more and stay tuned for future videos thanks a lot [Music] [Applause] [Music] bye
