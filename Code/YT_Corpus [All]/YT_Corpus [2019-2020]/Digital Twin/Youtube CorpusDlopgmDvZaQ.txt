 I think they sent us over for something like 25 terabytes of data we had to process through to put this together and we started to build this digital twin which will allow us to put in more and more data it's a living twin so it's a copy of what's going on in the real time and it will not be something which is just delivered and finished it's something which is being developed over time as we're working with that I think this is a super exciting journey I think Jersey is a lovely lovely sandwich we'll test case for us so I really excited to be working with this you
