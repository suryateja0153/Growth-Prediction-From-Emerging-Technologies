 I am Jörg Jungedeitering, CEO of DiConnex GmbH from Hamburg, and we deal with the topic of Building Information Modeling. With the BIM method we support companies, builders, planners, and contractors to integrate the topic of BIM. In 2016, we started working with NavVis, getting to know the technology, and then developing use cases to build the whole digital twin solution. The example of the Polarstern is one of those examples, where you can see how intensively the NavVis IndoorViewer can be used. We now have over 2500 hits on this model. We were in the harbor of Las Palmas for the scanning. We planned with four days, but then in the end it only took us 2.5 days and then after four weeks, we were ready and had the model online. In this project we used the NavVis M6 to capture and digitize 80% of the ship. In the run-up we had planned with about 50%, but with the NavVis M6, the maneuverability and the possibilities to lower the head, we then managed to digitize 80% of the ship with it. We then performed the other 20% with a TLS scanner and then merged this data in the NavVis IndoorViewer. The TLS scans now also offer us the possibility to display the panoramic images via E57 files and neatly navigate in NavVis IndoorViewer. This works great and we have had good experiences. 2500 hits is a respectable number and it is only researchers who access this model. At the moment, the Polarstern is frozen in place at the North Pole, which means there is no access for researchers for about a year. There are researchers who spend the whole year or several months at sea in this research vessel and other researchers now have the opportunity to access the ship from outside, to walk through the digital twin, to plan their objects and to measure them in this model.
