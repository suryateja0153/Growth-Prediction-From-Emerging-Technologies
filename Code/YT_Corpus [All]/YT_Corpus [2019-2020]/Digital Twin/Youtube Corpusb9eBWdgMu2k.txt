 The use of robots and A represents the future of critical infrastructure inspection, repair and maintenance. Through the ISCF 'Robots for a Safer World' scheme, four world leading research hubs have been developing solutions for use in hazardous and challenging environments such as those found in nuclear, offshore and space sectors. The development of robotic platforms which can enter these environments to perform missions is only half the story. To enable their full potential, they need to be connected to digital versions of themselves and the environment through the use of digital twins. These digital twins can be used in a number of different ways. For academics and researchers, they can allow the rapid development and simulation of new algorithms, securing the knowledge that the performance is similar to the real robot. For operators, digital twins can allow immersive visualization of environments and facilities using virtual and augmented reality. They can also provide real-time updates highlighting critical areas of interest. When it comes to the remote tele-operation of robot platforms, more intuitive techniques can be used alongside approaches such as haptic feedback. This will allow operators to be a more efficient, accurate and quicker with their tasks. For the physical and digital systems to interact seamlessly, connective digital tissue needs to be developed. 5G will be required to ensure reliable and high bandwidth communications, which will be critical for linking the digital and physical twins as well as the operator. The use of cloud-based infrastructure will not only allow advanced AI algorithms to be deployed, but also lead to the use of shared synthetic environments to help facilitate the ideation and design of digital twins. All of these technologies will come together to enable a future where the lines between the physical and virtual worlds blend seamlessly together and where human and robot work effortlessly hand in hand.
