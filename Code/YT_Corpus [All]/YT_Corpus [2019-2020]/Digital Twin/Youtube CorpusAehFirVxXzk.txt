 Anthony Fasano here from the Engineering Management Institute and I'm excited to be here at the offices of Bentley Systems about to pop in and visit with Bob Mankowski. Bob is a Civil Engineer and he's also the Vice President of Bentley's Digital Cities Business Unit I'm gonna ask Bob some questions about Digital Twins for Digital Cities and how that's going to impact Civil Engineering as we know it let's do it Anthony Fasano here from the Engineering Management Institute and I'm excited to be here at the offices of Bentley Systems I'm here sitting down with Bob Mankowski. Bob is the VP of the Digital Cities Business Unit here at Bentley and we're gonna get into digital cities but we're gonna talk about some other things related to Civil Engineering so Bob Welcome to the Civil Engineering Podcast thanks Anthony so Bob we're definitely going to dive into digital cities digital twins for digital cities we had a recent episode about smart cities as well just so much technology going on Friday that's impacting not just civil engineering of course but everyone but before we do that your background is in civil engineering that's right and so I'd love for you to just kind of tell our viewers a little bit about your career journey sure yeah I got a bachelor's in civil engineering from Drexel University in Philadelphia and from there I went on to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that was my first first job at a school and well drexels a co-op school so I had a few few opportunities there as well in a construction company and so when I went out to LA I worked for the water department and my first role there was as an inspector on cement lining projects so I was out in the field it was really a great experience and you know I've often recommended to young civil engineers there's a to get that field experience in the beginning because it makes a big difference in terms of understanding how your work as a designer or as an engineer actually impacts the folks that are responsible for building it operating it you know you get that first-hand experience of like what it really looks like out there in the dirt that's great now how did you get from Drexel to Los Angeles was there connection yeah there was a well they you know it was like a career fair at school and there were a lot of companies interviewing students and one of the engineers out from LA was an alumni of Drexel Oh came back and was recruiting on campus and so I had my first interview on campus and then they invited me out for a second interview Wow and yeah it was really exciting as a young guy from the East Coast sure to move to LA and a few of my friends actually one of my friends was there with me in LA and then a couple others worked for Caltrans so there were quite a few of us that went out to LA that's awesome I mean I would imagine for a civil engineer especially young you know starting your career you know Los Angeles Department of Water and Power must have been a very interesting place to work absolutely it certainly was it's one of the most complex in fact it might be the largest and most complex municipal water system in the United States so yeah it was a really great place for someone with a hydraulics and hydrology focus school to you know be selected to work there was was fantastic and I worked like I said in the field for a few years and then moved into the office and was responsible for a small team of of draftsman who we were basically creating main line replacement plans okay so upgrading the infrastructure which of course we can talk about in the context of digital cities sure just the aging infrastructure in the United States and Los Angeles was no exception there so we were designing replacements and and that's where I've got my first like taste of really programming so this is sort of how I got into the software industry I was there and I was helping like I said we were sort of drafting all these mainline replacements and I started to write some auto Lisp code and an auto cad to automate some of the repetitive tasks that the draftsman had to do oh and so just really making it so it's a bit more efficient for them to to do the work that we had to do and I really got I mean I had always enjoyed programming as a kid right I've gotten like you know in high school I had a programming class and at at Drexel there was one program in class you know that was required but I sort of had the bug yeah that's interesting so that's how you kind of got into the realm of software it is I guess how you really saw the power of you know you could help by writing this code to make things easier and then I started doing stuff you know as a hobby I'm kind of a geek and so I'd go home and I'd start writing code on my own you know to do hydraulic analysis I wrote little like you know Manning's equation calculators and Hazen Williams stuff you know and and I actually created a like a hard across you know network analysis program on my Mac at home and just for fun that was like what I did that was like my hobby was programming and and then when LA was you know I'm from the East Coast and so when I left the department only after like four years but during that time I did qualify for and and get my professional engineering license just great and yep so I've kept I've maintained that over the years but but when I was leaving LA a colleague of mine there said hey you're you know you're from New York right I said yeah and he's like Connecticut's not that far from New York is it that's it no he said well there's this company called hey stead methods in Connecticut that does software for urban water system analysis basically hydraulics and hydrology I thought that sounds like perfect job right you know right and so I came back East and applied there I wanted to be a programmer and they said no they're like no you're not you're not a good programmer but since they saw I guess they saw a bit of a passion there and they said well but you can join us join us as basically an engineer engineering supports I used to help people that were using the hasted products okay you know get the most out of them I would do you know it was a smaller company it was like 35 people and I joined so you know a little bit of everything but then really worked hard to try to learn how to be a better programmer and and like sort of earned my way into the programming team and I did and was sort of product manager slash programmer and then worked my way into more of a full time programming gig at hasted and ultimately hastin was acquired by Bentley yeah in 2004 so I worked there for nine years and became the CTO the chief technology officer at the end there and then when Bentley acquired us I make the joke that Bentley already had a CTO Keith Bentley the founder so I guess that job was out and then I started working at Bentley and in our geospatial group and over the years you know got more responsibility different product lines civil engineering I was responsible for our road design and rail design products for a little while and yeah so that's kind of how I got here it's it yeah I never would have thought Anthony when I was you know at Drexel that someday I'd be you know working in a software company it wasn't sort of on the horizon you know but that's how things happen sometimes yeah I mean I can tell you well first of all I remember and I had mentioned this to Bob earlier that I really remember the hasted methods programs the storm cab the culvert master a lot of stormwater when I was practicing as a similar engineer and they were I just remember the programs it's really helpful when you're dealing with you know hydrology all kinds of different inputs and different factors that happens right so the hets interesting it was when you know preparing for this it was exciting for me to be able to catch up with you on that but also you know from doing all these episodes of the podcast I found that you know civil engineers do do very different and interesting things in their career you know you're not necessarily limited to always doing design work on civil projects although that's in itself is an amazing job right but there are these other opportunities which is what I was excited to come and talk to Bob about because I feel like as a civil engineer kind of by nature you're always interested in like the built environment and you know improving in and we get to do that on a regular basis and I can imagine that for you and your position you know you have some you know potentially really a lot of influence in terms of helping civil engineering projects become more efficient which you know we're gonna get into talked a little bit about the digital twins for digital cities but I would just think as a civil engineer it's got to be a great feeling to maybe be able to work on some of this technology that can impact it is absolutely and as a young civil engineer when I when I joined hasted methods you know I was just really interested in the technology itself like I just loved mastering programming and making the computer do stuff you know and getting the great results out of it but I think as I got older I started to really appreciate how that impacted the broader community and at hasted it was a global company we sold our software all over the world and then Bentley of course is as well and it's been really gratifying for me to see how like the work that we've done has helped you know folks in India have a more reliable and continuous water supply or rebuild after the tsunami or you know there's just so many of these places in Brazil we have a great example of you know providing sewage to it to a population that didn't have sewage collection before and you know there was all sorts of environmental problems with that the lagoon was completely polluted and they used our software to plan and then execute a storm water I'm sorry sanitary sewage collection system huh and it has like real impact those people's daily lives and it was like like I said as I got older I began to appreciate that more when I was a kid it was more like I was just having fun but but anyway it's great it's great so all right so let's let's talk about digital twins for digital cities you know some of our listeners I'm sure aren't familiar with the term not familiar with it at all so maybe you could just start off with the basics sure yeah so a digital twin and this isn't specific to the infrastructure industry or cities or anything but a digital twin is essentially a virtual replica of a system or a process or a product and in our case it would be a digital twin of like an infrastructure system or or a lot of infrastructure systems together like in the case of a city so it's a virtual replica but it's not just sort of the geometric or physical replica of that in a digital world it also includes engineering technology which allows us to model the behavior and and the performance of the infrastructure systems and then use those for predicting you know what what the performance might be under different circumstances right so you can do sort of these sort of scenario brands because you have this virtual replica of it but you it mimics the behavior of the real system and then a digital twin is often you know it's built up from a variety of different sources of data and you then connect it also with IOT typically right so you have some sort of sensors in a water system it would be a SCADA system okay and that way you can get the real-time and historical performance of the system into the digital replica and use that as sort of the boundary conditions or starting conditions of your simulations for example right so does that make sense it makes sense what it sounds like we can just immediately see you know tons of benefits for that I guess one of my questions would be in terms of establishing the digital twin for a city what is in Vegas and what's involved in it is like you said getting information from different sources you have the data and is it something that ultimately is done through a program of some sort it's on the computer yeah yeah so typically one of the ways that you would start for a digital city and a digital twin of a city is with what we call reality modeling the idea is that your virtual replica has to reflect the actual reality the physical reality otherwise it's not going to be very helpful right so one of the things that can be done and Bentley has some great technology for this is transforming photos into 3d models and so it's it's you know there's a photogrametry has been around for a long time this is automated photogrammetry so just by taking photos from a fixed-wing aircraft you know an airplane or a helicopter and now of course with drones you can get lots of images close up to buildings and so forth you could also take ground photos if you want incorporate all this including lidar I'm sure many of your listeners are familiar with lidar technology and basically bring all these images and lidar together and automatically process that into a very accurate precise and visually like appealing replica of the city and we have many examples of this being done around the world and that's one of the ways to start so that 3d model of the city becomes sort of the integration point of this other data might be GIS data right it might be BIM data you know Building Information models right obviously civil data right from Road design or land development or whatever you want to bring that stuff in connecting in the sensor data from IOT sensors and having this 3d model is a way of indexing all that information and accessing it in a very intuitive and immersive environment and we deliver these things so there's basically it typically lives on a server or in the cloud and then you would access it through your browser either on your desktop or on your tablet or on your phone wow that's that's amazing and so for example it would be like a city that would want to build the twin right so they might have just someone to build it for them to build it for them and then they can whether it's their engineering department or whoever it is somebody can kind of use it as a model to like you said that's runner things that's right one of all one of the classic examples that we have is urban planning so being able to as an urban planner look at the changes that are being proposed for the city bring them into this digital twin environment and bet get a better feel for the impact on those and then a lot of what cities want to do with their digital twins is use it as a as a platform for engagement with the citizens and so basically they can create forms to ask citizens questions about how they feel about a proposed project or oh you know do they have interesting yeah it's really interesting very interactive and the citizens you know from some of the examples we have it's it's a better engagement platform than say the the town hall meeting you know where or the zoning meeting where typically it's only the people opposed to the project come you know have the energy to come and sort of speak at those things this way you get you know more engagement because it's easy it's right on their phone they can just look at the project they can see what it's all about and then they can you know provide their input that's great now how far along is this in terms of are there cities that use this now or it is so it's play it is in play yeah I think it's you know it's past the point of being a vision of having a digital twin of the city to being a reality with that said it's not mainstream it's not like you're gonna find every city has a digital twin but there are some leaders in this area there are some innovative cities that have embraced the technology and are looking to to create you know a better quality of life for the people that live and work and play in their city sure that's really interesting in fact we had another episode on our structural engineering channel podcast which was focused on using drones for bridge inspections yeah the experts that we interviewed he had done a whole PhD research around it and you know there's many benefits to it obviously one of them being you know time but also safety because you know you got people hanging off of bridges trying to get to these locations where a drone can get under there and you know video and things of that nature so you know speaking in terms of civil engineering it seems like there's tons of benefits for this in terms of monitoring things like you said utility systems that's right and things that nature and I would even think that just a large construction project right you could create a digital twin of that project site that's right and that is happening today there's um for example with drones it becomes relatively cheap and quick to capture to do this reality capture this reality modeling of a construction site on a weekly basis right and then you have a whole timeline of change across the the project we also have some technology called syncro which is all about for deconstruction modeling so hooking up the the structural models the BIM models to the project schedule and then being able to see the progression of work and identify potential problems in that progression again through a digital twin of the construction process right that's yeah yeah I mean the thing is is with like these some of these mega civil engineering projects is that the but you're talking about like astronomical budgets and things of that nature and impacts the community that something like this can be a big time saver absolutely and and a big time saver and then like you mentioned earlier about safety and security construction projects of course these large construction projects where there's a lot of earth movement changes the drainage on a daily basis and so one of our users is capturing their construction site on a weekly basis and then running our hydraulic analysis capabilities to predict you know for a design storm and for a check storm where is where am I gonna have ponding where am I going to have trouble this week and they can pre deploy you know pumps or they can take other measures to to you know facilitate that right to deal with the what could happen if it were to rain like disaster preparedness yeah actually yeah so that's redundancy exactly that touches on a broader topic what we call resilience right resiliency and for cities it really has two main components to it one is dealing with sort of the chronic stresses in a city you know the aging infrastructure the the urbanization like the population growth those sorts of things that are happening and they're happening all the time but really stress the infrastructure systems within a city and then you have these acute shocks they refer to acute shock such as like a flood event you know a massive storm and flood or earthquake or tornado or hurricane and so using a digital twin to help plan for that to assess the risk associated with those types of events plan for mitigation right of those say you look and say well if we raise the seawall you know half a meter you know what does that do where does the water go then because the water's got to go somewhere so if it's not where is it gonna go you know and so so by using a digital twin that can really help them plan for and mitigate the risks associated with these kinds of stresses and and shocks and become more resilient that's great I mean it really is there's so many benefits in and so a civil engineers like there's so many impacts to the community based on project based on you know the environment and and so it's interesting to see that there could be a tool like this that can see can be so beneficial in different areas so before we we are gonna jump into our hot seat segment a moment ask Bob a few more questions about his career which has been kind of an interesting journey but before we do that to two last questions here Bob what are some things or what is something that really excites you about civil engineering in terms of where we're headed in the future yeah so I don't think it'll surprise you to for me to say that like the technology yeah that can be applied to civil engineering you know with the advent you know so cloud computing is not new anymore but what is still growing is our access to data right right and the amount of data that we're producing and and how sensors and all these things are becoming smaller cheaper you know and proliferating around the the infrastructure systems and then there's lots of new techniques related to artificial intelligence and machine learning I'm sure your your listeners have heard about this before but these things have come together now to a point where we are seeing real benefits from machine learning in the context of civil engineering say for a water system to detect anomalies as they're monitoring their system can they you know artificial intelligence machine learning techniques can be used to identify anomalies in that that flow rate or in that pressure and identify when perhaps there's a break before it's actually noticed at the surface right they can see it in the data and that's pretty cool and I think there's a lot of technology that civil engineers are going to be a you know be able to apply to the problems that we're facing and yeah I think that's for me that's the most exciting thing is seeing how civil injury because it old profession yeah and it's just and it's relatively risk-averse for good reasons right but it's exciting for me to see how they'll take technology how the profession will up you know uptake of this technology and apply it to the problems we have yeah and I agree with you I mean you know as a civil engineer you know how can you not be excited about all the potential technologies and kind of what I was diving into there with Bob before is like you know you're kind of like with Bentley you're kind of seeing all that on such a broad level which you must be exciting but at the same time you know like you said as well is that this is an old profession and so I think it's gonna be interesting to see how these things are adopted how they're used how they're overlaid because there's all these different technologies as well and so I think that that is going to be an interesting aspect of civil engineering going forward last question here in this segment is what's something maybe that worries you about simple engineering I mean I know we're talking a lot about the positives and the technology but yeah well you know I guess um I'm not you know I'm not the worrying type first of all but but no I think that you know we do have a lot of challenges as a society that civil engineers are going to be faced with tackling right so we mentioned aging infrastructure before I mean that problem is you know every year it gets another year older it's a it's a it's a real challenge and you know so what worries me I guess is a couple of things the demand for civil engineers is growing and I'm not sure that the enrollment and the graduation rates of civil engineers are going to be able to keep up with that demand so I'm a you know one thing that would worry me is if we ended up with a shortage of qualified and skilled civil engineers because we do have a lot of challenges and you know from climate change and aging infrastructure urbanization decarbonization there's so many things that civil engineers can have an impact on so we just need to have to make sure we have enough make sure we have enough make sure we have enough of you know those young people that want to go into that profession because I'm afraid that they might not understand how exciting it can be how how impactful their career can be ya know it's it's good to say that because there are so many things we can work on we just need to make sure that we do think about the next kind of generation of civil engineers and really like one thing I'll add to that which you kind of touched on in the last question is kind of like one thing that could be a little bit worrisome is though can I just hope that we can use use the technology you know adopt it and use it the right way and use the right technologies because I do feel that sometimes for simple engineers it can be a little overwhelming yeah because there are you know you have the needs of your client you want to do the best you can on your project you have budgets you have timelines and then you have technology right and so I think it'll just be and I think that the technology can help us with that all the things we're talking about that we just talked about with the climate change and all this stuff it's just getting being able to integrate it and implement it effectively and so if that should be interesting great all right we're gonna come back in just a moment here with Bob Monkowski at Bentley Systems and we're gonna put Bob on the Civil Engineering Hot Seat. I hope you are enjoying this episode of the Civil Engineering Podcast which is produced by the Engineering Management Institute please be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel here for more podcast episodes and for all of our Engineering Manager 80-20 shorts videos that we publish weekly where we interview successful engineering managers now it's time to jump into our Civil Engineering Hot Seat segment All right we're back here at Bentley Systems with Bob Mankowski we talked a lot about digital twins for digital cities and many other things but now it's time Bob to focus a little bit more in your career we're going to put you on the Civil Engineering Hot Seat you ready I'm ready all right so first question Bob are there are any routines that you practice on a regular basis whether it's a work routine morning lunchtime something that just helps you in terms of your success for the day yeah absolutely I I keep it to do list my life has gotten so busy between my you know personal life and professional life that I find if I don't keep a running list of things I need to accomplish and prioritize them that things fall between you know through the cracks yeah so yeah every every morning I will take a look at my to-do list and throughout the day I just keep it open and it's very simple I just use a spreadsheet and I have a list of things that I need to do and I just color code them by the importance and sort them by their priority and yeah check that throughout the day and keep adding to it throughout the day and just keep that as my list spoken like a true engineer using a spreadsheet I use a spreadsheet for everything I mean my my wife's a civil engineer as well and you know we're all like we're doing a home renovation project and of course first thing we do is we get the spreadsheet out that's the way it works all right next question is there a book that either you would recommend to engineers or a book that you found to be helpful in any of your personal or professional development efforts could be one could be multiple but is there sometimes something sticks out yeah it's a little bit specific to me though in my career because I got into software development sure so I'm not sure you know for civil engineers if this is going to be that helpful but there was a book that really does stick out in my mind called the dynamics of software development and it was just a very practical book written by someone who had been through it themselves now and and had some just really good advice on how to deal with the typical problems and software development there's one that I'm reading right now actually which is called objectives and key results okay ours it's a management technique Google was a big adopter of this and there's many other examples and but I think it applies it could apply to any industry sure terms of civil engineering the whole idea is that you know you want to have a big objective something a bit aspirational but then you want to have metrics you know you want it and I think this comes back to some of our discussion about data all right today it's all about the data and using data to inform your decisions some people call about talk about data-driven decisions yeah yeah I don't like to use that term because I think that we don't want the data to there's a lot of things intangibles or things that might not be quantifiable that can influence your decision as well sure but it should be data informed you should have data to inform you know your decisions and that's what these OKRs are all about that yes you have key results there's got to be a number you got to be able to measure something to see if you're on track and achieving your objective and if you're not if you're not achieving those key results then you need to reassess your strategy so it's another great book ok Aria I think could be helpful for everyone yeah no I mean we do at the engineering management Institute we do a lot of management leadership training for engineering companies and the first thing we try to do with them is some kind of assessment or baseline because you know you don't want to just start giving training to people that don't necessarily need it in that specific area right right we're in a world where really in my opinion you should try to do things that are as custom as possible because you don't want to waste people's time and we can get the data that's right relatively easier so that's great now just on that first book you mentioned is that a book that you picked up when you were getting into software to help you it was a long time ago yeah it was actually probably 20 20 about 20 years ago I would say and it was we did a lot of reading and and you know I was lucky I had some great mentors and great managers around me and so there was one guy Darrow Kirkpatrick who shout out to Darrow he was fantastic and he would read everything and then you knew you know he would sort of fill through this stuff right so you would know hey this is a good book to read and ok you know that's good I asked because I know a lot of civil engineers from time to time that I that reach out to us like they're interested in maybe switching even within the civil range like a different discipline or something so you know you can always find a resource when you're making it addition that could potentially you know help you and absolutely no there's a lot of a lot of good information out there all right next question you've had managers throughout your career of course and whether it was the water to put an order department or you know in your software life if you think back to your managers and maybe a couple of them that might stand out that we're considering you know great managers or really good managers what were some characteristics or maybe things that they did that sure kind of made them great yeah so yeah you know I've been lucky in that regard I've had some great people around me and you know the term management somewhat implies like you know like organization and structure and management and that's not how all of them were right I had some like that a great organized administrators structured you know very good at project management and that kind of stuff and I learned a lot from that but I was also lucky to be involved with entrepreneurial types as well right so when I came to work at Haestad methods John Haestad was the President CEO founder of the company got to work directly with him it was a small company and the dynamic you know it was just a dynamic enthusiastic risk-taker you know and it was it was great to be around that kind of energy and then when I came to Bentley Bentley has grown a lot by acquisition okay and so a lot of the leaders of the company are also entrepreneurs who had founded and ran a company that then ultimately got acquired so I also had a boss here still ECAM Otero's he was my first boss at Bentley and again a really dynamic enthusiastic passionate guy and and I learned a lot from him that's great I mean it sounds like one of the key things there was like people they were very energetic and passionate about what they did and that can certainly rub off on absolutely it rubs off on you it energizes you it you know there's a lot of hard work you know I mean and you know in civil engineering as well as software you know you put in a lot of long hours like you said earlier you're trying to do the best for your clients but you got budgets and there's all sorts of balances that they're facing so having that energy that team and energy you know and having a leader who is really a leader and like I say neither those guys were sort of managers in the classic sense right of they were but they were leaders they were excellent leaders that's great all right last question here let's just say you were to get into an elevator with a civil engineer a young civil engineer and they're thinking about their career ahead of them right you only have about 30 seconds with them okay what advice what career advice would you give him or her I said this earlier in the in the program that I would recommend that they absolutely get some field experience don't limit yourself to working in an office you know behind the computer making drawings and designs and calculations and spreadsheets and things those are important but that field experience is is where the you know the designs hit the dirt and there are a lot of challenges out there in construction and in the operations of infrastructure and civil infrastructure and I would say for a young engineer to get out there and talk to the contractors talk to the people building the things that you're designing talk to the people that are operating the stuff that you've designed and really create a rapport with them and it'll improve your designs it'll improve your engineering by having that context and that experience of what it's like out there you know getting dirt under your fingernails to actually build these things that's great all right Bob Mankowski Vice President of Digital Cities Business Unit at Bentley Systems thank you for coming
