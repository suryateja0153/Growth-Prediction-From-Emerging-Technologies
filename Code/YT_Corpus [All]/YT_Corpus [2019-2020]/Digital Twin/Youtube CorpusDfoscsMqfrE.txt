 You also mentioned in your speech the concept of a Digital Twin. That kind of peaked my interested as well. Can you talk more about this, and again, where do you think hotels could learn from that? I think that a lot of industries are going on a digital transformation at the moment, where they are trying to get all  their data together. And what they're ultimately trying to do, I think is create a simulation of their organisation where they have sensors on all the important devices and equipments and tracking things. Even their people will have sensors so they can understand how happy they are and whether they are productive and things like that... But ultimately they're trying to create a digital twin of their organisation. Because I would argue intelligence is synonymous with adaptivity. So if you have a Digital Twin of your organisation you can run simulations to say if I spend more marketing money here how would that impact my entire supply chain? How would that impact the customer experience? If I can have that simulation, I as a business leader can ask lost questions, run lots of hypothesis, so that adapt my organisation more quickly. And that's what you're trying to get to.
