 the electronics industry has always  been at the forefront of innovation   affecting every aspect of our lives  but innovation comes with a price   the pressure to deliver new products without  compromising on quality and time to market   demands a new approach to electronic  pcb design and manufacturing   valor digital manufacturing solutions drive  intelligence throughout the entire design   to manufacturing flow enabling smarter more  efficient introduction of products to market smart manufacturing begins with validation  that the product can actually be manufactured   creating a digital twin of the product and  analyzing it with over 900 different dfm   checks ensures the manufacturability  testability and reliability of the pcb   without physically placing a single component  on the board valor npi allows us to left-shift   manufacturing know-how into the design  domain once the product design is validated   we can package it into an intelligent  format and hand it over to manufacturing   a digital twin of factory resources and  constraints allows for accurate finite planning   intelligent simulation generates an optimal  production schedule and minimizes downtime   especially in high mix assembly operations process  engineering work is also streamlined supporting   rapid introduction of new products and revisions  the entire line can be programmed with a single   tool including stencil smt inspection  test and electronic work instructions   with a digital model of the manufacturing process  in hand high quality pcb production can be   executed quickly and safely on any manufacturing  line anywhere in the world the digital thread   continues on the manufacturing floor intelligent  iot devices collect data from manufacturing   stations creating a real-time digital twin of  the production normalized performance utilization   quality and consumption data is available to mes  and other shop floor applications enabling quick   automated response to changing manufacturing needs  valor material management allows us to maintain   continuous production flow and reduce material  waste by proactively ensuring that the right   amount of material is delivered from the warehouse  to the line exactly when we need it just in time   instead of drowning in a notion of data vala uses  its analytics capabilities to draw insights about   the operation and generate predictive closed  loop feedback to all stages of the pcb design to   manufacturing flow driving intelligent business  decisions and continuous product and process improvement siemens ingenuity for life
