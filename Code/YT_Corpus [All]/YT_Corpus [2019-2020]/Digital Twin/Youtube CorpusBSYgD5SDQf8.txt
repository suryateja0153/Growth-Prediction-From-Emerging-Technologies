 2019 was an incredible year of achievements for us in Howden and for our journey of digital transformation. Our vision is to create value for our customers through overall product lifecycle improvements that are enabled by some of the most advanced digital innovations in the world. With this vision, and with the support of our partners, we developed unique use cases for technologies such as Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence. We also spend a lot of time with our colleagues in regional offices and product units across the globe and together we talk to many of our customers about the benefits and advantages of the Howden digital services. We came to understand that, despite the variety of applications and products involved our customers needs tend to be similar in many ways, our products often operate as process critical which means that our customers are focused on maximizing equipment availability. They are proactively managing asset health and enabling predictive maintenance strategies across the entire operations whilst minimizing energy consumption and ensuring the safety of operators on-site. Our customers operate in some of the most critical processes providing essential infrastructure services for society around the world. From power stations to wastewater treatment and transportation our customers need and expect world-class reliability and performance. Throughout 2019 our customers experienced firsthand the advantages of Howden Uptime, our performance optimization solution. One of our customers in the wastewater treatment segment experienced an unexpected shutdown of their fleet of blowers following routine maintenance. Howden product experts were able to access data and remotely diagnose and resolve the issue within 30 minutes. Not only did this avoid the cost and time of travel for field service engineers, but importantly minimized the environmental impact associated with the discharge of untreated wastewater. In the petrochemical oil and gas segment we have many customers using Howden Uptime. In several cases the Uptime system has detected the change in the normal operating conditions and immediately identified the root cause, these interventions prevent a production loss for the plants and increase the asset reliability. Additionally we have expanded our portfolio with new installations in the pipeline for steam turbine and axial fan technology. With these demonstrated successes we are confident that 2020 will be another year of accelerated growth for Howden Uptime. Our lives have been digitized in so many ways and it is important that Howden also keeps its pace on the digital transformation journey, so that we can be ready for an era which will need the new approaches to serve our customers more effectively and efficiently. With that in mind this year we hope to expand a successful implementation of Howden Uptime with more customers in the power and mining sectors. We will continue to capture expertise from R&D and engineering teams, integrating our knowledge and experience of manufacturing, market the new equipment to advance digital twins, which ensures our assets run reliably and efficiently in operation. We will continue to evolve our use of mixed reality technologies, which not only provide a new approach for accessing data related to the status of our equipment, but it also improves our safety by providing guidance and safe practices for engineers and operators. In 2019 we built an incredible foundation that will sustain a 2020 of acceleration in scale. By linking our vision for digital transformation to the overall product lifecycle and the service we can offer to our customers we are setting a remarkable growth trajectory and exciting future for all of us in Howden.
