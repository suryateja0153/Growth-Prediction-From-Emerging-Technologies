 for thousands of years our planet has enabled and nurtured our growing civilizations throughout the ages our settlements have existed in balance with the natural world that surrounds us protecting us from the elements while enabling our societies to thrive but now in the space of just one human lifetime all that has changed the extent of our Urban development's has reached extreme levels and our buildings now contribute more than 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions our actions are causing dramatic and irreversible changes to the planet that we call home the critical links between ecosystems are being broken [Music] but we have the power to turn this tide we have the ability to limit the impact of the structures we build and to help them support rather than destroy our planets the construction industry can make the difference and with the help of new cutting-edge technology placed into the hands of billions we can save our planets for future generations [Music] Urban Development is one of the main ways that human beings impact the earth from the structures that we call home to our schools hospitals workplaces and the infrastructure that we travel on our built worlds now accounts for a significant portion of all a greenhouse gas emissions produced worldwide from initiatives to make entire cities carbon neutral to innovations in concrete manufacture and even smog eating buildings the construction industry is beginning to recognize its role and respond but much more needs to be done and at a faster rate to make a real difference we must reach beyond the construction sector and enable each and every one of us to better understand how our buildings are impacting the planet technology can play a key role here particularly in the form of the digital twin systems that have supported other sectors for many years creating a digital replica of a physical building that actually behaves like the real structure and provides crucial information on real-life performance can enable us to better understand how our buildings are performing and simulates how they may perform in the future under a range of scenarios leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning these so-called digital twins can improve energy resilience reduce operating costs increase resource efficiency and help to decarbonize our buildings when applied across a group of structures or even an entire community we could start to analyze and improve our energy use at a societal level reducing our impact on the planet digital twin technology for buildings is available and in use on real projects right now systems like the intelligence community's life cycle or ICL environmental digital twin developed by IAS combine building simulation and machine learning to provide insights on energy usage waste heat renewables occupant comfort and even transport connectivity the ICL can replicate reality by simulating the physics of energy and heat flow throughout a building or a collection of buildings any gaps in real-world data can be filled with projections developed by the intelligent digital twin itself such systems allow energy and resource use in buildings to be clearly visualized reaching beyond the barriers of complex engineering and engaging everyday people from children to those who previously had little awareness of how our buildings can impact the planets and their lives the main reason to do this is because of course we want to improve buildings now love Kelvin used to say you cannot improve it if you cannot measure it so that's what the they shall build the digital twin allows you to do it gives you a prototype a virtual prototype of the building the first of all loves you to measure it but also allows you to test to experiments on it without having to experiments on your building it's all about the data so the digital twin engine is a collection of data for different use cases it can look very realistic like maybe the trend Basin that we are looking at now from knocking on my back but also it can be just about data about performance so because the data is available means that we can use the data to share when we hear we make this information public so we educate the public when you get the public we hopefully create more engagement that's what we need to solve there's a climate change to improve the climate with ambitions to become the greenest campus in the world by 2020 Nanyang Technological University have deployed IES ICL technology across their 250 hectare flagship eco campus in Singapore initially IES created a master planning model of the entire campus site accurate to 91 percent for total energy consumption that model was then used as a baseline for high-level analysis on a number of energy reduction technology trials they had this this mission they wanted to improve the performance of their campus they said let's first create a very high-level master planning view on our campus and I just tackled the low-hanging fruits so are we using a set point database too low so are we keeping the rooms at 17 degrees rather than more manageable 23 24 degrees very simple intervention they already managed after one year of lenez's resetting all the parameters they managed to save around 10% 15% of the energy this allowed it to analyze it to test to experiment the impact of changes something that cannot really be easily replicated on the side without without using the digital twin in toto the use of ICL technology revealed a potential reduction in energy consumption of 30% ik waiting to potential savings of over four point seven five million Singapore dollars IES is digital twin technology is currently in use on residential schemes as well Trent Basin is a model low energy community in Nottingham in the UK here is works with experts at the University of Nottingham to create an interactive platform that allows the community to visualize his energy data in real time Trent Basin is an area of the city of nauseum on the banks of the River Trent and it used to be an industrial area of the city and is now being redeveloped for low energy housing as near zero-carbon as they could achieve so there's lots of energy efficiency technologies and design elements that gone into the housing residents can interact with the platform online or at a large touchscreen in their community hub moving around the virtual sites seeing the amount of energy being generated and their energy use what the arc that was interested about was to create engagement with people that live in the community so they know they've designed sustainable buildings so they wanted to allowed them to sit in a way almost to interact with the digital building the main thing was to visualize the data and to make the data more accessible and presented in a friendly way to informally engage the residents about the energy use and what has been produced at what has been consumer data what has been storage in the development the platform means that residents can interact with and comprehend their energy use like never before driving behavioural change you can really interact with a 3d model you know sometimes for for people that is not from architectural background is difficult to visualize three 2d sketches or 2d drawings and the 3d interactive platform it actually helps a lot when you live somewhere where you're generating your own electricity where you you're living in a well insulated home with lots of energy efficiency features it starts to make you think more about your own living in your own environment it's also highly engaging for children immersing them in the concepts of responsible energy management from a young age the platform was created to be inclusive in self explanatory so it allowing children and people with reduced mobility to use the platform and to interact with energy in the way that they have interact before residents can go and touch the baddest buildings and see not only what the building looks like what are the main properties of the specific apartment of the specific house they can also go there and see what the current energy consumption is or what the temperature is [Music] we generate our energy locally using photovoltaic technology solar panels that electricity is generated locally and then it's stored locally in a large battery at the time it was installed it was Europe's largest community energy battery over the past year since this has been running we've reduced an awful lot of carbon dioxide emissions associated with conventional generation the potential impact of this technology on a planets facing such an urgent climate emergency is considerable systems like the ICL can help us to better understand how our built world is performing and provide insight on how to improve it it's not just about having the technology running the backgrounds actually take the residents on on the journey as well if we could integrate this technology into all the buildings within a community and then replicate that across multiple communities around the world we could make a significant reduction in carbon outputs at a global level the widespread adoption of such technology would also drive behavioural change not just among the current population but with future generations enabling them to care for our planet's long into the future our biggest challenges are countries how we do carbonize he how we get gas out of buildings and how we generate heat for a built environment and one of the things that we're looking at here in the trent Basin is how we can get maximum value out of on-site renewable energy generation so electrical generation how we store that locally and how we can interact and trade between the heat that we can generate and the electricity that we're generating here to optimize an entire system to optimize the use of renewable energy for provision of both heat and power [Music] while the climate emergency currently facing our world is extreme it is the construction sector that can make a key difference in turning the tide with technology as our key ally in this fight we can develop a more sustainable built environment helping our planet to recover and thrive if you enjoyed this video and would like to get more from the definitive video channel for construction subscribe
