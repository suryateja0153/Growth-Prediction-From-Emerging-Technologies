 what is and has always been special about  Electrolux is the deep consumer understanding and   the consumer orientation which started 100 years  ago Electrolux makes 60 million appliances every   year we have about 150 markets where we sell our  products we have about 50 factories we have 3000   suppliers and around 100,000 delivery points  expectations of quality of consumer experience   and then consumer fulfilment logistically are  just increasing so the speed of innovation the   reliability and the logistical excellence become  more and more important Siemens plays a very   important role because it's sort of the mother  system if I may say of digital product development   and more and more so digital operations and of  course we get into the the world of digital twins   so we get into the world of moving on a digital  product all the way through our manufacturing   process I would like to see it go through our  supply chain process like to see it go through our   marketing and sales piece as well right so that we  have the ability to visualize to show to simulate   throughout the lifecycle of our product when we  started 2010 we took the decision that we need to   have one pill and backbone for the whole la classe  group one of the reason for selecting team Santa   was that the portfolio is very broad because even  if we started in the padang dia with engineering   change managing the components ie bones that  subtract we already note that we will increase the   usage of this PLM backbone to other functions like  quality purchasing manufacturing etc when we have   to plan a new factory in the past we were doing  a calculation about capacity manually on an excel   sheet now we put the process we load it into the  techno Matic stool and this provides a simulation   of the total capacity how many shifts you need how  many people and work in position are present and   you can identify the bottleneck simulation does in  one week what two engineers done in three months   simulation tools will no longer be just used by  a manufacturer engineers once a time when we need   to create a new production line but they will be  a living tool for the plant management in order   to where every day the digital tune of the plant  and the spected behavior in terms of Manning and   performances Internet in order to manage and to  simulate everyday what the plant should do and how   the plant is behaving we are going to digitalize  more and more our workforce so it's fundamental   that they are able to learn quickly and the tools  are easy to be used for the young engineers coming   into Electrolux today will absolutely see that  we will be in top-of-the-line when it comes to   using these type of tools we need data from a  lot of different organizations within Electrolux   from tim center we can get information about the  product we can get information about the process   and also about how the factory is built up we take  the production plan for these products we take the   process plans how to produce these products and  then we put them in the same picture and we put   also the parameters for the equipment the shift  calendars for all the operators working in the   plant and then we put all of this information in  a simulation model we have around 5000 users in   our company that are frequently using PLM tools  from Siemens and that are happy with that that   are innovating all the time on that and that are  delivering much better results for our consumers   on a constant level the Siemens PLM systems  have contributed to a strong extent to lower our   development time by around 20 30 % it's not only  the saving in time it's also the increased quality   of work in in Brazil in our could Sheba plans do  our engineering we were installing a completely   new production lines and that through the  simulation in techno Mattox we found 16 unexpected   issues without the simulation we would have lost  at least six months production time and more than   half a million dollar sim has been a key partner  we've had a tremendous journey together now for   the last seven eight years on how do we drive and  how do we make sure we have one single version of   the truth and and for me that is the beginning of  that digital journey to actually have that first   piece of the puzzle in common across the group  there has to be one truth that is updated all   the time so that you compare virtual reality  with the physical reality once you're there   everyone will develop in the right direction  for the better of the consumer experience
