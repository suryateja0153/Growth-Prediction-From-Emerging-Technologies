 so we're talking today about robotics and automation and I think Catherine when you think robots you know in a certain way that always seems futuristic but actually robotics and automation has been around since probably the first Industrial Revolution so what why are we talking about this now and what's happening at the moment yeah you're quite right so robotics is kind of where we came in with all of this the spinning jenny in the 1700s and things starting to be done by machines that used to be done by hand the difference now is really the convergence of new technologies which are boosting robotics boosting automation to another level so if you think about all of the industry 4.0 processes which are happening we've got artificial intelligence boosting things we've got digital twins we've got Internet of Things all of these things are coming together with sort of physical automation and taking us forward up to the next level so what we need right now is not spinning Jenny's so what do we see in what sorts of things are being automated yep so one of the leaders for robotics for manufacturing robotics and creating robotic systems is Japan and there's a really nice little phrase in Japanese which is kickin kit Suey and kit and I so that means dangerous difficult and dirty and that sort of encapsulates really nicely the kind of the kind of situations where robotics can help so dangerous situations you might have sometimes military environments bomb disposal that kind of thing after a big after major accidents where you've got dangerous environments or hazardous chemicals or nuclear accidents that kind of thing you very often robotic tools support dealing in those kind of environments where it's too dangerous for the humans to be involved difficult robotics so for example surgery is a really good example of that brain surgery has done using robotic tools many kind of surgery that the robotic tool can in many ways be more dexterous and can get to places that the human beings might not be able to or perhaps it's incredibly delicate and the precision of the robotics is better or things like very detailed welding jobs that kind of thing so difficult things where precision and extreme accuracy is required and also dirty things so I've already mentioned hazardous environments cleaning up a hazardous environment for example there are even barn cleaning robots for the integra cultural environment so you've got those three big areas the other one that the that I haven't mentioned is dull jobs so the absolute classic of screwing the lids on toothpaste tubes things which are repetitive simple can be automated they've long been a good option for robotics and then perhaps I'm not sure there's just the the last adult jobs per in terms of industries which in the industrial setting where we see in robotics make it an impact yeah so it continues to be the automotive sector there have been robotic production lines in car manufacture for example since the 1960s and that's just that's only continuing and getting more so robots themselves are made by robotic industrial processes and and the degree of automation can be really quite striking so for example one of the major Japanese manufacturers their robots are built by their own robots and they only turn the lights on when they want to take photographs of the factory so the whole process is completely automated it runs 24/7 every day of the year and it doesn't even need lights on because there are no humans involved in this process and nobody needs to see in a lit visual sort of way the robots obviously sent some operation in a completely different way so another area where robotics is really important industrial robotics is really important is in the electronics sector both for building hardware and that sort of thing but also increasingly for creating for building batteries for manufacturing batteries which is interesting cuz again that the increase in demand for batteries is very much driven by the automotive sector because we're moving into electric vehicles rather than the combustion engine so batteries again and you know they're again you've got many hazardous materials involved in the manufacture so robotics are well suited to that as well and what about warehouse services because I know I've seen some fantastic videos of robots being used in a warehouse setting is that something where robots are particularly well suited yes so we talked about robots that make stuff service robotics which is robots that do things are a really important growth area as well and warehousing and customer fulfillment so picking off the shelves the stock that the customers ordered it is a really good example of this the state of the art now is that you don't really have humans involved in the in the picking process you have humans pushing humans do the packaging bit still but the state of the art for example is is is a factory where all of the stock is very densely packed together very efficient in terms of space and the robots will run across it picking up what the customer has ordered and that system is a really nice example of the convergence that we mentioned earlier so you have connectivity and sort of Internet of Things technology managing the robots using almost a sort of air traffic control network to control them there's artificial intelligence in the systems that run the ordering of the or of the picking etc etcetera to optimize everything make sure it's as efficient as it can be and it's also really nice example actually of the whole sort of digital transformation aspect where the businesses that have built these new technologies these new customer fulfillment technologies for themselves they're such valuable systems if you like that they're now able to actually sell them to third parties they're selling the technology which they built for their own core ecommerce business they're now lifting that up and selling it as a product in itself so it's really interesting so service robotics is another really important area other areas where you see service robotics we've talked about medical surgical tools already that's another area also customer relations increasingly you see little BOTS in shops and you can interact with them or perhaps it's a it's a little bot that gives you a direct connection to a human being customer relations person so that's another area where service robotics is becoming really important I suppose the only other area to mention is consumer robotics probably the best well-known examples are robot hoover's robot lawnmowers that kind of thing and then also something that we have at home some toys as well toy robotics which is you know not such a big commercial market but you know it's something that perhaps many people will come across so I can see that convergence of technologies is a key theme in robotics are there any other exam of convergence and where that is being used in robotics yeah so another really powerful example is is the way that robots are actually being trained the movement is being programmed into them so traditionally if you want if you want a robot to to move in a certain way that needs to be coded into it each elements of the movement has to be separately coded and worked out now one of the revolutions that's happening in relation to artificial intelligence is this ability to give the system a target define success and failure if you like and tell it the rules of the game and then set it off to work it out itself set the system officer that it works out how to get from nothing to the goal works it out itself now that's been used with robotics so and again it's also using sort of digital twin type technology where you have a virtual replica of the physical thing and then you can then trial and test things on the virtual version of something before you put the software into the physical version and off it goes so they have created for example a robotic hand the physical hand was built and a digital twin was created and then using the digital twin the virtual replica they used reinforcement learning this sort of trial and error process of work it out for yourself type programming and the hand the robotic hand the virtual one worked out how to move the fingers so that it could manipulate a cube and if you asked it to show particular face it would do that and it wasn't programmed in how it needed to move it was told to achieve a certain end and then with computing power so that thousands and thousands and thousands of iterations were possible it worked it out by trial and error and then once that programming had been achieved it was lifted out and put into the physical robot hand which was then able to move this cube with the dexterity which had been developed sort of virtually and robotic dexterity is one of the really hard challenges in all of this it's one of the things that's very difficult to do they did something similar with a four-legged robot and they said they ought they instructed the the AI system to work out how to walk to work out how to move along and it and it did itself it wasn't programmed walking wasn't programmed into it it was it was given a sort of deep learning neural network reinforcement learning and he worked it out for itself so that's another really nice example of where advances in one area of the technology are benefiting of benefiting robotics and other example of conversions yeah and you mentioned the digital transformation aspect the fact that businesses are transforming what they do as a result of what can we achieve through robotics now that obviously poses some legal issues perhaps you could expand on some of the legal issues that robotics and automation post yeah so actually following on directly from what I was just saying about reinforcement learning one of the problems with artificial intelligence as we know is this sort of black box aspect that because you don't program every step into it you let it work it out for itself sometimes outcomes are developed with deep within the neural network which the humans didn't anticipate this isn't different for robotics to any other application of artificial intelligence with the black box angle but you have the liability issue of normally as you know in English law negligence there has to be a chain of causation between this person who's responsible for that thing it was foreseeable that might go wrong this person is therefore responsible for what did go wrong and you have that chain of causation linking the responsibility if you like to the harm that was caused and if you've got a black box AI system involved in that process somewhere so that the human had no idea that that might go wrong it wouldn't it didn't tell the AI system to do that the AI system generated that output within its own system as it were that can cause problems there isn't a answer yet on how to deal with this that doesn't mean sort of dealt with by the courts or by legislation yet although you know it's something that perhaps can be dealt with under the contractual liability framework the risk that you sort out in the contractual provisions risk allocation it can perhaps be sorted out with insurance etc but that's one of the problems another issue so there are many of the issues are not particularly different or new with with advances in robot six I mean you know these these industrial robots in particular are incredibly powerful potentially very dangerous they're not smart in any way they just follow their path and do their rep repeat the movement they're designed to do so you have sort of health and safety issues but they're they're not different they're not they're not changing because of the advances in robotics perhaps all of the issues that is very high-profile and you know has quite wide implications is is the impact on the work force on the human workforce robotics obviously the whole point about automation is to is is to make it its erudition you don't need a human being anymore to do it and that obviously has implications on how you deploy your workforce whether you need to retool your workforce whether you need to restructure your workforce etc so there's big future of work type issues and OSI as you know it's done a really interesting report around those kind of issues and and that's absolutely the territory that we're in and perhaps the last thing to say is it's an angle that doesn't often get thought about but one of the ramifications of robotics is actually its impact on the taxman so a robot doesn't get given a salary or a wage and therefore a robot doesn't pay tax and a robot doesn't take its money and go out and buy things in the shops so a very significant proportion of of the tax man's revenues in the UK in the u.s. in many countries is actually from either from taxes on salary on income and national insurance that kind of thing or on secondary taxes on indirect taxes on the things we spend our money on so there's actually quite a big potential impact wide wide automation will be felt in the Treasury coffers there will be an impact point so again that it may be that down the line that that will require some sort of legislative restructuring to make sure that revenue is a sustained or restructured or changed etc so there's a sort of less obvious angle perhaps on the future of work aspects of all of this so space for regulation and legislation will need to keep pace with some of the technical developments we've seen in robotics yeah that's right absolutely Katherine thank you very much thank you
