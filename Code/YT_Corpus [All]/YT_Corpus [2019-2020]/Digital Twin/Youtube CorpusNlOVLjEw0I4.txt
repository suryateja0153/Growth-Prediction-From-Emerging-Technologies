 Karlis what are you doing I'm trying to figure out how I can automate all my lamps and devices without manually configuring each one oh I have a solution for you just build some digital trains what's served a digital train is like a digital version of your physical devices let me show you how to build one on Google cloud platform that sounds awesome let's get started [Music] the solution we built today looks like this the blue boxes are managed products which we can use directly the only places where we need to write our custom code are the two yellow boxes which are cloud functions that links are your tea core and pops up with fire sir so all the infrastructure will be managed and we are just writing some custom glue to fit the pieces together yes let me show you the code for this project we need to have IOT core setup you can find it in the console I have created a registry which is a grouping of IOT devices under it I have gateway devices where our simulated IOT device will be talking to the gateway device as you can see here I have my simulated device called lamp one bounded to the Gateway you can find the device by clicking on devices as well once the lab is connected then it will send events to IOT core every second an event update the event will be sent from IOT core to pops up and pops up triggers the event to cloud functions I also have another function applying changes from the user to the device let's look at the code I use the device ID as my reference for changes reading changes from fire store and eventually updating the device with the latest info now let's look at the firebase site I made a collection of devices with different states like on and off I also added the mode field for brightness of each lamp so now in cloud shall I run my code see what's happening in fire sir I have added my lamps so you can see the index is increasing while each one is sending their data to IOT core and fire store let's change the mode of the lamp assuming you have an app and change it through that but I'll change it mahir manually to soft the lab mode immediately changes to soft this change is real-time and quickly handled by fire store for you this is how you can be your own digital to in solution try the lamps well it's worked yes indeed try out IOT core and firebase for yourself and the link below and don't forget to subscribe for more great Google cloud platform content as simple as that not even a compile error no not even a compiler [Music]
