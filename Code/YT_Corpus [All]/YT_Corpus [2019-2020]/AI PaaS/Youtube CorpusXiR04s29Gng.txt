 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am pediatric physical therapist. I am here with my co-instructor. His name is Sebastian and he is 6 and a half years old. He has spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. Sebastian is a child who is...because of his strong extensor tone, he is usually not terribly happy with his orthotics on. So I know I am about to get lamblasted but we do not have orthotics on. I am sure I would not want to see the position of his ankles and feet but to be able to make sure we can weight bearing through the legs, we go ahead and do weight bearing through the legs in controlled places. We are on a trampoline. We are working on head control. So just like I did on an earlier video sitting, I do the same thing standing. Again a lot of times, these kids do not get enough movement. They tend to be placed places that are still. Kids crave movement. So I move with my kids. I have got him here standing and bouncing on the trampoline. What are you doing? Again, you do not have to have a trampoline to do this kind of activity. You can do it bouncing on a bed, assuming your bed is strong...that is kind of funny... assuming your bed is strong enough to hold you up. I would hate for you to go clomping to the floor. But it is one of the ways we work on weight-bearing through his hips. Dynamic weight-bearing is more important than static weight bearing. From here, if I get his legs a little wider I could do a lateral weight shift as well..or not. Side to side while I bounce. Anyway, I hope this is an idea for you to do at home for dynamic weight bearing in standing. I will look forward to seeing you next time. Thanks! Bye-bye!
