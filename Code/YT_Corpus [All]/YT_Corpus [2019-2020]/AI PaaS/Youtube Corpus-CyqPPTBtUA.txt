 [Music] hi and welcome to episode number 174 of the weekly Google cloud platform podcast I'm Oscar Hammer lee and i'm here with my colleague mark Mendell hey Mark hey how you doing I'm pretty good actually excited about this week's episode yeah I've been up since 5:00 a.m. Eastern and now I'm in San Francisco so I don't know what day it is but it's great I'm so sorry mark but I'm glad that you're out in community teaching folks awesome stuff about a goddess I do stuff it's cool so this week we have some pretty cool people coming to hang out with us we have Anne Wallace security practice lead and Michael woman TPM of cloud migrations both from the professional services organization or PSO so they're going to talk to us all about what the PSO team does here at Google cloud and how they help out customers and later we've got a question of the week about cloud build but first let's do the cool thing of the week [Applause] we have many cool things what if you go to Asia one of our co-workers Amy Unruh built an app that uses cloud vision to identify key features of images that are texted to it the link is going to be in the show notes and if you have lots of pictures of cats or pretty plants it will tell you all about them and it's confidence and it's identifying them it's a really cool example of how you can hook up some of our ML API is to your existing applications nice so as many people know I really love games so this is a specifically cloud but it was so awesome I just thought I'd mention it on the Google Blog cold want to change the game design your own with Google Play so the change the game program came out of Google Play last year teamed up with girls make games they're looking for teens that want to share their game idea and vision of the future of gaming basically for a chance to see their game come to life on Google Play the grand prize winner of the challenge will win $15,000 towards college scholarship and $15,000 for their school or community centers technology program which is really awesome there's a whole bunch of other stuff in there as well unfortunately it is us residents only but if you want to get involved or you know a teen that might want to get involved I will have a link in the show notes to apply that sounds awesome my other cool thing for this week is if you saw the developer keynote at next either in person or you watched one of the recordings or the live stream the game of life app that was demoed during that keynote is still up if you want to play with it and it's a game of life dev Oakland yeah it's really cool I didn't ever think of game of life as a team sport I was thought of it as a fun mathematical exercise but it's actually a lot of fun when there's five teams playing trying to out glider each other so folks wanna check it out it's still up there feel free to go try it and compete against your co-workers fantastic last but not least again I seem to be picking semi non cloud stuff this is a Google search thing but it was just too adorable to pass up I'm gonna read the first paragraph because it's fantastic it's not quite cat a day and we're a few months away from the dog days of summer but searches for pets never pause around the world people constantly ask Google questions about their furry friends so there's no time like the present for a good old fashioned oh my God look at that little face off uh-huh so it's basically an article talking about how people search for about dogs and cats and not only is an article discussing it they made a website called why do cats and dogs calm talking about all the trends that people ask about why do dogs do certain things or why do cats do certain things such as licking or eating or moving around or shakes or just weird sounds that they make my dog makes a little weird sounds so it's a lot of fun whether you're a cat person or a dog person I'm super excited about that because we all know you're a dog person but I am definitely a cat person and I'm sitting here according being supervised by one of my cats and my dog is fast asleep next to me snoring dogs are so much better behaved sometimes why don't we go have a chat with and and Michael oh and get the interview going so this week I am very excited to have two wonderful people come and join us we have Ann Wallace security practice lead and Michael woman TPM of cloud migrations joining us from the professional the services department for Google cloud how are you both doing today I'm good doing great awesome well thank you so much for joining us and coming to talk to us all about professional services and what it does before we do that George tell us a little bit about yourselves and what you do here at Google sure my name is Ann Wallace I'm based in the Portland office I am currently the global security practice lead for Google PSO or professional services the security practice is fairly new we spun off of the infrastructure practice about six months ago so I've been helping build that out within the Americas and globally prior to Google I spent 14 years at a major athletic company in Portland I had a wide roles in architecture and engineering and when I'm not working you can find me running very long distances on trails and in the mountains you run they're like ridiculously long distances yeah 50k is 50 miles my dog has run up to 30 miles with me I dog barely runs like if we hit a hill she's like it's hard no yeah I never German Shorthaired Pointer they are very energetic dogs Michael you want to tell us a little bit about yourself sure I run double ultra marathons because I have a rambunctious three-year-old long curly blond hair who we called the dude so I'm constantly chasing after him occasionally I'll chase after mountain lions in the Berkeley Hills for professional services I'm an infrastructure practice lead and you know infrastructure is kind of the catch-all practice compute storage networking containers app dev security but we're beginning to spin off these like sub practices and that's where kind of n came in and picked up security so outside of that I do big gnarly migrations from on-prem to cloud from other clouds to other clouds and yeah I'm cloudy yeah and actually you know Michael and I met it's probably six years ago outside of Google the company I was working for he helped us do our first cloud migration so then we just ended up at Google together yes and I remember debugging a custom pearl configuration management system it was amazing y'all said that you work for PSO what does PSO do I mean we help customers migrate applications and storage around we help them in essence move generally from on-prem to cloud right that's like our charter you know more recently it's been moving customers from clouds to other clouds and setting up kind of these hybrid environments and you can imagine the challenges with this I mean I think customers that are kind of maybe sitting in the San Francisco Bay Area that are more tech heavy have an easier job but you know we have to service all customers therefore you know we can fly out to the Midwest and service some customers there and you know it's different challenges so yeah I think in a nutshell that's what we do but I think there's a little bit more to that as well we work a lot you can think of us as post-sale versus the pre-sales where you have our customer engineers and solution architects but we also partner and very heavily with those teams and work on solutions around security data migration AI ml sort of things and we also getting a lot of customers who are wanting to figure out how to move their VM applications to containers so it's not just the traditional lifted shift kind of scenarios anymore also I speak at several conferences a year and we're at Google next the cloud summits and we work pretty closely with a lot of the themes I work very closely with a lot of the security PMS with a lot of input into the roadmaps for a lot of the services and GCP services just because of customer input to add to that like everything kind of starts with the customer right so the professional service org is like the one that touches the customer the most like we're there we're friends with the customer like I have dinner with the customer and then I help them design their next generation products so what is it a typical engagement with a customer actually look like where do they go like how does it get started and then like where does it go from there it starts with us scoping right starts with a dream you know specifically a GCP it starts with the dream of like I want to operate like Google okay right and it just starts there and then you kind of work backwards and like what does that mean it means like you know being flexible fast deployments you know able to iterate very quickly being secure so like it starts there and then we kind of work backwards and figure out like how do we actually make it a reality and so it's challenging right because I mean customers are running more monolithic applications right so they're older and you know now they want to run in containers and micro services and how to get the data up there etc etc but I wouldn't say there's really a typical type of engagement because every customer is so unique and brings different challenges to us and it's not always technical sometimes it's more organizational that we have to navigate through but you know sometimes the conversations start with us sometimes they start before us again working with maybe a solution architecture team or customer engineers and then we get pulled in when they went a little bit more than those teams can provide and it might just start with a conversation you know maybe you're at a conference and meet up with somebody and say hey we yeah we have these sort of things I still feel like it's pretty organic how a lot of these engagements start also with the packages I mean like and I think you're a hundred percent correct like we're constantly trying to generate reusable content right like these reusable packages but like we found it hard in the sense of that every customer is unique it's amazing like they're using different flavors of code and different flavors of os is in different network so I've been in cloud a long time and there are like Pat common patterns but it's amazing how many different combinations you see and when you're doing an engagement what sort of hands-on engagement are you having there I mean are you sitting down and building out architecture diagrams are you sitting next to your engineers and writing code or yeah I think it's a little bit of everything sometimes the engagements are short so with security we have just a security workshop so we'll go into a customer for around three days and do a lot of security deep dives into our services a lot of best practices kind of tutorials whiteboarding then we have customers who want more of the come in how to move this from the data center beams to containers in TCP and that might be coming up with a technical design document so it's writing out a lot of use cases and diagramming that but then there also might be that case where it's like hey this is great you've diagrammed all the source and delivered this technical design document but we really need help implementing that so then we might have another engagement where we do that we also leverage partners to help with some of this work so if there's a lot of hands on keyboard or they want more staff on we tend to instead of having Googlers set a company months on 10 we use partners to do that yeah I would say absolutely I mean Google has never traditionally been a consulting company like you don't think of Google as a consulting company so we're definitely partner heavy but we do try to mimic some of the success Google has had internally at our larger projects so for example we have a TPM that maps to a TL that maps to partner engineers and we try to explain those acronyms just for those who want Googlers Auto Show Technical Program Manager TL is the technical lead that's how we develop our products internally and so we've had a lot of success mimicking that model at some of our larger customers and then we're able to iterate faster everything is documented and we're you know status reporting well and another added kind of layer of complexity that we see is that we're not just GCP right we're G suite we're chrome we're Android so like that adds just another layer of I wouldn't say complexity but you know when they go all-in on Google it's like they get access to all these different things and it's kind of interesting how you can really transform a business not just from a technical staff but like from a peoples in process so that's something new that we've been working on as well so you guys are on the front lines you're hanging out with customers you're learning things you're helping folks any trends or changes that you're seeing that you find particularly interesting one of the trends we're seeing a lot is multi cloud so you have customers to have been an AWS or sure for a while but then they see things that we're doing that maybe the other cloud providers aren't doing they're just doing it differently so we're seeing customers coming to us or gke or I see customers come to us for all our ML technologies but then maybe they continue to use the other cloud providers for other things and I also I think really in the last year it's been a big uptick in gke or kubernetes a lot of companies now it's like if we're moving to the cloud we just want to move to containers we don't want to deal with VMs anymore again I can concur like being an old-school BSD person you know and as an infrastructure lead I mean infrastructure historically is compute network storage right and now you know they're beginning to abstract all that away into this like open source cloud I mean that's what ORS gets on says we're the open source cloud and therefore we're moving away from VMs and and this type of thing and we're going to containers gke sto service meshes and so the long term vision I believe of GCP is to be the open source cloud you can run your compute here you can move it on Prem can move data around so there's a lot more I guess a momentum to that direction I mean companies want to get there because they kind of don't want to be tied to a cloud provider right they want their freedom and I believe GCP is moving that direction right we're trying to just like open it up you want to use GCP great you want to run on Prem go right ahead that's great are you seeing any particular GCB products that are like super hot right now CSP and I wish I knew this is it and you know ironically you know Eric Brewer an old professor of mine is kind of leading the charge here it's just the open source cloud it's containers is tio and now we're extending it out in that you can extend kind of like the kubernetes language that's in llamó deployment language and now you can extend it out to further GCP services so now I can start defining pub subtopics and cloud sequel databases all within this kubernetes constructs so I'm super excited to see that happen and yeah and you seeing anything in particular with your customers I think what I'm seeing it's not so much hot services because I've been talking to customers who are really wanting security first I think the trend is really to get the security teams at the table from the beginning I think a year ago and six months ago we'd have customers who plan all these deployments for like we're ready to go to reduction and then all of a sudden they get a big red flag they're like no because the security teams weren't brought in from the beginning so I'm really seeing a passion from customers about getting the security folks to the table first and coming from a security background I'm very happy to see this and just making security part of the deployment pipeline baking security in from the beginning so they don't have to think about it later on absolutely I would say one more thing I'm seeing a lot is very large data migrations and I'm not talking about you know 10 terabytes or even 10 petabytes I'm talking a hundred plus petabytes and so the new challenges for the infrastructure team is how do I even move this data around right I know there are some products that you come in and plug a fiber in and you're supposed to you know close your eyes and pray that all the data gets copied but it's just much more than that right because you're applying security policies to the data you're encrypting it and this amount of data I think I did an analogy in a presentation saying we're moving so much data as some of our customers if you were to stack the hard drives up it would be higher than like three Golden Gate bridges or something like it's massive amounts of data and I think this is fairly new that I haven't experienced to date why are they doing that servers go end-of-life right I mean they're running these gigantic Hadoop clusters NetApp filers I mean they just go end-of-life and then now they're faced with how do I make use of this data like I need to obviously run MapReduce or parallel process it and so I think it's a combination of end-of-life and the new frontier of AI like they want to happen to google's AI for the data and the only way to do that obviously is to have the data in cloud but again it's like totally new challenges I mean you don't just are sync or FTP to data up you know given that you work so much with customers you mentioned previously that you work a lot with product managers as well is that sort of shaping product and providing feedback what does that internal stuff look like yeah so there's a lot of that so I work closely with a lot of the security PM so Andy Chang CJ Johnson Mya so it is giving feedback I must have been contributing to some of the PCI Work and compliance work we're doing and we also do sessions at next the cloud summits we lead internal and what we call Samia academies so it's leveling up a lot of the folks that are in the field so PSO the customer engineers solution architects on security so we do this a couple times a year bring a lot of the security PM's and other folks to talk about roadmaps what's going on on the field so we're all kind of on the same page and I've been helping build out some demos for the products that we have so again that's partnering with Sandy a lot so yeah there's a lot of exciting things going on but I really love the fact that were able to feedback into the products and give and put into what's being built I would say I have a love-hate relationship with product managers let me explain it I mean we mostly love each other but back to this you know when you're migrating 200 petabytes to a storage platform there's a lot of things to consider and so what we do is like as a TPM I'm basically negotiating between product management and the customer right and it's this constant on.you negotiation and like we drive product like for example the dual bucket GCS feature that I believe now is in beta came from a customer saying okay I'm gonna have you know my hundred petabytes in u.s. East won and if I have a regional outage and I have a security event I mean to go through this data like what am I supposed to do so there's this new dual region bucket that came out of that requirement another example is the customer said okay I want to process this hundred petabytes in like 20 minutes right and you do the math and it's like you know I need 20 terabytes a second of throughput that's like completely outrageous so you know I was able to like work with the security team and the customer to kind of like back that down to something like reasonable so that's where the love hey I mean they love me when I'm negotiating with the customer and basically saving the platform but they hate me when I'm demanding new features right but this is ongoing any big customer it's exciting right product managers always want to partner with that PSL people yeah but those features sound amazing and it's so cool that they're driven by really use cases that we're running into that and solving problems for people that are on our platform that's awesome absolutely I mean like if you were to tell me I could have like petabytes and petabytes of data asynchronously copied to two locations at the same time like I don't know how they do it well I do know how they do it but we have we have big pipes yeah it's pretty amazing very big pipes and lots of magic rpms they're super busy they are always very eager to speak to customers and present to customers I'm in awe sometimes how they get everything done that they do just to add on I mean the platform is changing so rapidly that literally my full-time job should just be like monitoring new beta features I try to set up an RSS feed but that didn't really work you know like I'm trying to figure out like a good way to digest all this information so if any users out there I have a good method of doing this I hear this podcast is really good for that yes listening to podcasts like you know like 24 hours a day know if you ran 30 miles you can listen to podcasts so we've heard about some of the cool and challenging problems you've run into any others you want to share with us because I know everyone loves hearing about all the other cool problems that other people have I'll even speak for an on this one like you're getting Oh No yeah getting ready to roll to production like you're ready to click the button and just say go and then the seaso walks ins is like what's going on right and you're like oh I'm migrating like all our infrastructure to cloud and then he puts a kibosh on the whole thing because like obviously it hasn't gone through the proper like security reviews and audits and compliance and I mean you know that's a true story and that's a true story over and over again but I think now that we have the security practice and some of our our sales teams and our technical account managers know that they're trying to get security at the table to begin with and so we have unblocked a couple of these scenarios just by having security folks in the room and regardless of the security folks were part of the infrastructure team two months ago but because they have that security title it's helped and again it's just trying to automate security into the work flow to begin with having it almost seamless and you see you don't have to think about it actually yeah you say automating security of any particular tools or products that you really liked for doing that kind of stuff what I like right now and I always end up saying this incorrectly but for containers is using your face and krita's for signing using that with binary authorization so you can set policies to check for multiple different things but you know for different vulnerabilities vulnerability scores if they're high or medium or so forth and if those are found then the kree discussant sign the container image and if you go and try to deploy it it gets stopped so I think that's pretty neat tool that we have out there right now so binary authorization is in GCP and graffia s-- and kritis and again i'm sorry if i said that correctly we'll put links in the show notes we'll work it out open source projects we have you have your technical issues and I think probably more importantly you have your people issues and like it's generally a people issues that kind of like provide like the roadblock right and so in larger migrations you're like navigating emotions you know like I'm almost a psychiatrist at these projects right like I'm coaching them about like their cloud migration and coaching them about like how to retrain their org and it's a lot of pressure right you have to retrain people maybe some people might lose their jobs as a result of some of the migrations so there's a lot of people aspects to our job I've got a challenging one they've got an architecture diagram from miles ward miles wart hands them something beautiful it's amazing it's AI it's automated it's dr like you know half the world can get hit by a meteor and this thing would still run you know it's like they get handed this and they're like yes i want it then you go in there and they're running like windows 95 right so that can be challenging they know what they want they want the big picture and the the beautiful googliness and then you know it's it's just kind of hard to get them there and so reality can be tough sometimes but we're there to iterate them and like kind of help them out right so first of all hi miles second of all how do you step people through that like how do you how do you take someone from from somewhere where they're in a less modern architecture and bring them up to speed and what may native or whatever the the buzzword is right now we're working on a partner package well a package that basically takes them the first step to container so you can run a container an orchestration system like kubernetes ray and orchestrates you know multiple containers and load balances and does all that fun stuff but you can also run a container in a one-to-one mapping to actual VM so like I'm working on a package that says okay I'm going to take your VM and containerize it which gets you then you can use the tools that Ann mentioned to kind of do the security and get it in a registrar and then you're going to deploy these containers on a one-to-one mapping to GCE so now your container rise but you're still kind of running on a lift and ship mode so that's like a initial step and then security comes in and you get all the features you know like gob for example offers I believe it has like DDoS and other things like that and actually I have something that's a little interesting I don't know if it's an interesting problem that we've solved but I think it's something different that PSO does and maybe other cloud professional services organizations and just slipped my mind because I've been so focused on security but when I started at Google I was helping build out CRE offerings with PSO so I think you've had some of the CRE folks on the podcast before and so CRE just for folks who might not have heard that is customer reliability engineers so they are some of our site reliability engineers who are customer facing and work with some of our larger customers on building out asari practices within their org the CRE team is small and just overbooked so they were looking to see how they could grow this so they've partnered with PSO so we're starting to offer CRE off rain so some of this is just going in and doing kind of basic SRA 101 but then we also have SLO SLI workshops so this is you know taking a customer's application and running through what it might look like to set error budgets and your SLO s and s allies so the little bit I got to work on that six or so months ago was really exciting but it's starting to kick off now so there's a few folks within PSO who are driving that so I'm really excited to see where that that goes just to follow up there I can't believe I forgot the sorry portion of all this you know I partnered with Liz Fong Jones one of my favorite people on earth it's actually like a new construct so I came from another large cloud vendor and we'd lift and shift and we'd lift and transform but we never talked about operations right and so again this is coming with the whole I want to run like Google so you can lift and shift the monolith and actually apply you know sre principles to these monolith applications so we're doing that as well so we're trying to kind of embed this during the transition you know it's just a whole lot of fun you know when you start talking about error budgets and you know how many nines you know you know the customer asks for five nines but the application they have is two 9s it's like it opens up for some interesting conversations so if people want to get involved with all this awesome work you're doing in PSO where do they go they visit us at Google next or you know they talked to their GCP counterparts the CEO or the sales team the Technical Account Managers like you know we're all tied together like one Google right so you know we're like a large hashmap cloud.google.com I think you can find us on there we have tons of job openings I think you could just look for cloud consultant it'll come up with things in infrastructure app dev Security ml so it sounds like if people want to get in contact with you best ways through their account rep or their sales contact if they want to get into contact with PSO yeah I can tell you how to personally get in contact with me but you yeah you can save me an email but like I'm you know have thousands and thousands of emails unread at this point but we are running out of time unfortunately is there anything you both want to mention are you doing anything special for next or something that you want to make sure people know about anything along those kind of lines before we finish up today yeah I will be it next I'm not speaking this year I'm just gonna be hanging out talking about security right after next on this April 13th is a women who code Connect summit so I'll be speaking there that is also in San Francisco and the cube con EU speakers just got announced so I'm gonna be speaking with Maya and we are going to be speaking about container forensics when your cluster becomes a cluster that sounds cool can I go where is it Barcelona oh yeah yeah I will be attending that well thank you so much to you both for joining us here on the podcast we really appreciate you taking the time thanks a lot thanks for having us bye thanks so much to N and Michael coming to hang out with us it's always really interesting to hear about team's internal to Google how they help customers and how they help support them so super happy to have them on yeah that was a great chance to talk and learn about something that I didn't actually know much about yet but now it is time for a question of the week and our question this week has to do with cloudbuilt and the question is how do you cache files between builds and cloud build which is something that a lot of folks want to do to speed up their builds and or because they've got interesting pipelines that they're trying to build where they have lots of different dependencies so mark what is the answer to this question I had exactly this problem basically I had a file-based case that I wanted to store some records in and just persist it between builds to make things a bit faster you know I was like okay clearly I have Google Cloud storage I can push stuff up and down but like what if it's not there what if it is I don't want to write all this code so I went hunting through the repository which is the cloud builders community repository under Google cloud platform which has a bunch of Google Cloud builder steps these are custom build steps that you can use yourself inside cloud build that do some kind of fancy things and there's a whole bunch of them I'm not gonna go through them all but one of them that stands out and one that I really like is there is a case build step or a cache depending on with your Australian or American and what it has it has a safe cache and a restore cache functionality so it will take basically any path that you like and check it in Google Cloud storage you can have keys you can have your own keys if you want you can tell what bucket you want to put into it'll even do checksumming of a particular file so if you want the case to be stored with the checksum of a file and you want it to change with the file change it's all kind of baked in and just works so if you're looking for that we'll put a link in the show notes but it's super handy just put it in it's just where it was great yeah and that whole community all those community supplied buildings are really great because oftentimes the problems we have a problem someone else has already solved and we're really grateful the community for the ones that they've contributed so even if caching isn't your problem you should totally go check out the community builders repository on github and see what other folks have built awesome well before we wrap up what are you doing where are you going do anything cool I'm not doing anything cool I am taking a break from travel and events to focus on family and my career and a bunch of other you know really boring stuff awesome good for you so I'm gonna be online if people want to see what I met too they can totally check out my blog at psycho miser comm or they can follow me on Twitter I am duh underscore ithaca miser and for those who don't know if AGGA miser is the spiky part at the end of a Stegosaurus I've got blog posts that are written and going to be released in the next couple weeks on doing coding assessments and interviews this what we can do instead whiteboards because there's been a bunch of tweets recently about whiteboards being awful and then I'm getting I have a horrible project idea that I'm going to use with Ruby and GCP and cloud storage and probably some of the ML API is that I hope to have a blog post about in the next couple weeks that folks can check out especially all of my Ruby friends and new versions of Ruby was just released Ruby Hagee and I'm gonna check out pattern matching has been added as a potential future I'm gonna check that out because I love me some pattern matching so Betsy if you curious about my thoughts on any of those things follow me online see how about you mark where are you gonna be going what are you gonna be up to yeah so in what two three weeks I will be a Google i/o I'll be doing the presentation there about open match in taganas working together games on top of guru Nettie's and open source unsurprisingly I'll mention something that's a little bit further in the future as well in August there is an open sourcing gaming day so people may be familiar with the open source North America summit under the Linux Foundation we've been working with them and some other people looking to advocate for more open source in the games industry so we're gonna have a day that's August 20th it's co-located with the event so it's gonna be the day before so if you are interested in attending we'll have details in the show notes but if you have any particular open source stories around anything pretty much to do with gaming there is a call for papers open as well till May 4th I believe that dates correct I will also have the link in the show notes as well so that'll be fun that's coming up in August that sounds awesome cool well as yeah I think that wraps things up yeah so thank you all for listening we'll have another awesome episode for you next week see you all next week [Music]
