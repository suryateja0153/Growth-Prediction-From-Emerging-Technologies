 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Myla. Myla and I are teaching activities for children who have low tone. I just wanted to show where she is right now with her walking. We tried on the treadmill earlier in a previous video. That was tricky. But on the floor, she can take steps with not a lot of weight on her legs...but actually better than a couple of months ago. You ready sweet pea? Let's show them what you got. We have to go walk, walk, walk, big steps, big steps, big steps, big steps, big steps, big steps, big. So before she was a lot more flexed. She was more bent forward, and her legs are a little bit more underneath her than she was before. And this is progress. I want to be able to get her so that her legs are straight underneath her...good girl... and take weight through her legs. So this is definite progress. Hi! Is it working better when it goes toward Mama? Whoop! Here we go. Go to mama? Good girl. Let's go. I know. I know. Okay. Anyway. Thanks a lot! It's a simple idea to work on...oh sorry... it's a simple idea to work on weight-bearing through the legs and more to document where she is right now with her walking. Thanks a lo!t I will see you later!
