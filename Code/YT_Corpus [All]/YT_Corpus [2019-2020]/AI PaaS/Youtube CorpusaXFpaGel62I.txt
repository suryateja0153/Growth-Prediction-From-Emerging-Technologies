 from the cube studios in Palo Alto in Boston connecting with thought leaders all around the world this is a cube conversation hi I'm Stu minimun and welcome to a cube conversation always love when we can dig into practitioner discussions and one of the editorial themes I've been really looking into in 2020 has been discussion server lists so really excited to welcome to the program Dave Anderson he is director of technology at Liberty Mutual coming to me from Ireland they thanks so much for joining us thank you tonight it to be here all right so I think most our audience is probably familiar with Liberty Mutual you work in in the software group Liberty I see as part of Liberty middle if you could just start us off give us a little bit about your background and you know your groups role inside the organization your Liberty IT or self at 20 years ago is really as a sort of internal software hoist part of the Liberty Mutual Group we're part of Liberty Mutual technology so you can work across all the markets and there be mutual and all the kind of global locations my rule is kind of tractor technology you really think about you know what's the technical direction of Liberty IT I can lead the architects with my group I'm really thinking about you know a global architecture of Liberty Mutual on how can we provide business value and deliberation going forward excellent so Dave I guess what is that just couldn't overall you know business and IT relationship when I think of companies like yours you know usually they're you know M&A comes in they're their growth expansions and you know digital transformation has been one of those buzzword discussions but absolutely you need to be close to your customer there's lots of services that you need to provide online you know how are some of those overall dynamic impacting how IT is supporting the business that's a great question shoot I mean technology has always been the key differentiator delivery Mutual even as my group was set up like I said 20 years ago it was always seen as it's a differentiator as something that we kind of be very good at we've always been quite close to be in the cotton age of technology many companies would say you know were not an insurance company or a technology company sells insurance we are an insurance company and in a very you know that's very important but we also need the understand how using the latest technology ie the Cloyd providers really helps us deliver value we are our business partners customers do we it's critically we have a very tight partnership with our with our business partner excellent so yeah 20 years you know a lot has changed that I'm gives a little bit if you can you know sheriff snapshot of where you are kind of in the cloud discussion and you know what are the relationships between kind of the the infrastructure side of the team and the development side of the team and expecting that'll lead us towards the Cerberus discussion sure I mean I I joined Liberty about 12 years ago 13 years ago and I actually started in order that they total channels designing systems with digital channels and it probably almost 10 years ago our CIO James McClaren quite visionary 30 kind of pressing the the public cloud agenda and sorry we started discussing public sliders as a potential future and it was a really exciting time because I think the infrastructure development we all are the boss what's the what's the possibilities of public lloyd and as you know the Cloyd itself it probably changes every year it's redefined there's new capabilities I'm not sure we could a disease where we are today back when we started that conversation like every large enterprise initial conversations around you know how do we enable this how do we make the sale or we act our data all the usual inner questions you would have but you know we cannot really join together at the various different departments we thought well how do we how do we move in the enterprise forward and as well being rural and global capability for for it was very important and as bringing up in the velocity that we can deliver value quickly to our business partners but we kind of we didn't do it for technology sick with ility can't drive it real value for the business and all of the really interesting things that we talked about is we we shied away from counting how many virtual machines do we have an exploit that wasn't really a good metric for us why are we delivering value to your business partners that was a kind of the metric that we continued the gist well that's excellent how how you kind of laid that out I'm wondering if you could help extend that and bring us into you know where serverless fit into that discussion I loved how you say you know it's not about you know number of VMs or you know the the new shiny thing so you know what was it that led your first use of server lists and you know bring us a little bit along that that journey that you've been going through one of the things that I've always find critical working in technology is that curiosity in a search for what's next so within my group I always charge or you know white people to say like you know where do we need to get to what is three to five years old and we have a lot of really fantastic ears right across Liberty Mutual right open-minded they you know they can think ahead so one of my team was that I think was reinvents in 2013 or the launch lambda for 2014 and he came back we do it excited they built their first small application that was actually a document generation I think they were using some proprietary system so they built the document generation solution and couldn't believe the amount of in a room cost that was saved it probably knocked home taken 94 seven percent off doctor cost couldn't believe it and we see we started think wow this is potential the back then you know again five years ago the stack was very immature was a lot of things you needed the figure I like their observability the developer environment you know there's a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't quite right so it's something that we we share through our peers across the organization we talked about its we you know we really started to kind of think well this is interesting this idea of fairness or a managed service it started to really change how we thought and it really started to make the concept of a cloud native application very real as we start to think of it Cloyd native architecture learn native application architecture and that's thirdly really flipped I we sought so it's just been a real journey as past couple years and the big thing for me is what we started engineers thinking of Claude as a mindset not necessarily as a platform that opened the door to a lot of possibilities yeah it's really interesting that you said that you know oftentimes we say you know cloud is an operational model you know not a physical location are you using multiple clouds today yes we were you probably would brendi have a multi cloud strategy and and really I mean they're very clear starless for us it's not just function as a service it's not like saying well we're just using Kenny something like lambda it's really about that idea using managed service I'm thinking of an evolution or architecture how can we can have you know Brian corrode anything that is effectively not differentiating there's a great term which I always like is the the stack policy it sometimes as technology companies we get obsessed by the stack and we think that the the piece near the customer this is quite easy I think from a technology perspective we need to think about we can deliver the most value and making the customer experience in a vast and then can maybe even rent a stack from from the other meet that need yeah no it's really it's a fascinating discussion I've seen even today it's you know what is you know you say server list functions as a service a lot of it is I don't want the developer to have to think about those underlying layers which reminds me of the discussion we've been having about platform as a service for more than a decade but has was supposed to be you know platform independent so I could have my code wherever it goes server list today you know right now I mean you talked about lambda Amazon there's certain things that I can only do on Amazon there are discussions and working groups and the cloud native computing foundation working at how we can do you know server list of functions is service that could span between multiple clouds or use the same sort of code so how do you look at that space you know you talk about you know cloud native how do you make sure that you're leveraging the technologies of the specific cloud but you know I guess I'll throw out not being locked into you know and any one provider I think about it for me it starts with the empowerment of the engineering team we talk about servants first strategy that means that you've got to good to capability you build anything you need food but your rent where you can we had a fascinating story one of our - the race is complete call or area called work grid work grid software has all the companies that we spotlight of Liberty Mutual that was a project we had an internal digital assistant that we built with some of our teams be back for five years ago and our CEO Jim decline and they said the phone as you cannot start up they broke off around three years ago and that initial in at four people another engineering team so they kind of decided that they would be service first in their approach they didn't have time to think about it operate ability or you know rights / portability hey how do you realize business by you really quickly so every I knew they took an evolutionary architecture approach which master kept incremental and iterating deliver and value were possible like what's the next best thing they can build the deliver value for the customer can you think in that regard if you ever come to an Amazon of a great with no one-way door for two way to work lock yourself in the anything make decisions is you can always build upon there was that kind of you know constant iterative work of our teams and that's cerebral is first prodigy it means that when you do rent a service if you need to change to another service it's just a matter of you know if you've got your boundary set up correctly it's fairly easy to get out of that you dig yourself in deeper something that's a difference so I think there's an engineering mindset and culture but would but we certainly have brought us in our teams that's in a go-fast focus on business value and kind of you know try and be sort of cloud native in the right look excellent yeah that I just heard Andy jassie in the AWS summit online you know talking about those one-way per your weight so sounds like from your standpoint serverless said who weighed or from for architecting in your mindset absolutely and I mean I think it's really for me it's it brings architecture back into the team there's one of the really nice things is if your team or you know you using many services that focuses on business value if our infrastructure asset support that type of team they need minimal hand officers in the team if a single team it's their job to you know create value engineer the solution make sure the security is good enough through the operations the visibility it's all contained within one team we get a huge responsibility from that one team as an engineer that is super powerful super huge autonomy so we can talk with the service engineer and for me it's been absolutely fascinating to see teams come into this environment and once they understand you know that event-driven way of creating their systems and I use the word systems rolling applications the create event driven systems the constantly in the building of all it's just fascinating to see where they go it's you start to see the creativity and innovation summit of Engineers so it's it it's it's truly oh it's unbelievable do I really right though yeah Dave I'm curious when you look at the application portfolio that your images how do you decide what goes server list is it you know new development all go server lists if there been a migration you know how do you look at the overall application portfolio that you have well it can't depends I suppose on I mean I'm not going to sit here and say that we're going to refactor everything the server list you know I think when you do migration you have your you know you're usually six or seven paths you can go down and you do what's what's best for the business but for new development that's definitely interesting we haven't find many use cases that are really about fit it's a spectrum we may decide you know what different servers do you use we built a system last year which was absolutely fascinated to see it's like a financial you know aggregation system where we do a lot of our accounting so it was a kind of I call service ETL we're trying to run like a end of month by system you take a lot of coins from different countries and kind of pipe them into a can a general ledger not something I would have thought about for service to be honest but then when you think about it and some of our engineering needs as they put this together we can design this fantastic system using service workflows because you're taking lots of various different types of data orchestrating them in this single destination and we would live without this year and I think one of the Montanans that they recently around I think they're on something like 100 million transaction cost and relatively low cost and of course being a month and sister the rest of the month there's zero cost you don't pay for Idol we only actually pay for while it's running and that montane process or maybe you know yours or something you know Devi you talked about the in the early days 2014 when lambda was an out reinvent when you first started using in the first year so there's the maturity of that that ego system solution set where do you see things now you know what's working well what's on your wish list kind of mature or increase overall functionality to help I think the developer environment and developer experience that is a big part one of the key messages in trying to kind of get into the the ndr culture is a code as a liability it's not NASA if you have a bunch of engineers writing lots of code that effectively is a liability there's no business asset and the asset is in the system that you create they're trying to get engineers into the mindset the right last code and they actually engineer systems you know so one of the things that we've been trying to do is maybe using patterns as building blocks people in the kind of like a lego building block way of creating their systems it reasons some things like cdk4 development kit patterns using the world attack the process they make sure that teams are looking after their their course to secure their performance or reliability and there are kind of optimizations it's so it's it's some of those things are really important but in that whole ownership of you know operational view of their systems and also even things like observability when you when you create a system with a lot of advanced planner on our skit in conflict but then you can can if you do that correctly you can start to layer on more what what theater insights gonna be built on top of the system so it's really opening up aims a different way of working and then of course there's lots of operational challenges when you get into more complex environments so as we are say it's it's not easier different build the fickle people these systems but it's different I suppose there's none easier the better all right how about anything that you're looking out towards the future you talked about you know the early days when you you know look at these and while you're not necessarily you know throwing the latest shiny thing into production there's that that curiosity so what's exciting you now anything else kind of looking forward I think I mean one of the most fantastic success stories we've had is with a project we called virtual assistant and really that's your question it's about proteins can properly work at MVP so one of the things that we really find fascinating is when you put a good engineering team and I mean a team who you're really solid engineers we then layer on the cloud and security best practices in certification we then put them in a ported service environment what's the real business problem they then create an MVP your virtual assistant in prison MVP or they would arc the see if you call into the call center and you've a fairly straightforward request like a you know if you have an auto claim you might say well when can I pick up my rounds oh you're ready join your game we have an NLP and that's a language assistant that can help you with that conversation so when you start the MVP systems like that you can start them off with a fairly small traffic until you actually tune that until it's it's gonna perfect and then you gradually scale up and add on other you know data-driven potential AI services you know integration through that so I think we when you start detect an MVP approach and have a very very no solution deal with that's like an in the wild and then start to scale out I mean we scaled on system taking movies 30 calls you maybe taking a quarter on your calls oh it's it's it's fantastic how you start to scale these systems up well I think what I'm really looking for is more kind of support you see how we can you know it's it's the art of the possible how can we use this this bill set and the service mindset you create really fascinating you know you know business applications because when you get under that that kind of creative conversation with business partners I mean they don't want to hear what lambda or events or observability they want to say well what can I do with AI what they do before what can I do with vision we start to open up really fantastic you know conversations like that so I so I think that's what I'd like to see more of that in a creative part development excellent well yet Dave so important that you brought back as to how you know I in the business working together it's it's not about you know the technical you know widgets the knobs or anything but you know the services and the value that ultimately you can write for the business and you know the impact that has on your ultimate end customer all right Dave thanks so much real pleasure having a chat with you thanks she really appreciated thank you all right be sure to check out the cube net lots of backgrounds if you go hit the cert you can actually type server list find out more about what we've been covering as well as what events we will get in the future I'm Stu Mittleman thank you for watching the Q [Music]
