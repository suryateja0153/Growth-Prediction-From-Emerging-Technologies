 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Charis. Charis is seven and a half months old. She is sitting but not figuring out how to....she is figuring out how to belly crawl...but not crawling yet. So we are just working on being on our knees and propping on at least one hand.   Let's try the other. There you go. There's a start practicing kneel position and weight bearing through the hands in a fairly easy position. I am blocking her hips with my thigh. Oh heavens! So, it is a way to work on kneel. Oh, Oh, there. Goodness a way to work on kneel that is fairly easy to do at home. Thanks a lot and I will see you next time. Bye-bye!
