 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am here with Sebastian and his mother, Nikki. We are... yes... you are both of my co-instructors. Sebastian is six and a half years old and he has spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. One of the things we are working on is sit to stand with control. I am going to try to get him sitting so when a child is extending and you are trying to flex them/bend them, one of the things I do is start at the head. If I get the head... if I can get the head to bend forward, I have a better shot of everything else. What? What? What? We are going down. We have to sit down first. Thank you. I mean we have to sit down first. Alright, so we are sitting. If you will hold that out in front of us, we are going to stand up and you can get it, Sebastian. A little bit lower, Get it! Way to go Sebastian! So that is how that activity works. We are going to do it one more time. Got to sit down Sebastian. The hardest part is the sitting down. Sebastian, we are going to sit down. Nice job. Nice job. All right, Sebastian. If you hold it out in front of us. Stand up Sebastian and knock it down, my friend. Excellent, Sebastian. Excellent work! I hope that is an idea that you can use at home. It does seem to work best if I am  behind him to be able to support him and let somebody hold something up in front of him. One of the things you heard me say was "Not too high" because the higher the ball was, the more he is going to hyperextend to try to get it. A little bit lower means that he can reach it without having to go into that full extensor pattern. I hope that is helpful and I will see you next time. Thanks, bye!
