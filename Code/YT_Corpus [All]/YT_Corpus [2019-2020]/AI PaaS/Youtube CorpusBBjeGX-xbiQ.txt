 the popularity of cloud computing has led to an increasingly diverse set of cloud technologies which in turn has led to some confusion around important cloud paradigms specifically public and private cloud technologies and how they intersect in the form of hybrid cloud and multi cloud models a public cloud is a set of services and resources that offers a complete virtual infrastructure available on demand and paid for based on actual usage a user creates an account with a public cloud providers such as AWS or Microsoft or Google and then deploys those cloud services and resources as needed to handle computing tasks you can run a few basic instances or you can architect a highly scalable and comprehensive enterprise computing environment organizations use private clouds to deploy services and resources within their own data centers the business owns the environment which is typically used by a relatively small number of employees and customers and provides limited services and scalability in theory private clouds offer the DIY conveniences of a public cloud while still enabling the business to maintain direct control over the infrastructure a hybrid cloud is basically a connection between a public cloud and a private cloud ideally a business could use a hybrid cloud model to support seamless workload migrations between private and public cloud environments a workload might also run redundantly in both environments for greater resiliency or components running in each environment could interoperate ultimately a hybrid cloud offers more flexibility and more control than either a public or private cloud could do alone a hybrid cloud is usually associated with cloud bursting moving resources from the private cloud to the public cloud when demand exceeds on-premises capacity the cloudbursting is uncommon in practice private and public clouds can and do work together but they're rarely in apples-to-apples match which makes cloud bursting technically challenging ideally a multi cloud environment incorporates services from two or more public cloud providers public clouds can have similar capabilities but they're not necessarily equal so there are advantages to being able to pick and choose across providers first different business units have different IT needs for example Google cloud is recognized for its AI services so data scientists might turn their for machine learning projects at the same time AWS offers a mature and diverse set of infrastructure services such as DNS routing caching and load balancers pretty much everything developers might need in order to deploy a complex enterprise application in the public cloud the idea here is that a business can use almost any public cloud services to support its own specific goals second organizations want to avoid vendor lock-in in theory an organization builds its cloud environment in a way that enables straightforward workload portability should it ever decide to switch providers in practice this goal is rarely enough to justify a formal multi cloud strategy because public clouds are not interchangeable differences in resources services api's and other components make it difficult to migrate complex applications without some amount of reaaahhr tactic finally a multi cloud environment typically involves two or more public cloud providers notice we didn't include private clouds that is connecting a private cloud to a public cloud doesn't make it a multi cloud as we're defining it however almost any multi-cloud strategy will likely still involve some amount of on-premise physical virtual and even private cloud infrastructure just remember that none of these scenarios are either/or choices to learn more about cloud computing be sure to visit www.kingston.com/support for
