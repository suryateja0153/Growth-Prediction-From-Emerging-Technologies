 Hi everybody a sub summit from Aguada co-founder Sorry, I'm moving too much A few words about the company before I jump into the details we've been around for four years the founding team are members from companies like Mellanox Voltaire extreme mayo and xiv all Successful exits in the Israeli scene all related to data and we'll see how we use it at iguazu We have employees across Across The u.s Asia, where we have offices in new york in singapore and recently also, we started working out of the UK Most of us are still here in israel and in total. We're about 80 of us on the investment side We had two rounds of funding first one was 15 terms. The second one was 33 top receipts from Israel and strategic investors as you can see verizon samsung Bosh the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Dell all of them are heavy users of data all of them are trying to innovate in the a Using AI to actually we've heard it in the previous session There's so much data, but how do you actually turn it into business? how do you apply AI on all this data that you gather in real time or the historical data that you have and turn it into real result in business and There are so many Types of ideas and and solutions and people that are coming with new Ideas around AI applications data size machine learning deep learning Everything looks great when the stuff is done at the lab So but then we see a big a big difference when this has to actually go into production Turn the business brings America the dance at the end of the day people are doing this to make more business For their businesses rather than just for the fun of it This is a recent study. That was done at Google They looked at you know, when you have a new data science project a new AI Application that people are building. This is how they envision that there will be actually spending their time on that application. They hire Expensive data scientists if they've managed to find them and then they expect that blue part to be the majority of their time But then reality kicks in and this is what they do. Actually they spend most of their time on the Boring part on the overhead part on actually bringing the data enriching the data combining cross correlating Building the infrastructure around it And then that tiny part that is left for the real AR part for the real training the machine learning developing the model is a big waste that we see right now in the market the bottom line there is that 70% of AI projects are failing by the time, you know you you're in the lab. You see great result You see kind of the seeds of what could be a great outcome for the business But but the time you get to the finish line You actually see that the project actually was a waste of time and no results are brought to the business. We try to analyze Why is it so and then we went into the world of? an application the entire lifecycle of building an application from the seed from the initial idea all the way to Bringing it to production and you see so many stages so many I mean in some cases we hear customers telling us we're back to the 80s because there's so many processes It applies to different jurisdictions And disciplines within the application development stage at the end of the day this process is actually what hurting most companies that are trying to implement AI in their businesses and then comes iguazu and we have built the company in a way that actually takes the those AI models those AI ideas and through the lab stage all the way to production in a way that is simplified in a way that is Automatic easy to develop easy to deploy and bring results in production This is our platform our data science platform that actually it relies on special sauce. We're Three elements that we have within the platform one Special sauce is around a very powerful data engine that is in the heart of the platform Combined with the server list framework that we develop and it's part of the open source community called nucleo and all of that is packaged together with very Popular data science and analytics tools that are comprised together the GWACs your data science platform So essentially you just place a platform Connect your data sources and from that moment on your developers Your data scientists are spending their time on the business logic rather than the boring Infrastructure that is needed for those applications at the end of the day customers with our platform are delivering predictive analytics to their businesses Predictions around recommendation engines for purchases matching products. We work in the telco spaces I'll show you some examples Banks small customers big customers and all of them benefit from developing applications faster Delivering models that are much more accurate when it comes at the end of the day when you build a model you want the prediction To be correct you want those alerts to be correct without all those false positives so when you work efficiently you can actually get to that and the quality of platform Normally gets deployed in the cloud, but we see today a lot a big move that is going towards Deploying such applications at the edge closer to the data sources in many different markets will touch that too A great example is a global telco that we work with that have been doing the same for years. They've been connecting all their devices across the network and they have all those monitoring tools and once they had any kind of problems or Outages in certain areas, they had all those red lights flashing and they had to scramble and fix a problem They realized that with AI that can actually change the way they were working and become more proactive and using predictive algorithms Find those outages before identify the problem before it actually becomes an outage they try to do it and You know the classic way that people are doing right now in the market using their duplicate system tools That were working on it for six months and failed miserably Started working with Iguazu and within weeks they managed to develop a platform that actually delivers those predictions So instead of seeing those red lights and outages now they can actually predict a problem in the network using AI also they can actually Identify the root cause all of them is done automatically and the last stage of applying the fix is also triggered through all of these change of of events and Eventually problems are fixed before they actually become real problems within the network This is for me actually taking AI applying it to businesses and getting their ROI from such application another recent Announcement we had was with Samson Samson became a new investor For Iguazu, but also we worked with them very closely in the field. And this was an application. That was built for real-time recommendations applying real deep learning on that application This is a benchmark that was done in Amazon with and without iguazu and you can see that the amount of transaction meaning the scale of this application to being be able to actually handle recommendations for thousands of customers rather than a few Is being achieved using whadya rather than just taking and deploying it on the infrastructure as it comes from Amazon as is with iguazu it's actually four times faster and more handling more customers at the same time I mentioned the edge before so building these applications in the cloud is great and we see most of the market going there, but More and more we hear about edge Wars Where the cloud? Companies are now picking the next battle between them This is exactly what is happening right now? If you think about factories that are analyzing their data They can just move their entire data set that are generating by all the sensors to the cloud The cloud vendors are realizing that now that some of those decisions some of those Data handling operations. Some of the influencing has to happen closer to the sources at those factories add those Regional data centers. Were you collecting data from moving vehicles? Not everything can happen in the cloud and this is where we've been partnering with The cloud vendors on such deployment a big market in this space is the retail market right now we see Not just the Walmarts of the world moving more intelligence into the branches We see it happening very competitive market happening across The large medium and even a small change that are moving intelligence there But then how do you build applications in an efficient way a simple way where you know? You can't actually have IT people in the branches. So this is where we collaborate very closely with the cloud vendors in using our technology both in the cloud and at the edge So with that, these are our top partners We're working. I mentioned the top cloud vendors samsung Equinix. Nvidia That is a key ingredient in any a application these days We're also our proud donor for tomorrow. I think some they're doing great work for the community and that's our way to give back and That's it from a quasi. Oh, thank you very much
