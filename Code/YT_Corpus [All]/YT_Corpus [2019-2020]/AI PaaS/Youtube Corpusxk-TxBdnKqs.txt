 [Music] thank you for coming along to our talk on using AI to transform fleet operations my name is Mubeen dim and I work in a Hitachi consulting within the strategy and innovation team hi Mandy Lamont I working over at digital transformation practice in the UK so today we're here to talk to you about Hitachi's predictive maintenance platform for fleet operations just to give you a bit of an overview of how this session is going to be structured it's gonna be similar to everywhere you've been already we're gonna essentially tell you why we've done what we've done over the past three or four months so giving you some information around the industry issues we're trying to tackle from the fleet open up from from a fleet management perspective we're gonna spend some time showing you how we've done what we've done by taking you through the architecture and taking you through some of those challenges and design decisions we've made and then we're gonna show you because I think that's the most important part right you want to see what we've done and we'll give you a demonstration of how we've applied this with one of our clients as well the key thing I think all of you are probably wondering is why do we have Lego and this let's address that elephant in the room you've probably walked around the conference rooms and seen the Lego at the booth and I think more people have been fascinated by the Lego than anything else essentially it's a whole lot easier to bring one of those from the UK than bringing an actual vehicle so we've got this to support one of our use cases around a are guided inspections and we'll give you a lot more information about that as we go through this session if we could hold all questions until the end as well will allocate some time for that but if we don't get around to you because we run out of time please swing by the booth ask for Meredith she'll be able to help you out there as well thank you it's perfect I think we've talked about this but essentially our aims are to show you what we've done explain why we've done it but also show you where we're going next and just to give you all a bit of context and information about Hitachi so you've all probably heard of us because we touch pretty much all industries from an industrial perspective to it nology perspective we are a global technology leader founded over 100 years ago and a global industrial powerhouse with long-term stability and deep resources Hitachi has deep experience in the industrials and manufacturing space and especially within the kind of vehicles and fleet management space so there's some interesting information out there I won't talk about all of it but over 70% of vehicles have at least one Hitachi component and Hitachi manufactures components that amount to up to 45% of the component building materials you'll have in a vehicle so we have deep deep experience in the manufacturing space there but we also as Hitachi have a lot of experience in the ownership and operation of large fleet operations as well so that's spanning from the automotive to the trucking to the heavy asset so your your earth moving materials as well and along those lines attaches also got deep experience around IRT AI and we're bringing together those with our use of Google as our platform for bringing our industrial experience and heritage to the industry to help our clients within the industry innovate and move forward we also are a combination of 800-plus subsidiary companies and that's how you've probably seen a lot of Hitachi touch in your world so what are we here for today so today we're here to talk about fleet management and how predictive maintenance can support fleet management activities fleet optimization activities specifically fleet management solutions need to evolve they need to move from where they are currently fleet management solutions are often reactive visualizations of the information that you have available to yourselves reactive in terms of maintenance but also reactive in terms of any kind of optimization activities as well today flee or flee organizations essentially have to compete with a number of disrupting factors such as startups other entrants into the market rising fuel prices and lexie mission-based regulations that's forcing them to focus on efficiencies and within that maintenance costs for fleets account for 15 to 20 percent of your fleets total costs so a prime area for optimization and a prime area for AI and IOT based solutions to help reduce that cost digital technologies are changing most industries in all areas and this is somewhere where there's a great opportunity to provide efficiencies and cost savings just to give you all a bit of contextual background information there are a number of fleet maintenance optimization challenges that need to be addressed so fleet managers often lack the pertinent asset condition data they may have data but a lot of the data that gets collected across fleets is cluttered by individuals as opposed to necessarily being streamed back from the vehicles themselves in all instances there's excessive operational maintenance cost so a majority of organizations from a maintenance perspective do periodic or cyclical maintenance where essentially you are maintaining the asset on a time-based process to essentially reduce the risk associated with that asset failing at any point in time that's due to a lack of available asset condition data and a limited understanding of the relationships between the assay failure event and the data that you can get from those assets beforehand assets are becoming a whole lot more complex as well so fleet operators are having to manage at larger scales with more complex assets and that brings with it its own nightmares as well and there's also the challenge around knowing when to maintain your assets and when to replace your assets so for example end-of-life for assets is calculated by organizations usually on a time basis we can bring additional data in to help those types of organizations retire those assets and replace those assets when they need to just because a certain time is elapsed so this is the maturing process the move to predictive maintenance doesn't happen overnight we're on this trend moving from data reporting through to descriptive analytics and dashboards to help people understand their assets and through the use of data and bringing in data you're able to move to the predictive world before we get to the prescriptive world where you're doing things because you feel they're going to fail or you're doing things before you need to do it moving to predictive maintenance is expected to save 10 to 20 percent over preventative maintenance practices and we'll break that down a little bit as we talk through this conversation and why now the big question is has this not been possible previously why are we able to do this at this point technology convergence is a key reason we're able to essentially bring a number of different data sets together from both edge devices within vehicles within assets as well as streaming data from other data sources so we're talking about the Met we're talking about condition data and all those pieces enabled by cloud computing and big data toolkit so they really allow us to stream and store vast amount of data efficiently economically and securely providing monitoring capabilities and the ability to make interventions before issues occur they are machine learnings could be trained against these large data sets at comparatively low cost compared to in the past and advanced visualizations through the use of augmented reality and also automated dashboarding and those elements can help surface the information to the right individuals at the right time so that they can make those interventions as needed and the big question we have to ask is well why do you do these things why do you go through the pain of understanding and working through those data elements and it's all about delivering value for the organization's so fleet operations aren't essentially anticipated to juice costs by moving to predictive maintenance improve efficiency so I'll give you a few examples if we look at maintenance as it stands at the moment we talked about it being done on a cyclical basis if you maintain assets when they need to be maintained as opposed to for the sake of it you reduce the downtime for those assets so for example you don't need to take vehicles out of service to go and do maintenance against those assets you therefore make those assets available and you can improve your revenues against those at that point you're reducing your operational cost you're not having individuals having to go and service assets that do not need to be done and you also are able to manage your capex and essentially focus and work on those assets that need the work when they need the work so I've given you a bit of context and bit of information around wifely organisations need to consider predictive maintenance need to understand their assets better and that's understood and that's a key driver across the industry however there are technological challenges associated with this in terms of streaming back fleet data so a lot of the data that you pull off the vehicles for example are unstructured or the data sources that available come through a time series data with varying structures and schemas IOT data itself isn't going to help you generate insight insight comes together from a combination of additional contextual data sources so knowing the actual event a vet events that were occurring at that point in time climate temperature terrain where you were with that vehicle and also within the work we've done we've identified that you need SME input you need the knowledge and information from those SMEs that are working in that space to help you focus on the right use cases you can bring back data for many sources but unless it's actually serving a purpose and working for the use case to help the organization deliver value it's not going to be worthwhile perfect so I'll give you a bit of an overview here around what we have created and why we've created it so essentially Hitachi is used GCP technologies to deliver a predictive maintenance fleet operational solution which overcomes some of the challenges I talked about we do two things predominantly and we'll go into a lot of detail around this from a actual feature perspective and functionality perspective but just as a high-level overview at this point we've created data dashboards for maintenance planners that look at the data that we pull out of those vehicles compared to contextual data sources and they look at the full information that we've already created and the AI models we have created to predict fault events and they surface the right recommendations to that maintenance planner at the right time so they know where and when they need to maintain assets comparing that against the alerts that are also coming back from the vehicle so it can be dynamically updated throughout their kind of planning process but also looking at the normal maintenance schedules as well for those assets that are not quite ready for this what we've also done is working with our client around the maintenance and inspection space as well as we help them identify where they need to work on their assets and we're using an AR guided inspection application to help their largely mobile workforce understand the steps they need to take to complete that inspection against that vehicle so our client has a large mobile workforce but they also have a large number of contractors that they use as well and the use of an AR guarded application has been super useful to helping those contractor workforce individuals understand what they need to do and where they need to do it we'll give you a demonstration of that as well so that is using the AR components of Android but also using Google glass as well so in terms of giving you the overview of what we've done and how we've done I'll touch on the concept so our solution looks the end-to-end using GCP all the way from data ingestion from either the obd terminal that we have in the vehicle or additional sensors that we instill in that vehicle and Andy will take us through in a white little while the Google DCP components we use from an architecture perspective and why we use those we bring through the data and both stream of backs depending on the use case it's all around what we need to show when we need to show it and then using Google's capabilities from an AI perspective using auto ml ml we essentially are doing the analysis against that data set to identify those fault events and we're visualizing all of that information through assisted reality and data dashboards using Google Data studio and also the mobile and glass application as I've talked about so just to give you an understanding of why we're doing what we're doing and how we got to where we are today within Europe a Hitachi own and operate a number of rail trains and we provide those trains to organisations but also they do the maintenance services against those vehicles as well as it actually were creating those trains they were looking at what data we would need to pull back from those vehicles and structuring the development of those and also the development of the data capture elements on those vehicle on those trains to bring back that information so we could do things like asset monitoring and and asset optimization that has evolved as we've moved on to the GCP suite that's where we're looking now with our fleet clients which will show the demo for to do predictive maintenance using GCP so bringing in all of that information is great and visualizing is great but we are taking that next step forward bringing in contextual data sources and identifying those types of failure events that require intervention so big question is why ai why now and the move from kind of descriptive analytics to predictive analytics is driven by a maturity in AI technology so this won't be new to a lot of you in the room but as businesses are evolving faster than ever data has to keep up and deliver the insights for those individuals within the organization's and bring that data to the frontlines to help them make the decisions as and when they're needed and capitalizing on data is not new how people have been doing it throughout time the difference now is that this evolution of compute and this evolution of scale and speed and diversity in the types of models that are available and the type of Big Data technologies that are available through Google Cloud from a capture all the way to a storage processing and insights perspective are pretty much ready at this point in time to help deliver those insights it's not about big or small data it doesn't matter how small the dataset is it's about how you leverage it with the insight from the industry for the right use cases to deliver value to those individuals as well and this is all about the move from understanding or hindsight through to insight so how do you get insight available within your organization to know where you need to work and the overall overarching aim is to getting to foresight where you're able to go and do things before they occur we've all see Minority Report right and just to touch on this as we're talking through this Hitachi has deep experience with in the maintenance world Hitachi has deep experience with in the IOT world as well so we are able to leverage not just the AR components of Google we're also able to leverage the experience that Hitachi has across the maintenance space from a disparate descriptive analytics space to predictive and also some of the newer things around prescriptive analytics as well so for example Itachi has a our solution cause that we were able to containerize and bring into the Google environment to do certain things such as operations risk or so driver behavior and we've used some of that insight not necessarily to detect those faults but to support that data set that we using for the brakes example which I'll take you through later today and also there's really important things there around remaining useful life estimation and fall predictions around other use cases that we haven't necessarily touched on in this space but the purpose of me showing this and explaining this is to say we have great experience in this space and we're able to bring those with whatever use cases people are looking to work on as well and all of this is in the pursuit of total operation optimization and automation so it's about moving from the hindsight world to insight and also to the optimization space where AI is not only helping you understand what you need to do but orchestrating and run it running that for you as an end-to-end system we're not quite there but that's where everybody should be fair walking towards as well so I'll stop there for one second just do a quick time check with Andy how we doing okay fine yeah I'll let you know that I'm I get told that I like to talk a lot so just have to use Andy to keep me honest I'm here to throw him off the stage okay perfect so before we actually get in and start showing you a bit about the architecture I'll describe some of the features of what we've been doing and when we do the demo I'll explain some of those pieces as well so our fleet operations platform does the normal condition monitoring element so you bring through the data you show some of the basic elements like Mars driven where the assets are and those elements we also do advanced failure prediction so we have two use cases we're talking about today one around failure for air conditioning units on fleet vehicles and one around failure prediction for the brake pad or brake elements of the vehicles as well we also have anomaly detection models where we look at peak performance versus normal performance we bring in the intelligent driver score elements that we talked about and we surface all of this to our end user being the maintenance planner through prioritized maintenance dashboards where we offset the real-time predictive recommendations against some of the cyclical work that's been going on as and we also surfaced that information through mobile and glass applications to the engineers who are out there doing the inspections and completing that work perfect I now hand over to Andy yeah thank you very much he'll give you an overview of some of the architecture components about what we've been working on cool I so yeah we've obviously talked about the fact that the end-to-end capability we looking to use GCP for this we've built the platform with a number of the components so again I'm just maybe just give you a bit of an insight into the high level platform predominantly this is best around Google's blueprint for IOT you probably see lots of diagrams in this area this is very summarized I think the important aspect in all of this is not you know this architecture doesn't necessarily for every use case we have to bring in and use different components of the GCP family to address some of the challenges so again depending on the speed that you need to consume the data whether you're looking at these things in real time whether you want to do things in batch you may end up using different products this is just a I guess the common ones you would tend to use in such a solution from our point of view I guess more recently cloud a cloud IOT core is something that we've introduced some of our clients historically wouldn't have used this they would have used direct connections or stored the information centrally but now with IOT core we can connect directly to these devices and again it's part of the platform we've we've proven some of that technology out so this this is here - I guess predominantly we want - this is not just for the sensor data I think asthma beans mentioned previously there's lots of other information you want to bring into the platform to actually enhance the the prediction models and again different clients I've got different volumes of information so I think back to one of the other slides you know from a rails perspective if they have a lot more days of potential than what you maybe have on the car so you've obviously the platform you can scale out you Nabal to process it you're able to use the power of the of the GCP based on the input the data that's coming into the solution I think again what we've touched on previously there's lots of talk about containerization and again coming back to the algorithms that are the solution cause it actually likes the colon that we've got we we can obviously bring those into the platform so again we don't always have to use GCP products we can introduce our own technologies and things that we've invested in previously and developed over a number of years so we also kill include those and again we'll see some statistics at the end where we've actually done that and we can solve sure where the benefit of using the platform so you know we've talked about the back end you know as I say lots of components from a visualizations perspective we've utilized data studio to do the the what we would cluster the standard dashboard capability so again from a maintenance planners perspective that is where we are surfacing the consolidated information so that's where the person is and making those decisions to support the the future I guess the maintenance effort is required and again Google glass that's where we're doing the the guided investigation and again all the components interacting with the GCP platform taking data in giving data back after some of the investigations have happened I guess these are some of the differentiators and we can call out from GCP obviously from our perspective and to end capability so we can obviously collect the data process it analyze it and then obviously do the recommendations off the back of it that's obviously very important I think as as we mature within the area of predictive maintenance having the ability and I think probably some of the announcements are correct from Google this week you know they're continuously investing in this area of machine learning as well as what hate actually doing so we can bring our enhance capabilities and use obviously Google's enhanced capabilities to progress that as we go through security is a big thing I think you know Google is best-in-class from a security perspective a lot at the time when we you know you could figure in the platform it's just there it just does these things you don't have to worry about it and there's lots of you know out the box capability that we get with the platform and again obviously we've talked about different clients require different needs speed performance the scalability is obviously very important for when we do a lot of the work around the algorithms again I think we've probably touched on this this previously but you know my background is bi and it used to be very humid you would go and gather some requirements from it from an end user you would write you know you'd write write a document you would then go away and build it and I think in this day and age you've got more parties involved with the whole process data engineering is very key you know death is no good if it's not meaningful clean so there's lots of interaction with data engineers and the data scientists but obviously the important people on there is the business operations people the subject matter experts who understand how these lovely objects work and they need to provide that input and guidance and again I think that's we found that it's very critical in key to making sure that anything your developers get gives you the the right outcomes so why attaching Google I think we've touched upon it previously attached has got heritage within the industry space and I think probably is a single tagline it would it would probably you know we were using Google as a platform to bring our I guess industrial expertise to the market you know we we've got some we can see the power in the benefit of using GCP when we develop developing out of these solutions so yeah that's a very brief overview of the of the technology I think as I said we're now going to just go through the actual the demonstration of the application thanks Andy now I'm assuming all of you have already come past the booth and seen the demo so this be the second time you've seen it yeah I'm sure I'm sure that's already happened so just to give you an overview of what we've done with our clients so obviously our client doesn't just have Lego vehicles Lego isn't the enabler for AR to be a success and driving site it's just an abler for us to demonstrate some of the pieces we need to but essentially our client was having is having a lot of work that needs to be done from a maintenance perspective around to specific use cases so eith AC so air conditioning HVAC in the states and also their break elements that's where they spending a lot of their time in terms of maintaining their fleet of vehicles and these fiscally uh vehicles is dispersed across a large geographic region and within their organization they have a number of mobile workforce users but they also leverage a contractor pool of resources when they need to so we started to think end to end about how we can provide a solution to help them both understand where to focus their attentions and when to create the right interventions before assets failed but also how they could get the contractor resources the right information when they needed it visually as well because the last thing you want as a worker is lots of paper the key thing around all of this as well is from a data kind of management perspective our client has access to the data that comes off the vehicle so in the Europe there's an obd to terminal that sits inside a vehicle that streams back lots of information about that vehicle now a lot of that is just noise right you get lots of information but you need to figure out how that is useful for you so I'll just quickly touch on one of the use cases we'll talk you through today around air conditioning so our client was noticing they have a lot of issues in terms of client feedback for the vehicles that they're borrowing around a/c performance issues compared to a some of the other issues some of the other maintenance elements and a lot of their maintenance work was around repairing or servicing these a/c units across their vehicles as and each vehicle obviously slightly different unit slightly different maintenance shed your pattern that they have to follow so we worked with our client to understand what data points would be useful to pull back from the vehicle around the AC usage so looking at the time it took to get from start temperature to the desired temperature is a great starting point in terms of both cooling and heating but then we looked at failure information we could gather from that client to their maintenance records also the external data sources that are required to support their AC use case so how do we bring in external temperature information how do we at least test the value of putting additional sensors within their fleet vehicle so that they can have a robust data set to be able to get to a fault prediction perspective what our client also noticed and and has from an SME experience perspective is an understanding that if you get to these eight air conditioning issues in time you can you can actually remedy them before they turn into total failure so for example if an asset has degrading performance from an AC perspective and our model is flagging that and we know that that asset was serviced let's say within the last six months it really shouldn't be having any performance issues that is probably an asset we want to prioritize getting to to work on because those issues within an AC unit are usually down to pressure eroding out the system coolant leak those types of pieces and they're able to identify based on what we've created those elements in those areas where you could get to it and repair the hose or and improve whatever issue there is with it so the whole unit doesn't fail so we'll take you through that use case we have two focuses from this perspectives their data dashboards which Andy will talk you through shortly where we're surfacing all that information and we'll talk you through that and we also have the guarded AR inspection piece for that mobile workforce as well Andy thank you so just looking I guess from a dashboard perspective this is very we play class more the bread-and-butter bi type stuff with them means to you know surface the information and we need to take action upon so again from a dashboard perspective what we're doing here is we're effectively summarizing the events that have happened now those events may be that the system itself is generated or actually in this case is where we've executed the models and it's come up with these recommendations of the things that need to be actioned straight away so again this is but this is more from I guess work from Earth maintenance planning perspective as opposed to the individual again we can obviously drill into the detail of that we can go and see the specifics of where this thing is failed so in this case air conditioning and again based on so these conditions cause obviously things that we this is the score that we generate again that's based on the the input factors for the different components and models that we're predicting against so again just a visual representation of the information that we're then ultimately going to go and do some inspection against and that's how we're other beautiful car we sort of said that we've we've talked about HVAC in and braking but as part of the the data set that we actually had the data scientists were actually started to I guess evolved that if you like and started to look at things around drivers behavior because that's obviously a key aspect into potential degradation especially things our own brakes where you have a drive who's continuously braking and driving I guess not to the optimum again something it's very useful within the whole the fleet for the industry's perspective is it's also used on the trains it's similar sorts of things where you want to try and optimize that and again we've built out some capability and again these dashboards here are just showing the I guess the aggregated views and some of the the key metrics that people want to capture when your stockin starting to look at driving behavior and again we can drill into that detail skip through these but again it again it's an education thing so we saw we can obviously use that from a where we have to go in actually inspects and service the vehicle but we can also do use these things from an education perspective because obviously it's the same driver it's causing the similar sorts of problems and we can obviously guess take corrective action and which ultimately will obviously improve that the vehicles he's driving or she's driving and just to build on that as well so our clients now looking at the data we're bringing back from a breaks perspective and drivers core perspective to say well that's good for maintenance but how can we start to surface some of that information to that end user that driver to let them know that they're not driving optimally they're accelerating harshly or braking harshly not as a way of telling them off but as a way of helping them understand their performance we carry health monitoring applications and it's just about seeing what you're doing because you may be let's say naive to the fact that you're not driving efficiently cool thanks sorry okay okay perfect so this is the part where you actually see the Lego Porsche is not just here to look nice so essentially in this scenario we've created an application for our clients mobile workforce client wants that mobile workforce made up of contractors to be able to execute the right activities from a maintenance perspective there's two or three things we're doing here and this is all about the inspection workflow within this one I'll talk the examples through as we've got the video playing in the background but essentially within the maintenance world you would be surprised but there are a large number of times where somebody goes out to work on a vehicle or an asset regardless of if it's a fleet asset or any other asset and they work on the wrong vehicle I come from a background in rail slightly where that was happening everybody feels like they know where something is you get the information from the data base and it tells you it's in that location it's a fixed asset you've been there a million times you get there you see the checklist you know what you need to do you do it your market is done you don't realize there was actually an identical unit right next to any worked on the wrong one so we use AR for our visual identification through Google to help we use or understand that asset now with vehicles it's easy because we have license plates we have registration plates for those vehicles and with our client they have three different types of vehicles so we've trained it against those three vehicle types but also the license plate as well to remove that chance of error for the demo purposes you'll see today we've retrained the model and we've done made some of that data for unsanitized it so you can actually see the AR image recognition against the the lego unit itself the other thing we do using the application is we help the user understand where to focus their attention for this inspection so for example I may be a add an AC inspection engineer however I may have not worked on all the cars that have ever existed in the world so it's about surfacing the information for that vehicle and it's all about us then training the models to recognize our clients vehicles and their assets so scalable outside of just vehicles and and fleet assets but immensely powerful to helping people understand what they need to do so in this scenario we're essentially the p-side Walter out the model was highlighted an AC efficiency issue this could be due to gas regulation within the system or leak somewhere the AC unit was serviced quite recently so it's actually something that we're looking for our client to target and get them out to complete that inspection and we will go ahead and complete an expression against that unit so this is where we're hoping the magic works and the video will play I will probably pause it from time to time just to recap them some of the things that we're doing this is the same overview of the use case and scenario that we're working on but essentially user is able to see the job queue the work that they need to go and do and obviously they get a lot of information through from our model so whatever we hold in the model will surface the right information to them about what they need to do where the asset is and then we'll keep it playing we essentially help them navigate to get to wherever they need to do the work on so for example using Google Maps to get them to their location for simple purposes we've simulated that for this part we get to the asset and they need to identify the asset so piece are talked around earlier around working on the wrong asset is extremely powerful we need to make sure that we fix things right first time on the right asset to play this is where you'll see the AR element come in so the a of recognition element the user hovers the mobile or glass device across the asset and data is pulled back from our database to show the pertinent bits of information that we want to surface for that use case and for that user for this demo purposes we've pulled back the mileage we pull back the air condition score and the focus area as well now as we click play the app also provides information to important for that user so that user understands what it is they need to do so from an AC inspection perspective there's usually three things you go look at the condenser the pressure that's within the system but also check the fixtures and fittings around the hose is there any leakage happening in that space so essentially the users given basic information and then they're guided through this so if we click play start inspection they'll be able to that we've told obviously where they need to focus their attention they'll scan that asset so this is using the camera to pull back visual information check against our model and then it pulls back the information around what it is they need to do so at this point we've called out the three inspection areas now for different vehicles different cars you'll have different areas to have the hose or have the condensing unit and this allows them to click in and see what it is they need to work on and the steps they need to carry out as well so it's removing the end of job checklist activities and it's focusing that user on what they need to be doing when they need to be doing it this can get as complex as you want it to be dependent on every cause it just they're handy complex as you want it to be depending on what asset you're working on so it's really powerful and then obviously the information having a press PLAY sorry it's pulled through and that passes through to the database so that we can have positive feedback around what was completed whether there was actually a fault and it's reinforcement with reading codes so our model can learn as we go so that's the demo from the AR perspective and this is where we're hoping that it works and we can go next again the value of why we're doing this so the value of why we're doing this for our client is to help them reduce the maintenance burden and improve efficiency from a maintenance perspective so go and maintain those assets before they fail so you don't have to spend more time and result and and effort when those assets are out of commission later on down the line improve the uptime for those assets so if we can get to a vehicle and do a small repair as opposed to having to a large replacement it's been available to be used by other parties and reducing that capital costs so you do not want to be going out and repairing a/c units as frequently as you as you currently do you want to be able to maintain those units to a higher level of efficiency so that they last a lot longer as well perfect so key takeaways I know you're all probably wondering so what and how much all of this would factor in from a data processing perspective so this is just I guess an example of I guess why the platform is really useful it's part of one of the air conditioning investigations we did some analysis and we try to extend the dataset that we had to simulate over I think 12 months worth of information so you can see there were those big numbers you know if we were to try and do this I guess on premise we probably struggle so this was a job that we executed they obviously spun up as you can see quite a large volume of compute took about 22 minutes to run and it only cost $12 so you know when we give this of ability to our data science team that they're very happy because historically they're they're very I guess mindful of spending lots of money because they know how much people were cast but when they were actually amazed when the they saw the results of actually how much these things cost perfect and in terms of the key takeaways from a let's say learning experience with our client so fleet optimization is a continual effort so it's about understanding what you want to do where you want to do in what you want to try and improve from a use case perspective so ACN breaks with the start and our clients now learning all the other things that they might want to do based on the data we've been able to pull up and surface for them data isn't enough so the key point is as much data as you can bring back isn't enough you need to combine that data with contextual information but also with that subject matter expertise and the ability to add new sensors and bring in additional data points that you didn't originally capture because it can benefit what you're trying to prove so for example with the use case around brakes we brought in the additional data around driver behavior because it's very likely someone's driving badly brakes are going to be impacted it's not this sole factor for why that scores calculated but it's a combination factor then we bring in things like terrain weather do those have an effect on how people are using the vehicle from a brakes perspective and the other key takeaway from this is the speed and scale that you can move out from Google's perspective so you have all of the access from edge data capture to authentification of new devices using IOT core to the use of ml and containers to do the analysis against that data set but also robust and powerful visualization tools to help provide the information for that end user to help them complete their job so for example when we were talking about the guided a our investigation application we tried it in two ways we tried it initially with just a mobile application for a user and when we tried it with the AR piece and side by side and the client was noticed also that the people who are using the a our application will pay more attention to the work they were doing now maybe that's because it's new novel technology but maybe it's that little nudge that you need to in the work that you're doing it's so easy to say well I've done this form a million times I know what I'm doing if you're having to use the camera and those elements it focus your mind on the asset that you're working on as well the other part here is all about technology is important but if technology plus the business context that helps you deliver success and deliver insight your people are your strongest asset this whole process is all dependent on using AI advanced analytics through a change journey with your client understanding what value you're looking to it unlock understanding the focus areas that you're looking to prove value in and demonstrating that value to bring other people into the fold and keeping those individuals involve throughout that process either through visualization tools so soft prototypes that you can work with them to help the business understand what is coming and adjust what is going to be delivered in an agile way so that what they end up receiving is actually beneficial to what they're doing perfect I think we've elapsed towards our time and I think we have about five minutes left for questions if any of you are interested in understanding a bit more about this by all means do you take a picture and scan that QR code or also have a look on the Hitachi Google website and you'll be able to access our information from the applications that you saw as well and thank you very much for coming along today thank you [Music]
