 [Music] what's up guys as i mentioned in the last episode today we're going to be talking about cloud computing and my investment ideas for amazon stock okay let's begin when the internet was in its infancy the word cloud was used as a metaphor to describe how the complex telephone networks connected now many people and organizations refer to it as the cloud but it's not a single entity and it doesn't exist in one just place so what exactly is it cloud is a model of computing where servers networks storage development tools and even apps are enabled through the internet [Music] instead of organizations having to make major investments to buy equipment train staff and provide ongoing maintenance some or all of these needs are handled by a cloud service provider like amazon microsoft google and alibaba cloud computing has two types of models deployment model and service model there are three types of deployment models public private and hybrid cloud imagine you're traveling to work you've got three options to choose from first public cloud in this case the cloud infrastructure is available to the public over the internet these are owned by cloud service providers second private cloud with the private cloud the cloud infrastructure is exclusively operated by a single organization finally hybrid cloud a hybrid cloud is a combination of the functionalities of both public and private clouds next let's have a look at the service models there are three major service models available iaas paas and s a a s first iaas infrastructure as a service we rent the it infrastructure that we need like servers databases storage etc from the cloud provider second paas platform as a service it delivers a platform or an environment on a demand basis to develop test and manage software applications finally saas service as a service it delivers software applications to users over the internet on a subscription and demand basis the cloud service provider handles all components of solution required by the organization so what are benefits of cloud computing [Music] first organizations can scale up as requirements rise and scale down as requirements fall this reduces the investment cost and infrastructure second cloud computing systems are offered by cloud service providers who manage and maintain the servers saving you both money and space third they offer a better security and let you avoid having to constantly monitor and manage security protocols fourth they enable faster and easier data recovery finally they are maintained by the cloud service providers reducing the cost and resource allocation substantially now i would like to introduce one of the most favorable cloud computing stocks amazon first of all let me briefly explain about how
