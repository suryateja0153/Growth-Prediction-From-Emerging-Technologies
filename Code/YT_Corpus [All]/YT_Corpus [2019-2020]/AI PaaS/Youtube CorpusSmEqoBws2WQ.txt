 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist with a little over 30 years of clinical experience. I am here with my co-instructor. His name is Sebastian. He is six and a half years old, and he has spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. We are here at Child and Family Development. It is my employer, and they have also been nice enough to let us use this facility for this videotaping. A lot of times the treatment of children with cerebral palsy is much more equipment intensive, so it was nice to have a place where all this is available. One of these I love in my treatment space at work, we have a trampoline. I love using a trampoline. I think static work encourages still muscles, and I think dynamic environments, swings, and trampolines encourage movement. Ok, ok. Enough talking. All right. I am going to place him criss cross applesauce. He tends to extend his right leg, so I am going to put it underneath his the left. That tends to help that leg stay in a little bit better. I simply bounce him if his head is not back. So, his head is back, so I stop. You have to fix it. You are going to  have to fix it. That is right. You got to fix it. Uh-huh. Fix it Sebastion. Let's go! I am supporting at the shoulders to give him more help. The lower you hold him, the less support you are giving him. He is still struggling with head control, so I am supporting at his head and neck. Sebastian, if you want to go, you have to fix it. Yes. Good trying Sebastian.  You got this. You got it. Sebastian, way to go buddy. Any bouncy surface will do, bouncing on your bed at home works, but trampolines work well too. That is another way to work on head control. You bounce when the head is in a good position and you stop when the head is back or the head is down further than you want. If you fix it, we can we can go one more time. Yes! I hope this idea is helpful for you at home, and we will look forward to seeing you next time.
