 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Charis who is 10 months old. I am going to work on sitting balance with her. So this is another way to work on sitting balance this time. I am just going to put her up on my knees. Oh my! Oh my never mind. So I am going to hold with her pretty low. On other kids I might hold higher, but with her I am going to hold lower. I am going to tilt my knees to one side and have her lean uphill and tilt my knees to the other side and have her lean uphill. It is called the elongation on the weight-bearing side or C curve or just balance reactions. I am taking her side to side fairly slowly. I am going to try a little faster. Whoop! Whoop! That looks a little challenging, so that is about as hard as I am going to go. I hope that is an idea you can use at home to work on trunk strength and balance. I will see you next time! Thanks! Bye!
