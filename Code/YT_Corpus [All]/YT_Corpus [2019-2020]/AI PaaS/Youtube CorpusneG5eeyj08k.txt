 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist with about thirty years of clinical practice. I am here with Myla, my co-instructor. We are teaching activities for children with low tone. Myla is not crawling yet, so we need to work on things to get her on our hands and knees. So a simple way to work on it is simply to put her on our hands and knees. I am going to get behind her and hold her knees. Mmm-huh. I going to put her down on her hands. There you go. I know it. There you go. Good girl. I know. So I am simply blocking her legs by squeezing in with my knees. I have got my hand underneath her chest. She is propping on one arm. She prefers to reach with her left. She is willing to play here. Yes, she needs lots of work on hands and knees play. Even though she has figured out how to get around by sitting and scooting, it would be great if she could figure it out on her hands and knees too. I would not give up on it yet. I hope that is a simple idea for you to work on crawling skills. Myla and I say thanks a lot. See you later! Bye!
