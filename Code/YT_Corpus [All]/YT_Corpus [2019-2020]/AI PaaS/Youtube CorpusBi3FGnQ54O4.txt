 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Myla who has low tone. She is 16 months old. One of the ways to work on back strength is just how you carry them. So I've got my forearm cross her hips. What? Okay. and I can... if I hold her across the hips, she has got a use her back to stay up. I can make this easier by having her more upright or harder by leaning her out a little bit more , so she has to arch up with her back to stay up alittle more. Uh-huh. So ...easier and harder. It is kind of like weight lifting. If you're expecting it to be harder, don't hold it as long. So you could go out with one and back, two and back. Heavens!.... but it' is better with a toy.... and I still have...Oh, I have one left What about that one? That one? No? Okay? She says, "We are done with the airplane. Thanks a lot! Oh! Maybe we aren't. Bye!
