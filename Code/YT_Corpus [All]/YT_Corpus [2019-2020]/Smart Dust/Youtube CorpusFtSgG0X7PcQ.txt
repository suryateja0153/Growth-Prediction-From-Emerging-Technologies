 what's up guys saf here on supersaf tv and today we're going to be talking about the huawei mate 40 pro big thanks to huawei for partnering with me on this video and we'll also be taking a look at the huawei free beds pro and how they work together with the mate 40 pro in huawei's ecosystem now i've had the mate 40 pro for around one and a half almost two months now it's kind of hard to keep track of time with the lockdown and there's a lot to talk about including the whole software situation and we will be touching on that a little bit later but before we do that let's just pause for a second and appreciate the device itself right the hardware in my opinion is very much on point the design is very unique we've got so many smartphones this year but when we do put them side by side i think the mate 40 pro really does stand out because of this space ring design now huawei have kind of talked about the inspiration behind it including the picture of the black hole but let's not go that deep but anyway the thing for me really that strikes out about the mate 40 pro is the symmetry right so generally smartphones have a camera module on one side or another i really like that the mate 40 pro has that mate dna and everything is symmetrical and i really do like this design the mate 40 pro does come in two versions we've got a glossy black and then we've got this matte finish mystic silver for me personally it's an easy choice it's the mystic silver i really like the you know two-tone well it's not even two-toned it's like multiple tone finish depending on the angle that the light hits it you get a very different look and i absolutely love that the fact that this has a matte finish it doesn't attract as many fingerprints as the glossy version would do so personally i'm glad i went with the mystic silver now being a premium huawei flagship device we do have premium materials across the board so we've got a glass front and back we've got a metal frame and this is ip68 water undust resistant now let's take a look at the display so this is what huawei called a horizon display and that's because we have 88 degree angle curves on either side so these are very extreme curves and they look absolutely awesome especially when you're scrolling everything kind of just melts in to the edges now personally speaking i am somebody who prefers a flat display but the mate 40 pro i've not really had any palm rejection issues or anything like that i think even though the curves are extreme they do look really good and are somewhat practical apart from that this is a very nice display it's an oled display with a 90 hertz refresh rate now it's not 120 hertz like we've got on lots of other smartphones out there but here's the thing a lot of other smartphones that have a 120hz display you can only have 120hz when you are at 1080p resolution the mate 40 pro has a 134p resolution so it's almost quad hd but it's definitely much higher than full hd and then you've got that with 90 hertz so it kind of seems to me like while we have gone for a bit of a balance so that way you are getting a higher resolution with 90 hertz and things are very very smooth especially because we've got a 240 hertz touch sampling rate so everything feels super smooth and responsive and when we do take a look at the display front on it actually looks like there are no bezels on the left and right and that is thanks to those curves and we've got small bezels on the top and bottom so we do have a maximum screen to body ratio but there is this pill shape cut out now granted that the pull shape cutout does take up some space but in my opinion it's totally worth it and that's because of what we actually have within this cutout so firstly we do have an in-display fingerprint scanner which is very fast and responsive but then within the cuts out we do have 3d facial unlock sensors so not only do we have the fingerprint scanner along with the 3d face unlock you actually have two options so generally when i'm at home i'll just use the 3d face unlock which as you can see works very very fast but then when i'm out and about in the day and age of masks it's actually nice to have the option of the in-display fingerprint scanner so it kind of covers the best of both walls there's other devices which do use just the front-facing camera for facial unlock but obviously that's not secure this is actually 3d facial unlock so that's the first thing that we get thanks to that punch out but then we've got the front-facing cameras so you might have already heard me say that the huawei p40 pro has my favorite selfie camera of the year i think the mate 40 pro might just have beaten that and that's because this is an ultra vision camera which has multiple different angles of view so you can actually switch between around 78 degrees 90 degrees and you can have all the way up to 100 degrees so if you are taking some group selfies it's gonna allow you to get in a lot more from the front-facing camera so having those options there is really really good but on top of that you have a 3d depth sensing camera now you may have heard lots of other people say that having a depth camera is not useful and i completely disagree with this because just take a look at some of these portrait selfies look at the edge of detection and how good it is especially in this selfie where i'm actually doing a peace sign it's also cut around my fingers precisely and this is something that i really like about the mate 40 pro as i did like about the p40 pro portrait selfies on here are absolutely great so although this punch out is larger than others that you may have seen in my opinion for all of the additional features that it offers it's absolutely worth it now let's take a look at the rear-facing cameras which are within this space ring design so we've got a primary camera we've got an ultra wide camera as well as a periscope zoom camera the primary camera is a super sensing camera i think the most important thing about the primary camera is its sensor size it's around one over 1.28 inches which makes this one of the largest sensor sizes on a smartphone it's similar to what we had on the p40 pro and the results are also very good like we had on the p40 pro lots of detail accurate colors and you also get a very natural depth of field thanks to that larger sensor size and this is also an ryb camera so it's not using the red green and blue that we normally see on smartphones this basically allows in a lot more light so low-light photography of course an area that huawei has been ahead in for many years now and again on the mate 40 pro you get some excellent low-light shots too we've then got the ultra wide camera now while i call this the ultrawide center camera and this allows you to get more into your shots now personally speaking i would have preferred if this was a little bit wider um i have tested other smartphones that do have a wider field of view which i do like however huawei calls this a cine camera because it is the default camera that you go to when you go into video mode and this is an area that huawei has really also concentrated on when it comes to the mate 40 pro so we do have 4k 60 frames a second from all of the cameras and we have real-time hardware hdr so you get some really impressive results in the highlight under shadow areas then we've got the periscope zoom camera which is going to give you five times optical zoom now you can see a few examples here at five times and then even when you go to ten times you get some really really good results i mean take this one for example i would never be able to physically get this close so having that 10 times zoom which uses a hybrid of optical and digital zoom does get you some very impressive and usable results now this can go up to 50 times you guys know how i feel about 50 times zoom on a smartphone it works and you can actually get some pretty good results as you can see here but uh they're not gonna be images that you're gonna share on instagram it's mainly if you do want to kind of see something at a distance uh maybe there's a sign or something that you want to see at a distance it's going to allow you to do that personally speaking i tend to stick to around 5 or 10x and that's where you're going to get the best results some of the best in this category now let's talk about the performance of the mate 40 pro so this is powered by the qn 9000 chipset and i mean as expected it's absolutely fine i'm not somebody who does benchmarks and things like that uh in terms of day-to-day usage gaming it's been super fast and snappy and thanks to the 240 hertz touch sampling rate as well as the 90th refresh rate things are very smooth and responsive now this is an integrated chipset so this was the world's first five nanometer chipset that has integrated 5g and what that actually means is efficiency right what way devices you've heard it many many times before are great when it comes to battery life and that's in part thanks to the software which does do a really good job of putting things to sleep in the background but now that we have integrated 5g it just makes things that much better and the mate 40 pro has excellent battery life i've not been able to kill this thing and on top of that you do have 66 watt charging out of the box so this is included with the device and this just gives you super super fast top-ups as well as that you do have wireless charging as well as reverse wireless charging but more importantly the wireless charging is at 50 watts now i don't actually have a 50 watt charger but realistically speaking i've not really needed one because generally this is gonna last me the full day i can just drop it on a regular wireless charger and wake up to it fully charged but just having all of those super fast charging options there is really really nice to have right now we've talked a lot about the hardware and the experience of using this and i think it's easy to say that this so far is one of the best smartphones of 2020 and it takes off pretty much all the boxes now let's talk about software so the software situation as you probably already know unfortunately is not perfect but i've said this before it is totally workable so we do have emui 11 with the huawei app gallery and petal search so huawei has been working very very hard to bring as many apps as possible to the huawei app gallery and the apps that you don't have in the app gallery you can use petal search to find the official apks for those apps and install them right away so for example whatsapp is an app that is not currently on the huawei app gallery so if i do search for this on petal search it's going to bring up the official apk from the whatsapp website which i can then download and install so it's pretty straightforward and easy to get a lot of the apps that are not on the huawei app gallery as yet but generally speaking i tend to use phone clone now phone clone is an app that's very easy to use you just have to install it on your previous device scan a qr code and then it's going to wirelessly transfer all of the apps that are compatible from your previous device on to the mate 40 pro and then you'll see that lots of apps such as facebook twitter instagram will all come over nice and easily from your previous device but what about google play services now obviously this is the area where it's a little bit tricky what you can do is pretty much all of the google services such as gmail youtube you can access via the browser now this is not the perfect solution of course but having the browser there means that you'll still be able to watch youtube videos as you normally do you'll still be able to get them at the resolution you want you'll also be able to play around with the speed i generally watch everything at two times nowadays because my attention span is so so low so again i think it comes down to the fact that yes it's not a perfect situation but if you do want to take advantage of everything that the mate 40 pro has to offer then you can do some workarounds and still get a really good user experience and speaking of user experience if you are somebody that owns other huawei devices you'll really enjoy the experience that you get on the mate 40 pro because everything is connected together seamlessly it's something that while we refer to as one plus eight plus n the one being your smartphone the super controller which interacts with eight categories of devices including pcs tablets earphones smart watches and many more and the end layer is where everything comes together now i've actually covered the huawei ecosystem in a lot more detail in a previous video i'll link that video in the cards and down in the description but just to kind of show you some examples of how well integrated huawei products are with each other i've got the huawei freebirds pro so the freebirds pro are some of the latest noise cancelling earphones from huawei that feature up to 40 db noise cancellation depth a large 11 millimeter dynamic driver and up to 30 hours of battery life and if i bring the free buds pro close by and pop open the case you'll see this quick animation which will allow us to connect the free buds pro to the mate 40 pro right away but of course it doesn't stop there you can actually use the mics on the free buds pro to record audio when filming on the mate 40 pro so for instance if you're in a loud environment maybe you want to mount your mate 40 pro somewhere and go a little bit distant you'll still be able to get clean audio that will be recorded and transmitted wirelessly to the mate 40 pro from your free bridge pro so i'm roughly about 10 meters away from the huawei mate 40 pro and i do have my freebirds pro and the audio is coming through the freebirds pro now another example is say you have a huawei matebook laptop and you have the free buds pro connected to the laptop and you're listening to some music watching a movie and then you get a call on your mate 40 pro if you answer it then the free buds pro will automatically switch from the matebook to the mate 40 pro making things super seamless and easy once again if you want to know more about the huawei ecosystem and things like multi-screen collaboration which is personally my favorite feature i have covered that in that previous video which i'll link in the cards under the description so that is the huawei mate 40 pro who is it for well as mentioned it does tick pretty much all boxes when it comes to the hardware the battery life the display the cameras the thing you are going to have to consider is the software if you want to take advantage of everything that the mate 40 pro has to offer including the integration with the huawei ecosystem especially if you own other huawei products and you can live without direct google play services you don't mind a few of these workarounds and using the browser then the mate 40 pro is a great option and i can definitely recommend it what do you guys think of the huawei mate
