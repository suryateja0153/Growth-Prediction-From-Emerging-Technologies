 good morning uh and welcome to this rendition of nano explorations it is my honor to introduce you to albert liu albert is a graduate student in a group of professor michael strano and in about six days from now he'll be defending his phd thesis what you're about to see is a fraction of that thesis work and i'm very excited to be able to hear it so in a moment i'll pass uh the stage to albert uh but for right now i just want to remind you that if you have any questions for albert please uh either send them in chat or wait till the very end and i will call upon you if you raise your hand so you can ask the questions directly but with that being said uh uh i noticed most of you already have muted yourself and turned off your videos thank you for doing that that will increase the bandwidth for the rest of us that being said albert please take over thank you vladimir for that introduction and the invitation for giving this talk it's a great pleasure of me uh to introduce this topic that i've been thinking about for you know as a group uh thinking about this for the past several years uh of this topic of colloidal electronics um and so let's get started um so what is colloidal electronics it's obviously composed of two words colloids and electronics a colloidal system can be defined as microscopically dispersed particles suspended throughout another medium for example in a glass of milk that we drink every day you can think of them as you know fatty protein colloids suspended in you know a beaker of water for example um but colloidal suspensions can be stabilized in other forms of substance too for example in aerosol particles in air and also in the subs in the solids solid phase gluto systems are ubiquitous in nature uh for example in the ocean and we often have these phytoplanktons that swims around which can be also treated as a coil suspension the defining feature of a chloride system is its characteristic mobility right because the particles are suspended in the liquid it can be moving around passively with the liquid medium that it's in electronics on the other hand requires no further introduction it has literally infiltrated into every single aspect of our lives and so to graft electronics onto a colloidal system into that colloidal form factor will naturally extend electronics into previously inaccessible locations and environments and this will change the way we think about medical devices environmental monitoring as well as microscopic sensing in chemical manufacturing industry so just to give you a length scale of the problem that we're dealing with here right so here's where our everyday autonomous electronic devices lie on this ruler basically it's tens of centimeter in scale you know on your cell phones your laptops and tremendous amount of progress has been made in terms of shrinking down these electronic devices into for example centimeter scale in these electric ingestible electronic uh systems that can go into our gi tract and you know a serious effort led by you know berkeley some 20 years ago have led to the development of this smart dust or moats that can go beyond one millimeter in its uh critical length and can be used for neural activity monitoring and so forth of course i think the holy grail of the field is to think about the possibility of further shrinking electronic devices down to the length scale of let's say a human red blood cell which enables us to put finally electronic artificial electronic devices or artificial devices into on the human circulatory system and you know all kinds of crazy other applications that is out there so this is roughly where we'll be talking about today roughly at this 10 micron regime which is what we define coil electronics are lying at now fundamental to this problem lies several challenges you know you can think about energy management you can think about uh information relay and communication but the problem that i want to highlight today in this particular talk is a fabrication problem how do we integrate nanoelectronic devices onto a colloidal form factor in a very energy efficient way to create energy efficient circuitry so the material of choice that we have relied upon is uh two-dimensional materials i think for this audience uh you know i don't have to introduce two-dimensional materials except saying that depending on material composition and structure of this atomic lattice you can have uh different electronic properties right so you have uh you can have three at your disposal a conductive material a semiconductive material or even an insulated material found in like hexagonal boron nitride on top of that two dimensional materials are also very very flexible so this atomic thinness allows them to be grafted onto essentially any surface that we can think about so this is attractive feature for our uh uh the the guiding principle of our fabrication method so here's the idea if you take a layer of two-dimensional material or a circuit that you can pre-pattern out of a two-dimensional material and treat them as origami papers and if you fold them around an already existing dom colloidal particle right you can have the top and bottom layer sort of fold them around these particles and if you have a way to cut these 2d material around the edge of the particle then practically you're making these microscopic dumplings that has this two-dimensional material skin the electronic skin and the uh some sort of polymeric core serving as structural support now the particle suddenly becomes like intelligent in that they have this the actual property that is brought forth by the 2d materials in the form of this like alien-like um electronic down point now i'll be the first one to admit that i love making dumplings people who know me knows that but making thousands of these dumplings one by one wouldn't be a lot of fun at this kind of microscopic length scale so is there a way for us to scalably fabricate to the material enveloped or grafted uh microscopic dumplings well the the answer actually lies in controlled fracturation of the two-dimensional materials this is sort of like a weird concept when i first encountered it um you know if you think about fracture and it's the fluctuation process of a brittle material for example glass never really appeared to be controllable it's almost always stochastic right i on average break one iphone screen every year the process never appears to be controllable to me um so how come we can control the fluctuation of two-dimensional materials it turns out this problem has been solved almost 100 exactly 100 years ago by alan griffith so he had he's the fondly father of modern fracture mechanics and he has put forth this griffith theory to describe the fracturation process of any given material so according to his theory when you have a piece of material and you advance a crack within the material that is going to expose new surface area within the material so if you plot the overall system energy as a function of the crack length you see that the surface energy scales linearly with the surface area that you expose and hence it's linearly correlated with the crack length at the same time when breaking the material the strain energy that is built up within the material will necessarily drop precipitously actually so if you sum up these two contributions to the total energy you get this concave shape with this vertex of the concave being this critical length scale that we call griffith length now this is interesting because any crack this theory predicts that any crack that is shorter than this griffith length on the left-hand side of it will actually not grow because further increase in the crack will increase system energy on the other hand if your crack length is on the right hand side of the griffith flanks it will basically precipitously grow and the material will fail griffith then went on to calculate analytically what the griffith length is a function of other different material parameters specifically he has pointed out in this formula that the graphic length scales inversely proportional to the square of the specific strain at a given location of the material so this is interesting meaning that increasing material strength it gives us a tunable factor that we can use to control the length of the graphic versus length hence can to control the breakability of a material so how does that square when we look at two dimensional materials here's a piece of graphene under tem as we all know cvd ground work chemical vapor deposited graphene or other two-dimensional material always have these inherent brain boundaries or defects that is on on the order of nanometer scale so these defects can be seen here and if we think about these defects as seed crack that exists within our material i'll actually say that this c crack you that you see right now is shorter than the graphite length with the reason being that it it actually is stable enough for us to take this tm image right so this seed crack has to be on the left hand side of the griffith point now consider the thought experiment what would happen if i pull on this graph a little bit if i pull on this piece of graphing a little bit then your new uh imagine that you're sitting at this cracked tip the string energy is going to increase according to this formula your graphics length is going to drop so if your new graphics link now suddenly it sits on the left hand side of the same seat crackling the material will actually fracture so by controlling strength you can control whether or the direction at which a crack will propagate so here comes the question can we control material fracture within the two-dimensional material with a given pre-programmed string field and use that as a fabrication method for making chloro-electronic devices so this you know give rise to what we call alkyl perforation or automatic perforation of two-dimensional materials which uses a pre-formed strength field to guide brittle fracture within a given material so the way to do it is actually quite simple you take one layer of two-dimensional material and you can print using inkjet printer an array of polymeric dots on top each of these styles let's say is about 10 micron to you know hundreds of microns in size and you can drive your dot take another layer of 2d material and just overlay on top you form this sandwich array structure now that you know if you of course you can freely choose whatever two-dimensional material you use to form the top layer and the bottom layer so you can make graphene encapsulated arrays mos2 encapsulated arrays hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated arrays or you can mix and match making genus layers so what would happen now if you put this whole thing inside a lift-off solvent you erode away all the polymeric support for these 2d materials now if you think on the scale of a single layer of 2d material folding over one particle what would happen is that as this layer of two-dimensional mirror falls over this polymeric pillar that we have previously printed you naturally form this ring of maximum hoop string this is very similar to the process in which you fold a piece of tablecloth over a circularly shaped table you're naturally going to be getting maximum strength on the edge of the table right so this string this maximum ring of maximum hoop strength will actually you know according to griffith theory can be used to attract a randomly generated crack within the material and the crack will propagate along this ring of maximum group string so experimentally this is very similar to what we can predict in theory basically what happens is that anywhere there's no support of the 2d material it will fracture it will actually that you'll see the the propagation of the crack will follow uh the the the edge of the circular pillar that we print and then as a result you get this perfectly punched out particles that are flanked on top and bottom with the two layers of 2d material just like a dumpling or a ravioli depending on where you come from in the world uh but you know this is the kind of sandwich structure that we can make using this kind of auto perforation method okay so this is actually a beautiful picture that was taken by our colleagues felice franco inside her studio where you can see this stripe that you see is actually the liftoff solvent this mechanical shockwave that we create to generate the initial seed crack or the the to nucleate the seed cracks you can see the crack starts to form on top of this shock wave and then later on the process you already see on the previous slide it starts to propagate and cut across the circularly shaped pattern form these fluid electronic devices so we're not doing anything crazy here all we're making is basically this 2d membrane encapsulated composite but of course by using different ink that we print using our inkjet printer we can control whatever composite that we're making inside this dumpling so by controlling the ink volume we can tune the size of our chloroelectronic devices down to roughly the size of human red blood cell we can also control the shape and morphology of this little thing that we print by using different inks with different viscosity and surface tension you can you can actually make them to look like a human red blood cell with this colloidal shape by using nano uh magnetic uh particles inside the uh the ink that we use to print you can actually make the particles magnetic and then you can control its local motion uh using an external magnetic field you can control its flipping its rotation and translation but i think the fun part here is that you can actually control whatever 2d material you use to make on the top and the bottom of this dumpling that we're making you can for example control the optical property of the particle by mix and match different um you know optical responsive to the material for example in this case we're making either a graphene graphene particle a mos2 mos two particle or a hybrid janus particle with one layer of mos2 on top and one layer of graphene on the bottom it of course will have different photoluminescence and other optical properties even one more fun part is that you know chemically with two layers of defined 2d material on top and bottom you actually have chemical access to force surfaces because each layer of 2d material have its internal face and external face right so you can actually using our fabrication method control the either covalently or non-covalently what kind of functional groups you can fabricate you can adhere to the surfaces of these different uh layers of 2d materials by doing so we can control the mechanical um flexibility of our particle you can make them strong enough that it will stay sort of in this pancake shape or you can roll them up into a burrito or like a taco shell these particles can make can be made strong enough that they will be um they'll be strong enough to to to survive a nebulization process in which the they are aerosolized from their native liquid state into aerosol particles and travel across the room and be landed onto a glass light for future electronic uh testing right so this can actually travel as aerosol particles so here are the things that we can do with these particles um but what about electronic features so if you think about the structure of the particle it's very simple it says it's got you know a dumpling shape so there are two electronic modes predominantly two electronic modes within the particle one is the in-plane mode that you can make into a very simple chemical resistor something that will switch its uh resistivity based on the chemical it touched so here what we can do is with the same graphene particle we can selectively adhere onto the surface an amming functional group which will grab onto the gold nanoparticle inside groundwater so this becomes a like heavy metal uh nanoparticle sensor within groundwater so by dispersing particle into the groundwater and the harvest come back late afterwards you can measure the conductivity change of this surface and this this is very selective and sensitive on the other hand if you use something that's called a nitrile triacetic acid ligand or nta ligand using the same chemistry you can functionalize the same particle with different ligand now this suddenly becomes a zinc sensor a zinc cation sensor so here what we did was that we put again magnetic nanoparticles inside the ink that would print the particle hence the particle becomes magnetic these meth these little magnets will traverse through a soil matrix when it comes out on the other end uh you can use a strong magnet to harvest them back onto your inside your microfluidic stage and then later on test it under a probe station so to cut the long story short these can be made into very sensitive and selective chemical sensors using its chemical resistivity of the two dimensional materials i think a more foam part of this kind of the geometry of our particles is actually in the cross plane domain so imagine right you have this particle let's say if you make them with graphene then from top to bottom you basically have this two terminal device where you have an electrode a graphing electrode another layer of graphene in the middle you can print whatever you want inside that polymeric gel that you use to make the particle core so in this case what we're doing is to make them into a mem resistive device i think last week there's a tremendously uh uh uh insightful talk on on memory these devices we're not doing anything special here all we're doing is printing nano black phosphorous nano flakes which is a known memory resistant material inside our polymeric gel to form these kind of uh pathways memory resistant pathways from top to bottom and if you look at its electronic uh uh behavior all we're doing here is that within a particle then this allows us to build a particle that can be switched on with a positive voltage so this is a reversible non-volatile memory to terminal memory and this memory can be swapped back to its uh non-conductive state we're using a negative voltage um so one of the things that we did with this particle is that giving one single particle we can actually make them into a 15 15-bit random access memory in that in this one particle that you see with with and and the color that you see is basically vertical connectivity we can program in the letters m-i-p uh with the vertical connectivity and you can read it out and erase it later and do it all over again so i think at this point i'll just sort of um switch gears a little bit and because we now with the auto perforation this allows us to make electronic particles um but to if we take a step back and think about what are we doing with uh with these colloidal electronic devices certainly we're not anywhere close in making these devices into computers that can run microsoft word for example right so but you know i'll show you this uh for me i really like this image and i i know for some of you you might find it disturbing which i apologize but uh this is uh the idea where a group of army ants can come together and form a bridge across a crevice so i think this really resonates with me in terms of the vision of coil electronic devices in that maybe in one day we can have these very tiny little electronic devices and do computation other things in a distributed way um in that different entities can come together and when accessing the collective behavior or the emerging behavior of our little uh sort of you know sort of useless entities we can access uh a tremendous function that none of these individuals can perform by themselves um so our group is working uh you know in this direction in terms of accessing you know communication and uh different kind of collective behavior between these particles um one of the critical things that we have to solve before doing that though uh is uh is locomotion active locomotion how does each one particle can access active locomotion at its own well right so that i'm not talking about a passive locomotion where you have these particles just uh free uh flow freely within a embedding medium but how do you access active locomotion and so this is actually also compatible with our auto perforation fabrication technology so here what i'm showing is basically instead of just doing this very simple sandwich structure of graphene or 2d material polymer graphene you can actually modify this fabrication a little bit uh using what is uh what is known as a carboxymethyltellus or cmc this is a water-soluble polymer so if you print this instead of the the usual uh polystyrene or other polymeric material we can create a fabrication method that allow us to pattern these micro wells uh within our pmma underwater on a dissolution so these micro wells are basically 10 microns in diameter and maybe 100 a nanometer thin um followed by the surface profile that you see here so what this micro well allow us to do then is to create a fabrication methodology where we can use electroplating to electroplate uh different kind of metals on top uh within the micro well because graphene for example is conductive so we can use electroplating to do this as you can see the platinum that we chose to uh to electroplate within the microwell then appears to be this dark color so if you follow through the fabrication add this step onto our original auto perforation uh fabrication you can basically make particles that are uh after the auto perforation process uh will will give rise to this janus a platinum layer on top of the original sandwiched structure so this additional metal layer allows us to do something uh you know a little bit unusual uh which is just to uh when you put the particles inside of hydrogen peroxide bath then the platinum can be used as a catalyst to um uh to to to decompose hydrogen peroxide into these oxygen bubbles that allows these particles to generate these bubbles and propel themselves to move so this is a step in in in the active local motion direction in which um again we're borrowing knowledges from the colloidal science community and we're introducing it onto our um colloidal electronic devices to make them perhaps a little bit more useful than they are um they are they are today um so i think i'm reaching the end of this talk and i'll just summarize what basically i have talked about today um we take a colloidal particle and you can think of two-dimensional materials as origami papers and you can fold them around this little particle and this method basically gives rise to a bottom-up defect self-assembly method which we can then use as a controlled fabrication method um what i didn't get into today but you know it was covered several weeks ago in the same mit nano uh seminar uh by our postdoc uh of volo coleman uh he has uh basically extended on the idea of using two-dimensional material to create nano-electronic circuitry uh to make a active solar cell in form of a photodiode integrated with a chemical resistor that you heard a little bit about today and also a memory resistive device on top of a single particle now this actually three device a circuitry allow us to to to access uh logistical computing in its most elementary form so i think shooting material research in a very real way uh can be slingshoted by this particle colloidal particle that is stuck in the middle uh into a a new direction which allow us to extend uh artificial electronic devices into previously inaccessible locations and environments so of course as i alluded to before that there are lots of other problems that we need to tackle before colloidal electronics will become useful in any way shape or form um so we have talked about today the integration of nanoelectronic sensor and memory in the form of two-dimensional material on top of this you know 10-micron size particle but of course we have to worry about how do you power this particle actively right so we can have photovoltaic or other traditional ways like rf signaling these uh radio frequency energy transfer but it turns out none of these traditional energy harvesting methods scales very well into the microscopic regime so uh you know efforts has to be made on thinking about other ways that can augment the energy harvesting for colloidal electronic devices for them to be useful in the future and of course we have to think about ways in which we couple these two devices together how do we communicate from one particle to the other and then how do we utilize the fact they can move by themselves and they can communicate with with each other to form larger order assembly or perhaps dynamic assembly of these in individual colloidal devices uh to form the basis of uh future uh sort of distributed computing uh using photoelectronic ensembles and these are actually you know topics that have sort of touched upon within my thesis so i'll take this opportunity to advertise for my thesis defense on next monday in which i will talk about basically all four points uh but today you know we obviously only have time to to discuss auto perforation as a fabrication technology that can integrate uh sensing and memory with with the form factor of a two-dimensional material so with that i'll uh thank the people that have contributed uh tremendously into the work that you have uh heard about today uh and i just want to highlight that the fact that the the work that you heard about today uh was uh was an effort uh that is under this miri grant uh between you know mike and and tomas in the it was actually an effort led by tomas in the eucs department and uh if you're interested in the details of the study that i have uh talked about today uh feel free to check out uh the november issue of nature materials last year which covers our work thank you very much for your attention and i'll take any questions if there's any thank you thank you albert that was amazing uh you have uh indeed painted a whole new vista of what might be possible through uh hands-on nanoscale i guess the way i would portray it there are so many different ways of putting together uh all these different nano elements and indeed you showed us that through inkjet printing uh 2d material handling and then very clever appreciation of cracking uh down on nanoscale you're able to indeed generate these uh nanoscale micron scale particles and then actually electrically activate um in so many ways i feel like you have uh generated an ability for us to rethink how to handle the nanoscale and kind of open a whole new set of projects that this could lead to so thank you for that oh thank you for saying that i really appreciate it pleasure um i'm gonna start to ask you some questions i do i have i have received a couple on the chat uh of course i have a bunch of questions i'm asking about as well um but uh just to let all of the others who have tuned in uh no please now's the time to send a chat with questions or alternatively to raise your hand and i will call upon you to make sure that uh indeed you have a chance uh to be heard and ask a question appropriately so let me start uh by uh investigating the griffiths our auto preparation law that uh you indeed um uh introduced the question is you know the actual uh way of breaking uh the sheet is by providing a pulse um or maybe a beat of pulses that will cause the breakage eventually is there any dependence on the frequency of the beat of pulses if that is chosen as a choice of a house yeah i think you know that's an excellent question and uh indeed we have not actually studied you know how this uh uh the frequency of the post how does that correlate with with the the fracture but you know if indeed you're using a mechanical wave to generate that uh initial um nucleation of the defect so to speak then i would naively think that the higher frequency that you have chosen would uh um would then correspond to maybe more fracturation and indeed if you if you if you don't do this um um well enough then the 2d material can crack on top of the particle which is uh which is what you don't want right so it's i think it's a careful balance about the initial density of the nucleation of the crack and should let them freely travel at their own will to explore the um sort of string energy landscape that we have created by the underlying particles that we have printed and yeah i'll ask you one more a related question although i suspect the answer to it to it which is um you know the griffith law again uh uh provides you the guidance on how to understand what parameters you have the young's modulus the strain uh every one of those guides you the one thing clearly that one can ask is well is there such a thing as a young's modulus in a molecule to molecular atom to atom kind of bonds that a graphene sheet has is it rational young's modulus and maybe it is given the fact you have hundreds of atoms not two atoms working with each other to generate such a behavior i assume when you dial in uh you're cracking it is done experimentally and hence all of the parameters kind of are lumped together and you're really just making the griffith law as a guide right yes of course yeah uh there are you know lots of sort of fitting parameters that we have to use in order to explain uh some of the experimental observations that we found of course as you as you mentioned vladimir the there is you know a concept of beyonce's modulus within graphing right and people have measured it uh perhaps you know bearing a lot based on how your graphing was you know it was it exfoliated was the liquid exfoliated was it was was it cvd grown and if it's severely grown what is the defect density and all of these factors uh will will factor into the young's modulus consideration um but yeah no of course you're right that uh uh this this griffith guiding theory was one of our ways one of the models that you can in fact use to to to rationalize the programmability of control fracture and it seems simple enough at least for a non-mechanical mind of mind that that i can understand is an easy enough theory i know there's you know a lot of further variations of the griffith theory later on but this initial seminal paper published in 1921 was one that you know i was able to appreciate and utilize to to explain some of the experimental phenomena but yeah yeah thanks of course uh let me just move to the actual applications that you observed um you observed the memristor behavior and you found it is programmable uh by choosing uh different pulse uh you didn't necessarily spend too much time telling us how do you program and then erase uh your memristor that's one question and the second question would be uh how long is the memory uh duration um how long does the mechanical compression stay right again two excellent excellent questions um and uh so and and you know i think the the the mechanism at which the the main resistance turn for black phosphorus material is i think at the current stage it's being understood as this interfacial uh uh mem resistance pathway in which we have this oxygen defects that can electromigrate within the pathways that we have created using our printing method on the um the first question was on how well first of all uh how how do you erase it yeah so you raise basically so what happens sorry yeah so you raise it with a negative voltage so this is reversible mem resistance uh and basically what happens in our experiment is that you can first of all land the particle onto the platform and then program in your memory and then you can lift it off by by dissolving away whatever is underneath it and then you capture it again afterwards and then you can read out the information that is stored in the vertical electronic memory that are protected again by the two layers of graphene within the net the black phosphorus material and if you want to switch off the the memory you just run the negative voltage shown by this voltage characteristic curve here so the in our experience the memory resistance to answer the second question uh the memory resistance is actually quite stable so it's not volatile uh i have obviously not tracked the the memory resistance to its failure but uh it can stay there for for for for day zone out without really uh um really um decrease and one of the reason is that you know we have to buy a bear in mind that you know our memory resistance pathway across the particle this dimension is at least one micron in in in length so this is quite a long pathway meaning that you actually have to spend more energy than these nano scale uh for example tio2 or these very small uh nanoscopic mem resist devices that people use for neuromorphic computing so the switching time is obviously not comparable but the advantage of that is actually it's quite stable right so once it's turned over it takes a lot of effort for you to then drive back the oxygen defects in the reverse direction so it's quite stable in our testing the top and the bottom electrode of your mem resistor are graphene correct yes yeah so and and we used ipo as the bottom sort of electrode and graphene assist on top and the tungsten probe just directly come down and contact the graphene yes and you're counting on a high series resistance apartment lateral resistance or graphene exactly you only write a small spot under your right so it turns out you know you don't you want to go much more above this switching of a voltage right and and then because of the the lateral uh high resistivity sort of sheet resistance within the graphene when it's fabricated in this form well we'll you actually do not it turns out the spreading current is is in such a way that you don't you don't really affect the the the adjacent pathway by by that much yeah but of course that you know i if you want even better tunability of these uh digits uh one one simple way is just to fabricate uh contact pads of you know different metallic contact pads which then our later on work of fabrication of electroplating um uh electro smaller electrodes on top of the graphene can also be utilized for for that kind of application in order to access even more stable digits and bits of memory yeah is one of the last images you showed us was the one of these particles swimming through h2o2 uh propelled by the uh by the uh uh mission of oxygen in a process uh the the way you're powering this is by optically or how are you no yes this is a chemical powering uh scheme right so i i think a cell power is sort of a misnomer but the idea is that you the the this is an old scheme again not invented by us platinum is known to to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide right so hydrogen peroxide is the chemical bath that this particle is sitting in sort of analogous to how biological cells are always sitting in a glucose bath which utilizes glucose as the chemical energy input so the the particle here harvests the chemical energy within the environment turn that over into uh oxygen bubble which then you know mechanically impact the cyst to propel it forward i guess uh if i'm gonna imagine my solar uh you know opportunity here would be to use your injured printer to print a polymer blend that would be solar active and generate 1.25 volts let's say right and you can make the oxygen and hydrogen bubble and and and uh that'll be doubly uh fast i guess yeah and and if you shine on the left you can go to the right and if you shine on the right you would exactly go on right and you can have a very quick right right it's a remarkable technology i'll ask the very last question here that came through the chat which is uh what is the closest commercialization application that you might imagine this discovery might lead to right yeah so i think the closest uh sort of entry point to the market for technologies like this or perhaps uh still in its sensing ability and the ability to remember stuff right so one of the critical challenges of let's say on being able to detect something and remember uh even maybe as a function of time it's tremendously hard with existing technology for small scale systems right because like what if you look at how ingestible electronics or other centimeter scale or modes or these type of millimeter scale device are currently doing it you always do real-time information uh feedback either through bluetooth or optical uh so this is a real-time information feedback um and that becomes less and less likely at the micron scale because the energy efficiency is just low for you know if you want to make an led uh at high inefficiency it's tremendously hard uh and and also the light it generates probably does not penetrate through the soil matrix or skin or what have you so uh one way of you know sort of dealing with that problem is just to remember what you have seen perhaps then you can store the information digitally and then later on when the particles do come out you'll read it out so in that sense you can think about you know a wide array of commercialization possibilities for example could you use this as geo uh sort of like particles that you can put into oil wells for for exploration of well of oil and gas industry because you think about maybe detecting a chemical nutrient within uh within the soil matrix or you know through microfluidic reactors for instead of installing millions of little sensors alongside these uh microscopic reactors that people are building for sort of these uh production on demand chemical industry uh you can just simply you know throttle in a little particle or a group of particles and making them into chemical sensors that are uh that that can record the information which can you can use the information to back out what is going on within your uh your small scale reactor system yeah so i think there are a lots of different ways where people can apply this technology to great effect even within the next few years and of course you inspired many of us uh to imagine additional technical achievements in the lab that this kind of technology can lead us to so thank you again albert it's been a truly fantastic talk um i i i can't but just be in awe of what our graduate students and soon-to-be doctors indeed are able to achieve in their time at mit so thank you again for uh treating us uh to your work uh with that i will just remind you uh that you should join us again this coming thursday at 11 o'clock uh we'll have a talk on fast and energy efficient monocular adept estimation on embedded systems uh this is by diana dwarf uh and i very much uh hope that you'll have a chance to join us for that but till then thank you for joining us today we'll see you please thank you for the invitation
