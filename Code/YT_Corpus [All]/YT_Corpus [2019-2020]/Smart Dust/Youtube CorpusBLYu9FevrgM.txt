 Yesterday, we reported about how fine dust weighed on the local economy... today, we have a new study that says high levels of fine dust affects the health of pregnant women here in Korea. Oh Soo-young has more. Pregnant women living in dust-filled areas have an increased risk of going into early labor. Researchers from Kyung Hee University Hospital and the National Cancer Center analyzed the births of one-point-seven million newborns from 2010 to 2013. They found mothers within the first 37 weeks of pregnancy who lived in dusty areas of Korea were one-point-five times more likely to give birth prematurely For women in their first 32 weeks of pregnancy were twice as likely to go into early labor. Those residing in areas where the average fine dust density exceeds 70 micrograms per cubic meter,... had a seven-point-four percent chance of giving birth before their baby's due date. On the other hand, women living in less polluted areas had a four-point-seven percent chance of going into premature labor Researchers say there's a clear correlation between fine dust levels and premature births,... stressing the need for further studies. On Monday, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said at a parliamentary session that some 2-point-8 million U.S. dollars will be allotted to research on how exposure to fine dust impacts human health. Studies will focus on socially vulnerable people including infants, the elderly, pregnant women and chronically ill patients. Joining hands with public and private institutions, the five-year research initiative will aim to identify channels of exposure and how to reduce their impact. Oh Soo-young, Arirang News.
