 utility fog coined by dr. John stores Hall in 1993 is a hypothetical collection of tiny robots that can replicate a physical structure as such it is a form of self reconfiguring modular robotics topic conception Hall thought of it as a nanotechnological replacement for car seat belts the robots would be microscopic with extending arms reaching in several different directions and could perform three-dimensional lattice reconfiguration grabbers at the ends of the arms would allow the robots or foglights to mechanically linked to one another and share both information and energy enabling them to act as a continuous substance with mechanical and optical properties that could be varied over a wide range each fog light would have substantial computing power and would be able to communicate with its neighbors in the original application as a replacement for seatbelts the swarm of robots would be widely spread out and the arms loose allowing air flow between them in the event of a collision the arms would lock into the current position as if the air around the passengers had abruptly frozen solid the result would be to spread any impact over the entire surface of the passengers body while the fog lights would be microscale construction of the fog lights would require full molecular nanotechnology Hall suggests that each bot may be in the shape of a dodecahedron with 12 arms extending outwards each arm would have four degrees of freedom the foglights bodies would be made of aluminium oxide rather than combustible diamond to avoid creating a fuel-air explosive Hall in his correspondent soon realized that utility fog could be manufactured on masts to occupy the entire atmosphere of a planet and replaced any physical instrumentality necessary to human life by fadhl its exerting concerted force an object or human could be carried from location to location virtual buildings could be constructed and dismantled within moments enabling the replacement of existing cities and roads with farms and Gardens while molecular nanotechnology chol bodies utility fog would remain a useful peripheral with which to perform physical engineering and maintenance tasks thus utility fog also came to be known as the machine of the future topic see also play tronics gray goo molecular machines no robotics technology programmable matter self reconfiguring modular robotics smart dust synthetic biology the invincible a 1964 science fiction novel with intrigue centered on nano bot x1
