 [Music] and hey it's been a couple years yeah like two or three like three yeah yeah yeah not long enough for too long oh it's all good it's all good great hey thank you so much for having us out your amazing workshop well thank you solar panels on it yeah yeah it's wonderful thank you so much for having us so are you ready to see what you've done and what you come of course how you're heating it so what made you build it the first well I've been a woodworker for 50 years and so a couple years ago I designed this and built most of it myself and I'm finally in it now I've just retooled it so I've gotten brand new tools which are pretty exciting yeah and I'm just kind of getting back into that groove again yeah yeah it's it's being great I find myself there looking at the watch and going oh wow it's 5:30 dinner Oh Jen she's probably okay I have to shut her down guys I kind of get lost in here that's great yeah so it's it's a great space and it's comfortable it's warm what I need to be warned yeah and there's enough room for me to do what I need to do I'm not building any new big cabinets or anything and thinking around with a little artsy craftsy stuff in some some bookcases and stuff so anyway it's it's working yeah well we can probably learn something about woodworking and other things we're excited to see what you've made sure thank you you bet yeah this could be this could be in a magazine yeah all right sir you bet this is like a craftsman sighs it's funny because I have this natural fur floor for the rainforest you don't see this this is a dream where I can just kind of throw practical for a shot there's lots of dents and dings in it now so anyway that was kind of one of the splurges and people actually for a while like before I filled it up with stuff you know it was all perfect and like people with tender shoes oh well this is about 20 by 24 that's perfect right when I came to like sign for heating what were your options so the first thing I thought was I'm gonna put a little little corner building here I started looking at the cost of the tank yeah that's propane up here the tubing and then where did the how much room is it gonna take and with 400 square feet if you lose you know 10 or 12 square feet that's a lot right that's this whole corner so then I sort of what else can I do and I went online I think I don't know how I came up with a degree but I saw you guys looked at your things and then wanted to talk to you okay and it was perfect I mean look you can take your pictures of just the ceiling and with the lights and anyway it's pretty trick just looking at it yeah yeah and they work great I can come in and wise you know you know that it's not warm in here when you get here to once half an hour later you start getting more guts start turn the heat down it's like it just heats so evenly and there's no fan lon sawdust isn't a problem as far as combustion or anything and they're just so clean I really like how just they just blend it and you don't really know what they are but somebody told you what they are ya know so anyway it's worked great good it's been perfect for this application this other batch isn't warm the tools are warmer yeah it's just it's so different it's like you can you know if you you know you can feel the it's like seeing the sunshine right all that do you think that is right now your eyes those are two by four some of them 50 watts you know do whatever ya know right under them and everything I need sorry me them so yeah yeah it's a very unique heat I mean it's like nothing that I literally it's like you go over to the stand by that window when you get warm the same thing here right which is kind of why I put in ho again because then no matter where because you can see this is like the pathway where all the tools and working goes right and so you've always nothing never too far away from some sunshine and I turn it down about 55 at night and then I come back in on a minute I turn up to 60 usually even within 15-20 minutes I'm feeling in the coat and in the summer of course we don't need a mall but it's it's been very surprisingly comfortable and I like him because you don't know they're there right they don't make any noise anyway so you have a total of four let's come out to 1500 watt space years they're not taking up any usable space of no chance of anything tipping over you know and consuming dust or any have you spending money on maintenance on these yes no okay goes against the notion that people can pick the heat rises well warm air is so little science for you yeah and so yeah we're really grateful that it's been a great way to condition it yeah but you use it often indicate of never even knowing the technology was there much less than it was made in dumbing him right and electricians installed them and they've been great fantastic no worries well let's take a look at the things that you made okay yeah so I don't do it much we working in huh what is this beautiful it looks like it's got character even like yeah the wormhole wall this is called spalting it's kind of sickly kind of a start of a rotting thing that it hasn't softened yet got it this is some cherry wild cherry that grew up the up the road here about six miles and I cut this down I used to cut this up for firewood and my mom Gaiman gusseted weather and she said cherry and what are you burning that for you have to make something out of that so I had a slab into Lexington you can see this is the light man yep these are the fans saw marks okay yep and and you can see they all the you know trees are circular so they tend to work when we're there so there's a bit of a crown here and a bit of F anyway so to build something out of this you need to work on it so this wood has been here I'd on the forty years or something I'm not here I've been tacking it around and you can see this one is pretty well you know most of the cut marks the saw marks are gone you need to joint this still straight as an arrow yeah it's pretty good this was a piece that this was obviously a bigger piece P this is a duck yes you know well but you can see it's got some of this ball team in it oh sure and that was one of the first thing that it's nice having wood and then you make the project rather than say now I'm gonna build this thing what do I have to do it with can I use yes thanks miles I did the blend the dominoes first what do you what kind of wood is this this would be made in which a bed of rice you can see all the oil just pop and then we've got black walnut for half all the even dots above the red oak right okay black walnut red oak maple all kind of local woods you know here's the set right here I'm tell you now that I was in a set who's curious 55 but in 2012 okay or double nine sorry Harry yep and about four hundred and ninety five holes Wow that's 495 drills right and then you have to cut it down out of a three foot so cutting you little plugs see you learned you learned that I did some math it's some women this here is us and this is the box then I just kind of created this - also maple and something this is can see here's some half-inch inside there's 3/4 and I did this so that when you put the dominoes in you can still grab them to take them home in just wanting to speak right anyway this box I built is just a box it was a solid piece just like this and okay building and then after it's done you come back and actually cut on the table saw the top off of it okay BAM and then I've already got it for the hinge that's yeah so I'm really getting real close to the end of this there if you have the tools you can go from the rough to make some pretty much that is great that's great you know yeah and so well you know that's it's something that you keep in I have a son maybe he'll keep it right company gets to so you know it was always always fascinated with buildings from ages ago the architecture is always fascinated me so I just fell into it that way you designed stuff and it built probably a half a dozen houses in fact until that house my men know I built every house I lived in since I left home Wow and actually on that wall here you see I have a couple of pictures this was the first do this 20 year old to Washington cut all the logs and the property this was a neighbor who had 40 acres he said come on out build a cabin Wow so these are kind of the steps and then this was the second one idea this is the 20-footer this is about a 40-footer and just I shot off with cedar tree so it's kind of again I just don't know any guests drink kind of write instruction so I've been building buses for a while and just like I said this shop might be my last deal because I'm not 30th still look at the picture and it's just it just looks ya know this is it and say your your space here you say this vote by 24 hours square feet and you've got looks like looks and you've got this is like I mean this is like we wants to organize well yeah that reads charges and a hospital stereo system here in the frigerator oh yeah you gotta keep your juice cold right just goes right and you got bins very even marks a north in class well I like the job I did for 20 years I retired from my I was there a warehouse guy so I organized stuff one so it just came naturally it was interesting I thought everybody just had that natural been not true not too far and few between yeah anyway it kind of just it's just a natural way that I do things in even as I outfitted the shop you know one was just a building blank space it's like how do I do this no it's not real big a lot of shops are bigger because obviously tools to take up some room but you can see I actually just figure out what tools do I buy no matter what kind of shop needs spacing and I build this just like everything else I can actually move this to where I reckon modular anyway so so that's these three that were actually used in the domino thing ask what's that yes was that sound literally every tool in here with the inception of that spindle sander I used by the Domino project and that's kinda how I figured out what to start it right before bit I get used to all these on my project okay so if you can do God knows you'd be doing that's great that's great it's definitely inspiring yeah that's great [Music] you
