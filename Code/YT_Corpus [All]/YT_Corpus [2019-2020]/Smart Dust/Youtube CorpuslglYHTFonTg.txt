 hi guys welcome back to our YouTube channel in this video we are going to show you top 7 riskiest trends in technology you should look out for have you thought about having a secret spy at home what about senior double advancement in technology has given us things that have proven to be very practical and useful in today's world we cannot function without electronic devices such as smartphones laptops headphones and televisions as much as we rave about the positive impacts that this has led to we fail to look out for the negative destruction that this same advancement can cause there have been so many instances where technology has been misused and has fallen into the wrong hands starting from smart home devices such as Alexa and echo to the drones we make as science projects let us see how they can be harmful to us listed below are seven of the most dangerous technological trends that we should be cautious about number seven spying home devices have you ever thought about the home device that you own having personal information on you that could be used against you well think of it as a spy that you have invited into your home devices like Alexa and Google assistant have their clouds filled with various information about you like when you wake up and go to sleep the address and route to your house the food you eat the music you play and what you watch regularly your small habits are tracked by these electronic devices based on the information you feed into them and they can easily be hacked and can pose a threat to you these home devices are activated by voice recognition but can't our voices be simulated how much ever we try to protect ourselves by not initiating the device when not required and deleting the data in the cloud from time to time we are never truly safe with these assisting devices number six facial recognition facial recognition like voice recognition can be easily manipulated and can put our identities in danger imagine someone looking like you being able to unlock your phone most smartphones now have the feature of unlocking the phone with facial recognition some people claim this to be the highest form of data safety but people now know how to get past facial recognition using alarming methods have you seen those YouTube videos with people putting on makeup and trying to clone a person to unlock their phone using facial recognition while these videos might have harmless intentions not everyone has the same innocent intentions so wouldn't it be safer to just put a normal pin or password number 5 fake news bots have you ever read the news that you believed and found out was fake this technology has proven to be very menacing as organizations and governments have refrained from publishing important documents and news in fear of them being tampered with some systems use artificial intelligence as a way to put out fake news articles and information that are dangerously believed by people and this has led to them getting misled there are automated BOTS on Twitter that target people with a huge following to spread information that is not true at all these incredulous sources are being investigated but have not decreased over the years of digital advancement so check twice before you believe a tweet number 4 ransomware and AI enabled blackmailing and hacking as much as we praised artificial intelligence and it's practical uses it has many complaints in the cybersecurity field that is used by hackers to lure people into traps by tricking them into exposing their passwords and bank details you must have come across messages that ask your bank details claiming you to be the 9999 twin or so similarly ransomware is a system that technology does not give access to a computer without a ransom being paid these techniques have been mastered by many to commit cyber crimes which is very easy with a large population because if one does not work the other will well we should take care not to give out our personal information at any cost even if they tell that you have won 1 million dollars number 3 smart dust micro electromechanical systems commonly known as smart dust contains sensors mechanisms to monitor display and sound and other automated systems even though it is as tiny as a grain of salt its uses are highly impactful governments and organizations use it as a method of spying on critical enemies to protect their people from danger but if these tiny electrical grains fall in the wrong hands they can be used in malicious ways to invade the privacy of innocent victims and being so small it can go undetected so if anyone throws salt at you be smart about it number 2 AI cloning have you ever imagined seeing another youth unless you are of course a Twinner triplet but artificial intelligence systems are so advanced that they need just a recording of your voice or a few photos of yourself to create your clone clones and robots have been created for military purposes but there is a high chance of it being misused photo morphing and multimedia messaging services itself have proven to be very harmful when used in the wrong ways making clones using this technology can have fatal effects on an innocent person's identity these were used before to put down enemies and target high-profile people but now it is being used very commonly and that is a very disturbing thought number one drone swarms drones are familiar to everyone as they are made for projects and other purposes they are highly useful to get a wide view of an area for commercial purposes governments in the military have plans to use the mechanism of drone swarms that will communicate with each other for disaster relief and war techniques but you know how this can go wrong if these swarms are weaponized and they can function on their own they can prove to be extremely lethal for mankind even though the possibility of this happening is very low the advance in technology still makes it possible on some level it is a myth if it is said that something useful cannot be used in a derogatory manner everything in the world including science and technology can be used in a good way or a bad one that is on each individual to be cautious of this and be wary about trends in technology that can potentially turn out to be harmful rather than helpful now that you know these seven dangerous trends keep them in mind and educate others - all this is for today's video hope so you enjoyed it your likes comments and shares are appreciable for us and don't forget to subscribe our
