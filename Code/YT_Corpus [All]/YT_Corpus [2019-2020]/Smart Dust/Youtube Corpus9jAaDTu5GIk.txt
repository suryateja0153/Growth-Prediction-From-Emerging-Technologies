Don't do that. - Don't say that. - Mon, look, we're making the smart move here, you know that? - Mm. - I think you should keep going. - But I don't wanna go. Hey, I wanna stay, I wanna be here with you. - Come on, don't flip flop on me now. - I'm not. I mean that. (man sighs) - (laughs) Then what about tomorrow? We're just gonna be right back where we started. - It's not gonna happen. - [Man] I don't know. I don't know. - Look. We did a lot of shit wrong. Can't we just forgive all of that? Can we just at least try? I can be better. I promise. - But you said you were done. - I've had a lot of time to think. - You walked out of here five seconds ago. - Right, Jesus. I'm sorry.

(machines beeping) I'm sorry. I didn't build that part yet. (ominous music) (buzzing) (ominous music) - [Man] What is this? - Don't worry. (ominous music) I can fix this. Then, we can try again. (machines beeping) What were you gonna tell me a second ago? (buzzing) (ominous music) (muffled yelling) (computer buzzes) (sirens ring) (muffled yelling) (computer buzzes) (muffled yelling) (melancholy music) (toaster rattles) (melancholy music) - Did you forget something? Look, I'm tired, we're just gonna keep going in circles here. (melancholy music) What? (ominous music)
