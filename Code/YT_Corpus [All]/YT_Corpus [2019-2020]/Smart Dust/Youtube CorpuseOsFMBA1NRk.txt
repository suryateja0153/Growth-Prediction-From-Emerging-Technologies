 hey everyone welcome to social freelancer my name is Abhimanue it's been three days since I posted the video so right now I am here to make another video today's video is all about changing a camera lens without entering dust inside your camera body obviously some particles will enter your camera but you can avoid some risks when you are following this method wait let me show you everyone is trying to avoid the dust particle to get inside the camera body so one of the best method to avoid dust particle while removing a lens is hold your camera upside down not like this if you are removing your lens in this position with dust will definitely enter your camera body and what you have to do is hold your camera upside down and take your index finger and remove the lock from here from here and just rotate your lens and remove it okay as if you are removing the lens upside position some dust will definitely enter your camera body remove the lens in this position so there is less chance of entering that dust inside the body so make sure whether you are shooting in outdoor try to remove your lens in this position that will definitely help your camera body to avoid some risk due to the dust okay guys I hope you liked this video if you like this please to share subscribe and comment and don't forget to hit that Bell icon so that you will get notification from all my videos and we will keep in touch cheers guys I will see you in the next video
