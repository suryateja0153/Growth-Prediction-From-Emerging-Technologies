 hey guys welcome to another episode of the Wednesday checkup there's a ton of confusion and even some misinformation out there about antibody tests so I thought I'd set the record straight I'll give you the scoop on what happens when you're infected with Cova 19 how your immune system reacts and what's the deal with all these antibody tests should you be running out to get one I'll answer those questions and more starting now [Music] first things first let's talk about what happens if you're infected with kovat 19 well first you have to be exposed to someone who has covered 19 generally that person will either COFF or sneeze and expel respiratory droplets that then have to make contact with your mucous membranes your mouth your nose your eyes sometimes they'll land on your hand and then you'll make contact with your face then one of those viral particles will attach itself to one of your cells it will then make its way inside the cell and actually start making copies of itself using your own cellular machinery much like a Xerox machine those infected particles will start spreading throughout your body mostly through the upper and lower Airways that's where kovat 19 seems to thrive that's when your immune system kicks into high gear and starts kicking that viruses but however at the same time your immune system starts making antibodies that's a protein substance which actually gives you lasting immunity against a virus let's take chickenpox as an example if you're yet to get the virus that causes chickenpox your body fights it off clears it and then it creates these antibodies which serve as a lasting immunity generally speaking chickenpox is an illness that you get only once in your life because of these antibodies now let's move on and talk about the testing for these antibodies generally there are two types of tests qualitative and quantitative qualitative tests simply give us a yes-or-no answer whether there's a presence of antibodies at all for example if you've ever had a strep swab or a nasal flu swab those are qualitative tests positive or negative only quantitative tests give us a numerical value which establishes how many antibodies are existing in our blood these are generally higher end tests that we actually have to send out to a lab through a blood sample let's summarize what we know now you get infection with Cova 19 your immune system kicks that spot clears it creates a lasting immunity through a protein substance known as an antibody we can test for this antibody so shouldn't we give this test to as many people as possible so we can send them out into the workforce because they're protected not so fast there's actually three problems with these antibody tests I'm about to let you know about problem number one is we simply don't have enough information on what to do with the results of these tests for example let's say you go out and get a qualitative test and you get a positive result all that really tells us is that you've had kovat 19:00 it doesn't quite tell us about your level of immunity because perhaps you had a really mild case and your immune system didn't build up enough antibodies to protect you for the next time so the solution might be let's get a quantitative test well that's better and you're gonna get a numerical value telling us how many antibodies are present however we then need to rely on reference ranges let me explain reference ranges if you've ever gotten a test to see if you're immune to measles you get a numerical value back and then we look at reference ranges to see if it's above this value then you know the person's immune if it falls in between these two numbers their immunities falling and they likely need another booster shot and if it's below this value they're definitely not immune and they should get a booster ASAP with kovat 19 whatever number we get is great it might be accurate but we don't have these reference ranges set up like we do with measles of which we have decades worth of research kovat 19 is a novel virus these reference ranges take years to develop so it's gonna take some time until we know what's what and the final point of all this is we don't know how long the immunity lasts perhaps you do have antibodies perhaps you are immune for how long is that immunity gonna last is it gonna be one week one month one year or a lifetime you don't know that information yet but we will soon the second problem here is poor quality tests there's over a hundred of these tests on the market with only four of them being FDA approved through an EU a that's the emergency use authorization it essentially allows companies with limited evidence but still decent evidence to show that the FDA their products actually work think about the dozens that are out there that are really poor quality manufactured god-knows-where and can be giving questionable results problem number three the false positive rate look no test is perfect they all have a margin of error and one of the examples of that is a false positive rate where it tells you you're positive but you're actually not it's flat-out wrong and some of the best tests have a 5% false positive rate that sounds pretty good but let's take this exam into consideration picture yourself in a town of a hundred people and five of those people have had Koba 19 and cleared it and the government wants to use this antibody test to find out who those five people are they're gonna give the test to everybody and they're gonna find out five people have had it but because it has a five percent false positive rates five other individuals will also test positive even though they've never had kovat 19 that makes for a total of ten positive tests five of which are accurate it means a 50 percent accuracy not so accurate because the prevalence of the disease is quite low but when the prevalence of the disease goes up say 50 people have had it in this town you have 50 people test positive correctly five people test positive incorrectly when you do the math that over 90% accuracy you see how the prevalence of an illness can affect the accuracy of a test that false positive rate really needs to be taken into consideration when we use it in areas with a low prevalence of kovat 19 all that goes to show that you as an individual should not run out to get tested for kovat 19 antibodies we just don't yet know what to do with the information we can't tell you if you're 100% immune even if you do test positive the last thing we want you to do is think you have a layer of security when you truly do not what we can use this information for is on a state on a government level to see where kovat 19 is prevalent how many people have had Cova 19 and not even known it what's the true fatality rate of this virus and which areas can we start loosening - social restrictions in to get our economy back these antibody test is really important but it's not important to us as individuals it's important to us as a whole nation please if you have any questions about these antibody tests leave them down below I'm gonna be super active in my comment section and check out this video where I interviewed 100 doctors or check out this video where I interviewed the man himself doctor foul Qi
