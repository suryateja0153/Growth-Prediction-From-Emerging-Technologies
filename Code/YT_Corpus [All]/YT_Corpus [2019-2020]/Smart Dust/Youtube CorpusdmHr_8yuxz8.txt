 Say you've just started learning how to work with wood and you happen to have a cheap shop vacuum Some spare tubes & a plastic bucket. Oh, yeah, and did I mention a lot of sawdust? What could you do with all that? Yes, a cyclone dust collector! I have seen similar designs made by others on YouTube and I wanted to find out whether it actually works or is it just a myth? So I decided to give it a try given that I already have most if not all of the components So the basic idea seems to be that you add a bucket on the way to the main vacuum Using gravity to collect heavier bits of dust or shavings and separate them from the vacuum filter pretty a smart and simple isn't it. The component amusing come from another scrap vacuum that I disassembled few days before and they happen to match to each other almost perfectly Now I need to connect this random bucket to the vacuum somehow I'm going to use this rigid tube for two elements Firstly as a connector between the two other tubes and secondly as the input tube into the bucket itself, hence I needed to cut it into two pieces Once that was done I checked if the parts are matching as I expected The black vacuum tube and my freshly cut connector happened to be ordinarily the same diameter So I decided to try weaken the material and somehow force the tube onto the connector It worked out okay, but it's a really tight field I may need to improve that bit later on Now I need to make two holes in the bucket - input and output There are many ways to do it but I wanted to check how my router works with plastic - you could probably get away with a knife or scissors easily It turned out to not be the best idea as it left a lot of ugly tear out on the material - potentially due to the heat generated during the process. But the end result was roughly what I wanted in a reasonable amount of time After a quick suction test I carried on adding the input pole using similar technique and marking the whole position with a sharpie With both of the holes done I decided to give it another quick test by putting all components in place, though I was pretty sure lack of any kind of seals would cause a massive loss of suction yet It worked a little bit still which at this point was really promising Now the sealing problem can be solved in many ways I'm sure but I decided I need another excuse to play around with my 3d printer So I went ahead and designed some sort of a threaded Inlet which with a little bit of turning force would press the seal to the brackets wall and hold the input tube in place at the same time After about three hours of printing later, I was ready to test this concept Because the inlet is threaded it was really easy to mount it to the buckets wall The nut provides enough force to keep the two parts tightly connected to the bucket Unfortunately, I overestimated the inlet diameter and have to add in some paper shim in order to provide a tight fit for the input tube I also added some cable ties to enforce the connections between any of the hoses Which an addition should support the suction throughout the system Next I decided to slightly improve the inlet by fitting a round piece of rubber made of an old bicycle tube It should make the connection sealed well enough I also decided to use the same technique to seal the bucket's lid which required a little bit more work, but it did the trick With the lid ready I came across another problem. The seal was pointless if the lid wasn't fixed in place around the rim Technically when the vacuum is on it's being pulled downward, but I wasn't convinced that's enough. Plus I can easily imagine what's gonna happen one day when a container like this is going to fall over when full with some sawdust so it did some more 3d printing and Experimented with a custom-made G clamp, but I wasn't too successful this time Then the solution came easier than expected the bucket I purchased for this project turned out to have its hinges mounted an External piece of plastic which I decided to drill through and attach the lid to it with tiny screws I made just for this purpose It looked okay so I decided to give it a proper test - just for a minute I could act just like the government - create a problem and then try solving it heroically Overall I think I'm happy with the result as you can see the dust is getting separated into the bucket and very little dirt is going into the vacuum chamber This is exactly what I was expecting so I can call it a day Thanks for watching Feel free to ask any questions and the feedback will be appreciated and as usual like and subscribe for more projects like this
