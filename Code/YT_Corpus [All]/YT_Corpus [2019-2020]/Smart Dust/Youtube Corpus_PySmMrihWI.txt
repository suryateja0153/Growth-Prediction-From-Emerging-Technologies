 the new one +70 this guy has some battle scars from our last video but it's still currently functioning today we're gonna see what holds this 70 together and see what it looks like from the inside let's get started taking apart a glass back foam is already pretty difficult but with a strong enough suction cup and a lot of heat it's doable if the back glass panel has cracks it does make it hard for the suction cup to get any suction since air can use those cracks to get underneath the suction cup which inhibits the suckage I had better luck putting my suction cup on the uncracked portion of the glass but if you ever encounter a totally shattered back putting some clear packing tape on the panel to cover those cracks and sucking the suction cup to the top of the tape also works pretty well now that the adhesive is sliced away from underneath the glass and I still have all my fingers it's time to see what's under this Oreo I mean camera hole the inside of the phone is a stealthy black design black plastics black battery with a red battery pull tab and 11 screws holding down the top plastics once those screws are removed the top plastics can pull away from the phone attached to these plastics are the NFC coils and the rear dual LED flash that circles around to the underside of those plastics and has its own cold contact pads these communicate with the motherboard the large circular cutout that makes up the exterior camera lens is mostly for aesthetics much of the circle inside of the phone is just empty space since the triple camera unit is still inside a rectangular metal housing the large circle does make the phone design stand out though which is probably what oneplus was after I will snap the battery connector like a little Lego along with the four other ribbons running down along the bottom of the motherboard each of these ribbon connections is surrounded by a red rubber gasket which helps out considerably with water resistance the bottom plastics have seven screws holding them in place all phillips-head just like the top pulling off the plastics we see it also contains the loudspeaker the loudspeaker does have two circle stickers in each of the corners we can peel up these stickers to see if it has any of those little white foam balls and would you look at that it does same as the iPhone and newer Samsung phone the little foam ball baffled technology exists as well here in the oneplus 70 the little balls kind of break up the air inside of the speaker to allow it to sound bigger than it actually is the other little circular sticker covers up a much smaller hole which probably allowed the air inside the speaker to escape as they were filling it up with foam I'll put the stickers back into place and let's go deeper into the phone there is a long extension ribbon going from the motherboard to the bottom board I'll remove that and set it down off to the side before we get too deep though here's a fun little background image for you crank up the resolution on the YouTube video screen shot this and crop it to match your phone background that way you can appreciate the inside of your phone while it's still safely remaining in one piece lucky for us the black battery does have its own pull tab thumbs up for that and look at this apparently I've made a huge mistake it says right here that the battery is not removable then I went ahead and already removed it I guess that's what I get for not reading the instructions first I've gone and done the impossible ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live my life this is a 3,800 milliamp hour capacity I'll set it down off to the side we can pretend that I never removed it after I reassemble the phone again one thing that's super cool about this one plus 70 is that oneplus obviously put a lot of thought into how the internals look with red rubber accents everywhere including on the inside of there dual SIM card tray the phone looks good from the inside and definitely has water resistance all unsnap three more of the little ribbon cables down here at the bottom and then pop the little board out from inside the phone this little board is mostly the SIM card tray and one of the bottom microphones the USBC charging port is its own little unit and also has a red rubber ring accent to spice things up the oneplus 70 can charge at an impressive 30 watts going back to the water resistance we can see that the loudspeaker port is protected by the water resistant mesh there is of course no water resistant rating on the oneplus 70 but it has all the characteristics of a phone that should have an IP rating there is an under screen camera down here as well this is for the in screen optical fingerprint sensor along with a white square next to the SIM card tray this is a water damage indicator that turns pink when it gets wet now for the top of the phone this one +70 has two more Phillips head screws holding in the motherboard with another white water damage indicator next to the volume rocker the front-facing cameras here in the center of the phone it hides up inside the teardrop notch and is 16 megapixels films video in 1080p and has no optical image stabilization pulling the motherboard out reveals a whole lot more blue inside of the phone the metal anodizing process that colors the phone has done to the entire frame before the internal hardware is added this adds the color to the inside before the phones even assemble there is quite a bit of thermal paste on the back and a super long metal bracket that's holding down the lingo style camera connectors I'll remove the rubber stopper holding the metal bracket in place and then unlatch the bracket so we get the cameras out more red rubber gasket surround you should be connectors once those are unclipped we get our first close-up look at the three cameras the camera module is flipped right now so the 12 megapixel 2 x optical zoom is over here on the left the 48 megapixel main cameras in the center and the 16 megapixel wide-angle lens is over on the right side only that Center camera has optical image stabilization but also remember that this camera contraption can take close-up macro pictures of things that are 2.5 centimeters away from the lens most smartphones cannot do that there is an abundance of thermal paste underneath the motherboard oneplus is again using the aluminum frame of the phone as a heatsink which is fine there is a small circular vibrator motor up at the top the unusual thing about the 70 though are the dual speakers up here at the top of the phone sometimes when a phone manufacturer claims to have stereo speakers in their phone they just bump up the volume on the tiny earpiece and call it a day iPhones and Samsung's both do this but oneplus has actually added a whole different larger speaker up here at the top bringing our total number of speakers inside this one plus 72 3 it's pretty safe to say that a larger speaker has better sound quality than a smaller speaker so it's cool that oneplus has done this but also weird that they aren't bragging more about it once I get the speaker and its rear magnet out of the phone we can see that the top loudspeaker is directly channelled out the front of the phone on the opposite side of the grille from the regular earpiece speaker because of that larger speaker now at the and the bottom this 70 should theoretically sound better at loud volumes than most other smartphones claiming to have stereo speakers inside the speaker the surround is made from rubber meaning that it will survive a bit of moisture as well and of course the magnet on the back is what makes the whole thing work overall it's a pretty sleek little phone the screen is still glued into the frame of course like normal so screen replacements would still be pretty difficult but other than the back glass cracking during the bin test it seems to be a good little phone there has been a lot of attention to detail on the inside with plenty of water resistance and that extra loudspeaker there are so many good smartphones out there these days it's kind of hard to choose a bad one it's mostly all about finding a smartphone with the features that line up with what you need and most importantly just make sure you get a case let me know what you think down in the comments do you like this new Oreo design coming out me on Instagram and Twitter and thanks a ton for watching I'll see you around
