 (suspenseful music) - Is this even legal? - Well, it's not illegal. Of course, it'll be easier for everyone if you exercise discretion. - [Oliver] So you'd get your memories backed up too, then Andrew? - Consider it a benefit of becoming a partner. - Is it a benefit or a condition? - Oh. It's an insurance policy. You know, I've been watching you for a long time Oliver. You've earned this, you really have. You're a hell of a lawyer. You're smart, relentless. Not afraid of a fight. We need to protect you. And us. And what about your family? If we can't afford to lose you, what about them? Your wife, Talia, your son. You think about that Oliver. (piano music) Excellent mate. It's really wonderful. - You really think so? - No. I know so. That's not an easy piece to play. You're much better than I ever was. - [Heath] Oh, cool. - Mr. Klein? See you now. - Now listen mate, I've got to go get my snapshot done, but how 'bout when I get home, you play that for me in person, all right? - Yeah, that'd be great, Dad! Thanks! - Good man. Love you buddy. - Okay, I'll see you in a bit. - Bye. - (suspenseful music) - So Oliver, how's work? - You know, same old, same old. - Yeah, I doubt that. I'm sure your firm doesn't pay for monthly back-ups for the sheer pleasure of spending cash. - My partners just want, what's your slogan again? "Peace of mind forever." - Yeah, a piece of your mind anyway. How's your family? - They're good. Heath's got a piano recital next month. He's been practicing like a madman. The tune has been stuck in my head for weeks. There's um dum dum dum da dum. I'm not doing it any justice. - No. - I don't have a musical bone in my body. Heath gets all of his talent from his mother's side. - My daughter's obsessed with the violin. She wants one for her seventh birthday. - It's good that she's enthusiastic. - Yeah, like I can afford one though. Not like my ex is gonna help with much. Same playlist today? - Mmm. Yeah. - I'm going to monitor the download from the control room, okay? - [Emma] Please say your name, the date, and identity code. - My name is Oliver Micheal Klein, backup date is July 5, 2019. IDC is 3663 Green. - [Emma] Thank you Mr. Klein, starting the download. (whooshing) (upbeat music) - Hey, Emma, we done yet? Emma! I gotta get going. (electronic beeping) (suspenseful whooshing) - Oh, you're awake already. How are you feeling Mr. Worth? - Where are my things? I told my family I would be home for dinner. - Your things are right there. I didn't know you had a family. Something wrong Mr. Worth? - Mr. Klein. - That's my next patient. Are you sure you're feeling all right? - I'm feeling a little bit disorientated. I think I'm gonna be sick. (door opening) (door closing) (heart beating) - Mr. Worth? You all right? (gasping) (knocking) Mr. Worth? (knocking) Gavin? Gavin we had a deal. I'll need you to verify your identity. Can you please give me your IDC? Gavin stop it. You're hurting me. - Stop calling me Gavin. I'm Oliver. Oliver Micheal Klein. July the Fifth. 3663 Green. - Oh shit. - What the fuck's happening Emma? - Gavin asked me to rewind his. I must've-- - I. - You're not Oliver Klein, you're just his most recent backup. That's all. - I swear when I looked in that mirror. - The brain sometimes, it shortcuts. Sometimes we see what we expect to see. We call that a phantom self. - Well where the fuck's my actual self? - Come with me back to the lab. Come on. I can fix this. - Okay. - Yeah? - Okay, good. - Wait. - How? - I'll just overwrite-- - Just need to overwrite what? Emma? Overwrite me? And then what happens? - I put Mr. Worth back. - Yeah, yeah. But, what happens to me? Oh no. No. No, you can't do that to me. - But you're not you. You're just a backup of you, of Oliver Klein's memories, his conscious memories. The real you, he's just walking around out there. He's completely unaware of (boom) - You're talking about killing me. Look, there may be another version of me out there, Emma. But I'm every bit me, okay? Do you hear me? - What about Mr. Worth? That's his body. We don't know how that's gonna change you. - Don't do anything stupid, Emma. I mean it. - Goodbye Mr. Worth. - Dr. Pa. - Everything all right, Emma? - Yeah. Mr. Worth, he can just be-- - An arsehole? - Difficult. - I know. (paper rustling) (elevator dings) - Sorry mate, running late. - [Elevator] Restoration going up. (doors slamming) (car dings) - Hey, Emma! Sorry. (metal clacking) (electronic dinging) Everything okay? - Everything's fine. Thanks Mr. Klein. It's fine.
