 Dust of Snow Introduction Robert Frost (1874–1963) was born in San Francisco, California, but the death of his father, when he was eleven, necessitated the removal of the family to Lawrence, Massachusetts. Thus, Frost's poetry is based largely on a sensitive awareness of a New England environment. One of the most familiar techniques Frost employs in his poems is to draw a human significance, a kind of moral lesson after describing a scene or an incident. Best known for his shorter lyrics, Frost lived in the country and loved the natural way of life just as Wordsworth did. He admired qualities of honesty, simplicity, love and hard work. At the centre of most of his poems lies an antithesis between fact and fancy, reality and imagination, pleasure and purpose, nature and civilization, country and city. Finally, the resolution emerges from his dramatization of such a reconciliation. The poem 'Dust of Snow’ presents a moment that seems simple but has a larger significance. We come to know how the touch of nature in the shape of the dust of snow changes his mood for the better. Dust of Snow - Summary The poet is wandering in the lap of nature. He is regretful because the day has not been fruitful for him. Then, suddenly, a crow sitting in a hemlock tree shakes off the dust of snow onto him. His desperate mood was changed, and instead he felt solace and joy. The poet proclaims that some part of his day was saved because of this incident.
