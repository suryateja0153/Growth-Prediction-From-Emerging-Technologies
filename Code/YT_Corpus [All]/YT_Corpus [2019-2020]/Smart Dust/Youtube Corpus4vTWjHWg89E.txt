 I built this mobile miter stand five years  ago and it's been a workhorse in my shop.   It's got some great features like the folding wings  obviously the mobility and an awesome stop block   system plus the automated vacuum it's been a great addition to the shop but it's time to say goodbye and say hello to the new miter saw station all right we're ready to add the miter saw into the station but the problem is i don't have power right here here's the only outlet on this wall and i've got to go through three studs to get into  this bay so i'm just going to take the whole strip out at once and it's going to make patching it  a lot easier now odds are if you're working in a garage you're going to need to add some outlets to your walls at some point unless you love tripping over extension cords i like using a multi-tool with a drywall blade on it to follow the lines that i've drawn out after making the cuts with a multi-tool i started prying out a piece of drywall i was trying to be gentle here so that i didn't  snap it and just make more work for myself and after a little finessing and some cutting  with my utility knife i got the patch out in   one piece i drilled holes through the center of  the studs to run the wire and i probably should   have made the opening a bit bigger and gone above  where the box was going to be but this worked out   okay i even got to make a little insulation cotton  candy now then i ran a piece of wire back through   the holes to the box i'm not going to get into  the details of the connection and wiring of the   box here there's plenty of great resources out  there for your specific situation you can look up   just make sure you follow all your local  codes if you're going to do it yourself   now before putting the drywall back in place  i nailed some wire protectors over the studs   i've heard some people don't use them  frankly i think that's pretty shocking   next i needed a cutout for the new box that  i put in so i transferred the measurements   to the drywall and made the plunge cuts with the  multi-tool and when i installed that patch back   in it fit like a glove i drove in the  screws at all the stud locations above   and below the cut lines and then i  can move on to repairing the drywall   i still hate doing drywall but coming off of that  wall repair and my bathroom remodel i just did   i felt like i was in a groove i got it done in  just three coats which is like a record for me   and after a little primer and paint it was looking  good the electrical work and the drywall's all   finished up and i got this nice new outlet and it  doesn't look like much but that took a lot of work   if you don't feel comfortable doing that make  sure you get a licensed electrician but now we can   finally get started on installing the miter saw  and we're going to start with a shelf to put it on   i measured the area between the cabinets and it  wasn't perfectly square but it was close enough   now the shelf is three quarter inch bolted  birch just like the rest of the cabinets   and i cut it a little over size that  i can trim it to the final width later   i drilled pocket holes in the underside to  attach the front trim as well now my wood bin   is a treasure trove of offcuts and i found a stick  of maple that i used for the trim on the cabinets   and this is going to match it just  right with a few milling operations   i have the trim cut down to size and ready  for install the trim gets attached with glue   and pocket screws that i had just drilled  to hold it tight while the glue is drying and after it was dry i took the panel over  to my buddy fred and i trimmed it to the   exact width of the opening well exactly to the  smallest size of the unsquare opening i guess   i'm going to use some small cleats made from  plywood to attach the shelf to the cabinets   so i went ahead and ripped those  down and cut them to size as well   i have the little strips on my mouth that are  going to hold the shelf and those are going to   go down so that the top of the shelf will be four  inches below the surface i found that four inches   seems to take into account most of the miter saws  that are out there there might be some that are   more than that so make sure that you measure  your own miter saw but mine's actually about   three and three quarters and i'm going to shim  up from there and then that way if i switch the   miter saw out i won't have to move this i can just  shim it to a different rate for the next miter saw   i pre-drilled holes in the cleats for the screws  and then i set my combination square to four   inches plus the thickness of my plywood now a  quick shot with my nail gun held it in place so   that i could drive in the screws and i checked it  again with my combination square before securing   it in place now both cleats are also cut a little  shorter and set back so that they won't interfere   with the trim on the front edge of the shelf i'm  about to move the miter saw over but before i do i   want to address some questions that i had in the  last video i've gotten a lot of questions about   why am i getting rid of the miter saw stand and  moving into the miter saw station and going from   mobile to the wall mount first of all i love  this thing this is one of my favorite projects   that i've built between this one and the flip top  plans available down below link in the description   but between these two pieces they have been great  work horses in the workshop it just adds a ton of   flexibility with the folding wings in the stop  block on here this is this has just been huge   having that stop block so it's not about the  functionality at all this still works great   the original plan was not actually to have a  space it was just to add two more cabinets of   the 30 inch wall cabinets in base that i had but  what i quickly realized is that i'm going to have   all of this countertop on the top of these base  cabinets and so i thought i want to do double duty   and so i turned this into the miter saw station  so what's going to happen is i'm going to be able   to get rid of the mobile miter saw station the  rolling wood cart as well as this rackety wood   rack so that's kind of the the reasoning behind  it is really just to better utilize my space so   up to you for your shop do you want mobility and  do you really need to put everything against the   wall when you're done or are you going to have  storage and for me it was just an evolution   so that's what it is hope that answers it  for you guys now let's get this saw on there   i unplugged the saw and i took the bolts  out that were holding it down and then i   huffed it on over to the shelf when i came  back i was having minor heart palpitations   seeing all the dust stored up under the miter  saw so i grabbed the most used tool in my shop   the vacuum and i sucked everything up and the  world was right again i know i've got problems   i've got it in here and the biggest concern i have  right now is the dust collection because i've got   it almost up against the wall these are 20 inch  deep cabinets and i wanted those so they have   low profile but that doesn't give me a lot of room  also i can't use the slider so right now i've got   nine inches of actual space between the  fence and the edge right here which is more   than what i had on the mobile miter saw stand  i'm gonna use the shop vac for the time being   with the automated switch which i'll show you  here in a minute so i'm going to figure out what   the right position is and i'm going to have to  figure out some fittings to make that hose work   i put the hose in the sawz dustport and i was  moving it from side to side to see how it would   react to the full motion for my saw now the  right side seemed to get stuck a little more   often since the bevel lock is over on that side  so i decided to go with the hose on the left to   make sure that it would stay free and not be  caught on anything i made a mark on the back   of the shelf and i used a roll of electrical  tape to trace for the cutout for the hose   a jigsaw makes short work of the cut  and it was a perfect fit for my hose   and while i was on the bench i put a couple coats  of polyurethane on the shelf for some protection   while the finish was drying on the shelf it was  a good time for a little maintenance on the miter   saw with the help of the sponsor of this video  wd40 company i vacuumed off all the dust and i   tried to get into those little nooks and crannies  but beyond cleaning it i also wanted to give the   moving parts a little love too so i cleaned  the pull-down spring and i sprayed on some   wd-40 specialist dry lube with ptfe it's perfect  for dusty situations like this because it dries   in seconds leaving the parts lubricated without  the dust attracting grease or liquid left behind   it also works great on saw blades and bits  keeping pitch and resin from building up   which lets you clean your blades less  often and reduces the burning on your cuts   use the link in the description to  check out the whole specialist lineup   and thanks to wd-40 company for sponsoring this  video i'll be using the same dust collection   setup as my mobile stand at least to start off  with so i pulled everything out to transfer it   over the setup is pretty simple but this yellow  box here is where the magic happens it's an   ivac automated vacuum switch and it triggers  the shop vac when the miter saw is turned on   then it runs for a few seconds afterwards as well  i'd like to hard pipe in a four inch hose at some   point but that'll be a whole undertaking since my  dust collector is on the other side of the shop   and this setup works pretty well i countersunk  some holes in the shelf and set it in place for   a test fit then i ran the power and vacuum lines  through the hole that i drilled out to see how   everything fit and moved so getting the right  fittings for dust collection is always a hassle   and i have this hose here that don't have a great  fitting to go into the back of the miter saw which   is not a standard size so i bought a 3d printer  about a year ago and i've been playing around with   it for a while but it's really cool to be able  to do things like this i printed up this little   transition that will go from the miter saw into  the hose but my machine was maybe 250 bucks and   i've been using it to make cool little things like  this and i think it's going to pay off for itself   in the long run so this was a cool one it only  took me a few hours to design and print it now let   me know in the comments if you guys want to see  some more 3d printing and i'll share it if there's   some interest here the hose was catching on the  vacuum switch power cord so i installed a right   angle extension cord and then it cleared just fine  i also realized i wanted the shelf a little bit   further forwards said it was flush with the tops  and not the doors i drilled another set of holes   i rounded over the now exposed corners and then i  attached the shelf to the cleats i used the same   maple spacers from the mobile stand and when i  put the level across everything it was very close   now the saw was just a little bit lower and i  used some playing cards to fit under the level   to know how much i needed to shim it up then i  moved those cards under the maple spacers and i   secured the saw with the same bolts that i'd used  before now pulling the shell forward did leave a   gap in the back so i made my first cut on the new  miter saw station to get a filler strip oh yeah   i am gonna like this so for a stop block system  for the miter saw stand i'm gonna be using some   craig mini track and i'm just going to route some  little channels into the top now unfortunately unfortunately i just dropped that but also  unfortunately i just spent a lot of time   getting this exactly level and i didn't think  about the fact that i'm gonna have to route the   channel into the top so i'm gonna have to remove  that and on top of that i also did not plan at all   for where i placed the fasteners into this top  meaning the screws as well as the brad nails   to hold in the cleaning and the trim so i have  a potential minefield of metal just waiting to   destroy my router bit inside of this top so don't  be like me and plan ahead for where your track is   going to go that would be the smart thing to do  but i do have a little metal detector that i'm   going to see if this will help me find that metal  in there i'm also going to review the footage   from the past videos and see if i can figure out  where it's at wish me luck before taking off the   saw i did screw down the maple spacers to make  reinstall a little bit easier and after the saw   was out i tried to do a little detective work  to find those nails and screws and apparently   my microphone was off so it sounded something like  this beep beep beep i was able to find the screws   and some of the me nails but i just tried to  avoid the screws because there was a lot of brads   now i don't have an edge guide so i used a long  strip of half inch mdf cut to size that would put   my bit right where i wanted it for the t-track i  also temporarily glued on a block of wood at the   end of the cut to prevent blow out on that  edge the track is only 3 8 of an inch tall   so i set the router to take it all in one pass  and i've got to be honest here this was by far   the worst part of the project for me now you all  know how i feel about dust and i was dreading this   but susan helped me out and she followed  along with the hose from the dust collector   and one of those big gulp attachments which  all together this was extremely loud so we were   geared up in our isotunes ear protection a susan's  wearing the new muffs that they just introduced   and i'm using the extra 2.0 i love these things  and you can get 10 off any pair using code ftbt   via the link below in the description these really  help to drown out the failures of your projects   even with susan following me with  the dust hose this made a huge mess   i'm gonna be having nightmares  about this until valentine's day i also routed a small recess for the  metal measuring tape that i'll be using   this one was a walk in the park compared to that  dust storm when i was done i brought the miter   saw back and installed it on the shelf so that  i could cut the t-track easier and while i was   at it i went ahead and cut down the hose on the  shop vac now this should help improve the dust   collection at least a tiny little bit i used two  four foot sections of the t-track and the first   one i used was a full stick so i just pre-drilled  the holes and installed it with some small screws   the second piece did need to be cut and i did that  on the miter saw you can cut aluminum with carbide   tooth blades just go slow and you'll be fine now  the track sat just below the surface and now it's   ready for a stop block which i'll be making from  some more plywood i glued up a little block of   wood for the stop block and what i'm going to  do is actually put a little flip stop on the   end and i'm going to make that out of some eighth  inch steel plate here so it'll be nice and sturdy   i made some rough layout marks and then i  cut the metal plate with my portabend now if   you don't have steel or the tools to cut it you  can also make this out of aluminum or even wood   since i am using steel i rounded the sharp  edges and the corners with my grinder   then i eyeballed where the stop needed to go  and i drilled a quarter inch hole through it   for my rotation point after that i  drilled a matching quarter inch hole   through the length of the stop block  and that's where that bolt's gonna go   i'm using a strip of maple to guide the stop block  in the t-track and i cut it to size and then i cut   a matching groove down the middle of the block on  the table saw and after gluing the maple runner   into place i drilled another hole through the  center of the block for the locking hardware   i laid out where the t-bolt would go and then i  started chiseling out the notch for the top of   the t-bolt head and apparently hard maple doesn't  take kindly to getting pounded with a chisel oh no but the joke's on him because i've cracked  more wood than jack torrance and i know a quick   glue job fixes a clean split easy peasy so  after i finished clearing out the notch i   glued the runner back on and we were back in  business i also wanted one of those adjustable   indicators on the stop block so that i could  read the ruler just like on my old setup   so i cleared a spot out on the bottom corner with  a forstner bit and my chisel then i drilled a   slot through the bolt so i can make some fine  adjustments to it now the visual indicator is   just some eighth inch polycarbonate that i cut to  size then i scored a line on it and filled that   line in with red marker and then i removed the  rest that was on the surface with alcohol and it   left behind the red line that worked surprisingly  well i countersunk a hole in the polycarbonate and   then i was ready to assemble the stop block i get  all the parts now and here's how the stop block   goes together i did actually drill another hole  uh to put the knob back a little bit further but   uh here is the piece and also i did put a little  notch in it so it wouldn't knock out the acrylic   the acrylic thing the metal flip stop goes  in i have a little spacer slash washer there   and then a lock nut so that this will stay in  place on the back side we have the uh the little   indicator i guess we'll call it indicator and  that little red line in there works really cool   so this little guy just goes up into the bottom  and uh did make the slot so that's adjustable   this was off the design by jay bates when he  did it made a stop block for his miter station all right and then i can adjust  this part back and forth as i   need to and we'll do that in just  a minute on the miter saw station   and then to finish it off just have a little  t-bolt i'm going to put this through the back hole and there we go kind of looks like a  monstrosity but it's going to work well   let's get it installed i set the stop block in the  track and i grabbed a 23 and a quarter inch board   that i had left over it's just a random length and  i used that to mark the approximate spot where the   tape measure should read 23 and a quarter inches  then i pulled out the stop block and i installed   the adhesive tape measure into the recess slot i  lined it up with that mark that i had just made   after that i could fine-tune my indicator using  a few cuts of that scrap wood and then making the   adjustments from the top i got it dialed in and i  was good to go i'm really loving this stop block   the flip stop works awesome and it is totally  solid with no flex to it now this whole miter saw   station really came together just how i wanted it  i am pumped to put it to use in my future projects   and add some storage under the cabinets and  possibly hard pipe in some dust collection later   if you want to build your own miter station i  have plans available for you there's a link down   below in the description you can also get plans  for the mobile stand if that's more your style   but i want to help you achieve your  workshop goals whatever they are   so i want to give a big thank you to all those  folks that have been joining the builders club   and i'll catch you guys on the next video  where we're going to build something awesome
