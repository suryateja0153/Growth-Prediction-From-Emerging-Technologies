speaker by clicking on the blue speaker bio widget on the console toolbar let me turn things over to our presenter sure the floor is yours thank you william hello everyone uh welcome to our webinar today i'm going to talk on 60 gigahertz radar sensors from ti let's get to the basics first uh for some of you who might be new to millimeter wave technology millimeter wave is really that band of spectrum from 30 gigahertz to 300 gigahertz and the millimeter wave sensors can typically provide three main information when it detects an object at what range or distance the object is or a person is with what velocity or the speed the person or the object is moving towards or away from the sensor and at what angle it is located so these three are the main information which a radar sensor can provide and it can work in any challenging environmental condition be it extreme sunlight complete darkness cold heat of snow doesn't matter millimeter wave sensor can provide accurate uh information in all of these conditions and texas instruments is offering a portfolio of sensors both in 60 as well as 77 gigahertz in a single chip form factor solution and it's also extremely low power because of our rf cmos technology and it is highly integrated with memory on-chip processing without the need for additional mcu and it's also a scalable portfolio across automotive and industrial applications and you can reuse the software as well and we are also innovating with offering antenna on package technology which you if you consider traditionally it has been the antenna on the pcb and also we are offering imaging radar which can provide lidar like performance at the lowest cost point and we are investing both in the automotive as well as industrial application let's get into details on each of the sectors where radar sensors can be used first building automation here you can see some of the use cases both outdoor as well as typical indoor applications the main goal here for building automation is really to automate the sensors thereby increasing the efficiency of the system to take an example uh for traffic monitoring example the sensor's goal is really to control the condition by counting the number of cars in a particular lane or how long it should wait for the red light signal the other example for example in automated gates and doors today if you see without a radar sensor the door keeps opening even if there is a bird or some object coming in front of the doors with radar sensors you can actually determine when exactly to open the door and thereby conserve the ac for example and in the indoor space the goal is really to identify how the occupancy is of the occupants or the people and also to see if there is a particular pattern in the motion of the people for example in elderly care it would be really worthwhile to determine if the person has fallen and then report the incident accordingly and privacy is a key concern here hence radar technology especially 60 gigahertz sensor shines and is a very good sensor for this applications the second use case is what we call factory automation use cases and with the advent of industry 4.0 protocol the goal really is to increase the interaction between the humans and the robots or the machines and you can see it could be used both outdoor as well as indoor applications one example could be autonomous delivery here the radar sensor could be used to detect obstacles around the sensors including humans and help it maneuver from point a to point b and thereby increasing its own dependence and dependence on the humans lesser the other application here similar application is robotic lawn mowers and on the indoor applications if you have seen in the factory automation setups uh the robotic arms for example could make use of radar sensors to determine if there is any humans around and thereby control its behavior in a safe manner as well and some of the other applications listed here are cleaning robots or driverless forklifts of 60 gigahertz and including in some cases 77 gigahertz sensors are a perfect fit for these applications the third automotive use case which we are going to discuss here mainly from the point of 60 gigahertz use case is in cabin sensing which is gaining a lot of traction these days primarily from the point of view of child presence detection which has found its place in a euro and cap roadmap hence a lot of car manufacturers are going ahead to implement this function in addition to that there are also other functions such as seat belt reminder occupant monitoring which a single sensor can provide at the cost of you know replacing all additional uh sensors such as weight sensors it could also be used for counting occupants a good examples would be uh detection or counting of children inside of school bus and radar could also be used for detection of vital sign of a driver and detect this fatigue state and we are also seeing some gesturing applications for control of hmi or even interior lighting and control and 60 gigahertz radar is a very good sensor to address these applications so here i want to introduce our 60 gigahertz as well as 77 gigahertz radar portfolio uh with more onus on 60 gigahertz sensors if you notice here we really have a scalable portfolio of sensors we call our sensors starting with xwr standing for basins and awr stands for automotive license radar iwr in our portfolio stands for industrial license radar and in the 16 year hertz portfolio at the very middle you can see xwr 6443 device is our lowest cost sensor today in our portfolio it has integrated transceivers comes with 4 receiver three transmitters it has integrated mcu it is an r4f processor 1.4 megabyte memory and also an inbuilt signal generator with 60 to 64 gigahertz band and with respect to interfaces it comes with can or canopy interface so essentially you can do the processing at the edge and the decisions could be sent over these interfaces intelligently depending upon the application so this sensor can actually provide a point cloud information and has a dedicated hardware accelerator integrated on the right hand side you see our xwr6843 which is a superset device it is similar to 6443 but it comes with a dsp integrated as well so you can implement your complex signal processing algorithms on this device as well we offer this device both in the flip gpga package as well as the antenna on package technology and both of these devices are in production both for industrial markets as well as automotive markets in automotive market we make it 125 junction temperature capable as well and the ace will be capable on the bottom side you can see the corresponding 77 gigahertz family of devices and the three main things which i would like to highlight here are if you are designing a sensor irrespective of the frequency regulation restrictions on the region whether it could be 77 or 66 gigahertz we have a pin to pin compatible offering so 6843 device for example is pin to pin compatible with 1843 below 177 gigahertz and it's also pin to pin compatible with 64.43 so essentially your design becomes much simpler now coming to software it is one software investment we provide a millimeter wave software sdk which comes with common software apis and if you build your software application on one platform it is very easy to build a different application or even port the same application to a different device in our family and lastly safety story is very important for a few of our customers our automotive sensors are ac b capable for automotive applications and for industrial applications correspondingly it will be still too capable so overall it is a common platform and common software investment and pin to pin compatible software hardware platform so texas instruments not only provides silicon but we also provide a lot of other things such as software tools which could be used for development purpose evaluation kits which you can readily buy on our website and evaluate any of these applications we have a lot of ecosystem partners who have capability in design of this sensor both production grade antenna design software algorithms for a multiple variety of applications we also have a dedicated training session both in person and online and we have a very excellent support system or what we call as engineer to engineer platform online platform where a person can post the question online and can expect an answer within 24 hours with our engineers worldwide and this is true for both automotive as well as industrial applications just want to introduce what what is our offering in terms of software so on top of our radar portfolio we have a scalable software sdk and not only that we also offer mcal drivers which is very essential for integration of autosar in case of automotive application we also provide software safety software in terms of low-level drivers and exhaustive list of documentation and user guides which our customers can use to certify their sensors as automotive safety grade or industrials integrate and in addition to that we also provide a variety of application reference examples it could be on the industrial space applications like traffic monitoring robotics people counting and tracking for building automation use cases or on the automotive side it could be a vital sign detection of the driver interior same thing including child presence detection short-range radar mid-range data so our whole owners here is really to make this experience for our customers really easy to where they can readily find all these examples by the evaluation kit and see for themselves firsthand how these applications work so i'm sure this will be very rewarding experience for you as you go through evaluating our chipsets now let's get into some of these specific application use cases first one i'll get into is the occupancy detection in building automation use case the goal here really is to detect and localize the people of their presence or absence and also find out their exact location and radar is very good at doing this because it can detect very high sensitive fine motions and also compared to other existing technologies it is highly accurate in other words the false detection could be overcome and all of this without getting invading into the privacy of the users in the three pictures you can see the different use cases and the first picture you can see how depending upon how it locates a person it can redirect the ac towards the person thereby increasing the efficiency of the system and in the middle picture you can really see in the meeting rooms or in offices the radar sensor can be used to detect where a person is and based on that control the lighting and even ac for example on the right hand side you can see the traditional ultrasonic sensor which today is used to detect one car in one parking space it could be replaced with one radar sensor which could be used to detect multiple cars so there is also this additional cost benefit for our end customers along with accuracy the second uh use case is the mobile robot sensing here the sensors are really needed to detect a human presence or even obstacle and mainly help them in case of agvs or automated guided vehicles to navigate from point a to point b without any obstruction the same is true even for autonomous mobile robots where the robots could be made independent and with the help of sensors navigate even in a mainstream or road conditions and why a millimeter wave or even 60 gigahertz radar sensor shines here is because radar can detect occupants and even the obstacles in 3d space and one major use case for this agv and amrs is cliff detection which was traditionally done with the help of multiple sensors and even lidar for example now with radar you can not only detect objects but you can also detect cliffs because we can detect elevation and because of this you get not only accuracy but also cost benefit in solving these problems and not to mention radar is robust and can work in challenging environmental conditions giving that additional benefit and the last application in industrial which i will cover today is the safety guards are using ti zeta traditionally on the left picture if you can see uh these are the robotic arm movers which is typically fenced in order to create a safety net and with the industry 4.0 our goal is to increase human robot collaboration thereby increasing the efficiency and the productivity of the system and with the installation of radar sensor we can detect where exactly a person is coming with what velocity is approaching and thereby slow down for example or completely go to a stop so here thereby increasing the efficiency of operation of the system and for all these applications now how how do you get started to evaluate these applications so at ti we are really making it simple by following a three-step process the first step what we call as for each of these applications discovery phase where we make it available to you a lot of white papers arctic technology articles or to explain you how the technology works what it is capable of doing once you identify that you go to the evaluation phase where we offer a lot of evaluation kits for different scenarios 60 gigahertz as well as 77 gigahertz including reference software so our goal is to make it plug and play so you can buy the evm software and check out for yourself the performance and once you're convinced that this is the technology you want to go ahead with you can design with our silicon and we also provide a lot of documentation in order to enable that including our data sheets design guides and we also have a lot of ecosystem partners who can offer your help in any of these three steps now i'm getting into the automotive applications uh in-cabin sensing as i said is gaining a lot of traction especially with the euro and cap requirements 60 gigahertz sensor is leaving the market conventionally if you see ultrasonic was tried in the past but it is not 100 foolproof and camera has its own uh drawbacks as well and with radar technology we can detect uh even a newborn baby covered with a cloth and seated in a child seat railroad facing even under these stringent conditions radar will be able to precisely detect as well as localize the presence of the baby and there are a lot of options for placing the radar sensor within the car it could be on the roof mount or the front mount and because ti radar sensors are extremely small it gives a huge benefit to our customers and this is within ti we did a lot of testing with the sensor on the roof mount as well as on the side in this example we are testing a baby doll which actually simulates the breeding of a real baby and we could see the baby placed on the bench of the seed in the footwell or in the child seed and using our evaluation kit shown in the picture we could really detect the baby really well using our 60 gigahertz 6843 device which has been recently released to the market on the production device you can use it to in a multi-modal fashion what i mean by that is the sensor could be used not only to detect the occupants inside the car the right side picture is detecting the four occupants across two rows and you could programmatically change the configuration such that it can now behave as an intruder detection sensor of the same sensor on the left hand side picture you can see that and again as i mentioned earlier we follow this three-step process to make it easier for the customers to evaluate our sensors the discovery phase we have some technical articles ti design documents which you could use as a reference and then evaluate our sensors the 6843 is evm which is shown on the right which also comes with reference software on our ti resource explorer and then once you are comfortable with evaluation you could design your board with the reference schematics and layouts we provide and the silicon which is all of it is available on ti.com with that i think we can open the floor for question and answers if you have excellent a few of you have already submitted questions so we're going to jump right in if you'd like to submit a question type your question into the question window on the side of your screen and hit the submit button or answer your questions please complete the feedback form which is located at the bottom of your screen so uh where can we find more information on the algorithms that are used in your example software all of our software and algorithms are hosted on our ti.com website if you go to ti.com millimeter way we have both automotive as well as industrial section and there is an applications tab and depending upon your application of interest you can find the right link to both evaluation as well as software link in addition to that our millimeter wave sdk also includes a reference software along with the library of lot of algorithms which are used for these applications and in this slide we provide a lot of link and depending upon your application of interest you could click and it will take you to the right location of software all right for mobile robot sensing applications should you be using 60 gigahertz or 77 gigahertz uh it really depends upon the region uh from our understanding it would be 77 gigahertz if it is us or japan markets but we are seeing that rest of the world is moving towards 60 gigahertz so it depends upon the region and that is the reason we offer a scalable portfolio into pin compatible hardware and software uh can the systems identify moving objects absolutely uh if you're thinking i don't know what you're thinking about but in automotive space just to quote an example our radar sensors when we tested by placing the sensor behind the bumper we could detect cars even motorcycles you know moving at for example 60 to 70 meter at high speed so that's one example and in the industrial application for example it could be a safety net which i spoke about earlier in the automated robotics there it could also detect humans which are approaching or moving away from the sensor and it can do this pretty accurately at four centimeter range resolution does ti provide a profile library or something to address different use cases yes uh ti has a host of tools uh one of the tool is called as a millimeter wave studio you can actually connect that tool from the pc directly to our evaluation kits and you can control it or different options through a gui and choose different profile configurations so that is one option and second tool is called as millimeter wave sensing estimator in that you can determine what your use case is for example if you want to detect a person at 10 meters if you input those parameters the tool will uh throw the right configuration which you can load into the sensor and start evaluating right away so there are two to three tools available and also a lot of documentation for you to help in this regard okay would it be possible to use radar on a forklift application to track accidents due to the moving forklift in people absolutely so this is one of the applications which i mentioned earlier we have seen some of the customers use radar the main reason they use it is because of its accurate ability to accurately provide the velocity information as well as the distance information of the approaching humans and based on this the forklifts can determine you know take the appropriate action this person would like to know about the range of the radar sensors would it be suitable and what would you need for examining and controlling a traffic light sure so it depends upon the uh application for trav for traffic monitoring applications we have seen it could be depending upon the region the distance of detection could be 60 meter to more than 100 meters or maybe 120 meters and uh with ti radar our devices are highly programmable and based on the configuration and profile you load you can control this range of detection and part of it is also dependent on the antenna and we provide some of the reference examples which you can find on our ti.com already which actually shows this long range detections already okay is 60 gigahertz radar being used in automotive applications only for in-cabin sensor and why exactly was 60 gigahertz chosen okay so predominantly we are seeing 60 gigahertz is being used mainly for in-cabin sensing the other applications we are seeing in some part of the world for a kick sensor 60 gigahertz are used but for the most part interior sensing uh uses 60 gigahertz um the reason is fcc last year brought out a mandate which prohibited 77 gigahertz from being used for these applications and it might be mostly because of interference reasons okay uh why would one choose a radar system over a vision system uh for certain applications uh it really depends on the applications uh just to give two examples for interior cabin sensing uh camera doesn't work hundred percent of the time there are concerns around privacy uh and also imagine a camera sensor in the front i cannot really detect a baby which is placed in a railroad facing position or the baby which has fallen into your footwell radar in any of these conditions can detect the baby really well to quote a second example for elderly monitoring which is an industrial application uh the there is a concern on the privacy as well and also the range of detection uh radar uh is very useful to avoid this privacy concerns and also the amount of complexity involved is drastically less on a radar sensor and also from the cost point of view radar sensor is highly attractive and it can do multiple functions as well okay is the 16 mm our millimeter wave in the ism band i think it depends on the region from what i understand 57 to 64 gigahertz band in europe is in the ism band in the u.s it might not be it depends i can take that action to get back to the user later on okay is the 60 gigahertz uh transmitter part of the sensor and if so what is the launched power level so in our uh sensors the transmitter as well as the receiver both are integrated into the sensor itself so it's an integrated sensor and the output transmitter power is around typical 10 to 12 dbm output power per tx channel and depending upon the application uh you could either reduce it or increase it programmatically on our sensors but the maximum is about 12 dbm and the data sheet provides that information as well for industrial sensors can it detect stationary objects absolutely yes uh this for example uh in one of our examples we have shown automated uh gates and doors uh if you install the sensor uh typically it would open uh for you know even if a bird is coming in right uh and if there is a trolley for example coming in the radar sensor can accurately detect that as well and in case of parking up sorry i was going to finish even in the parking yeah in the parking application on the automotive side for example it could auto detect a lot of static objects too okay is it possible to fine-tune the ti software to tailor it for specific use cases yes it is possible all of our millimeter wave software sdk is on ti.com anybody can download it and it is highly programmable also and anybody can choose it to find you there is a lot of documentation on how to do that application note and user guide and we have seen a lot of people do that very successfully excellent well i'm afraid we've run out of time if you asked a question that we were not able to get to we will be in contact with you soon to answer all of your questions this concludes today's presentation of electronic design i'd like to thank texas instruments for sponsoring today's event and of course to all of
