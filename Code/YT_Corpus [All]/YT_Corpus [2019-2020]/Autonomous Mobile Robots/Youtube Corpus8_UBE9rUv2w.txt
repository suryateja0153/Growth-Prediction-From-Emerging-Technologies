 yes we'll start thank you very much for coming everyone I don't introduce Radhika ready connect Paul so there's lots of things to say so I don't know how you want to split these thirty minutes and thirty minutes so Radhika is the Kavli professor of computer science of you know if if you take the river upstream did you find another University this is from that place over there from Harvard so radical as won many awards Microsoft Fellowship Radcliffe fellowship NSF Award nominated one of the top ten most influential scientists and engineers 2000 by Nature in 2014 she works and bottom up is interested in bottom-up organization in biological systems and see how that sort of gets translated to robot systems there is not only concern about the computational and algorithmic and community communication aspects of how to make that work but also the physical constraints on how do you get an a physical device to implement those algorithms with all the constraints that come with it so she has sort of shown great examples inspired by cells by and by termites by fish schools a lot of physical swarms that generate complex behavior so there you go [Laughter] anyway bottom-up emergence of intelligence to some degree right and as you know I always like to finish with something slightly different on the side and maybe in this case I want to share a personal story so I my my son Leo he's five years old and he's super interested in robots like that's his thing always and I had been looking for how we can sort of interact I can interact with him to teach him how to code and we have this robot at home which is called route which it turns out I discovered recently that it's comes from a company that Radhika started some time ago and I also learned very recently that that company started sort of shipping the first robots in 2018 but not too long ago was acquired by iRobot which is a fantasy fantastic news right so somehow radical makes it happen so that you can do all those things being successful at every single level including starting a company again being acquired and surviving through that process finally I guess she probably has some kind of trick to make that happen which might be the reason that led her to write a very famous blog article in Scientific American what year was it 2013 2013 she's called the if you haven't read it I really recommend it I've read it many many times it's called the awesomest seven year poor stock referring to the tenure process and how sort of manage all the expectations and all the stress that comes from having to navigate that process of having to do a hundred different things at the same time so thank you very much for that now I feel super nervous thank you that was very sweet and I'm really excited that that you're playing with root I'm sure your child is also playing with root but I don't know if it was playing more with rude because like the parents are apparently our biggest market all right so you know to hear somebody give you an introduction like that it's it's very good for impostor syndrome so I'm gonna try to like get over that as I start my talk so what I work on is collective intelligence I mean computer scientist and I'm roboticist and and the theme that my whole lab works on is collective intelligence so the idea that how is it that very large number of individuals with simple interactions which each other can exhibit a level of intelligence that is much more than what the individuals themselves have all right so what does it mean for a computer scientist and a roboticist to work on collective intelligence well these days it means something like this so this is me on my 45th birthday trekking 10 miles a day in 90-degree weather in Panama hunting army ants so army ants are this amazing example of collective behavior millions of them live together they build their entire nest out of their bodies and they they create these trails to gather food and the amazing thing is there's just no leader in charge and they create these crazy bridge structures to get over any kind of terrain that they don't like so it's really quite amazing so army ants of course are an example of collective intelligence in a way that we would like to emulate but they're not the only example you could think of so you can also think of cells as having collective intelligence so every little cell has an identical DNA program and yet as a group they create complex structure some fruit flies to ourselves even structures that can repair so this is an example of starfish but here's an example of a starfish regenerating its body from a leg so it's just amazing how much regeneration can happen collective intelligence can also operate at really large scales so tiny termites build these mounds that are meters high when the insects themselves are only centimeters scale how is that even possible for individuals at that level to cooperate and if you go even bigger sizes you can think of fish schools and bird flocks and here you start to see even more amazing structures structures that are in motion moving and changing and even creating these bait ball like structures so I mean all of these examples that I showed you we think of as collective intelligence and I think for an engineer or a biologist they're incredibly fascinating and one of I mean actually for any person these systems are fascinating I think one of the reasons we find them so fascinating is that when we look at them each individual is so tiny compared to the phenomenon that they are part of that they are generating and it seems almost mind-boggling that they could coordinate at all when each individual has such a local view couldn't possibly know what somebody is doing all the way across but they do coordinate really well and they do create these incredible structures and exhibits of intelligence and what I find most remarkable is that in addition to the fact that that's true we also know that these systems don't operate based on leaders so there isn't a professor in charge of the classroom there isn't a university president there isn't a president of the country as you can see there are lots of problems with all of these issues when you put somebody in charge well these systems have no one in charge these systems have no one in charge so how is it that they operate and it seems that they operate through rules that individuals use with each other and that somehow the multiplication of these rules is generating the intelligence so of course as a biologist you want to understand these rules because that's that's what science is about it's like how do these systems work but as an engineer of course your immediate reaction is how can I build my own so if this is intelligence how do we create our own version of AI how do we create collective intelligence could we mass manufacture very simple individuals and rules and have systems work in this fashion and there are lots of reasons why we might want to do this so if you think of any application where there's robotics whether you're thinking of agriculture or you're thinking of search-and-rescue or you're thinking of construction or environmental monitoring these are all cases where you're going to use lots of robots you're not gonna use one robot even if you think about self-driving cars right that's gonna be a lot of robots on the road so we want to be able to know how to program these systems with large numbers of individuals how to program them such that we have really good coherent behavior and not maybe pathological behavior and for me personally I'm also in addition to thinking about the applications area I'm also just really interested in how this kind of complexity arises so what are the principles by which these kinds of systems work are there universal principles that you would see regardless of scales that you would see they would work in cells and in ants and fish and in birds and in robots are there just some ideas that work across all skills and could we discover what those principles are and so for me building robots is both about you know trying to think about these future application areas but also just trying to understand the fundamental science behind complexity how do these complex systems work so today what I was going to do is tell you about four projects from my group that strategically are exactly based on this four systems that I showed you videos of and the thing that's common about these four examples of collective intelligence is that in all of these cases the group is creating some kind of structure so in the case of cells we can think about how can Agent work together to create precise and global structure when nobody else is in charge if we're thinking about termites that build mounds we can think about how can individuals build three-dimensional structures much larger than themselves and when you think about army ants we can think about adaptive structures how can individual problem solve by building structures in their environment without knowing ahead of time what they need to do and then when we think of fish schools will think of structure that isn't just structure but it's dynamic structures so structure and motion all wrapped up together so these are all sort of examples that have to do with structure but also have to do with collectives that are engaging and doing it without any leaders all right so so let's start with cells I always try to remind myself to set a timer because I'm afraid but I just forgot again okay so if I'm off time that will explain it okay so so thinking about cells you know as I mentioned before cells you know have identical DNA and they're working together to create this complex structure so imagine if we could do that right what if you could give me a shape you wanted a structure build I send it through a compiler it produces a DNA I feed this DNA to robotic cells and proof the robotic cells self-organized to create the structure and of course this is this is what all science fiction movies have made out of if you've watched you know big hero 6 you saw the Miller BOTS you've seen this many many times they usually go bad in some way and destroy the world so I'm a little worried about working on this area but I'm hoping that it will be more like programmable materials but really the whole field of programmable materials is inspired by this idea that eventually we would be able to create something as powerful as a cell and be able to program it and it would be able to create complex structure so this is what motivated project in my group called a kilowatt project and the idea behind the kilowatt project was exactly that first can I create a compiler where you give me a global goal that you want a system to achieve and I put it through this compiler and out comes the program that an individual cell will run and then can I have a thousand cells thousand robotic cells that actually run that program and achieve the thing that we thought it should be able to achieve what would it take to actually try to create that system and the kilobots was an example of trying to create that system and each robotic cell is very simple it has the idea is that it should have just the basics that you would expect movement communication and the ability to program it but only the ability to sense robots that are near it and then a thousand of them have to work together alright so this is a little bit of what it looks like and the robot is about this size so it has two vibration motors and that's how it moves but you can think of them really as wheels so if you run both it moves together it can turn left it can turn right it can talk with other robots by reflecting light off of the bottom surface and it can both measure distance from other robots and it can also communicate messages with them so once you just have those basic qualities you can we program a whole kinds of classic collective behaviors so for example synchronization so fireflies synchronized here every individual has an oscillator but it looks at its neighbors and it starts to synchronize with its neighbors which causes them all to synchronize eventually you can also program pattern formation so we can program time we can program powder information if you think of stripes in a fruit fly here there we could program motions so here they're moving towards a light I think the key thing to take away from these is that these are all collective behaviors that we sort of understand theoretically and then we can sort of work on them with this physical system and one of the things that you see very quickly is that our physical system has the kind of variability and complexity that you might imagine natural systems would have you give them the same program they don't quite run it the same way so one of the first things that my group has worked on this area is trying to think about a library of collective behaviors so what are the different kinds of collective behaviors that you would need so that you could program a system to do different things and so one of our key focuses many of those pieces of this library are bio-inspired so things that you would see cells do or see organisms do but there are also some classic distributed algorithms that we programmed to like localization and position control and so we built up this library with a lot of emphasis on closing the gap between theoretical models and the physical systems what are the kinds of errors and phenomena that you see that you wouldn't have seen that you wouldn't have realized if you hadn't a physical system all right so I'm not going to talk a lot about this library but I want to talk about what do you do if you have this library suppose I gave you this library of collective behaviors and you said well coming back to your original goal what I really want is to create some complex shape so maybe the idea would be can your robotic cells form some complex shape for me like the shape of a starfish which is not really that complicated since I'm ignoring all the internals of the starfish and just thinking about the shape is there some sort of compiler where I put the shape in and you actually take all of these pieces from your library and you compose them and you can give me back a program that the thing I want so here's an example I'll show you two examples of doing that so it's not that that you can only do this one way there's actually multiple ways you can compose these behaviors to achieve the same global goal so the first example I'll show you we call directed growth so the idea is if you think of like a plant growing or something you're sort of adding layer after layer so we start with a group of robots there's a seed which is basically where the thing is going to grow from and you're just growing outwards from layers and in this system we're using a couple of different i put sort of some of the library ones here we're using gradients or sort of stripe formation to think about layers we're using positional information so that individuals know where they are as they grow and there's a lot of edge following as you'll see which is basically how robots are going to get to where they are so this is what this composition looks like so that's Mike Rubinstein who designed the kilowatt robots from the speed of his moment you can see that this is very sped up but the important thing to notice here is that each individual robot actually only is able to talk to at most 20 robots in its neighborhood has no idea what's happening further and further away so each robot is sort of going around the shape looking for a pace place to make the system grow and the system is just growing layer by layer and in fact every time you run the system you actually get a slightly different version so here we ran a rectangle like multiple times and it's almost like fingerprints you know the internal and the noise will produce many different shapes but you can actually get a global coherent behavior and you can actually do this for many shapes so many different kinds of self-assembly can be done with this algorithm okay so that's the first way I could compose some of these behaviors I use some pattern formation some movement like edge following but there's other ways you can also think about building things so you could think about not building things additively but maybe building things subtractive lee so imagine a different program where i took all of my robotic cells and i shaved away the parts that I didn't want right so now I'm actually doing it by disassembly and this is also patterned for me and and uses motion so here's an example of what this program will look like so we start all of the kilobots together and you can sort of see that a that they are starting to talk to each other and form a shape it doesn't all happen at the same time and as they as they form a shape eventually they actually have to come to consensus so the whole group comes to consensus and decides that they are done with that phase and then they move to another phase and it's like a star exploding so all of the robots that are not part of the shape are basically moving away from the light and getting removed so this is a really different way of making a shape one of the big differences between the first and the second is that the first sped up video was 12 hours and this video was 30 minutes so there's one algorithm can be really really slower or faster than another and this is just an example of different kinds of shapes that we can do not all the same shapes so a little fast so with the with the kilowatt project one of the things that we were able to demonstrate is that it is actually possible not only to create this library of behaviors but also to create global to local compilers so it is possible to think of structure as formed by many many individuals but in fact how you decide to do that can have a really big impact in one case we used a very sort of growth based idea in one case we use a subtractive idea and one of the things we learned is that the subtractive idea doesn't require as much precise motion and so not only is it faster in some ways it's actually more robust so as we think about systems with larger numbers of individuals thinking about systems that are tolerant or sort of utilize the variability and randomness even better than we are doing before might be a better way of thinking about composing complex behavior than others nevertheless the kinds of shapes that we can form in the system are still sort of limited so for example if you cut off the leg of the starfish it can't really reorganize its cells to to make the thing come back but there's another group in at Bristol a former of lab affiliate Sabine horts who's a roboticist and James sharp who's a biologist and they're actually using Turing patterns to generate shapes so in this case it's an even more bottom-up approach and in this case if you actually cut off parts of the shape it does actually reorganize you still can't quite control the shape as well but it actually has this ability of self-repair again coming from a very biological idea and one of the things that I'm very proud about in this sort of one is that we were able to commercialize the kilobots and so now not only Sabine's lab Sabine's lab actually has a thousand robots so we are no longer the only lab with a thousand robots but there are about a dozen other labs and so there's a lot of different people who can now all of us can share code and also share ideas about what are the things about collective behavior that we're interested in so I talked mostly about self-assembly but there's a lot of people working on consensus and search and all the kinds of other algorithms so there's quite a few labs using kilobots now all right so so there's examples that I showed you thus far we're really trying to do self-assembly in 2d and there are a lot of individuals and working together but what if you wanted to do self-assembly in 3d what would you have to do so termites are a great example of that they're Master architects they build these skyscrapers that are so much larger than their own size and the way that they do it is actually very interesting so they make these mud pellets and they stack up mud pellets to make pillars and roofs and then they climb on top of that and then they make more pillars and roofs and then they climb on that and they build more so the idea is you climb and you build and you climb and you build a new climate and suddenly you can build structures that are way larger than your own physical size so this is a really amazing idea the other sort of interesting thing about the termites is that of course the structure they're building is so much larger than the individuals so you may not even meet other individuals in this system so the other thing they discovered about termites is that they coordinate implicitly so I might build thing and that influences what you might build later when you see it and this communication through the environment is termed stigma G so this also allows a small group which in this case is a million a million is a small group to work together over a huge area even though they aren't constantly talking to each other and they can't possibly be talking to one sort of central unit okay so we decided to sort of take these ideas and try to build our own system of robots that build and of course we thought we could do the same thing so if we have these robots and they have some sort of pellet or some sort of block that they can build from then if they can climb over those blocks then maybe they can build staircases and they can build staircases to build a higher structure and the more staircases to build a higher structure and that way we can have robots build structures much larger than themselves so we started working on this project and then two years into the project we were scooped by another computer science group so I'm going to show you their video this is the opening sequence of wall-e I don't know if you've ever if you even noticed this one but it has blocks it has a tower and it has a staircase going around this tower so we can build these high structures I will say that my group was both like happy and unhappy with this video because not only does wall-e climb and build structures much larger than himself he also makes those blocks out of found objects which is the other part of you know we can't still do so anyways yeah wall-e is every robot Isis well not every robot assist but everybody in my lab loves wall-e alright so this is our version of wall-e which took us a few more years and you can see this robot is climbing over staircases and it's carrying a block and I won't have time talking too much detail about it but the key thing is we were really interested in mechanical simplicity how do you create a robot that through very simple interactions can do all of these complicated things climb carry put down a block climb over the thing that it built right so all of these pieces together but once you have all of those pieces together we can actually program the group to behave in a way that's actually very similar to the kilobots so you take a shape you put it through this compiler and it actually has a directed growth pattern but you can think about growing in X Y and also growing in the Z dimension so here a robot comes to sort of the seed the starting location it walks around so edge following until it finds a place to build and then it built and it's just sort of growing in layers in the X Y and the nulls of growing layers and Z and the only difference is that we have to have one sort of invariant in building so that there's always a staircase in the system so you always locally have to keep things looking like staircases otherwise the robot can't climb it can't climb up straight walls so this is showing a single robot running the full algorithm so it comes to the starting place it gets a block and then it starts to build and the interesting thing here is that we were actually able to create rules that have a little bit more self-repair so if a mean person comes along and that's Kirsten who designed the robots comes and destroys the structure for you it actually doesn't matter because the robot doesn't actually have a concept of what has been built before it doesn't have a memory every time so the comes to the structure it's building a new so if some of the structure disappears many times it can compensate but if somebody comes and helps out that's good too and so now multiple robots can work together but the structure itself is the entire memory if that makes sense so here you see three robots working together the robots are not communicating with each other they're just running the algorithm and just constantly working together and we can prove that these rules no matter what order in which you know they traverse the structure or they traverse the structure in a particular order that the rules will be non conflicting and I think that what you know there's just a couple of takeaways I like from this is that one you know direct the idea of self-assembly and collective construction and global to local compilers is not that different this is really similar but it is also very different in that we can use stigma G we can actually communicate through the environment we can do things in 3d and that's very different so one of the open pieces is this was a directed growth implementation is somebody gonna make robots that can do the subtractive approach so would it be possible for to make a compiler where you start with a big block of stuff and the robots actually etch it out and I always think of like mines of moria you know just a internal structure but if you think about leaf cutter ants they build incredible underground nest structures and so really we could think of robots that build subtractive Li as well as constructively and algorithmically we would actually understand how to do this in all of these different settings all right so ok so both of the examples that I showed you so far the collectives we're building something where we knew ahead of time what we wanted so I told you that I wanted a starfish shape or I told you that I wanted a tower and we have this compiler that generates the program that individuals to run so we're really thinking about global to local probe programming but that's not the only kind of self-assembly that exists there's also a lot of self-assembly that happens where you're reacting to the environment around you so army ants are a really amazing example of this they constantly build structures in their environment only to solve problems so for example they build these crazy kinds of bridge structures because there's rough and inefficient train and they want to get somewhere faster and so they build these temporary structures throughout throughout their lives to be able to solve problems in their environment and of course you can't know ahead of time what problems you're gonna face an environment so you can't know ahead of time a blueprint of what it is you're going to build instead somehow your self-assembly rule has to work in the context in the of the environment so how is it that these individuals can work together to solve these kinds of problems in their environment so I want to start by showing you a video of what it looks like to make such a bridge structure okay and before I show you the video I just want to give you a little bit of the setup so there the nest is over here to the right and there you'll see in red there's a long trail there's a trail of ants that are carrying larva you'll see that them carry white larva they're bringing back food to their nest and there's a connected path but it's kind of long and narrow and has this v-shaped detour so from the left to the right so what the ants have done is that they don't really want to take this detour so instead they've constructed a temporary bridge so that they can basically go straight across right this is like when you have a sidewalk that goes like this and then people walk until you've like remove the grass from here and created your own path it's kind of like that except they're suspended in air and they've made it out of their own bodies which of course is very different yeah and so and the other thing to notice here is of course they straighten the path it's also fairly wide so they can actually support a decent amount of traffic okay so what I'm going to show you is what the formation process looks like or rather the Reformation process because we're going to break it all right so we break it they're freaked out there's a lot of chaos but one thing I don't know why it's choppy so some of the ants start going the long path but you can see some of them I don't know if you want to call them lazy or opportunistic are trying to cross anyways and if you want big ones get across but then suddenly there's a surge of traffic and a lot of individuals are getting stepped on and suddenly they're climbing over each other to get over on the other side and very soon you see that the ones that are getting climbed over actually just stay where they are and become a bridge and so now you have some set of individuals that are basically dedicated to crossing that gap and others crossing over them and it's literally five minutes less than five minutes it's like we did nothing this thing repairs so fast it's like you couldn't even tell that we actually destroyed the bridge so these are this is a really sort of cool kind of self-assembly and there's two things about it that I wanted to highlight that I think are really interesting the first one is that of course the shape of the bridge is going to have to be related to the gap right so it has to be related to the geometry but it turns out it's also related to the traffic so a colleague of mine Simone Garnier as a biologist has studied these kind of bridges both in natural settings and an artificial setting so here they're sort of creating an artificial detour and what they found is that if there's very low traffic then all of the individuals will just take the long route but if the traffic gets high then these bridges start to form and the size of the bridge is related to how much traffic there is so the more traffic and congestion there is a wider bridge forms to basically take care of that traffic so if you think about like sustainable architecture right it's you have a resource it grows when you need more of it and then it actually shrinks so if the traffic dies down or if the mean biologist stops the traffic then actually the the ants that are in the bridge will get up and leave and so the bridge will they will go back to their normal lives and so this is this is the self-assembly that can both grow with need decrees and dissolve all all with one rule and of course this all has to somehow work without with one single rule you can't have a different rule for every different situation that you encounter it somehow has to work for all so that's one really interesting thing about this self-assembly is it's very adaptive and dynamic the other interesting thing about this sort of self-assembly is that the structures formed are really not what you would think of as a good bridge and the they're not trying to make a truss structure or a lattice structure it's actually very inefficient structure because there's just so much material in it so the ants are just attaching to each other in a very amorphous and messy way but there are also some advantages that one advantage is that it's very fast so the ants are very imprecisely able to connect to each other and they don't have to reason too much about the structure so in this imprecise way they're collecting with each other and they're really fast and then the structure itself has compliance because the individual ants their bodies are flexible and so in fact this bridge can fit into all kinds of messy situations and unstructured environment which is where that they have to solve these problems so sort of two games being played here there's the sort of game of you know what is the computation and the collective behavior but there's also the mechanical structure which is really lending itself to doing self-assembly in the cinema so inspired by this these bridges is we have a project in the lab and this is sort of work-in-progress both of the two that I'll show now it was like half baked half published pieces is the estan we call desitin robotic up project and the idea is that we want to introduce another species into this genus except it will be a robotic species and our goal is to hit those two highlights that I said before so first of all can we design a robot swarm where individual robots can move but then when the need arises they can self assemble and self assemble some sort of amorphous and quick structure so most of the work that's been done in the area of self self reconfigurable robots has been focused on very rigid robots that connect in very lattice like structures so here we're saying instead what if we had soft robots and they could connect to anywhere else on anyone on any body can we still reason about this system when we've given up all of our understanding of lattices so that's that's the first part and then second part is how do we create self-assembly rules that have this property of being adaptive and dynamic and here we can actually take inspiration from what people think the ants are doing which is that they are somehow reacting to congestion as a signal to create structure and lack of congestion as a signal to dissolve structure and that may be that is a sufficient rule to produce collectively a behavior that seems really intelligent all right so I first show you a video of where we are on the on the robot side so this is Melinda he is a mechanical engineering student and who's the lead on this project and this is the robot in its native habitat I'm not really sure but it's like getting very choppy alright so the robot is smoother than this movie if that helps all right so the robot has a soft body this is actually roughly the size of the of the body and has two cables and it moves by bending and so it's a bipedal with a very simple thing so one foot you turn it over when the foot hits something it grabs and then you flip the body over so it's just moving by flipping okay and the grippers that we have grab into velcro or foam surfaces so they have a little coil and the coil sort of digs into the foam or into the loops and then you unwind it and can let go so can they make it has some nice self aligning properties alright so the control for this robot is really simple you flip over your foot when your foot hits something it has proximity sensors you grab and then you flip over your body again and that's the entire control but with just this control it can actually move in any orientation and also deal with even different angles and this is where the soft body is really important because the grippers might hit in different orientations but the body just absorbs the orientations and sort of deforms to the situation so we can have a robot that's quite good at climbing and then the next step is of course to make the robot climb over other robots and the way that we do that is we cover the robots in velcro so the robots are covered in stretchable velcro and now a robot can climb over another robot and it can important things it can attach anywhere along the body of the robot in order to climb over it so we're still working on making this these robots more easier to manufacture but the nice thing is that already they're untethered and fully autonomous and can basically autonomously climb over each other to create these soft soft structures so the next step is you know how do we take this robot that can climb over each other and can they start to create these dynamic structures so in order to since we only have two robots we built a simulator to investigate different kinds of rules and our simulator has a simplified version of the robot so instead of modeling all of the softness of the robot which as most of you probably know it's computationally pretty intractable we have an abstract model that has two grippers that is to grippers that move by flipping and when the gripper hits the surface it makes a compliant joint and that's sort of how we're modeling that the robot body can move and has a little bit of compliance and then for thinking about bridges and trains we decided to look at this video since it's one of the cases where there's a lot of good data on what on what ants are doing and so we have a V train and the idea is do you or do you not form bridges in this surface all right so what is the rule that an individual robot should use in order to decide whether or not to make a bridge so I'm going to show you one which is just a hypothesis that biologists have about how ants might be deciding to do this so the idea is is that an ant is in one of two states either it's in a moving state where it's just moving along or it can be in a bridge state where it's stationary and the way you end up in a bridge state is that somebody bumped into you or try to climb over you so as soon as somebody tries to climb over you or you're bumping into a lot of individuals you basically will become stationary and you'll stay stationary for a while and then if nothing is happening anymore nobody's grabbing you nobody's climbing over you then you'll go back to your moving State so it's a very simple program just moving state bridge state moving state bridge state okay the interesting thing is what is the implication when everybody is running this rule together so the idea is that for a collective the implication one implication might be that bridge self-assembly is actually stable self-stabilizing so the ideas sort of goes like this or the hypothesis goes like this if you have a lot of congestion then everybody will start bumping into each other because they bump into each other they'll start forming a bridge however the bridge itself will actually smooth out the traffic causing people no longer to bump into each other and thus we will end up with a bridge and we'll end up with smooth traffic so the bridge will grow to meet the need and then it will self stabilize it's a very nice hypothesis without proof and the other piece of this is that the size of the bridge will be a function of congestion so the more congestion there is the bigger bridge you're get and you might get congestion because your path is really narrow or you might get congestion because there's just a lot of traffic so both terrain and traffic are going to determine the shape and the size of the bridge you get and the second part of the hypothesis which is related to the bottom arrow is that if the traffic stops the bridge will disassemble so if if all of these robots are in bridge Strait and I stopped the traffic then some of these ants will be able to leave if they're on the edge and when they leave they'll expose other ants on the edge which will then leave and then leave and then all of a sudden you're left with nothing all right so we decided to basically implement this in our simulated robots and see and I'll show you we actually get pretty much the behavior that the biologists hypothesized so here's what it looks like so here we're in low traffic so for the most part things are going well but once in a while there's a collision and stick static traffic and now this little bridge forms and after this point it actually is pretty stable like there's no kin there's no congestion anymore we sort of cut off the bad part of the terrain when the traffic gets higher it gets a little Messier you start to see a lot more collisions you start to see all kinds of crazy bridge formations form but for periods of time the bridge actually stabilizes and then there might be sort of a little bit more but typically you get a stable bridge all right so now we're gonna stop the traffic instead of fun it's really fun to watch this thing dissolve because there's some trapped robots and the order in which the disassembly happens is also not totally obvious because we have this few robots that are just stuck in places but actually mostly except for a few edge cases most of the bridge actually dissolves when you stop the traffic all right these two are stuck it's it's a longer story why we have a few dissolution cases so the fun part is that this is this rule is not really specific to v-shaped bridges you could actually imagine more complex turnings and what's really happening is whenever there's congestion you're forming these temporary structures to try and smooth the traffic and then if the traffic is not there those those pieces will dissolve and so we think that this rule can actually be used in many different settings beyond beyond just thinking about bridging and it's true that army ants actually created a whole bunch of structures all right so this is where we currently on this project and we're looking sort of at this phase space of terrain versus traffic and you see regions of stability you see regions where no bridge forms if it's very low traffic or an easy terrain but you also see some instabilities so it's also cases where you have a pileup and this was even observed with army ants as well one of the things I think you know is sort of the open question is whether other kinds of structures that army ants create adaptively also have the same kind of rule so army ants for example create towers and they create chains to reach objects that they can't access there are also different kinds of ants that create cantilevers and the question is are all of these structures essentially the same kind of structures like if you remove the object they dissolve and do they form adaptively and if if so like what would you change about the current rule which is already pretty simple to get these kind of adaptive structures and that's something that we're working on now but it is interesting that such a simple behavior can actually have such a complicated complex outcome all right so the last project that I'm going to show you which sort of in the in the investigation of structure is thinking about structure that also involves motion so how is it that collectives can work together while moving to create structure and fish schools are of course the single most impressive example of that in my opinion birds are pretty cool too but I love fish I love snorkeling and fish do all kinds of amazing things so they can disperse in a really complicated environment without losing coherence and the collective when they're sort of foraging they can align and migrate incredible distances together in incredibly large groups but then they can also create dynamic structures to evade predators or to appear larger than themselves in order to scare off predators or even to capture other other prey like this this bait ball is an example where they're sort of rotating in a structure and so you know there's really these beautiful kinds of structures that can be formed and what's interesting about fish schools is that unlike the other examples that I showed you for example with termites or cells or especially we ants unlike all of those cases there's actually quite a bit known about what fish what rules fish use in order to create these structures and in in the 1980s a computer science computer graphics graphics person Craig Reynolds created this really popular model based on the experimental data from fish schooling to describe how a group could collectively work together and it depended on three basic behaviors so attraction repulsion and alignment so the idea with attraction is that a fish doesn't like to be separated from the group so it tries to move to the centroid or near by to the neighbors that it can observe similarly it doesn't like to really collide into them either so it's also repulsed so it's going to move closer to the centroid of the group but it doesn't want to be close to any particular individual so that it doesn't collide so that's attraction and repulsion and alignment would be that I also align my heading so that we're all moving in the same direction so when you put these three pieces together Craig Rowin Oh show that you could create really beautiful computer graphics of group behavior that two people looked exactly like the natural system and what's interesting is people after that showed that by using different amounts of these behaviors you could actually produce all these different kind of behaviors so for example if you don't have alignment you can produce something like shoaling if you have alignment then it turns into something like migrating and there's actually a version where you combine these three and it starts to rotate on itself and you can actually get bait balls so just from these three different behaviors you can actually program a whole bunch of dynamic behaviors from the group the other interesting thing about these three behaviors is that there's no direct communication between individuals so there's no identity in this system there's no passing a message into the system so you called implicit coordination I'm gonna make all of my decisions only by observing other members in the collective who are near to me and they're gonna observe somebody else and that's how the information is going to propagate and of course underwater this is really good because it's much harder to create systems that are passing complicated signal underwater but if you could do it all based on vision then in fact you could create all of these complex behaviors without having to pass messages so so using those rules so if we take all of the things that we can do from the Boyd's model all of these different kind of dynamic behaviors and then you add to it some of the collective library behaviors that I talked about before like sink or gradients or quorum sensing then in fact already you can imagine writing a programming language for a fish-like system that's really very powerful where you can use a programming language to express a complicated mission that you want this in this group to do and it would be composed from all of these pieces and so that part is already ready and sort of ready to go the problem is that implementing these systems has been really hard and part of it is even though these rules are very simple they assume a perfect fish that moves in perfect 3d and has perfect three-dimensional sensing of all of its neighbors and even real fish can't do that so even real fish are not necessarily following these kinds of rules and if we wanted to build a system that's a lot of pressure it's very hard to build that kind of perfection so the question is like what it what what is really needed like could you get away with less and and what is the minimal amount of implicit coordination that you need in order to achieve these kind of behaviors so this project inspired the blue swarm project in our group which is to create miniature robots about 10 centimeter size so that we can have lots in the lab and kind of like the kilowatts create a platform where we can program these kind of collective behaviors and investigate them and of course building a thousand is completely out of the question so if we build get to 30 I will be very excited because there isn't enough work in this area where where we can build on but the blue BOTS as it is right now has three-dimensional motion and so we have we use these very simple actuators called magnet and coil actuators but they're good for making flippers and you can completely submerge them in water so there's no sealing requirement so really easy to use and in this way we have multiple actuators so this robot can turn in place move up and down even swim backwards just with these pectoral caudal and dorsal fins so it actually has like the kind of motion so that it could react to its neighbors and then it has two cameras two spherical camera so it has an almost 360-degree view but of course with a lot of distortion and with a lot of computational limits so so instead our robot has some blue lights and this is how it recognizes other robots so if you have for example just like some rub some fish have schooling marks our schooling marks are these LEDs when you see these LEDs you can estimate sort of how far officials and where it is in your view but of course you also have occlusion so if there's a neighbor close to me I actually can't see any of the other neighbors because they're obstructing my whole view and most models don't even take that into account it's just somehow everything is a point and nothing occludes anything so the reality is that we have noise and occlusion and we also have still non holonomic motion even with all of these things put together all right so our current swarm actually has seven robots let's start by showing you a single one of these robots this is a tank in our lab and this is one of the demos that we run so there's a lure stick with a blue light on it and the robot is following the lure stick and so you can move the lure up and down and left and right and it's basically trying to use vision only to follow follow wherever you move it and so this is just showing off the fact that it can have this three-dimensional motion and that it can also see the lure at any point in its vision and see where it is so this is a single robot and right away you can start to program sequences of behavior so in this case the robot is searching for this particular object in the center when it sees it it's starting to swim towards it so it's homing in towards that structure when it gets to the right distance it aligns its heading so that the object is to its left and then it starts to orbit or go around it and the idea behind using this particular lure is this sort of could represent another robot so this is one of the first experiments we were doing to try and see if we could create sort of more complicated behaviors hey speed up in a second actually looks a lot to me like a carousel every time I watch this video like we should have tuned this better but it was one of our early experiments trying to do this together so once you have a robot that can react to the vision of other robots and can move in this way we can start to program now collective behaviors where one robot reacts to another and the first one reacts it so this is just a simple version where you see two robots executing a kind of milling they're basically trying to essentially follow each other and then ending up in this earth circular one so here is sort of a classic sort of example the first two parts of boyd's you're doing dispersion so you're trying to get to a certain distance away from each other and then you're doing aggregation where you're trying to equilibria at a shorter distance so you can aggregate and disperse and aggregate so we're basically doing that sequence to see if we can get the robots to do this and here is our sort of most fun experiment thus far structure in motion they are sort of milling so there there's actually a very simple rule where they're only sort of paying attention to things in front of them and they're able to stabilize into these circles and you'll see in a second it's actually a cylinder so it's not actually a circle so in three dimensions they're actually forming this baitball like structure at different depths so even with these very very simple sort of behaviors we can already create systems that are getting close and I think we will learn a lot about how robust what is the gap between what the theory tells us should happen and what's really gonna happen with these robots when is there a fun sort of end points I just wanted to show is that it actually turns out that there are fish Nocturnals fish that's school with blue lights which we didn't know until we were presenting this and a biologist gave us a video so this is a video flashlight fish and what's interesting is there's growing evidence that not only do they use the lights to school but they actually flashed their lights sometimes in synchrony and so they're actually passing messages in some way I flash then you flash then I flash and then we do something and so it's really interesting if we also exploit that modality what kinds of additional collective behaviors would be able to do in this system but we're really sort of at the beginning of this all right so I've shown you very quickly in the sort of world one view of four different examples of collective intelligence in nature and that have inspired us to build robotic systems and I will say like one of the things I love about doing this research is not only does it sort of span this idea of collective intelligence and mechanical intelligence like where is the intelligence coming from is it coming from the body is it coming from the physics of the interaction is it coming from the algorithms of interaction we can play with all of those and so it blurs the line between being a computer scientist or mechanical engineer really nicely but it also blurs the line between being an engineer and a scientist so for every single one of these projects we also now have a project where we're working with biologists in their domain to try and understand why fish school in certain ways or how army ants actually build more complicated structures and and similarly with cells and termites so it's it's a fun area to work in collective intelligence just because the number of people were actually thinking about it crosses so many different disciplines the other thing I was going to mention really quickly is that I chose these four examples to just tell you different kinds of structure but it's also interesting all of these four systems also use a very different kind of communication so if you think of cells you can think of very direct signaling chemical signaling termites are communicating through the environment fish are communicating only through observation and army ants are communicating through physical forces so it's interesting is not all even if all of the collective solve simple problems they've actually developed different methods of communication which may be more or less adapted to their environment and I think this is also an interesting thing that I hadn't realized before until I started to actually give this talk and I was like oh that's very interesting but I think there's really more to be known about collective intelligence than we're really starting to lay our fingers on all right so what can thousands of individuals do together as a collective well science so everything that I've shown you here is the result of collective intelligence since I presented four projects I didn't have time to go as much into related work but our work is part of a much larger field of people who are looking at building swarm robots inspired by biology and some of my favorite examples are actually here from MIT including going back to Miami Tarek answer the Nerd Herd which was I don't know if people remember but in rod Brooks's group some of the first experiments with ant inspired robots but everything from collective construction to underwater robots there's just a really big community that is trying to push what we can do with these systems and the work that I presented of course is collective intelligence as well and this is the collective and I'm really grateful and happy to work with is amazing set of people who have very diverse passions and diverse backgrounds and I think together we really achieve really transcend what any one of us could have achieved so many of these projects I don't think any one of us could have done alone so you saw Melinda Mike with the kilobots Kirsten who built the termes robots and Justin who worked with her on the algorithmic side and Florian and Melvin who are leading the project with the underwater swarm all right and I think that I'm going to sort of pass this one and end with that so this is my collective intelligence lab and we're pretty self organized all right thank you thanks a lot any questions hi very excellent presentation I have a question so it seems that in these cases the reward function is given by the compiler I'm wondering if you are thinking of the robot itself has some intrinsic reward or value function for instance maybe in these cases of the bridge for instance the ants or getting a pleasure of being stepped over stepped over and and if they don't get that anymore they move on and they try to be somewhere that they you know yeah no I think it's I think also so I I've thought a lot about this but I'm not gonna do justice to this here because of time but also because I don't have a good answer but I think that as long as we were looking at systems inspired by ants the assumption is that ants are so closely related that they are purely altruistic so if if you are happy I am happy even if I die I am happy you know and so it's so they are like an organism they are like cells like nobody saying oh this cell is fighting with the cells the cells are working together once you get to fish that's not necessarily true they're not so closely related so there is a lot of question like what is the reward function for participating and being part of a collective and what is the what is the reward function for being in the front and dealing with all of the all of the drag and saving everyone behind you like and it's unclear and so in these systems I think I've sort of sidestepped that issue but I think one of the places you would want to put that back in is if you want these systems to learn right so let's say that this these robots are making a bridge for a particular environment but let's say the environment doesn't change like the same situation occurs again and again could they build the fridge faster could they build a better bridge could they learn which was the best bridge they built in the past and build only that one in that case you would want to have some sort of reward function that is explicitly being received so that the collective can learn and all of these systems it's known that the collectives can learn in fact many of the biologists will tell you they will not run an experiment on the same colony or the same group of animals too many times because the results start to change they actually start to learn your experimental setup right and we know this about people that I would have never thought this about fishin ads and so we don't understand how could we build systems where we actually put in a reward function I think that would be the really good place to bring that idea back in but here the reward function is all designed by us pretty much amazing presentation as always a question for you about how you could see your work being taken forward into either the miniature or the macro realms you mentioned big hero 6 so miniaturizing these types of collective swarms or wall-e which is like a macro version yeah what are the challenges on a technical level for miniaturization or for macro is it energy storage and density is it the size of the chips and the hardware that you're using yeah I mean I think that you know there's so many challenges I don't know where to start but I think this is where people who are working on individual robots and people are working on swarms can really sort of work work together because as we as we continually make single robots more capable right then I can also tell you like how much capability is needed and where for the collective to work and so I think that that many of the problems I face are actually problems that people would single robots face it's just that you know we need to actually technologically solve them so you know I can give you algorithms that don't require a localization then you don't have to work on localization but I might still require some precision of movement and I might want a soft body and in that case I'm going to interact so I think as you go to the macro level I think we have a lot of examples like we could think of people building together but we can also think of automating all of the different machines that we've made to build together which of those is the right choice is really unclear I think you know whether we should be mimicking animals or we should be mimicking you know the or just automating the things that we have I haven't thought so much about the miniaturization as much but there's a new person in my lab who's really interested so she is constantly trying to take away motion and take away actuation so can you have systems that are more like physics you shake the system and all the actuation is from the outside and then the individuals are totally reacting on a stochastic way I think you have to move to that stochastic way of thinking if you want to miniaturize it that's my current feeling so something that your robots have access to which biological systems don't is maybe self replication rate so what do the rules look like for your robots if they wanted to make more of themselves how would you incentivize that how would you stop it how would I stop it yeah so so there's a Greg Tariq Jia at John Hopkins from the very beginning of work on thinking about rege he was one of the first people working on reconfigurable robots he would host a class every year where undergrads had to design robots that could build copies of themselves and it's amazing how many different kinds of designs you can make and he they all use Lego Mindstorms so you literally had to build you know your robot could move on a track but it would basically pick up these things and the idea was like one room robot moves on a track suddenly there's two robots moving on the track suddenly there's four robots moving on the track so it was like really visceral that it was creating this thing so I think there there are ways to think about it just like 3d printers printing 3d printers right as a mechanism to create it but in my case we looked pretty far if we ourselves can build the robot reliably I feel like we're still stuck there how do you stop it I I mean once we started I don't know but right now it's pretty stopped it's so stop just like it started or you can ask yeah so I think one of the reasons I got interested in amorphous structures for the first time was failures that we had with the termes project so the termes project is trying to build things in these lattices you make one mistake and you know the correction is not simple because the lattice has a defect and then the defect keeps on propagating but termites you know they build with mud so if they leave a hole there's comeback and they plug it right and so there are places where we as humans use that use that technique and the the one that I think everybody knows is building with sandbags so you want to build something fast and you want to build something strong it actually has to obey a safety standard which is protect everybody from the flood so it's not like you don't have a really cards back there but you can build fast and unskilled people can get together and build and so I think one of the things I like about amorphous structures is that maybe the settings where the first settings where we're really going to want to use that is where we have to send in unskilled robots or unskilled people or unskilled robots and unskilled people and we're perhaps the materials available to you are not precise materials they could even be found materials right it could be that you're in the desert and you basically have to build out of you know whatever is available to you there or you're you're sunburned and there's trees and you have to divide sticks but we're actually starting to study how beavers build and for me that's you know if you think of levies and you think of the dams that beavers built you know they're building it they're not taking sandbags they're just showing up they're cutting down material using sticks mud and you know rocks to basically create super strong structures that grow over time and some of these have lasted like 50 years right so our bridges are crumbling so I don't know you know I think we think of animal structures as not living up to a safety standard and maybe that's true from our perspective but the longevity of those structures and the self repair of some of those structures is really incredible so I don't know that like tomorrow we're going to be acceptable to live in a termite mound or like something like that but I do think there is a lot to learn and maybe it can change the way we do construction the mic you got the mic and it's also kind of related to his question um do you think I specifically in the case of the army ants do you think they're optimizing for redundancy because you said the structure was inefficient but maybe it's not an efficient it's just redundant or are they so small that they don't care about redundancy like a fall is totally reasonable I think that the the trick is is defining efficiency so in their case they are very efficient which is that they're building really fast they're the the idea is that the reason they build bridges is because they're rating something else and they're trying to get the loot back to their house as fast as possible and so the straightest widest path is the best possible case so they're very efficiently constructing that so my feeling is that the messiness and the amorphousness of it is because they're making speed efficient and not material use efficient and so they have a lot of ants like I think asking why they evolved so many ants maybe they have redundancy for other reasons like it's useful for raiding and it's useful for like some of these colonies are tremendously large so maybe it's just you have a lot of people so it's okay to use them right so I don't know but I think speed is the the most important factor that they think the other thing is if you really were truly redundant you might just leave the bridge there right but they actually recover the individuals so every time they build structures they actually recover it back and so there is some discussion in this group that maybe there is a cost function like every time I put down an ant that's an ant who could have been bringing back food and so in fact there still is an efficiency where I don't want to put down all of my material so I don't want to like make this massive bridge and I don't want to leave it there longer than necessary so maybe there is some other metric also there where material cost matters but at least in the small version that we're doing we're just trying to prove that congestion can a signal that can be alleviated and that that's you know that's the part that we are now but yeah they create they create an entire nest out of their own bodies and one of my crib enstein who I mentioned they he and Simone recently took an x-ray machine out there and they have actually x-rayed these much larger structures and they're gonna try and understand how these larger structures are formed so it's I think the more and more is going to happen in this we're gonna understand more and more about these areas all right [Applause]
