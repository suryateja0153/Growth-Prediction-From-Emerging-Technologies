 [Music] welcome to the session on cloud automation for industry 4.0 my name is Eva Durand I'm a product obsolete for cloud I Amir engineering team in Munich one of Google's primary goals is to democratize AI and automation they make it easy and accessible for all industries our vision is to harness the power of AI for the industry across multiple verticals retail logistics manufacturing automotive and many others however before we deep dive into that vision I want to get us started by looking at the state of the automation today automation today is only economical at scale the upfront costs of integration are huge and the results are inflexible to changes in workflows however there is a new trend emerging on the market a new generation of collaborative robots are making the automation much more affordable they are equipped with modern sensors and software layers that are easy to program this new generation of robots are useful in unpredictable environments earned work side by side with humans we still have to tackle a couple of challenges before we can leverage the benefits of that new technology firstly the setup and maintenance of robot fleets today is typically brought to the market by system integrators that create highly customized solution to individual clients as a result only industrial customers can afford automation and then mostly only for highly repetitive tasks secondly given this highly customized nature of integration there is a strong vendor lock-in if you want to renew your lab robot fleet or use different type of robots setup and maintenance becomes extremely complex thirdly most of the assets used for automation use-cases are proprietary thus it is hard for both software developers and hardware manufacturers to scale the applications and as a result they are forced to deploy bespoke solutions for individual clients last but not least most of the solutions are deployed only on premise which hinders scalability flexibility and efficiency at Google cloud we are dedicated to handles those challenges in order to make automation easier and more affordable our cloud automation platform provides foundational capabilities for cloud enabled automation solutions that are scalable support large data volumes and speed flexible allowing flexible distribution and deployment of software assets and efficient permit better utilization and infrastructure as a software provisioning our cloud optimation solution allows companies that are interested in the promise of industry 4.0 to turn the operations into the competitive advantage and the key word here is flexibility that is the ability to easily connect and operate the fleet independently of the vendor one key technology behind that is kubernetes which builds on years of experience of Google in automatic deploying and scaling software assets we also address fundamental security concepts such as authentication and authorization we also facilitate reliable connectivity and communication with synchronous and unsecure honest communication and last but not least we provide critical infrastructure for sensor data aggregation and processing that builds on familiar technologies such as BigTable bigquery and dataflow as mentioned the key technology behind that is kubernetes using kubernetes we enabled the distribution of containerized software assets that can run on three tiers on robot on premise and in the cloud we use kubernetes to enable robot hardware abstraction and command and control that is tolerant to intermittent connectivity with kubernetes technology we also create the opportunity for third-party developers to quickly engage with our platform and develop on that on top of that we want to enable the vision of what we started calling digital tween this is the mirror of the physical world in the digital world imagine the robot running through that warehouse and collecting the data on inventory levels exactly the same robot can run through that warehouse and flag damaged items creating new opportunities for quality management and inventory zation that is digital tween and AI capabilities with perception driven capabilities open the whole set of new opportunities that go much beyond automation last but not least on top of this all this critical infrastructure we want to offer first party services that leverage cloud automation platform and solve critical pain points for for the clients the first one is localization and mapping that uses data from sensors like lighters and depth cameras it allows robots to create a map localize themselves on that map and recognize static landmarks with our spatial intelligence service we further want to analyze that sensor data and semantically understand the environment direct robots to ROS shelves instead of just metric coordinates last but not least with our object intelligence service we can use the same data to discover and identify important objects in their location in the workspace that allows two robots to perform certain operations on those items so how does all that look in action the best early implementation of that technology is best logistics that's where we work with Bechtler ASAP as a provider of warehouse management system Mir mobile industrial robots the provider of hardware love robot fleet and novice the enabler of the digital tween but before I talk too much about beste I just want to invite vested cellphone state Klaus Kratz the head of logistics of Bachelor to tell tell you about his experience and how we are making the impact with our technology okay welcome thank you very much thank you if I think you very much for the introduction and having me I mean that very happy to be in San Francisco as you have mentioned we are from Germany and Germany is the country of the fingers and the poets so why I should be here and this incredible innovative place because I have taken I have adapt your mentality your spirit the American spirit just to do whatever it takes to gain new knowledge and new competences also that's why I'm very enthusiastic to have started this project with Google who is novice s IP and miR a pastor this is our headquarter at Bethel I'm responsible for logistics we sell hardware software IT solutions and IT services of course cloud services we are a year peon company and we have partners all over the world for example PC connection and Massachusetts as a partner for us in America we have more than 10,000 employees and 17,000 happy customers Voeckler is in my opinion a German success story not at the scale of Google of course but we have tripled our revenues within the last 10 years from 4.2 billion euro to from 1.8 billion euro to 4.2 billion euro and our target is for the next 10 years to double again this turnover to 10 billion euro to reach this target we have to integrate our customers more deeply increase in efficiency flexibility and quality within our processes and systems and find ways to cooperate with future strategic partners when the wind of change blows some people they build walls others they will burn mills and we are building windmills so basically logistic has to change from volume distribution to a solution distribution on this way we already provide where you added services such as individual taking packaging repackaging and transporting and also sustain real solution maybe in the near future we will have a flat rate for workplace for all IT equipment and software a customer needs including recycling and disposal of used hardware currently we have four main warehouses the biggest warehouses in Germany we have our warehouses in France Switzerland and Netherlands in the past we had to optimize and physically alter our warehouses which require a lot of time and improvisation skills and a lot of money as you can see within the next photos and this is really reality so why we have this drilling machine in our warehouse because we had to implement a mezzanine within our warehouse and we had to drill 30 holes 11 meter deep and this is really logistic things yeah it's really tough and we have done like crystal every night we have covered our Powerex to avoid dust or our articles and then you can see the mezzanine it's three and a half thousand square meters you see the the white white ellipse behind this there there are people working and an American colleague said to me always is very bad because it's against work security restrictions so I have hided these two people there but you can see a stage a mezzanine is growing and this is the actual warehouse and the rack we have big parts like how like servers PCs notebooks and in the on the on the mezzanine we have small parts like cables and USB sticks in the future we will need many more warehouses in Germany and also in Europe with a possibility to automate processes adapt them to customer requirements we need in the future very high flexibility dynamic scalability and very short throughputs to deliver to our customer as fast as possible our customers can count on us for the support they need to reach their own targets as a transition to German industry 4.0 the future warehouse in my opinion is a combination of traditional technologies like high rec warehouse systems and modern technologies or new technologies like autonomous mobile robots in our warehouse as if I have said we have already implemented the Google s IP mere novice solution we are using the solution for tasks such as cross docking items cross docking items means that in inbound logistics we get the information from s AP that customer orders have already been placed for these items instead of processing put away and picking we bring these items directly to the outbound logistics in the past we did this with electrical vehicles on a pallet and now we are doing it with Rex multi-level Rex and the robotics and how its work working I would show on a video so this is Claudio the mere robot it's Klaudia one with the support of its sensors cloudy picks up the card on which across stopping items Claudia starts to drive Ottoman autonomously to a static native destination and Claudio drives within a different zone and avoids barriers that may occur on its way dependently by going around them Claudia observes the environment still our people have got to get too used to it in some critical areas with cross traffic or forklifts Claudius emitting sounds to get the attention Claudio transports the car to its designated destination and moves out for new tasks yeah it's great and this is a great team of from Google s AP and Bachelor as a result of using autonomous mobile robots and future optimization we can achieve flexible automation process optimization scalability and productivity and yeah I have a good I had a good example from a forklift driver because we are very transparent and if we change to such new technologies we are having an open communication we speak with our people and to persuade them because we have an unemployment rate of 2% in the region I'm working so we have to be forced to automate optimize our warehouses because we don't get any more people we have to qualify them and so the people have realized that this is possible and they are not afraid and the forklift driver the next day I have mentioned that we go in this strategy he said to me but mr. Kutz we you have to pay attention with the robotics because I don't want to crash him so people immediately think about and this is great in my opinion think immediately what will happen with these new technologies and this is also the adaption of the people for these new technologies so thank you very much for your attention and if you are ever in Germany feel free to come by and say hello thank you very much Klaus for bringing your volu perspective to that audience and sharing your experiences with our project just thank you we'll continue this is exactly the best implementation of how we and our partners such as mere novice and si pecan men make an impact for businesses like best law in particular we need to make sure that we make automation drastically simpler and less expensive our core value proposition does has to be flexible automation with collaborative robots that can seamlessly and gradually be deployed into the existing environment as needed secondly we need to escape the vendor lock-in trap and enable an easy deployment of heterogeneous fleet that our vendor agnostic clients like bestseller shouldn't have to take care of coordinating the robots and processes between different kind of robots rather we should enable an ear earpieces than the assignment of tasks and orders in an intelligent manner across various robots thirdly we now have a chance to grow our impact by shaping new opportunities in analytics for example quality management inventory zation space management and so on so forth by putting our AI capabilities into action will enable the vision of digital twin generating new insights that go much beyond pure automation finally we need to break away from purely on print solutions that are difficult to scale and suffer from limited flexibility and low resource utilization rather cloud automation should use kubernetes to enable easy deployment and distribution of container right software assets that can run on robot on premise and in the cloud with all that we can generate real business impact that allows fast and easy automation and enables the flexibility in setting up and maintaining automation processes it facilitates efficiency and increased utilization by efficient fleet management better and faster localization and optimized path planning it also triggers productivity improvements by turning analytics into action and opening new opportunities in inventory space and quality management and last but not least it provides bases for scalability competitiveness and better customer service that will allow businesses to reap new revenue sources and engage with new clients but to enable all that vision and leverage technology we need to work with our partners and grow that platform into an ecosystem where each of the participants can benefit and contribute providing the complimentary skills that's why we invited some of them today to share their experiences with cloud automation platform and explain to you how we can all create our new business opportunities for them and on that note I want to invite some stage our partners nemrut diversion Oh head of industry 4.0 at sa P he leads innovation projects in the areas of logistics manufacturing and retail and drives programs for the intelligent enterprise strategy for sa p thank you very much for being here welcome stage we also have Niels Jacobson co-founder and CEO of Mir mobile industrial robots one of the largest collaborative robotics manufacturers in the world thank you for coming then we have Farex Rhines Hardin co-founder and CEO of novice a powerful platform for the digital twin for in their applications thank you very much for flying over to San Francisco and last but not least we have Moritz Tanner's CTO of magazine o that builds and developed intelligence collaborative robots for internal districts with particular focus on mobile picking robots thank you very much we had one turd things you guys hope you have good trip thanks for coming here and sharing your experiences to that audience on the cloud automation platform I want to get us started by by asking you a question the same question to all of you please explain how how are your companies benefiting from from the cloud automation platform what are the key challenges that you are facing at this stage and what are the benefits that you are drawing from working together in that ecosystem and maybe let's let's get us started with mirror getting from from the bottom of the stack from the hardware okay I can say that at Mia we develop and manufacture what we call autonomous mobile robots or AMR and we do that for indoor transportation to help the logistic there to optimize logistic and also as we heard before actually to free some of the working force there so some of the challenge since we see there as you have already mentioned actually is this the cost of integration we are distributing all our robots through a network of integrators and and they are taking the robots to the end-users integrating that for that purpose and it still takes a lot of time and is costly even though we have a simple system to operate on there and then you can also say that sometimes that the customer they always are new new way of using the robots that they would like and that's always something that we you not can provide out of the box then the customer has to wait either for a software upgrade from our side or find another solution for that and then we have the last module science is the integration with a ERP or warehouse management system there we also see that that tends to be a lot of specialized software there and here we really see that that this cloud solution can't go in and and help us on many of the points there this ability to to have versioning and updating the system Mallis for free now we also see that with a cloud platform where the ability to have data aggregated to the cloud in a way that you can do analyze this is now possible on a much larger scale and also the ability to to have adding clocks like an SI p integration there can be of great help for us he mentioned s AP and the integration with yura pieces tum' what is sa piece saying on that what are the kill challenges that you are facing and building on that point exactly how are we benefiting from working with with us and with with Niels and all the other partners Rudy yeah the thing is that s appears a lot of customers not only in warehouse management environment and more and more of our customers are interested in making use of collaborative robots and the thing is usually also our customers have different kind of specific processes they want to have being customized depending on which areas they are like mining manufacturing discrete and process industries or logistics the thing of course is that looking at those devices those robots they have different kind of capabilities compared to static robots that are they can be trained they can repeat their their processes over and over again why you have seen it on the pictures on the on video that they have more capabilities more dynamic features that need to be considered so in our case we cannot really cover everything and therefore we need a kind of a flexible environment where we can also integrate customers partners and third-party solutions easily and that's what the cloud robotics platform will help us to cope with all kind of challenges that are related to collaborative robots in this case just as an example if glass is going to make use of further fleets that are not from here or from from magazine o then the challenge will be to orchestrate them okay and orchestrate dream is one thing but to assign the task from the backend accordingly will be the next thing so but to do it over and over again for every customer would not make sense at all so we will be definitely benefiting from this cloud robotics initiative to plug in existing solutions even custom develop solutions for specific customers and we can deploy them easily regardless if that component is being deployed on robot and a cloud on Prem depending on the user of course and then we will be definitely be more flexible than we were in the past to integrate all kind of devices building on the point of both Niels and Rudy mentioned cloud Felix you are gathering with enabler of the digital tween a lot of data how are you benefiting from the cloud and from from the cloud automation platform at this stage permit me say a few words on what we are doing at Navis be cursus whole term of digital twin is gaining a lot of momentum and I think it still needs a little bit of explanation so what we are doing is we do not model environment but we scan environment and we scan it on mobile devices think about the mini version of the famous Google car now capable of working without GPS and equipped with scanners with cameras and it creates super dense and detailed 3d maps of its environment that we then overlay was more information and make walkable digital twins out of that that you can access in your browser and that's the point today we are creating already digital twins of manufacturing facilities for a lot of the largest automotive companies in the world but the data is being created and and process in a form that its most catering towards human beings for space optimization logistics optimization however of course we want to make this data accessible for our clients in a much more flexible way and we believe that in the future this data will be perhaps even be used by more robot than human beings and and man all the points come into play that you mentioned before there will be very different kinds of robots and they all need to be capable of accessing not only our data but potentially as well as a model data so at the end we need good automation we need standardized interfaces that allow for a variety of different robots as well as software solutions to make use of this data that will make our clients happy and of course will drive the adoption of what we are doing so that's why we're here yeah and building on that more it's you're not only building hardware but also software what are the key challenges that you're facing and how it's called how can you we do that you know so with our company we're building the hardware but especially all the software and the cloud it equation for mobile robots that not only navigate and transport but also pick and they these robots can operate alongside the humans in the same environment so they can drive through the warehouses identify the items pick from the shelves cannot go into the shelves and basically do all of this in a shared environment with humans that pick the same items from the same shelves and so on and especially this collaboration with humans creates lots of challenges because humans changed the words and compared to classical robots that really liked it when everything is deterministic and predefined we live in a pretty uncertain world we're still in a warehouse we're not in the children's room and in the afternoon that is much more uncertain probably but the word is changing constantly and the big challenge is how do you on the one hand design software that is scale scalable that is capable of analyzing this data that is can perceive the world and derive the right actions from that how do you develop and deploy this software to a fleet of robots that are somewhere in the warehouses but the big challenge I think that we're sharing with other people dealing with autonomous robots especially how to make them go bust so how to make it resilient to change as two inch perturbations to all kinds of kinds of changes that others have to cope with and that's a pretty data-driven thing so the developers don't sit next to the robots they don't see what happened so you really need to transfer all this this context all this information from the robots to the developers or to your machine learning algorithms and that's something where we can really benefit from the cloud I think on the one hand for using computation in the cloud on the other hand also for using data storage so how can we stream the data I'm going to make it available for easy debugging also make it available for automated machine learning on that and another track is definitely how can we use cloud technology in order to deploy software on the robots on the on-premise service and the cloud service and for example with the cloud engine how deploy applications on all of these different layers at the same time how do we roll it back and souls so that's super useful first and that's that definitely to keep and coming back to the hardware once more news how do you see the future for collaborative robotics and how this open platform and open echo system can help you grow the market in the future you can say in a way we we've already seen with our mobile robot that there's a whole community now building what we call chopped modules so that is different platforms you put on troubled robots and and that is already striving yeah and but but it's still limited in a way because we cannot add new software to it in an easy way so it's my hope that we in this way can envision actually is becoming a community that can provide new solutions for us not only on hardware but also the capability of moving the robot in another way we can have someone following people knowing what to do and this can actually be a kind of business where this software companies that are living from just creating this additional tool set for four different kind of vendors there we see that as really a kind of hope for that because we have many ones today that want to build more really good solutions but are just too small companies for that because this is to spread then you also see this ability to move a lot of the computing from the robots into the cloud something we have been hoping for more than 10 years but now we think that the foundation there is more or less ready so so we can see the first thing there things like planning how the robots is moving from in the warehouse there of course the robe on their own can do that but now we have several hundreds of robot moving together how this orchestration as we talked before how that can be done that just make a demand for much more computing power that shouldn't be on the robot there but should be on some kind of cloud computing platform there and and last I think we just released our first AR product this week so AI is really coming on to the robots there but you see much more of that this is really a field that's moving very very fast and I don't think any wenda can sit down and say we can do it the best we need to be open and see what others can come up with there and we really feel and also some of the things you have presented this week here that these are really really good platforms on how the robots can learn to interact much more with the people so we really hope that the robotics platform will be the distribution of new services new applications moretz you mentioned you are building a lot of software for for your about sorry for your for your hardware how would that help you in the Ponemon and distribution is that the kubernetes so kubernetes at the different layers we really promises to facilitate the soul the whole DevOps tasks and yet you have to do on many robots that are in the fields with different Internet connectivity levers also having to someone from its installation some cloud installations and so on and that can be put in challenging if you have large fleets also different hardware so I mean it's not all virtualized you really have physical devices behind that that's mechanically different there and really deploying to these things managing them having the fleets and data management I think that is one big thing that we can benefit from another one is we really use the cloud capabilities for making these robots more intelligent more robust so doing more machine learning in the cloud but also using existing services from the cloud and integrating them more easily and I think the third part is what's also planned for the robotics platform to have the marketplace so that we can benefit from other people's components for example the localization component also some may be some image recognition parts that we can also use it for sharing our own applications with others so if other Robert vendors can use certain control components for example that we have a way of sharing that and also sharing the experiences we made there on solving this we world problems and building on the application marketplace what are the benefits in the future for youth Alex and for novice as you engage on that marketplace and in the article system so just to give you an impression on you know what we create it's layers and layers of data it starts was really the replication of the physical reality in point clouds and images that then transformed into 3d models and each step is kind of a data refinery you know puts layers and layers of data like you start with the with the raw oil and end up with all the different plastics products and of course on all these different stages you have very complex processing a lot of machine learning and I a lot of that we do ourselves but you are spreading yourself is very thin if you're trying to do all of that yourself and as well all these kind of intermediate products are as well very important raw materials so to say for a lot of other applications and on all these different layers you account at the problem of generalizations and interfacing and of course we are talking about vast amounts of data we are now scanning tens of millions of square feet of data every single months some of bark lines with hundreds of millions of square foot of industrial space now move from scanning perhaps once every six months to every month and in the future one to scan every day so they want to have something like a real time to share twin only a very scalable and robust cloud platform can actually handle this kind of data run continuous leads through all these kind of stages of data processing so it's a matter of scalability absolutely it's a matter of interoperability with all the different players and of course I think at the end you need a marketplace because it will be myriad of different applications that do this data refinement in as well kind of take their data and on each of the layers between different applications so yeah I think that is why we believe that kind of cloud or kind of large-scale automated robotic platforms will play such an important role for us and I think it's not even possible to move that kind of ecosystem forward without Trudy maybe in building on that point of creating the marketplace and leveraging different applications for the for the business processes how is ERP system and SCP dealing with that and benefiting from that and also ICP and Google have a broader strategic partnership so how does this project fits into the overall relationship and partnership between Google and and ICP maybe you can comment on that I think this project has already proven that the combined set up having Google as a kind of infrastructure provider to us in this robotics project and us being able to concentrate on the business processes only allowed us then indeed to you know to ignore all this communication data storage and data management device management stuff that all of you need of course Nick would need to take care of but it allowed us to concentrate to keep the core focus on the improvements of things that you want to extend in our case to get the warehouse management being connected to the robots very easily and that we can use infrastructures that are easy to integrate to also to deploy the different components and containers very easily and that we can identify easily which components to use for the specific use cases this allows us of course on our journey to support our customers regarding the intelligent enterprises that most of our customers are up to also to include further capabilities that the Google cloud that will outperform is providing as you could see on the videos for example the machine learning based vision service that Google is providing that we can integrate easily into scenarios and use cases easily without having two weeks or two months of custom development that will definitely be a very big benefit to many of our customers if they want through it we include and enhance their processes and usually any customer that we have is somehow interested in integrating more and more of the AI and ml capabilities so at the moment we can start with the foundation that we have first that we have already in place but depending on the use case that the customer is interested in we can pick different components that are for example on the cloud platform or a customer or or even our partner is providing and integrate it into the intuitive process very easily and compared to former times it is by far by far more easier now to do so and especially also in conjunction with the industry for Oh initiative in in Germany that I'm also driving our goal is to have an environment where we can do a plug and play of devices of robots that our customers can easily integrate the devices in your process in your business but also make use of intelligent services that can be coming of course from Google from the Google cloud platform but also from embedded business applications that we already have in place so therefore it is definitely our complimentary set up to enable our customers accomplishing the goal to have an intelligent enterprise in the near future and as well on that positive note benefiting from from the partnership reverse ap with the business knowledge and b2b application so I think we all can benefit from that and since we are running out of time I don't think there is a better way to end that panel just by saying that we as Google are only as successful as our partners are so we we are happy that you are happy so to speak and for our clients like best we definitely want to drive business impact drive efficiency scalability flexibility for our partners whether there are startups developers ERP providers and so on and so forth we definitely want to enable new business opportunities and enable you to to reap new revenue sources and grow the market reach so that's our common goal I think for all of us so on that positive note thank you very much for your attention and feel free to reach out to us after this session if you have any questions thank you [Applause] [Music]
