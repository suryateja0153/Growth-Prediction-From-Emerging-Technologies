 The NASA Centennial Challenge for me was a life-changing experience. When you work hard on a project with a team it's an amazing experience by itself. The NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge was a challenge for robots to go out in a large field and collect a variety of samples. This is Cataglyphis in its final configuration and it has to recognize the samples, has to know where it is in the environment. Fully autonomously has to bring it back and this is certainly a really, really difficult problem. We were very excited and very proud to see that our robot that we put so much work into, hundreds of hours, thousands of hours, is actually able to pull it off. At that moment you are like, "I'm not living on the Earth." The NASA Centennial challenge really opened the door. We have started working on a robot-pollinator. And now we're working directly with NASA JPL to make future Mars rovers more autonomous. Everybody had a life-changing experience. I would definitely recommend it.
