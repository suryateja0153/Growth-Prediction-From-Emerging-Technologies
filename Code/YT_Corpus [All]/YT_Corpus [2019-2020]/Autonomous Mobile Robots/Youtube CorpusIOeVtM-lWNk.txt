 We are here at the 307 Lake Shore Boulevard East, Sidewalk Labs venue It's the Institute of Navigation's ninth annual Autonomous Snow Plow Competition and Sidewalk Labs Toronto was generous enough to bring us here and host this event. This year we have eight teams competing. They've been working hard on these it takes probably six to nine months for a team to put a robot together. This is Dunwoody's project Wendigo. This is a n autonomous snow plow platform we've been developing for the last two years to be able to sense everything around it, autonomously navigate, keep it track of where it's at and not get lost has been a huge problem that we've had to try to overcome through software and advanced technologies. The real question when you build robots that you have to think about is where am i? And the next big question is where do I want to go? The biggest thing is that we hope to be able to perform as well as we did last year, if not better. We were able to take first place last year so we're here to repeat that because ultimately we're here to win and our biggest fear is obviously we don't want the robot to explode or to go rogue and hurt anybody. Go team Wendigo! Go Blue! [Unclear chants] Announcer: looking at this in the front row , we all got a good spot to see what's happening on this sunny Toronto day. Saturday January 26th as the snow Devils prepare for their first run. Let's count it down. 5...4...3...2...1...Let's plow! Let's count it down for team Yeti. 5...4...3...2...1...Let's plow! Let's go Yeti! Look at the speed...go Auto go! Slow, steady, methodical, powerful Wendigo. There you go...that's a nice autonomous robot. Let's hear it for Wendigo!
