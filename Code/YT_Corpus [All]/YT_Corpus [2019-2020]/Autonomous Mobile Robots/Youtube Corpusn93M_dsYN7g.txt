 The idea of the project is to do something that every discipline has some expertise in. Interdisciplinary teams of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and software engineers building robots over the course of the semester and they are to autonomously deliver paper to two different printers on this floor. All the groups are doing a line following robot. So this is the track for that robot to follow. This is a really fun thing for our Introduction to engineering class. [music] I had all the functionality. I brought all the pieces together. So like making it follow a line. I got that down. Then I, you know, I worked with the obstacle detection, got that down. But, then bringing it all together was the challenging part, so it took a lot more planning. So I actually had it laid out, and I had a whole whiteboard covered with the algorithm I developed to make it follow the line as well as it did. We're good. We're good. You guys nailed it.
