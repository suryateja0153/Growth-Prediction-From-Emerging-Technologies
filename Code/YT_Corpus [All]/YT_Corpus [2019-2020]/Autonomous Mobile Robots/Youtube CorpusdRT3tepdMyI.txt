 meet the robot chemist a mobile autonomous worker that has been designed to offer a helping hand around the lab we started the project around three years ago and we'd never worked with mobile robots before we've worked with automation but the first few months were that were spend really just learning how to drive the thing around the lab reliably what we've done unusually is to use a mobile system that has advantages because you can really drop it into an existing lab and without much modification use equipment which is already there to some extent if a human can use the equipment the robot could use the equipment this robot helper has been designed by chemists at the University of Liverpool to help them in their research into developing photo catalysts which are materials that help produce hydrogen from water using lights but the robot it communicates with a software control system wirelessly it needs to be wireless because it's moving around a large space the robot weighs out the solid catalyst it dispenses the liquids it shines the lights onto the samples it measures the outputs which is nitrogen and based on this output the hydrogen emission from the experiment it then makes a decision about what to do next just like a human chemist this robot needs to be able to adapt its workflow based on the outcome of its experiments and this requires a computational solution if you work out the number of possible combinations of the components in the experiment it's something like 98 million so the robot uses an optimization algorithm using a method called Bayesian optimization to navigate that chemical space to help it work more like a human chemist this optimization algorithm is a type of AI that gives the robot decision-making capabilities but unlike its human counterpart the robot can run continuously so there's a balance to be struck between giving the robot too much freedom and restricting it if you explore too much then you end up doing 98 million experiments and that's just not possible but if you exploit too much if you optimize too greedily or too quickly you don't necessarily find the best solution during these experiments the robot relies on its articulating arm to interact with lab equipment and at the end of this is a special gripper that allows the robot to pick things up and operate machinery to navigate the lab and to avoid misplaced stools or avoid collisions with its human co-workers this robot uses lidar which is a bit like radar but uses lasers instead to map its reading' environment on top of this laser scanning system there's a a force feedback calibration and what that is is the robot taps a cube which is located in a fixed space and that then provides a sixth position reference point the robot is programmed with the coordinates of equipment and instruments that it needs to use and each of these stations is marked with their own cubes this gets the robot closer to having the sort of positioning and control that a human would have with their hands which is essential when interacting with delicate glassware it doesn't just move around according to a program it navigates and makes its a choice to do the most optimal schedule now you could in principle do that with a human but it's a pretty uncomfortable way for most people to work to be driven by an algorithm bear in mind the robot doesn't invent the experiment doesn't design the experiment it doesn't come up with the hypotheses so so the Robo is a tool to search the space we still need people to think of the problems to work on so I don't see it as replacing jobs at this stage I see it as augmenting people's abilities to do research and amidst the global pandemic the robot has found compelling new potential in maintaining lab work during periods of social distancing we've now received a lot of interest on a technology in terms of how might you restart laboratories while still operating a certain level of social distancing if you have a technology where you can load load the system up and then that takes three hours and then it works for eight days or two weeks by itself then you can see possibilities there so yeah I'd be delighted if we can find some way to [Music]
