 This is the ANYmal. To the untrained eye, it may look like a robot. And that’s because it is. But it's no ordinary robot. It's an ANYmal. This ANYmal has just enjoyed an underwater excursion… because it can. The ANYmal is the only robot of its species to be completely waterproof. For robots in Switzerland, it's regeneration season. ANYmals use 3d lasers to scan its environment for the perfect place to rest. Most species hibernate for the entire season, ANYmals completes their battery-cycle in only three hours. Now that the ANYmal has had its “power nap” it's ready to go back to doing… whatever its programmer tells it to. Comfortable in any habitat, the ANYmal can go anywhere. ANYbotics. Let robots go anywhere.
