 An Autonomous System, or AS for short, is a collection of routers which share the same routing policy. What this means is that all the routers have the same view of the Internet, and agree about the best way to reach any particular destination. The routers in an autonomous system are normally owned and managed by the same group of people, and typically each organization will have one autonomous system. There are some cases where an organization might have more than one AS; that's quite unusual. Each autonomous system is identified by a unique autonomous system number or ASN. ASNs were originally 16-bit numbers but they have now become 32-bit. In addition to public ASNs, there are ranges reserved for examples in documentation, and ranges reserved for private use. These can be used when two AS's want to exchange information with BGP, but that information doesn't need to propagate to the rest of the Internet. These days AS numbers are shown as a single decimal number, which is called the "asplain" format. When 32-bit ASNs were first introduced, they were sometimes shown as two 16-bit numbers separated by a dot, called the "asdot" format, but that's rarely seen now. It's also rare to see the special ASN, 23456, which was a transition measure for software which didn't understand 32-bit ASNs. So if you want to connect your network to the internet with BGP you'll need your own AS number. To get one you'll need to contact your regional internet registry, or RIR, and probably pay a small fee. Except in a few very limited scenarios, in order to use BGP on the internet you must have your own IP address space. So in fact you'll need 3 things from your RIR, a block of IPv4 addresses, a block of IPv6 addresses, and an autonomous system number.
