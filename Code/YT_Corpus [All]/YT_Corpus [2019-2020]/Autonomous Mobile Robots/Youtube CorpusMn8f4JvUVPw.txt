 our farm is located in Cambridge Wisconsin in America's Dairyland we are milking right now 220 cows I went farmer hunting and I found my man about 22 years ago our twin daughters and in Katherine were in high school and Anna said that she wanted to farm with us but she didn't want to milk 9 hours a day there's a lot more that goes on with dairy farming than just milking the cows it feels like all you're doing is milking the cows when you are in a tie stall barn and I wanted to focus on the cow comfort and cow health aspect of it the relationship between our goals and Hinch Lee's is like a partnership people buy a robots for a lot of different reasons in their case it was a labor issue so we took them to farms that save labor as we started looking at robots we wanted to see who had been in it the longest way Lee's really stuck out to me I was impressed that it was designed by farmers the arm it moved with the cows and it was smooth and it was quiet so when I saw this robot it was something that I could figure out that that would be the future of our farm I want to go and continue the dairy farming aspect of it so we put up a new robot barn it feels great I feel like I can live five weeks into the robots beam in we're like let's go to a movie and it was four o'clock and that's when we'd start milking it's just like this is what normal people feel like we've been giving them farm tours for 21 years now it's a great way to go and get socially sustainable with the community and advocate for agriculture most of the kids that come out on tours this may be their only farm visit ever when they come out it's an eye-opening experience for them to see how passionate we are about our land our water the air everything that is around us and when they're going through with the hay ride and the cows are reaching out to them they feel the love of the animals and it's not something that they can experience anywhere else unless it's face-to-face on the farm Tina has groups here almost daily during the summer and they did not have consistent labor to help them know in some cases she would be stuck milking at the time she was supposed to be doing a tour and robots was a the answer that's something that a lot of firms don't have time for it's really something that we need to start pushing as people start getting so many generations away from agriculture I feel very strongly about saving small family farms even though it's a small part I'm playing a part in allowing people to continue to dairy that otherwise would be selling out because of labor issues health issues things like that I've personally seen farmers break down literally come to tears telling me how this technology has helped them robots are the tools that are saving my life and literally saving my life pushing in feed is a lot of hard work on your shoulders and your hips and your knees having those Juno's running on a regular basis has boosted our milk production scraping floors that had to be done before milking the discoveries they buzz around and take care of that manure if we didn't have the robots our future would be selling cows somebody coming out and starting fresh with the dairy science degree I think this is just it's the way to go I went to school for dairy farm management not to milk cows so the robots are a blessing so now I can have more time to manage the things that I really like to focus on now that we have the robots we have time to be better managers we have made the barn as how comfortable as possible so they're free to do whatever they want when they want so they can get their feed or they can get a drink of water we have the Layla Luna brushes in there so whenever the cow wants to get a scratch you can go and get a scratch or leave yourself and go get milk so there's a lot of cow comfort going on in that bar [Music] all the technology with laylee robots it can be accessed through my phone I look at the other health report see if there's any mastitis issues or abnormal melech so I think can sort those cows out in the robot and we can put them in the sword pen I have a camera app so I can go and watch my cows 24/7 going into the robot and coming out when the robot is not happy the robot talks to my phone if there's something wrong it's gonna let me know but the thing with the robot alarms is that it's pinpointing which robot it is and a lot of times it's telling me what the problem is and the solution right there the more that we can teach our farmers to do the less expense they're going to have down the road through the FMS support which is fire management support we really want to make sure they achieve their goals you have to keep improving if you're gonna stay in the industry technology is out there for you to take advantage of it and make your life easier and to be as productive as possible this is an investment this is future labor this is future happiness this is future health everything is going on in that barn right now milking for me was a structure and a routine that I took on but now I'm ready to retire I'm gonna retire from that milky and I can go on into the laylee milking and assist Anna in her legacy it's definitely a pleasure to be milking with laylee robots
