 Automation of repetitive tasks  reduces the need for manual labor. The research topic of robotics includes  various disciplines such as mechanical design, mechatronics, control systems, machine vision,  software development, IoT and machine learning. In our robotics lab, we focus on  programming and mechatronic systems. We study and implement mobile  robots that are fully autonomous, smart vehicles that are best suited  for labor-intensive routine tasks. We are also implementing robotics  for industrial production purposes and studying social robotics in  service industry and in health care. The future aim is to develop new  intelligent technologies by fusing together AI-based control algorithms with  novel robot kinematics and mechanics.
