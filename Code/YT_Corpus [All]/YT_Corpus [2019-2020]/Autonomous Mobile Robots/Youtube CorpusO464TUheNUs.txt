 Steve McLaughlin: What are the areas that you think are going to have among the biggest impact for artificial intelligence coming down the road? Justin Romberg: I mean the most interesting things that I'm seeing right now in the pure research field are people using and adapting AI algorithms— a certain suite of algorithms maybe called “reinforcement learning”—to help and drive autonomous vehicles— swarms of autonomous vehicles— how they interact with each other as they move; how they work collaboratively to solve problems. So this idea of having many flying, swarming drones all behaving with something which looks like collective intelligence, it strikes my intellectual curiosity somehow, or intellectual enthusiasm.
