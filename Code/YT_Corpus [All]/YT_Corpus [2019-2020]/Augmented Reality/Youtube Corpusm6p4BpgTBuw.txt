 [Music] thank you so much for coming to our session on AR as a feature and for everyone watching on the livestream thank you for tuning in we're really excited to talk to you guys about how you can supercharge your projects and products using augmented reality but before we dive too deep into that let us introduce ourselves my name is austin McCasland I am a UX designer and prototyper at Google daydream and before I joined Google I've written a couple courses on AR and VR product design in development I've designed and develop some award-winning AR apps and I just am really passionate about spatial and immersive computing cool and my name is dan wang nice to meet you all I'm a lead user experience designer I work on Austin's team and I'm really passionate about working at the intersection between digital and physical interfaces before I was working at daydream I was designing products at nest so really thinking about hardware interfaces spatial and physical computing and everything that's in between and before that my backgrounds in computer science but in general my day-to-day now is working with Austin on rapid prototyping all the time so we're super excited to jump in and share with you what we have today so today we're here to talk about augmented reality we're excited because AR can give apps superpowers but the key message today is that you don't have to make an AR app to use it air has progressed to a point where it can be reliably used as a technology that any app can leverage the ability to spatially understand an output content into the world opens up new possibilities across every vertical so today we're going to start by talking about AR as a technology we'll talk about where it was and has been in the past few years and where has gotten to today and why we have this message for you all today we'll spend some time talking about how you can evaluate your app for its air potential and this is going to draw a lot from our team's experience working with a lot of apps working with AR and we'll talk about different ways you can think about your app and where we found that air brings a lot of value and then we'll spend the bulk of our time today talking about different approaches and processes so that you can develop your own air features and now I'll hand it over to Austin to jump in all right so I want to start off just by level sitting on what we mean when we say AR or augmented reality so to us there's really two key components that makes a are this awesome thing that can up level any app and the first of those is the ability to understand the world through the camera so we're talking about understanding the world it could be anything from little feature points that are on objects around it could be detecting that a plane is somewhere it could also be more semantic understanding of the world so if you lens a banana we know it's a banana right the ability to reach out and have the computer understand space is super powerful and that's that's one of those two spokes the second is the ability to reach back out and put spatial content sort of believably seated in the world so what you're looking at there is when you put into the Android on a table and he's moving around and there's lighting estimation happening and there's tracking that helps keep it all in place and when you combine the ability to understand the world through the camera and to put content back into it all these really interesting things start to happen in terms of like use cases and user journeys that you're able to enable in your product so before we dive into the nuts and bolts I wanted to sort of set context for why we are talking about AR as a feature today because AR has not always been ready to be a feature in all different kinds of products so we're not going to do an exact historical run-through of dates and times but I do want to bucket sort of eras of AR from a product perspective so the first one the very beginning AR was pretty much relegated to like lab environments or you would see art installations that had AR and we even consider some of the like early projection mapping work so projection mapping is using a projector to like light up particular shapes and stuff as being these these early first steps of AR but if you're a product person it's not that easy to see how you're gonna create a product out of it unless you're doing you know experiential marketing or immersive theater or something like that and so if you have to get people to go to a place to experience they are it's kind of hard to build a scalable product around it in that sense so there's this next phase which was I'm sure many of you are familiar with it if you're not it's sort of we were using mobile images or images tracked on mobile devices to pin content in the world and the way that worked is you would have your phone and there would be some sort of image or QR code and by using that as a reference point we could put this digital content overlaid into the world and it was awesome it actually represented this big jump because now you could deliver a our experiences on mobile devices right I could put something on a store someone could download it and then they could have this this cool experience but there were a couple of shortcomings the the tracking wasn't as good as what we have now and if you lost sight of the image marker it would kind of go haywire and most importantly you had to have this image marker in space right and that's a really tricky proposition it's hard enough to get someone to download an app but to get them to download an app and also print something out can be challenging and so we did see some adoption of this tech in like marketing campaigns where there's physical collateral or if there were instruction booklets things like that where you would know that your app could could have those markers available but the game really changed with modern AR platforms like AR core and this was basically a from a product perspective like a quantum jump I remember when I first saw these these new AR platforms I was working with the image marker staff right and there was always a struggle and I saw some videos and I just was like I don't believe that is not that's not real so I went out I bought devices and I tried it and I remember sitting there and thinking like man this can actually be a thing now this I can release production quality user experiences with AR and the really important thing about this is there are there's no need for markers there that is a feature that you can access but you can send anyone a link to download your app they can download it and no additional effort is required they could have the experience you intended and so lowering that barrier to entry combined with a really consistent output of quality has just really changed the game for you know a are in a product sense and that brings us to today which is air as a feature so when these when these platforms first hit everyone went out and we were making AR stuff like that's when I made I made an app that you can you know paint in the air it's really cool really fun but these were these AR apps and what our team has discovered because we sort of go around inside of Google and say how can a are unlock new potential use cases for people is that your app doesn't have to be an AR app and in fact some of the most powerful ways we can execute on AR is including it just as a feature in an existing app and today is the perfect time to be doing it because these frameworks make it super easy when they when you see a re can look kind of like black magic like it's super hard you need to be a mega genius to get AR stuff happening but in reality you know eric worre makes it super easy and there are tons of helpful tools so like today is the time when I think any product person can be evaluating their product for this stuff so AR is a feature essentially means that the whole app isn't about AR so what you see here is Google Maps right and Google Maps is not an AR app right it helps you get where you're going it helps you search for awesome stuff but it's not all about AR how ever the team in discovered that for certain areas like in this case walking navigation it can be really powerful and enhanced the app experience to use AR in those moments and same in your your i/o app right if you pull it out and use signpost you can get where you're going but it's not it's not relegated just to navigational use cases but as we'll see you later so I'm gonna kick it over to Diane who's gonna tell you about how you can assess the stuff you're working on to see if maybe AR could do something awesome with it cool Thank You Austin so let's bring it over to all of you and start talking about how you can determine if air is right for your app here are several principles and questions that you can ask yourself as you decide on whether air has a potential to add a lot of value to your app and this is all going to be drawn from our team's experience but we'll just kick it off with the big question so we always start off by asking ourselves the simple question why do we want to use AR and that really helps ground us in user value and thinking about the specific value that this suite of technologies brings to us and going a little bit deeper here on our team we think that there are two broad categories of experiences that air can make shine use these as guidelines as starting points to answer this question so here are the two dimensions you may have heard this in our developer keynote the two dimensions here are helpfulness and creativity so these are two broad categories and that's one really easy way to get started and thinking about hey does my app fit in here does my feature fit in here and just thinking about these from a broad perspective helpfulness is a really great place for air to help shine because AR understands so much of the spatial context around a user that if you're trying to have an app that helps the user accomplish something air can do that in a lot more quicker of a way and when you think about creativity has a lot of opportunity here to help make feature shine as well you can see that air allows you to be a lot more expressive and engaging when you're thinking about a creativity feature you can directly overlay things and output content into the world and also have suggestive content that leverages our understanding of the context but beyond these two buckets our team also has some other insights that we found just by working across a lot of different apps so here's one to start with one area that we found has high air potential is when there's information from the world that we'd like to have in our app often if users need to look something up from the phone to complete a flow in an app air has opportunities to enhance and streamline that experience air has ability to capture information from the world and make user journeys a lot easier and more streamlined so that was from the helpfulness dimension but when you're thinking about creativity apps as well air can suggest expressive content that is relevant to the scene and context and another category of experiences as high opportunity for AR features is when someone needs to interact with the real world to use our app so if someone needs to do something in real life to complete a flow these are really great signs that air may be useful and one example that we Illustrated here is you can imagine that someone if someone has some specific dietary needs or preferences and at a grocery store and they really need to go and fiddle with the products in front of them to understand the products are right for them air has the opportunity to understand that at a much faster rate and we can even output that in a way that's really really natural so this illustration shows that for example maybe we could just highlight that area that would have taken you a while to get to so I've just covered two broad categories but also two other insights but is that all definitely not these are not absolute truisms and they're often entirely different err opportunities in an app that don't fit in these buckets so you're all going to have your own special scenarios so we encourage you to use these as starting points as ways to start thinking and having discussions about your app and to try out the experiences and so we're going to go in over this next but one of the fastest ways to really understand where air can add a lot of value is to just jump right in and start making things and one last note is to remember that air is a tool and a suite of technologies and will add a lot of value to some problems but not all but our guiding principle remains always ask yourself why is this better with AR and now I'll hand it over to Austin to talk about how we get these to happen suite Thank You Diane so I call this Pratt the fun part it's the fun part for me so when we talk about building air features like how do we go about approaching that and our team does this all the time over and over and over again it's great so I'm gonna run you through these three principles in these principles there's just sort of these lighthouse concepts that we try to keep top of mind when we're developing AR features and there's some unique things in here that sort of differentiate an AR feature from a more traditional from a more traditional feature in an app and these are that our prototypes are our sketches we consider design and development to be intrinsically linked and that it's okay to be cool but we need to strike a balance so I'm gonna dive a little bit into each of these starting out with prototypes our our sketches so if anyone has been in a room with designers or product people or anyone anywhere we know that sketching is this awesome tool for communication and for the purposes of this piece let's think about sketches as a way that we can assess ideas so I might make a sketch and I give it to Diana and we use that to figure out like is this idea good what do we like about it what don't we like about it and those things run through product teams you know product management engineering design everyone lays eyes on these but we found that with a our understanding whether or not something is good or like worth pursuing it's really hard to capture from a sketch there's all sorts of things that look great on paper and then when you try to go to execute on them they stumble and it's it's really tricky and so we try to get to these prototypes as quickly as possible because that's really the baseline for our AR features for us to be able to say is this working like do we want to continue on this and refine it the next principle is that we consider design and development to be intrinsically linked and I know they they are in all normal app development cycles as well however the the relationship between design and engineering in AR is incredibly tight and in fact every time we start a project we start design in development at the same time we don't come up with designs and then show them to engineering we don't even run like tight back-and-forth cycles we we sit next to each other and we'll have a computer with like a development environment happening and the computer with a design environment happening and that's because right now there's all sorts of opportunities for design to be really helpful for some of the harder technology problems so an example that I like to give is you know let's say it's pitch black right that's a really hard situation for AR we lose tracking and so from an engineering perspective that's really hard you're like how do we need depth cameras do we need all this stuff but if the design team is right there they can say actually hold on is as long as you can tell it's dark we'll just ask the user to go turn the lights on right and we find that there's all these opportunities to design around really hard technical problems and that the technology often informs what's even possible in a design and you really have to try it in the hand feel super important so the coupling of these an AR super critical and the last principal oh I'll go over is that it's okay to be cool but strike a balance so in the design world we often call these like you know moments of delight moments where we do something that really exceptionally powerful or useful for a user that was surprising to them or these little moments that you see in like animations or just you know go to dribble if you're if you're looking for what I'm talking about but in a are these moments exist as well and they're actually often much more powerful they're these sort of moments of awe like if you watched the keynote you saw that shark go onstage and that's just one of those moments that it's it's not just a light it's this whoa and we have found in our testing that that is really powerful for users because it does two things one is that it captures their attention and when they're more focused on our app the more successfully complete tasks inside of them and so it actually serves a functional purpose and two is that we've noticed when we are working on features where we actually really focus on these on moments and consider them more spending time on they tend to go hand in hand with users being successful overall even besides attention and it really helps them be memorable against the competition so the other part of this is strike a balance it can be really easy to go overboard once you have the AR stuff running and turn your app into like a game experience and maybe you want that but you want to be on brand and it's possible to maintain like the the mood and attitude of your application and have AR that's impressive and exciting without distracting from the core needs of your users and now I'm gonna dive into just a couple methods and techniques we use a lot of these will probably look very familiar to you if you've done product design type stuff but I'll give you some examples of how we use them in our AR practice so they are sketching and wakeboarding rapid prototyping and quick user tests and I know I just said that prototypes are our sketches but it does not mean that we do not sketch we do a lot of that early in the cycle of an idea having a shared visual for these spatial computing concepts is super important I've had multiple multiple times where I've had like a 30 45 minute conversation was the you know p.m. a fellow designer engineer and we're both vibin and we're on the same page super excited and then I go to draw what I was talking about and it turns out that we were not on the same page and that it was very different the sooner that you can get some sort of shared visual to frame your thinking around the better because we the vocabulary for describing spatial problems and the way that users interact with space is just it's really challenging and so these visual supports are super helpful we'll also do storyboards where we show how users are going we anticipate them moving through space with our experience and we'll do flowcharts you name it and this is really just a tool for us to iterate super fast before we even touch those prototypes next up is rapid prototyping and I would have to say if our team has like a superpower it's this we make prototypes fast and you two can make prototypes fast because one they don't always need to be technology prototypes as Dan will show you later you can do physical prototyping in space and often that's enough to assess an idea and at least get it off the ground but also there's amazing tools nowadays like we use unity a ton on our team to just bust out these quick and dirty prototypes just to get the hand feel and if our prototypes are sketches then we do a lot of sketching right so we try to just get to the the quickest and dirtiest way to feel it and try it out and assess it and if if it passes muster then we really refine it and one of the ways that we do this for fighting is through quick user testing and I don't mean like doing like a really quick Survey Monkey user tests although you could be fine it's more like I'll go to Diane and I'll tap our shoulder now say hey try this right I'll just constantly thrust new builds of the prototype in her hand because it's really difficult to see the forest of the trees in AR and part of that is because there's this physicality to augmented reality as a medium and you actually develop like a muscle memory for making your app work the right way so you like do like oh this is how you do it you'd hand it to someone else and then they're like what you know we're often spaced and you didn't realize that though I need to have some affordance to guide them back to what they need to be doing so lots of quick user testing and feedback and then eventually once you think you've landed on it yeah run some actual user tests validate feature I'm gonna kick it over to Diane who's gonna run you through what it might look like for our team to go through this process and it's a process you might be able to scalp for your own product development thank you so yeah we're gonna go through the whole process and take a look at what it might look like and to end for you to start to prototype your own air feature and so I'll talk through the steps first right now and then we'll walk through them one by one and these are incorporating a lot of what Austin just said there's principles methods and these are very special to a are because these features are so closely tied to the physical and world space that there's new things that classic methodologies in the field might not really address so we generally follow these steps in our process although we always adjust steps based on what is relevant for the feature and we recommend that you do the same kind of dig into what I'm saying and the underlying purpose behind these methodologies and pull the steps that really work for you and so from a high level we always start our process by jumping into a brainstorm and opening up the air opportunities this is where you start to bring in a lot of people get a lot of diverse perspectives bring out the creativity in the group and then we start deciding and this is where my previous conversation about how you can evaluate different air features and apps comes in handy then after we decide on our ideas we start sketching and this is where we get the broad strokes of all our ideas austin talked about this before but there's different types of sketching you can work with any low fidelity materials you have around you but then we gradually push it toward physical testing and if it's a if it's really applicable you might have some apps that are really closely tied to the physical world space and physical elements that are all around you so the fastest way to get a sense of those interactions is just to try those out and then after that we kind of understand our concepts so we jump into design and development simultaneously and I'll talk more about how we do that later and another kind of underlying step that we kind of consider more horizontal is we're always testing early and often and that's what the people around us but it's also great to try to incorporate your users as soon as you can and we always wrap up our process by taking the feedback that we get from all of our tests and we prioritize the stuff that we want to incorporate we think about supporting functionality and that we walk out with a really cohesive concept but jumping right in let's just start talking about the brainstorm phase and so this is where we open up all the opportunities we have a really great robust conversation with our group and we really try to pull together people of diverse perspectives so people from different functions of different backgrounds especially from backgrounds of people who'll be using your features so people can empathize with those groups try to pull them in and if you get a diverse group you'll also get really creative ideas on the board as well and this photo shows you what one of our brain storms might look like over here I'm just putting ideas on the board but I'm using a design methodology called affinity mapping where we're grouping a lot of the post-its together by theme and that really lets us take a step back and talk about the themes that are really exciting before we get too caught up into details and once we have our ideas on the board we have discussions about the ideas that we are most excited about and have the most air potential and this is where our previous sections on evaluating air apps and features comes in handy and this photo shows what one group of ideas may look like at the end of our brainstorm we're doing something called dot budding where we give each person a certain number of votes and these are dot stickers and we use this as a way to gauge the general interest and ones that were the most excited about as a group and we use this as a way to facilitate our conversations not to decide our ideas so try this out yourself and one other tip is that our team has done this a lot so we find that giving each person around three to five thought stickers is a really great balance between trying to get a nice breadth of votes but not spending way too much time trying to get those votes down and now once we've decided on our ideas we jump into sketching so we sketch to get a first pass glance at the solutions that were excited about in this photo I'm storyboarding a complete journey of an air feature using whiteboard and marker and this is where you can see that air starts to have a difference in classic design methodologies as well this is not a sketch that you would typically have for 2d app because you can see that I'm sketching a user in world space with elements that are pinned in world space so you can see that even at this stage we're starting to think a little bit differently and you might have to pull out your perspective drawing skills and so we encourage anyone to use any low fidelity and scrapping materials that are available you can do pen and paper whiteboard a marker to just try out the entire user journey and take a look at the feature at a first glance so one unique part about working as a r is that UI elements interact with physical elements in the real world so it's a great idea to try out your designs through physical prototyping so here's a really great photo of something that our team tried out we have these UI elements that we wanted to have pin to the worlds these fruits and so in order to understand a few factors like scale legibility and how they look like and feel like in world space we just created and started prototyping with physical elements so paper is great for this we've worked with Legos we've worked with clay those are really great low fidelity physical things to start working with and once we've gotten a good look at initial designs we jump into design and development simultaneously and Austin talked about this a bit before but our team really enjoys working with sketch for 2d UI designs and unity to develop our experiences quickly and at this stage we work through a lot of iterations of our concepts as questions show up we usually have designers and developers partnering up so you have the really nice collaboration and just back-and-forth of questions along the way and this step is incorporated into some of the previous steps as well but testing early and often is really key to a successful error feature since there are so many edge cases and interactions that we've never encountered before in 2d designs and here's a photo of Austin testing out a prototype in a lightweight manner with real-world objects beautiful in our in our office yeah just try to do it really early really often and continue testing with users all the way through development I know we're talking a lot about rapid prototyping for early concept thing of things are just kicking off but something that's really important is work with your stakeholders or whoever is involved in pushing your feature to launch work with them along the way to share your insights but also push them to also continue testing along the way and here's our last step for today once we have a lot of feedback from your colleagues from users we bring this feedback back for final polish and this is where we walk through all of the remaining pieces for cohesive feature and some examples of what we'll be working through in this phase include notifications edge cases in different contexts offline scenarios and scalability but now I'll hand it back to Austin to bring everything together cool thing again so upgrading your app with AR I hope you guys do it because it's rad let's pull together everything we talked about today so if you were a product person or a designer or an engineer or anyone who cares about the space maybe you have an idea for a product really start thinking about AR and what you're working on and you should really just evaluate your own app Freya our potential think about are there ways that I might be able to make this thing easier to do for my users or more exciting for my users to do or is there something that we never could have done before that we can show them in the real world and you know it's like it's not right for every problem but if you can answer the question why is this feature better in AR then you should do it in AR the next is that you won't know if it's good or not until you try it so try stuff out and I'm not kidding the suite of tools that are available for creating quick features that you can test out are it's amazing so I'm a designer and I do some coding and I make these all day every day if you're an engineer take go on unities website and check it out or do native stuff it's it's a lot less intimidating than you think to build these AR experiences like just get your feet wet I bet it's way more fun and easy than you expect and AR core makes a lot of the hard stuff really easy and finally keep on testing and testing and testing until you're confident it's awesome and deploy it thank you very much for coming to our session I'm Austin McCaslin I'm Dan wing and we hope you guys enjoyed it and build some super powered apps with AR [Applause] [Music]
