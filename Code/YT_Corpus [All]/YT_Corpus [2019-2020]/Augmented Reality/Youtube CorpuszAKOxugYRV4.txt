 let's have a look at how you can use some images to create augmented reality experiences based around real world objects in this example an ar book review in keynote i've made a really simple template for a book review i'll share this template down below i'm going to open up reality composer now and i'm going to create a new project i'm going to choose the image as my anchor point this time and when it opens i'm going to delete that blue shape on top i don't need that so i'm going to tap on it once then tap again to delete then you're left with a placeholder for an image tap on there once to select it and then on the inspector on the right hand side you can choose your source of the image this will open up the files browser and i've downloaded an image of my book cover which i'm now going to select and it will drop it straight into reality composer this book is now actually far bigger than the real book would be so when i tap on the object i can adjust the physical width and physical height sliders in the inspector get these a bit closer to where it needs to be in order to make your experience even more realistic then i'm going to swipe up to show the doc and i'm going to drag keynote over as a popover window with my book review on the screen i need to tap and highlight all of the objects to make sure they're grouped into one single object then i'm going to tap and hold and when it's selected i'm going to slide it across into reality composer and let go on top of the book from here i can then adjust the scale of this object to make it match the book underneath i can obviously zoom in out and rotate but we're working on a flat plane this time so you don't need to worry about rotating through all three axes finally once we're happy that everything's lined up and at more or less the right scale we're going to have the play and the ar buttons on the top of the toolbar when it realizes that my actual image which is the book cover is in the shot it will then snap and anchor itself straight to that cover that means however i move the book or the camera on the ipad i'll get that augmented reality experience right over my book there are so many ways you could use this in your classroom imagine making the display boards of pupil work come to life the book view is just one idea if you've got any questions or any suggestions let me know in the comments below and don't forget you can download the book review template by following the link in the description have fun with this hey thanks for watching that video now if you enjoyed that and you want to find some more quick tips for your ipad or to use in your classroom do me a favor and press the subscribe button down below that will really help me out and it will help you keep up to date with all the latest tips and tricks on my youtube channel
