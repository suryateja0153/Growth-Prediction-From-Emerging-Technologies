 Combine augmented reality with Automation Studio to bring your digital twin to life. The Wi-Fi connection and built-in mobile computer within the HoloLens allow users to move around without limits. The program is coded in Automation Studio and connected via Ethernet to the industrial Physics simulation environment. Improvements to the process can be evaluated by zooming into the hologram. The holographic view provided by the simulation makes development meetings much more efficient.
