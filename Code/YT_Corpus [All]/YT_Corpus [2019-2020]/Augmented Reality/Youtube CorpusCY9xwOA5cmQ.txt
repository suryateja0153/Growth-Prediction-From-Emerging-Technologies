 so thanks for the introduction my name is Mike an evening this is Katie media and Katie decided not to go to her own graduation instead she decided to go for CAI and so therefore we're going to comprehend this paper to work on 360 proto and I'll get us started and then katie is gonna take over in a few minutes so last year at CAI I worked on a project called Prada our show a quick summary here the idea was to start prototyping mobile AR applications on paper and then provide a set of tools to designers so that they can quickly capture paper and also play-doh as placeholders for 3d models and that way rapidly generated mobile there are applications at that stage they were market based and so this year we're going to present 360 proto and it is the next tool and my line I strongly believe like Yoshi Shiva fights the pixel Empire I fight the unity Empire I strongly believe that we need new tools to support HIV our prototype and I am really impressed by the power and flexibility we have with low-fiber no typing in particular paper prototyping no if you teach interaction design like I do I often refer to magnetics paper on prototyping for tiny fingers and this is the illustration that was used there to Institute to illustrate how a paper prototype could be tested and so we expand this vision to 360 paper prototyping modernized a little bit to support both prototyping with VR users and a our users in a similar fashion so this project presents or this paper the main contribution the way I see it is the system that we produced here which consists of a suite of tools that's how I think of 360 proto for generating interactive a of your prototypes from paper so both the interactive part and that we generate something from paper is key here and so the paper actually contributes a study on the use of emerging paper templates in the practitioner community specifically for ARV are we develop three and other tools in 360 proto and that we're going to demonstrate here as well and we show support for Wizard of Oz prototyping where we simulate rather than implement everything to produce an ARV interface and so I'd like to hand over to my colleague Katie so initially we gathered design templates from practitioners from places like Facebook and medium and here is shown in this slide we found a variety of templates for designing environments for controllers and faces for VAR VR experiences and initially we conducted a set of design jams with 36 master's students to capture information for requirements to better understand how users prototype for AR and VR the students completed specific design challenges by recreating three interactions from existing and imagined applications using plain paper and an equi rectangular environment template during the first design gyms we also tested our initial prototype for our tool and so with these design jams we uncovered three requirements for the tool the first is the support for layered prototypes so we found that designers needed to prototype all the parts of the AR VR app from the AR marker overlays to the VR controller menus and HUDs so our tool needed to be able to support multiple design layers and the second requirement we found was an integration with design digital tools so air VR prototypes require a big jump from traditional paper prototyping which is just 2d students found it was difficult to imagine what a design may look like once it was AR or VR so we found that our tool should incorporate realistic previews of the designs on an AR VR device and our third requirement is for Wizard of Oz capabilities so in the design jams designers mentioned that it was great to show the interactivity on paper and so we want to be able to provide that dynamic real-time preview of interaction within the tool and so we derived our inspiration for this tool from 360 photos and there equirectangular format so we were able to find to gather information and create a 360 paper template based off of a VR grid created by design practitioners and it's shown in this image the equirectangular grid can be morphed into a severe to create the VR environment and to explain our 360 paper template imagine that you can wrap this grid around your head to form a circle and so you can see that the very center of the grid is where you would put content that is directly in front of you and at the top you would put content that is directly above you and at the edges you would show content that's behind you and based on our initial feedback from the design jams we added a field of view in a range of motion based on the work of Mike Alger and other design practitioners these additions were made to help designers be able to draw within scale and understand object movement that happens in front of the viewer so to test the requirements we created this example of a Mountain View with butterflies this example is composed of three spherical layers a background a mid ground in a foreground and each is hand-drawn on a 360 paper template these layers have been placed at different distances from the user to simulate depth within the scene and so here Michael will be able to provide information about the 360 paper studio thanks Katie yes for 60 Pervis to do and I was hoping you have a life demo but we rely on Wi-Fi and this room is particularly bad for Wi-Fi so what I'll do instead is I have lots of videos and I hope to convey how this works so the way this tool works if it works the way this presentation hang on uh I didn't get any of this alright so and the labels that I show here it's actually a fairly complex tool what I want to illustrate with this if you look at the we actually simulate what this would look like on a mobile phone and that mobile phone could be like in a cardboard or in a daydream and but you see that view here and what I also illustrate here is on the right well says 360 layers is actually how we composed and this environment from the different 360 layers from background to foreground mid-ground and we have various features in the tool and including chromakeying features to remove background from like paper background and other kinds of features that you want to remove and we have a live feed that means we can actually stream back to an AR of your user which is a capability that we use for Wizard of Oz so what I want you to I want you to understand a little bit the different components of this tool so one part of 360 proto actually runs on a mobile phone and we developed our own camera app if you will that has a variety of features it's also multi-user and it can actually be used in a classroom environment and I've conducted initial usage of the tool in my own a of your course on this app you can actually capture the paper template that Katie was talking about and so this would be in a three step approach the camera itself through the 360 proto camera tool has the initial support for capturing and the environment from paper and providing a preview in cardboard so this looks is for example if you have a forest scene you composed not sketched but composed using paper printouts and cutouts you would take I'm sorry this is a bit weird okay you would take a picture and you would immediately see your preview and I'm gonna show you a video where this actually then happens live okay so what just happened is I took a picture and so this video wasn't edited it is immediate preview on a smartphone and Co scopic rendering on cardboard sorry about the technology hiccups here all right so next the next step is actually putting this tool in the larger workflow so this was just what's happening on a mobile phone which allows rapid previewing in VR or in 360 with a handheld so just like using the magic mirror mode and but then we have a more sophisticated part which is the studio and the studio is usually run on a laptop so that's the second step where you can compose multiple layers that you may have captured and I want to show you one that I think very powerful feature is there is a third component to this project is the final AR of your application that would support things like a moving butterfly so I want to I want to illustrate you one of the one of the examples that we created that I'm particularly proud of it is possible with this tool to create a live preview of a butterfly essentially flying in front of the user and we do this in AR and this is really something I would have liked to live demonstrate here and it is possible to extrude spawn and 360s here around me and project the butterfly right in front of me if I walk around with my mobile phone you see a video of this in a second and the way we do this is I actually on top of the paper prototyping template and we use a marker to move the digital butterfly and then I'll show you in the second part of this video is when this butterfly is then actually not live animated but it's actually kind of in the room in AR it's spatially anchored so the first part is here are live streaming including capturing and it's really difficult to you know because the other user would receive this live stream so it's really difficult to illustrate on stage how this would feel but so we capture and now we're moving over to the end user who sees the butterfly is basically appearing life in the room alright so if you're interested in this this is web-based and so it works in a variety of setups we have the camera tool we have the studio that actually supports all the different layers and we have the app that is running on again a smartphone and then we stream WebRTC media streams into various directions to actually capture from paper and then live stream and compose a AVI our interfaces one feature that I'm particularly proud of is because current mobile phones are still they overheat when you run this AR for 20 minutes they overheat and they actually you know go down in terms of performance so we had to pay a lot of attention to where we actually composed the AR experience so we capture the live video in the app we stream it to the studio the studio does the AR composition based on information from the mobile phone and streams it back to the mobile phone and that seemed to be the most most performant way to do this so I'll show you one of the examples that Katy has worked on katie is a designer and I wanted Katie to create the Star Trek for me and the next generation Star Trek and I want to illustrate a little bit how we do this and so what I'm doing here is we just landed in my house we are we a Star Trek I'm Captain Picard and I'm going into my well we just landed in my house so now we're looking at my kitchen slash and dining room in that fast-forward we are walking into space right now and I'm showing you what this Star Trek looks from the outside and you also see our screen which looks into my living room so what I just illustrated here is actually a very flexible use of the tool and we are constructing this experience if you're familiar with the Star Trek the captain's chair in the middle is essentially a smaller 360 sphere there's another layer around it which is essentially the bridge and then we have the observation deck and that is a room that is just next to the bridge and we built this by over setting the spheres on the right and using a our core it is impossible to essentially walk inside your paper prototype so we explored the use of 360 proto we ourselves try to create a variety of experiences we are students to recreate relatively complex I have your projects they had previously created with a frame and the unity we asked students in the design team to create multi-layer 360 prototypes you really wanted to explore like how complex can it get and we also explored live streaming in Wizard of Oz capabilities so we have a variety of results and basically here are some of the things that you can do with this template you an are in a three hour class we actually ran with my area course we had students work individually we just show you a sample here so using the template they could quickly prototype a VR YouTube experience including the menu there are specific templates for VR controllers as you can see on the right and then an AR and use interface with a are cut with with news content appearing in front of the user or also if you are more interested in face-to-face role based AR and this is also supported by our tool we have a variety of features to that so I'm going to show you two more examples that I think are interesting and then we're gonna wrap up so if you know the Amazon AR life shopping view that I'm sure the Amazon team spent some resources on it prototyping we can create that we can also recreate a highly interactive racquetball game this is one of Katies in my own favorite example in this case katie was the record player in VR and i was tennis ball on a toothpick and above the paper template and so what did we learn from trying this together with students and our own experiences so the overall feedback that we received apart from the fact I guess one of the key things you don't have to implement anything you do not have to be a programmer you do not have to know any api's which is well the state of the artist you just have to know unity or you do know I have a native air career kit or hololens mixed reality to a kit so what our students were our increasing interest in new acts find it was useful for design space exploration so this is a powerful tool to quickly eliminate AR as an option you do not have to implement all the things to realize that AR is not the right approach you can just prototype this very quickly the templates guy design but sketching is actually still difficult KB spend several weeks really exploring the template and optimizing the template and so that way we could create the Star Trek for example for our students in particular but I think also Katey when she reckoned it was difficult to imagine the final user experience so the live streaming support is very important that you can actually try it out so essentially we need all three tools in 360 proto to really prototype in AR VR experience the tools that facilitate creation of realistic a of your interfaces the fact that they are lo-fi and paper was actually never really mentioned as like a negative it was sufficient to X you know experience at least and we think this is actually the way to go this is the low five prototyping version of AR and VR and The Wizard of Oz actually enabled a lot of these interactive experiences and our students actually stated that they consider the air viewable prototypes created with 360 proto as a medium medium fidelity because obviously high fidelity would then be probably that thing in unity again so again we're not trying to replace unity we're just trying to fill the workflow in a half year so that we can have a nice prototyping workflow starting with low fidelity prototyping and that is actually the paper 360 proto thanks for your attention [Applause] thank you any questions like that you have two reasons for going with low fight in almost everything you know with the phones and everything it's a very expensive operation I plans for I've been with Unreal Engine or something like that and rate the equipment and not doing it at the web-based model so we chose a frame for right of reasons that way I can actually run it in the class and it works relatively okay I mean your you know your question actually targets multiple aspects so my attempt is not to create I don't think I want to be more higher fidelity than this I think this is fine the next step is actually going into unity or actually just stopping that project which is a you just saved thousands of dollars asking a developer to create the prototype for you and then realize it's not the right thing and and I think the way I think about all these different prototyping tool to put a frame here put unity here and I put unreal I'm not tall enough but higher than that and cinema4d I don't know where to put it but the other thing is that this is actually a tool and this emerging space of lots of digital prototyping tools it just really we target the low-five prototyping gap and I think I just where I want to be and but there are transitions actually and hopefully upcoming work in the future that these prototyping tools I mean one of the limitations is the prototype dies with the tool because we do not actually generate code we do not actually produce anything we could export assets to a frame and but that's something that are increasing exploring this bridge into tools like a frame or unity but not replace them here from national taiwan university is really interesting work I really like it I especially like the the the final part the final video that you used a toothpick to animate the ball in in the in the virtual world but and particularly wondering is it possible to that facilitator the the operators actually see that we are seeing or they are seen how do this the the facilitator actually know the user is what the user is looking at so that's actually a very good question sir and we have so we have the support to stream these streams and replicate those streams it's a multi streaming interface in our experience most of the time we oriented ourselves using the studio that I showed you that actually has the live preview that would be hard to find that slide right now the tool that's running on the laptop has a live preview of what's happening for the phone user and that is the orientation point for the wizard so the wizard is it's just using that however we could replicate that stream and actually build other interesting tools by using this multi streaming solution as well so congratulations this looks really interesting and fun to use I wonder you already mentioned there must be a difficulty to to draw on the template and to predict what kind of distortion and you need to draw the distortion on the paper and if you have any thoughts on how to make this easier yes so in the process of drawing on this if you understand anything about perspective it might be good to forget about that because it's really difficult to conventionally provide perspective in something like that that curves so much at the poles the way that I found to be easiest is to have that preview of what it will look like once it's been wrapped in a sphere so using the tool like while drying taking quick snapshots of the experience just to make sure that you're thinking in the right way about perspective was was the way that I found to help most end practice great oh thank you everyone thank you Michael and Katie [Applause] they will be here for any questions that you might have
