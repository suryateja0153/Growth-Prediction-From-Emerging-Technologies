 well I'm going to do a quick experiment today which is to ask you the question when is an augmented reality app not an app when it doesn't require you to download an app so let me just heat you to this QR codes that QR code is gonna take us to a website the website is called eath whoa it's our web a our sites no it's just loading up right now I'm on a 1 bar of a 4G connection right one bar so it's not like it's a particularly a good connection let me just take off the Wi-Fi to make sure that we know that's the case and like we have in front of us a little augmented reality 3d dinosaur guy let's walk around and make sure these properly 3d yes yes now we have what's called six degrees of freedom which means I can move towards them I can move away from them up down strafing left and right pitch in your I can get really close to them no hmm why is this exciting well this is exciting for me interacting with them because we did not need to download an app by downloading an app does the mean fraction point between people using different forms of augmented reality not bothering particularly for advertisers this is a big deal now the other thing that's a big deal about this is it's trackable it means that if you were to use an O of Homer advertising campaign like a poster advertising bus shelters that kind of thing these are notoriously hard to track the return on investment on well imagine you are a bus stop and you are interacting not having to download anything with let's see a movie poster and that movie poster becomes a movie trailer that means that you've got more interaction at the end of that you can bridge the digital divide by booking your cinema tickets for that movie straight we're finding out where the where the nearest showing or it is so there's no having to remember things and then go and act on it later on also the advertiser gets to see who interacted with their advert when they interacted what location they interacted in so that when they are quantifying the return on investment and where they're going to put their money next for the next form that their advert on that next section of that marketing campaign they know exactly where the most successful bus stops are teams of D for a digital hoardings which you can chew the appearance teams and their and just in general they can see what people are interacting with how long how much they spent this is a big big deal for advertisers so the old dinosaur friend you have been responsible for the evolution of form and traditional advertising upon you okay so thanks very much for listening everybody any questions you might have place them in the comments below and I will do my best answer and I'll probably put together to be video
