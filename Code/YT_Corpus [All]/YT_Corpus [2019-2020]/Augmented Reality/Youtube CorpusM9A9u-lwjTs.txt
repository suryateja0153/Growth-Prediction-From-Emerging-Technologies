 hey everybody its norm from tested and it's Jeremy from test welcome back to projections we're recapping some of the stuff we saw at the recent augmented World Expo a lot of hardware a lot of cool demos and one of the products that was announced there comes from this company and real right a new augmented reality glasses solution and their innovation isn't necessarily in new technology that's applied but in how they're applying existing technology it's extremely small what they've managed to do usually when we see augmented reality glasses that are that use a combiner like this does is you have a lot of equipment up top that gets shot down that the imagery gets projected downwards and then reflected into your eyes using a 45-degree angled mirror well they've done this in a way where all of that equipment is almost invisible and it's lightweight under a hundred grams in fact the product they announced there is called the N real light which will have two versions one which just the glasses for five hundred dollars and one that's including the computer the pocket computer compute unit that will be twelve hundred dollars and we both got to use it and I actually got to chat with one of their managers about the products so let's hear that hey everybody norm here and I'm at a better world expo this is Andrew with n real great to meet you Andrew to meet you now it's our first time using your new product Li and real light which you guys have coming out later this year sure you're excited tell me about this this headset certainly certainly sold this is a real light that's the classes that we have announced earlier today so it's gonna be available in early 2020 as a consumer kit but other than that of all the three pieces together are also gonna be available as a deaf kid in September this year so anybody who's interested in developing our platform should be able to apply through our website to tell you a little more about our product so it's called in real light actually has double meanings mine's been very lightweight because we want people to wear it very comfortably for a more extended period of time and second is also about you know lighting things up right cuz you know we have a signature optical system where we can you know we have 52 degrees peer review 1080p high resolution the image quality of this device is really awesome so much ATP per eye alright if I the form factor is really interesting because it we is one of the first headsets we've seen it reads like a pair of regular glasses all the the optic systems I imagine aren't here yes right so it's it's doing a combiner and I can tell from the profile check there's a little bit of an angle here so it's all compact compact in this in this area exactly exactly so just just for information that device the glasses itself only weighs 88 grams so that's actually little bit more just a little bit more than one pair of glasses so that's how we keep it very lightweight very compact and the design is very sleek so that everybody can actually wear it because our mission just to be very frank is to make mixed reality very accessible to everyone so yeah now you said it's a 52 degree field of view that's the horizontal that's the VI agonal diagonal Phillip II got it you also mentioned three components of course there's the headset here which will be available consumers next year the other to come own so you think of it as the compute unit and the controller right so so we do have two different bundles one is this the glasses itself because it actually can be tethered to a commercial phone use over or us PC USB type-c plug into the commercial phone use the phone as a computer unit as well as a controller that's one bundle as more for the consumer market and for the developer kit however we do have our own little pack that runs on Snapdragon a 45 and also we have a three dolphin taller which can be attached magnetically on top of the depth it is a Snapdragon 45 is that going to be a min spec for the phone version or will also run on for the phone we are counting it compatible with a 45 and a 55 this phone I'm quoting particularly as LG be 50 which runs on a 55 so you know there's a there's AG USB C port right here which when you plug the devices into you will be able to run demos on and that data running through here is it a video signal that's going through we also on the glass itself it doesn't really have any power so most of the rendering images and the power comes through the cable directly off to the to the classes and the classes are sending the sensor data down to the form for its two-way connection you are getting data on it here and it's sending the video that processing on there and then your phone will act as the controller then yes so when you plug it in you're gonna show we're gonna see a interface just give me one second it's kind of loads up and yes yes up so right now this is a just a simple interface so when you move around you'll be able to use the form as a controller and this area is also a touchpad area so you'll basically use the phone function when we you know when you can click just do a select and you know double click a swipe all those gestures will be supported what type of mapping are you using so I do see some lenses here looking out into the world know the demos we've seen you can track some some mats or those tracking marker base or is there some type of slam right so as you can see they are dual monochrome cameras on board so those cameras are for tracking purposes we do develop a system for a slam system so simultaneous localization mapping yeah we also leverage so when you plug the device into a poem for example we also leverage poems lower level API just two highly optimized the entire system install bar it's not marker based even though you may have seen some of the markets in the demo area we do have you know plate detection labid and completely based on you know slam and future point extraction and all that kind of stuff so it's just a very powerful system to recognize it to understand the amount is the idea that this is meant for single room use putting objects in your room on walls or is the idea that you will go out into the world and use GPS as well to to map a bigger environment it can be both I don't see the reason why it has to be you know restricted to a single room actually we do have a couple visor on the Alpha side and those files can be actually you know replaced with more like a sunglasses type so that when you go outside you will be you don't have a you know enough brightness too that's was placing the external pass-through and on the inside then also saw that you have inserts exactly would that be included as well exactly so the inserts will also be included you want them as it once again we want the mix you our lead experience to be accessible to everybody so the way we do you know we take our you know prescription first two playoff reflective lenses is we magnetically attached them inside the glasses so that you don't have to wear your glasses whole side so and also we do have different shapes of nose pads because we do realize the ergonomics of people face different a lot especially by race so you know we do offer different shapes of dos pads which can be also replaced right here just simple as that very cool thank you so much enjoy and think about the demo as well to meet you all right nice to meet you thank you so much okay so the glasses themselves when we put this on as we talk about the interview the the field of view I thought was compared to some of the other combiner AR classes it was good as generous the feel of you who still has leaves something to be desired I mean you still see the edges of the projection which is inherent to all augmented reality that we've seen that isn't sort of a vr combination yeah and so yeah I mean it's fine it's fine but you do move your head around and you see these cut-offs which is you know it takes you a little bit out of the out of the presence that you might develop and something interesting that works to how they made this headset so small is if you look at the front of the lenses it's not the full lens that is the optics that you look through the top half of the lens right here is like the hover is is actually black now because that's where the displays are right and so your verbal field review is actually much lower than I think it could be I thought that that there way that they squeezed so much into so little space was like the real innovation here and plus the fact that these actually the first AR glasses that look like classes I mean this is like this is what we're shooting for maybe not the technology yet but the form factor like they've made them red they're supposed to look like the actual style choices mm-hmm the opaqueness I thought was was decent as you would get with a combiner you're finding that striking that balance between the opaqueness of the imagery and how dark it looked the real world looks like and and obviously in conventional environment it's not your standard outdoor environment in fact a lot of their walls were very dark walls so that when they have these images projected on them they would look more opaque I think it's a fair use case I don't think a lot of people are using a hourglasses outside yet I mean obviously that's where we want to get but you know no time in the near future I was most impressed by the vividness of the colors yeah it doesn't OLED projector I assume it's some kind of a display it really is vibrant I mean those colors pop out of that display I mean in a way that I haven't seen before in a flat-screen monitor it's really really beautiful and pretty high-res yes and new 1080p for each eye now the demos they had were very standard across your stay our demos they had services that were tracked that had objects kind of in front of them again designed so as you would look through them they would fit in the field of view we got to go use the demo where you got to put basically a video player up on a wall and so you're sitting on a couch and you're looking through and you see what looks like a 70-inch TV on this black wall and video playback I thought you know while the alignment wasn't perfect yet the video payback was clear I could see myself watching youtube videos on this so walls probably would you say like 9 feet away 10 feet away exactly I disagree I probably would not use this for that just because the screen itself was almost the exact dimensions of the viewport so if you were to look around it gets cut off from it but it's certainly compelling I mean it's neat it does plane detection so it can tell where surfaces are I think it you know the slam the the simultaneous location and mapping that they do is not as advanced as like a leap motion yeah but it definitely can sense some aspects of your environment which lends itself more to like you know placing things into your space which is really for me the more compelling part of VR the other part of the design is something we expect to see with a lot more glasses in the future is how the compute works now this is off the glasses compute right you have one tethered cable that's plugged into USBC essentially to either their computer which runs on a Qualcomm a55 with a little pup that as a three-door controller or if you buy the $500 unit it will be plugged into a an Android phone something that they have a partnership Qualcomm they say would work with either a a 55 or an 8 45 and a selection of phones that would would work with that the input was a little funky for me because it was just three dot I thought the input was super compelling because you're it's not a dedicated device it's a standard LG phone that you're pointing in $3 and the laser was not lagging like that was actually really quite well done I thought that they had incorporated like some special tech into the phone but it works perfectly yeah and then you get like makes sense that's why it's Rudolph because they're not tracking the phone from the class that's right it just is the orientation limits the type of experience you're gonna have and again it goes back to this is the type of device I think makes a lot more sense kind of indoors living room environment and then walking around and the real world but it is you know it looks like a fully manufactured product doesn't look like a prototype and it's 500 bucks 5 juzz's for the goggles now do you think that that is getting to a point where like consumers might be interested in this and if so what for yeah I think meteor consumption like if it's gonna be putting a video in your real world like an map to your wall while you can still have conversation with people you know I still think this is a developer device I don't know if they have development partners that are gonna make games and more games and other type of games that will be suitable for this but it does need to hit that kind of consumer friendly price point for this to be mass-market yeah this is definitely hits a lot of those it's getting their points from augmented world expo we also want to go to VR and you had a chance recently to play a oculus Studios game that is expansive in its ambition oh my gosh so as God's wrath yeah this was announced back at GDC I want to say where Jason Rubin told us that this was the biggest game that had ever been developed in VR and I didn't know what he meant by that it didn't mean a scope of the game how long it takes you to play through didn't mean the budget that they've committed to the game and for all that I can tell after playing the game for about two hours last week is it's both like this game is freaking massive its RPG players have not had a whole lot to appreciate in VR yet because most you know experiences are maybe 10 hours at the longest and you have ports of things like Skyrim but that's that optimal for VR controls yeah that is definitely I don't even know if that's a real contender because the the VR controls are they're just not great the menus aren't great they're not designed with VR first this even the scale of the game had to be tweaked a lot in order to make it work in VR same with fallout this is a ground-up triple a vr RPG game and it's it does a lot right and I think that the combat while really compelling that kind of a lot of attention at GDC but it's all of the other RPG elements like the the leveling up the crafting the collecting the you know going to the merchant and buying and selling and all of the stuff that creates this world and makes you make your character feel like something that evolves that is going to be what takes this game to the next level and really is going to be the first time that that's been done in VR now what you played it's something it's not fully open world like you are there are instances yeah that you can go into your honour the earth or Asgard and there are these chapters and you can kind of then do a whole mission and the mission will have what enemies combat puzzles they call them sagas and so each saga that you go on you take you possess in a sense a character and the saga that I went on I possessed a woman who was going to avenge her brother and she speaks to you at first and she realizes that she's being possessed and there's an awareness of that but as a god I can then do other things that she wouldn't be able to do I can take animals in the case of my playthrough I was able to take a shark okay and I converted it into a humanoid shark creature and NPC yeah like a psychic who then becomes your your companion and and so he goes along with you and you can control him by aiming at the floor and you're almost like a hunter in that sense and like the world of warcraft sense where you're controlling what that character does and they become somebody who can help you get through battles or can help you solve puzzles so you can aim at the bad guys and have your character go attack or you can in the case of a shark you can aim it like a cadaver that's up in a in a cage on the ceiling and he'll jump up there and like and like eat at it trigger down and that solves the puzzle I was also able to capture it a turtle character turtle becomes you know not a ninja turtle but close enough and he becomes walking through the space and he can then block things for me because he's got a shell so he goes over there and he blocks the fire and then I have to play the timing game where I walk through the fire one is behind him do you get a sense that they have like a screen number of these animal avatar at PC definitely there's a whole radial menu of ones that you will eventually be able to choose and there's quite a quite a number of them I only got to see those two but it looks like they go up to upwards of 10 I mean that in itself feels like there's a whole game there and that's part of a bigger definitely story and while the sagas appear to be somewhat linear you you I played through a third of her saga and that was two hours there are several sagas and each one takes place in different realms so as you said I was in Midgard which is Earth but there's a lot of other planets on this menu that I will eventually as a player go to and some sagas travel between realms yeah and so as I was saying if it even though those are somewhat linear the characters that you collect stay with you so you can bring characters from other realms cross to other realms and then bring ones that you have back to realms that then unlock new areas so there's this hole and there's Easter eggs galore everywhere you look you know there's like torches that aren't lit and you have to figure out how do you light all of these torches within enough time and you have to do that in god mode or as human mode and they don't spoon feed you you know like a lot of games especially in VR they know that it's like maybe physically uncomfortable and people are new to this and they're spoon-feeding you and treating you like a baby this game doesn't do that so much you know it there's a lot there to discover and go back to if you don't you know if you want to spend the time and develop the you know allow the game to develop itself look at the footage that was captured from your playthrough what struck via was just the production value like the world building my huge environments and even like things like indoor environments that had statues and increase your architecture I was really impressed now granted I've been playing a lot on the quest lately mobile processor and I while I'm impressed by what that can do with its Snapdragon processor to then go and see like what the absolute peak of PC performance can give you I mean it really is this is a game that I don't anticipate being ported to class like this is definitely a triple-a PC experience and it looks great I mean the fire effects the geometry the character animations the voice acting it's all there and while this will be an octave oculus exclusive because it's an oculus students game I mean it is still one that I'm spent plenty spend a lot of time in and I hope that everyone else can at least give it a try did you find the combat was satisfying a lot of people are hoping for more challenging combat with melee combat combats greatly yeah it's it's interesting because it's almost like a Prince of Persia style thing where it's a timing based thing you know you can you if you walk up there and just smash mash mash doesn't do any good in fact it does nothing to them you have to wait especially if they're armored you have to wait till they swing at you harrier in which case you can either block it and if you block it with your shield that works or you can swing as they swing at you and the shield don't knock them back same thing with the sword you can parry an attack or sometimes they charge up their effect and if they flash blue that means they're going to do like their super attack so it's a it's a slightly different timing game there but if you parry that it does a lot of damage and you can then go in for the kill if they flash red that means you it's unblockable and so there's this other ability to - and so you have to move out of the way of those and I didn't even get to the point where I was comfortable fighting those that like the combat has a real sense of easy to learn hard to master I was not good at it and I but I knew where I was faltering and I wanted to go back and get better at it you also get a sense that it's gonna take advantage of like VR locomotion like climbing and not enough like there's a lot of safety features in the game if you walk up to us even a stairway you can walk down the stairway or you can grab this glowing arrow that's on the banister and it will teleport you to the bottom of the stairs and I'm like come on do people really need that I guess some people do because they don't even allow you to climb chains this way you go to the chain there's only the the grabby thing to teleport to the top that was one of my requests like please let me climb the chain yeah they do let you climb a ladder in the same senses but the same way there's a glowy thing as on the stairs so yeah I would I would like more of that I personally I love different locomotion mechanics in VR games that's one of things that gives me a sensation and so the more that they can push that for me personally the better but I understand safety features are important to a lot of people and that's Asgard's wrath it's gonna be out later this year and the fact that they're letting you do two hour-long playthroughs right shows their confidence and at least the scope of this skin and it also shows a sense of curiosity on oculus this part I think that they are as curious as anybody about how this investment is going to pay off because this hasn't really been done yet and it's a huge gamble on oculus as part to make a fifty hour RPG for virtual reality and so I'm super curious Sanzaru is the developer they previously did Marvel Powers United as well as the sports game that came out with the rift so they certainly have been they know what they're doing MBR and this is their biggest one yet very cool well next week I'll be at e3 check out some more oculus games and we have more coverage from aquata World Expo so a lot of stuff coming out in projections thank you as always for watching and we'll see you next time
