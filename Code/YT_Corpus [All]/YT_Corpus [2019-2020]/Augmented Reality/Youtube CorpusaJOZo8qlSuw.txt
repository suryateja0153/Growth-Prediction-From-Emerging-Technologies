 this is a gcs news break megan's heart is beating away that is pretty cool isn't that fun it may look like they're posing for a picture but what's happening actually goes much deeper deep inside the human body in fact annie benson and megan coburn are wearing augmented reality shirts from techterra education and with the help of a smartphone and an app it allows you to see all the working systems inside augmented reality is taking a target that looks like if anybody's ever used qr codes and most of us have in fact if we've been in the grocery store and we've scanned something to see the price that's the same technology really that augmented reality uses so it's taking a target in the case of the shirts it's taking the skeleton target and as soon as you're on that target it's then bringing the human body into life after seeing the ar shirts and what they can do vandalia elementary media specialist annie benson reached out to susan wells at tech terror education to see about getting some wells went one better by donating boxes of stem related materials along with 30 ar shirts enough for each third grader in the school i think they're going to be super excited about it especially because they could see it inside themselves and it makes it so real because i think sometimes when we're talking about things to students they're so abstract and i think for this especially we're taking the abstract and making it real and even though techtara is based just an hour away in durham vendelia elementary is the first guilford county school to have this new technology we have schools in china and malaysia we have schools in the uk and portugal and spain and schools all around the u.s but in fact sometimes it's hard it's hard to reach out to people in your own community so that was another reason i was just thrilled to get the contact from annie because we want to support our own community so that was really exciting for us this has been a gcs news break
