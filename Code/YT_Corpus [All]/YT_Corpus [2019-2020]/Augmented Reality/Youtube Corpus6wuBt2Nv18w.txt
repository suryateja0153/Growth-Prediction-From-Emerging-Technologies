 hello my name is pascal janssen and i'm presenting share enabling co-located asymmetric multi-use interaction for augmented reality head mounted displays we designed share with diary of enabling non-hmd users to become part of the virtual environment of the hmd user and enable them to interact and explore documented content together due to recent brokers in consumer technology such as higher display resolution and miniaturization augmented reality and virtual reality is getting dominantly realized using head mounted displays while ar and vr technology is often treated separately they share common problems which arise from near-eye display usage such as isolation and exclusion isolation occurs when an hmd fully occludes the real world from users and thereby isolates them from the environment for example here the hmd uses isolated from the group while interacting within his own world exclusion occurs whenever information is only visible to the hmd user and every user in the environment without access to the hmd is excluded from the experience this example shows multiple external bystanders who do not know and see what the hmd user is doing right now there are broadcasts that fight the exclusion for vr such as cave-like systems and collaborative virtual environments gokenheimer i'll create a system for vr that prevents isolation of agent users and includes non-agent users in the experience similar to our idea they use the projector setup to visualize the virtual world to the outside while this empire work is already addressing the issue of isolation exclusion for vr hmds there's currently a lack of work focusing on these factors for ar hmds so how can we include people in the environment without an archmd and enable them to understand and interact with the virtual world of the ar hmd user so we build share which is a modified hololens ar hmd a dmp projector a server motor that is controlled by an arduino nano using the internal cameras of the whole lens we allow non-hmd users to interact with the projection via touch input this enables a new form of asymmetrical interaction which the hmd user can share similar content or combine both technologies to create a new and more inclusive type of display with all corrections the projection is distorted and does not match the virtual content distortion correctional lines projected content with the virtual world of the hmd user we use the server motor attached to the projector to compensate head movements and ensure alignment various use scenarios arise from our flexible hardware setup including different use modes such as sitting standing or walking and usage of any planner service in the environment for example sitting at a table with a group of friends and playing a dice game standing in front of a white board with colleagues and placing notes navigating with a virtual floor plan while walking or playing arok on a clipboard if there's no suitable surface around to explore the design space we implemented three applications labyrinth treasure hunt and floor planner the goal of the collaborative game labyrinth is to influence the character's game path by shifting the labyrinth tiles thereby the hp user must guide the non engineers as only he can see the obstacles and treasure chests thresher hunt is a turn-based competitive board game in a pirate setting the hmd user plays a treasure chest on the game board fields that must be found and marked with flags by the non-hmd user both users can use special items from a store that have different effects on the gameplay and surrounding fields floorplan is an application for architectural design which allows both users to view and modify floors rooms and other objects by developing and testing share we discovered various challenges specific to the combination of a rh and dm projector the hpd user may perceive a mixture of inside and outside visualization when augmentation virtually overlays the projection a solution for this is to show all content using only one of the visualizations for example the projection another solution is to show specific objects that are relevant for the user in each visualization due to intentional unintentional head movements the projected image is constantly shaking or jittering we apply the motion filter to minimize twitter and to smooth the overall movement if an autographic projection is used less object information and details can be displayed in the outside visualization the perspective projection as we can see here allows to convey more object details from different perspectives by placing the marker on the forehead the non-engine user can also set a perspective camera position by themselves to conclude share is a proof of concept prototype using an ar hmd with server control projector to visualize the virtual world for non-hmd users they are able to interact with the hmd user and become part of the experience
