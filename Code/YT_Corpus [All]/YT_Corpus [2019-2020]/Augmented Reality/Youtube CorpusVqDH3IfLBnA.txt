 You are watching Emiliusvgs A few days ago the first Starbucks augmented reality filter appeared and caused a big surprise Possibly one of the most outstanding experiences of the year made by a brand. It would not be so relevant, if, in it, there were no new features that are not yet available to everyone I mean the image tracker or target tracker for instagram Before we go to the technological issue I will explain how to enjoy this filter and share it with your friends First you must enter the main starbucks instagram account and follow them Then access the "face" tab and try the "Holiyay" filter To live the full experience you must visit the nearest starbucks of your home or your work order one of the products that use the four containers of the holiday season. Point the camera towards the cup and watch the magic appear ... The first white container shows us a Christmas building of starbucks with typical festive ornaments. The great thing is that you can move the cup and the experience is maintained. You can use the rear camera and have different shots. next to the augmented reality The next cup containing green background and white text shows us a 3d phrase about Xmas and Starbucks and next to that falls letters as if they were particles. This cup allows us to unlock an experience full of snow, look at the logo detail, and discover how a 3d phrase surround our cup ... what a detail! This last cup is interactive. Red and green particles will appear. At that moment we can tap the screen and these will disappear if we focus on the ceiling the starbucks brand will appear and if we tap it more snow will fall and the red and green particles will disappear. The filter was created by agency "The Mill" with the support of the Facebook team to Chris Price How has Starbucks had a benefit? Well, it usually happens that big brands can have early access to certain features Clearly this is one of those situations. I think it is a good marketing idea create this content. A global brand can drive the adoption of this technology such as augmented reality filters. The target tracker or image tracker is a functionality that does not exist in instagram for independent creators Hopefully before the end of the year we all have access to this feature If you want to learn to create related experiences, you can watch the video I made about it. Another relevant point regarding new features is the video preview! Have you noticed? well if you are a developer of Spark AR you will know that this video preview is different from the rest. Starbucks showed a 100% marketer video where the instructions provided are clear and there is a good production esthetic Possibly the next target tracker or image tracker will be much more precise, with great quality of detecting elements and hopefully allows to detect different forms such as cylindrical, We will only know when it arrives for all developers ... If you liked this video, let me a good like and comment This is all for now, Emiliusvgs says goodbye bye
