 Hi, welcome to the ZEDShed. Today we're explaining the differences  between AR and VR Hi I'm Jess Wilde  and this is the ZEDShed Today I'm explaining to you the differences between AR and VR technology. Now before we get to the topic at hand don't forget to subscribe to the ZEDShed channel  and it will keep you up to date with all of our upcoming videos So, first things first, what is a AR? 'AR' stands for Augmented Reality The word augmented means to change or manipulate something and in this instance we're talking about manipulating something visual AR is the process of overlaying the real world with a digital image so you can experience something that you wouldn't ordinarily be able to in real time AR commonly uses the camera that's built into your phone or your tablet in order to be able to use it Things you've probably used already are Facebook filters or Pokemon Go It goes without saying that AR is becoming really accessible and very very popular I mean, we've all got a phone in our pockets Now playing around with an AR piece of technology is a lot of fun but if you're thinking of developing an AR experience you might be asking yourself "Why? Why would I want to do this?" Well, first of all you can do things that otherwise would be absolutely impossible For example, you can bring inanimate objects to life Imagine being able to go to maybe something like a castle or historical place and be able to look back in time quite realistically to maybe what things were like a hundred years ago or even more exciting look to the future Ultimately it is the real world that anchors AR technology So if that's AR, what's VR? 'VR' stands for Virtual Reality Virtual means something that's not really there so ie: computer-generated The main difference between AR and VR is AR is the process of putting a digital object in your real world environment VR is the process of putting you into an entirely virtual situation, so everything around you has been constructed digitally You may have seen the game 'Beat Saber'; this is an extremely popular and great use of VR technology With VR, there really are no bounds You can create any environment that you want! So, for example you can transport yourself halfway across the world or even to a completely made-up place You could shrink yourself down to investigate something at close up scale so for example checking out blood vessels inside of a body or you could grow yourself huge and see something from a completely different perspective that would be impossible in normal life and finally VR is really useful at for training Imagine training to travel to space; there's not a lot of options between being sat in a training room and all of a sudden you're in the ether With something like VR you can practice a lot of the technical skills that you'd be required to use without actually going to space! Now VR technology is still growing and developing and this means that right now there are a few limitations Some of those are things like  bad locomotion, low fidelity graphics and bulky headsets but just like all good tech it's going to  get better with time The key thing for VR is just having a great idea and then coming to somebody like us Zubr.co to build your amazing idea for you Now you hopefully know the difference between AR and VR it's time to get a little bit more complicated You may have heard of a term 'Mixed Reality',  or possibly 'Hybrid Reality' As this sounds, this is the merging of these two technologies Currently exploring a mixed reality experience is made possible by certain technology for example the Hololens or the Magic Leap These headsets have cameras on which enable you to interact with the real world around you whilst also putting you in to a virtual reality experience Imagine putting on a headset and you can see your normal living room but you fancy going somewhere else... Then a portal just magically appears in front of you (That's AR) you step through the portal and all of a sudden you are in a world of VR This is a perfect example of  Mixed Reality The reason you might like to develop something with mixed reality is it is the most immersive experience you can have The user literally transports themselves from real world to the world that you have created Ultimately the only reason you'd want to separate  VR and AR is really down to the limitations of current hardware If you enjoyed this video please let us know in the comments below If there's something specific you'd like us to talk about regarding AR, VR or anything else kind of 'R' let us know and we will do our best to make a video on it Don't forget to subscribe to our channel you can do that by clicking on the button over here somewhere and you can also give us a like by clicking on the thumbs up Thanks for watching everybody We'll see you next time
