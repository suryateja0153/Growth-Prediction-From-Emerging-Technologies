 This is Frida, an MIR100 Automated Guided Vehicle with a scale unit on top. And this is Anna, our robot operator. Using the Reality Editor, Anna sets the weight she needs on Frida. The Reality Editor is a platform to program machines in Augmented Reality using Javascript and HTML language. Using nodes with attached logic anyone can connect and program the behavior of any piece of hardware in AR. Anna can connect the scale to a feeder machine. The AR logic nodes allow her to program the machine to receive a target weight from the feeder before continuing its path Anna can now design a path for Frida to follow. The system is spatially aware It tracks the environment and knows the location on the machines in real-time as they move. Anna can create checkpoints on the floor for the robot to follow She can set the rotation of the AGV at each checkpoint and visualize how it will feed into the space in advance. Both systems can be programmed together. When the feeder detects that Frida is on the last checkpoint and the weight hasn't reached the set target weight it will activate the conveyor belt. Anna also connects the physical button to the first checkpoint in order to activate the motion of Frida. When she presses the button the first checkpoint activates and Frida starts moving towards it. Frida follows the set path. By performing spatial tracking with a smartphone we are able to synchronize the environment recognized by the phone and the AGV. The user can control the motion of the AGV without any further technical requirements than a mobile phone We envision this technology as a usable system for the creation and visualization of manifold AGV operations while maintaining a low-entry barrier to complex spatial hardware programming.
