 hi the idea of applying augmented reality in television broadcasting has been around for at least a couple of decades researchers have been testing its application in all three stages of production distribution and consumption on the consumption side in particular application of aor is promising this often consists of using AR to deliver virtual artifacts or extra information in the viewer's environment potentially enabling the viewer to interact with this artifacts this can enhance or transform the conventional TV viewing experience commercialization of a our devices suggests that this application may gain more traction in the future however it is not clear how to design content for this paradigm what are the parameters that the designers need to consider when creating content for this type of presentation to answer this we conduct a systematic literature review and look at peer-reviewed publications in the field we look at Scopus ACM digital library and I Triple E we select 42 papers for analysis that describes systems for the types or scenarios that match our criteria for more information on our methodology please refer to the paper we captured the often implicit design decisions in a set of dimensions these dimensions consist of a set of options that capture the relationships between various elements within content between content and the world outside ie context and between various elements within context context related dimensions will be covered in forthcoming publication the rest will explored in more detail in the paper today I will talk about three content level dimensions abstraction time and display and a content context level dimension interaction from a technology point of view content can be classed in two groups they are content and TV content here they are content is all media artifacts that are presented using AR technology TV content is the rest of the media artifacts that already existed prior to adding AR with this in mind now we can talk about abstraction abstraction captured the relationship between a our content and TV content regarding their contribution to make the overall content meaningful when thinking about AR content an TV content individually if they are meaningful and complete independently then the abstraction is independent if the completeness of the experience requires both they are antv components then abstraction is dependent F TV content is complete and meaningful on its own but a our client is used to deliver extra features or to enhance the experience then the abstraction is additional AR the reverse of this where a our content is meaningful and complete on its own and TV content merely enhances it is additional TV we found that most works fit into dependent or additional AR classes for instance relative created a system where children would watch TV content for a few minutes then the TV would be paused and the children would be asked to interact with AR component of the show once they captured relevant AR artifacts and threw them back into the TV screen then the TV content we could resume you can see that both AR and TV components are required to make the overall experience complete in case of additional AR for instance whatever created a system were silhouettes of remote viewers or superimposed on TV content here a our content is adding value however without them the TV counted remained complete and meaningful another content level dimension is time it captures a relationship between a our content and TV content regarding their timelines while a synchronous presentation of a or an TV content may be suitable for experiences that present independent a or a TV components in most cases typically it is desirable to have synchrony between the two components naturally researchers have tried to invent ways to synchronize a our content with TV content this has resulted in two ways of delivering content in synchronous way continuous and intermittent continuous delivery requires both a our content and TV content to be presented simultaneously to the viewer for instance what table with silhouettes they are artifacts while the TV content is being presented on the other hand Revelator's system required the viewers to go back and forth between TV content and they are content intermittently the final that dimension that we will cover today is displayed when using AR in the consumption phase of TV broadcast we found three ways in which content can be displayed either both a or an TV content are presented on the same display or they are presented on separate displays or the TV is illuminated and a our display is used to display content in case of same display for instance motive was audience silhouettes are superimposed on top of TV content and displayed using the same device inkay separate displays and AR device for instance a handheld or a head mounted display can be used to present AR artifacts for instance by Lord at all use both of these to present AR artifacts in the area around the TV screen TV via AR removes the TV set entirely there are instances where an AR display is used to present TV content to the viewer in one or more virtual frames this can be used for instance to anchor TV content to a physical location another option here is to present content outside any frame for instance using chroma keying or volumetric capturing techniques TV content can be presented in an unfriendly and appeared to be present in the viewers environment moving on to a Content contact level dimension we can talk about interaction interaction capture the relationship between the viewer and content it can be seen as a set of behaviors that enable the viewer to dynamically change an aspect of content we found that there were three levels of interaction in the works display level structure level and content level displaying that will interaction enables the viewer to change the program resize reposition or even change the camera angle for instance by Naruto created system where thumbnail images of other programs were displayed next to the TV screen the viewer could drag a thumbnail and drop it on the TV screen to change the program the structure level interaction enables the viewer to influence the story path and break away from the linear structure there are not many examples in our review that aim for this type of interaction but given the success of programs such as Bandersnatch it is likely that this level of interaction gains more popularity in the future Carter leveling 2 akin to how players interact with game content it requires direct manipulation of artifacts to achieve the goal for instance revelatory system the children are asked to capture words in the written and visual representations and throw them back to the TV screen to resume the TV show okay so we talked about three content level dimensions abstraction time and display and we talked about the content context level dimension interaction please refer to the paper to see more in depth explanation with more examples of these and other dimensions the dimensions and the options they encapsulate can be combined to create unique patterns for instance here I've selected one aspect of each time I mentioned to create a pattern this pattern provides the parameters of the concept that mixes AR with T V we can now write a scenario for an AR TV program for instance imagine a crime TV series between each episode that is broadcast on TV the viewers can take part in the investigation and search for evidence and clues the viewers may be asked to go to a specific location in town where a witness claims she has seen a suspect on the night of the incident they can use the AR displays for instance their smartphones to find and scrutinize the evidence once they submit these artifacts the Criminal Investigation Department in the story world can take over and examine the evidence in the next episode thus carrying forward the story in summary we talked about using AR in TV broadcast we talked about dimensions we explored a few dimensions in detail we presented them as a way to create unique patterns and we used a pattern to create an AR TV concept this can be a method to explore the design space at the generate guidelines this framework can help and structure the conceptualization and ideation of a our TV concepts thus enabling broadcasters and designers to ask the right questions when creating such programs in the end I would like to thank my co-authors and the institutions that provided the support for this research to take place please contact me for any questions or drop me a line if you'd like to talk or would like to collaborate on topics such as media TV or any form of our thanks I'm Padma and Psyche and this has been augmented reality and television dimensions and themes
