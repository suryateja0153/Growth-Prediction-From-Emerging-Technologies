 hey Ron its norm from tested and welcome back to projections where this week we're gonna be talking about augmented reality I had a chance to recently try tilt 5 these are the augmented reality glasses made by Jerry Ellsworth and her company and based on a technology that she's been developing since she was at valve software she took that tech and launched a product called cast AR about six years ago now and since then has been iterating on the hardware on the software and on experiences to now launch a new product called tilt five and I had a chance to chat with her about what's changed since Cass a are what's in this new hardware with type experiences they're developing for tabletop AR and all that good stuff let's take a listen well Jerry thank you so much for having us here looking forward to this demo for a long time now I know you've been working on this for years and years and years so the latest iteration of this technology and what you're working on it's an AR headset called tilt five I'll say I'm with the company for people who might not know and may have heard rumblings about like how a our headsets work how does tilt 5 work let's start from the basics so our system is kind of unique compared to other systems our system actually projects out to a special game board which is called a retroreflector and that allows us to make the headset really high performance lightweight super wide field-of-view and super comfortable for the user so part of the the system is it projects out of these silver lenses here down to this route this retroreflector and it comes back to each user and that allows the focus of these pixels to be correct so if I put my finger next to a virtual object it's in focus and that's super unique to our system a lot of other systems have a fixed focus and you can't focus on real-world objects and the virtual objects and then also the system is super lightweight so it's just 85 grams it just weighs nothing it just folds up and slip it on so our main objective is to have a system you fold the game board out slip the glasses on and just get right into fun you know no calibrations no complicated setup no sensors in the room it's a fundamentally different approach - AR yeah then what we've seen out in the marketplace before where people have used lenses essentially a projector is on so two waveguides lenses which let you put objects into real space but have limitations like field of view yeah like the accomodation vergence problem where things don't look like they're in focus or you have fixed and a plane right there because you're using the retro-reflective and essentially projecting out and back end you solve for a lot of it yeah exactly I mean we like I mean I love the systems that are like AR anywhere those are really cool but they have limitations we decided to do AR somewhere it's kind of our internal way we think of it's like what can we do and what can we just nail and make perfect and so with this system like playing with your friends like head to head or play with your friends virtually or even solo games like we can nail this and it's gonna be a great experience it's omit the tabletop game board it's yeah it's having this board here which is about like 2 feet by 2 feet where you're calling for with the tracking markers around it can be any board game yeah that you would buy the game store that you were a gen con' recently people were flipping out rare or it was awesome you have D&D in there you kept our defense you can have single-player games multiplayer games action games is so it doesn't have to be board games it can be like you know never before have you been able to sit across the table and play an action like war game with your friends and that make it really heightens the experience so like if I like pull up your base I get to see it in your eyes yeah and that's that's pretty unique and all that software is kind of defined and parameterize by the hardware that you've yeah iterated toward we talked about you have this nice yeah I'm here view of it it really helped helps illustrate I think how this projection system works they look at the projectors and it's really novel that looking at here the projectors actually go toward your eyes bounce yeah yeah so these lenses here these are actually really special lenses I mean they just look silver and kind of plain but there's actually a lot of layers in there this is one of the inventions I did pat on my back it's like this actually controls polarization and the way that the light gets reflected on the inside so that you get 85% efficiency when the light goes out and back again where if you just had a silver mirror you'd only get 25% of the light so it's a very elaborate high-tech one-way mirror system yeah that doesn't work the polarization to make sure that maximum light is transferred to the user but it also isolates each eye so you get this 3d experience and it also helps isolate between multiple users so you can have any number of users around there and then there's two projectors no the two projectors shine down onto these lenses and we've gone through like five iterations on these and the new ones are fantastic they're 110 degree field of view super high fidelity and in really small and light like even between this iteration in this iteration we shrunk it down even smaller it's like two sugar cubes worth of like volume I'm looking around you know your office you have all these parts everywhere so a projector like this it's not something that's off-the-shelf like you know people always think that we just get it off the shelf like no this is like four years of development to make this projector because you can get small projectors but there's you know very narrow field of view they have a very shallow depth of field and so we had all these requirements we had to have like InFocus over a large depth we had to have a massive field of view had to be super efficient so that we could run off you know cell phones and right right when people think of like pico projectors like those would not work great for this but now a lot of those projectors get too hot thermal was a problem for us too so we had to come up with solutions so that we get the efficiency of the LEDs up enough that we weren't heating the LEDs up and heating the headset so yeah a lot of work went into the projectors and a projector like that's one necessary work well as like no if you point this at the wall it's only 0.65 lumens or point at your hand you can't even see right but because of kind of the amplification of the retroreflector how it just takes all the light and brings it back to each user you get the super-bright image like we were demoing at Gen Con and it was probably the most harsh environment we've ever convention lighting these huge like mercury vapour lamps yeah it was super bright and people are like wow I can't believe how bright this isn't yeah and the objects look opaque and yeah really are you talk about resolution and these are HP so they're they're 720p all right and then you're refreshing them at a 180 frames per second 80 frames a second which then needs to talk about how you're processing all that cuz games then running at hundred eighty frames no they don't have to no no that's a really cool part of our system and it took us a long time to get here it's like I dreamed about this like years ago when I worked at valve I'm like in the future the game engine is going to run asynchronous from the actual projection system and in the headset it's going to do reprojection to realign the image and do all the prospective transforms that need to be done and so that's what we've achieved we have a chip on here that receives images over USB it lands in the chip and then the chip upscales it to 180 frames per second and does all the reprojection so as you move your head back and forth or your shift side-to-side the image stays locked to the game board and it's updating at this insanely high frame rate in the VR world we hear about reproduction all the time to compensate for lost frames and it's very difficult you know spatial projection for from a lot of movement this is all hardware base yeah the loop the entire loop is in the headset which is really unique like VR systems are just brute forcing it by having giant video cards so what this means is that we can have multiple headsets running off one PC and as long as the framerate it's good enough and you're happy with the animation right it's running at 60 frames you could have two instances of games running at 60 frames or four at 30 frames per second and for your perspective as long as it's comfortable as long as I'm used updating and the reproduction again is updating then you're usually oh yeah you won't have no discomfort yeah you won't have what's what's bad in VR and AR system is when the tracking goes bad and you drop a frame then awesome the image like goes flying off somewhere because you had head motion this happens to me all the time I'll be sitting on my desk working with unity and I'll crash unity and I won't realize it I'll be looking at the game board waiting for something to update it'll be like come on come on oh you don't notice it because the last image is right it's running basically at zero frames get the last one frame right but it's still smooth it's just no I should have shown you that we'll have to fire it back up I'll show you that oh it's neat very cool and then then the tracking these are the markers oh you're doing positional tracking of that way say inside out and what's unique about our system on the tracking is we have two cameras that are right here so one of them is 140 degree field of view infrared camera so you can play at night you can play full daylight so anywhere in between because we illuminate the game board with infrared light and that's on a specific wavelength and we filter the camera so the camera is another custom-designed piece has a bandpass filter to only respond to that wavelength of light then we have a second camera in here that runs on a totally different wavelength of infrared light that's for tangible so playing cards and tracking complicated object tracking like tracking miniatures on the table and that recognize that's basically computer vision yeah yeah recognition you can be as simple as QR codes shapes and your your one control there yeah all that stuff is positionally tracked because you have that inside out track yep yep man it's an 8 megapixel camera so it's super high res so we can pick out features like it really far distances with it and we talked about the the tracking field of view being wider than your visual field with you which so I think you were trying that out you were like clear off the game board yeah still tracking it yeah and then also you know you did a thing where you brought a extension to the game yeah you're also rendering beyond this because you don't know the user the system doesn't know where the game wardens necessarily except that it's somewhere within that kind of big field of view and so I was able to look in and see as far yeah into the world or even extending the work yeah yeah if you just put another piece of a game board here like a taught another tile and your your game board just extends and part of our offering will be will have a base kit which has this fold-out rectangular board just easy gives you everything you need but then we'll have the deluxe kit that has like the tiled system that you can do really fun stuff with like make a rectangular board if you're doing D&D right or if you want to have like lots of vertical you can have a little kickstand so you can tip it up and you can have all this vertical height out of the game board so that that's that's an interesting thing because extending it I get like you're having more surface area which then you can look deeper and more into it but having an angled game board it doesn't matter what angle it is because it's all about we can't even tell if you angle this it just it it's seamless all you do is just get more vertical it's it's a little difficult sometimes to understand what you're gonna see when you look at this system a lot of people are like oh you can never project anything above the game board which is not true at all you know us sitting here playing a game side by side I can have objects like this tall off of the game board and it's great it's a great experience all about the angle that you're looking at the game board form kind of like you know at a 3d movie things are still coming out at you both in and out but because it's wide enough that the angle works and you can have sterile images that far apart yeah yeah so on this system you can have like I can't see anything taller than that but I can see stuff this like in the center of the game board it's like this tall easily but if you had a requirement where I wanted to have something really tall I just took the the pro board up so there's a sweet spot in terms of where objects are placed yeah right in front of my front which tends to be where you're looking anyway yeah and what's funny is people are like well you know it's gonna clip on the backside sometimes and it turns out like we play video games all the time that clip 3d stuff in the back and it's like it it just works like your brains like oh yeah that just went off the screen and it feels right well in terms of sweet spot - one of the things we mentioned earlier is that accommodation verges I was able to hold a cube up focus on that cube and then focus on other cubes on the game board and go back look for and go back and forth immediately you're nothing that's changing the rendering what is it about this projection system the retro reflective material that allows for that to feel real natural well it's a combination things it's kind of complicated but it's the aperture of our projectors which send out really tight ray bundles and then also retroreflector these ray bundles will be going out in like a cone and it'll be focusing but since retroreflector brings everything back again it refocuses them and it brings them through these intersection points which are correct so it's like we're kind of through a clever optical trick we're making an entire leg field display without having to compute it and that works specifically for what you've experienced the sweet spot for tabletop yeah you are at that you know within certain number of meters and like as close as you want those no minimum focus distance at GenCon we actually had people like bumping their head into the table like Oh careful wait when you were first experiment with this I mean people imagine putting this everywhere yeah right that technically what good work yeah oh yeah yeah we are Maine kid it's gonna be like something that you can deploy in the home easy just flip the game board open slip the glasses on grab your wand and start playing but yeah there's some folks that are taking our system and doing really crazy things like huge domes for location-based experiences so you know all your friends in this dome you can see each other have a really wide field of you you know and sharing this virtual experience but again having the parameters of tabletop that allow the developer to work yeah they all get the same board it's a language that exists if you understand your four sides you can do multiple players so what are some of the game experiences oh well we're really excited for our announcement hopefully this is going out after our Kickstarter and fantasy grounds is coming to our system so for the DeeDee Pathfinder crowd they're gonna love this so you can have your whole virtual world laid out in fantasy grounds the DM gets their own unique view into the space the players sitting around the table don't get to see what's coming until the DM triggers so the the DM will be able to do things like an eerie mist settles in the valley and that's they wave their hand over and eerie mist will come out of their hand and it'll be revealed this fog of war will be lifted to the other players and if your friends can't login or can't join you around the table they can login and you can connect your game board to their game board and so in the DM waves there and over they would see a virtual representation of the hand and the eerie fog you know they do a trigger and the monster Springs out because that's true asymmetrical play but yeah people are using the same game board so the game knows there's gonna be someone in that position it actually doesn't really matter where they're sitting it as long as not rendered properly for them and some of you can be playing with someone yeah so the DM like could see like well here's a trigger point and there could be stats and there could be a monster sitting here waiting to jump out and the other players are oblivious it until that moment you trigger it so it's gonna be great for storytelling so we're super excited about that partnership what's also exciting about that is their system is truly cross-platform so if your friends don't have a tilt 5 system yet you can play on your PC or tablet and still participate there's the base the underlying technology and those systems are all the same yeah yeah roll they bring your ass they have adventure packs that you can download you can bring in 3d assets and work with them yeah that's super exciting so that's the D&D crowd we have a bunch of action games that are going to be shipping with the system so we have a bunch that we have which are kind of party action games so you have your friends sitting around the table you have shooting blocks and trying to grief each other and and do head to head then we have some solo play experience we have this racing game that's a very Mario Kart like and then we also it has a battle arena mode which is really fun so you're all in this arena it's got these spinning discs and stuff and you try to shove your friend's car it's kind of a rocket League like very cool yeah and these are all essentially just like PC games or a mobile game because you can plug this into yeah Bowl device for PC or yeah many of them will be on PC and Android devices they just go to Google Play or you go to steam and you download the game and and you're good to go we have a couple developers working on true card games so locomotives is one of our partners that's working with our brand spanking new hardware brave souls and it's looking really good you got a little sneak peek of that and so that one's like a Wild West theme where you can have up just I think six players they can be either remote it's truly cross play also so you can play on your tablet or your PC or on the tilt five and it's really up to your developers to choose that they wanted to be really graphically intensive something with a lot of network play or something that's very single-player focus that's kind of up to up to them exactly yeah we're just we're making a tool you know and we want to put enough you know tools in the toolbox for you know the developers to make these rich experiences so that's why we thought like tracking physical objects and hands and and cards like super critical you know great tracking great field of you have them all target a game board so everyone has the same experience no matter where they're at you have all the input-output you have speakers oh yeah we don't even talk about eleven yeah and this is all essentially whoever gets one of these can be a developer yeah yes so each kid is a developer kit so our SDK is super simple like I'm just a chip designer by trade and I'm writing unity demos every one of those like kind of cheesy demos that I showed you today was just like a camera test demo that I put together but our SDK you just take our plug-in drug it drag it on to the camera and unity or unreal and then that gets your head tracking and then if you want to use the wand you know the buttons and triggers is just standard unity input and then for the six degrees of freedom you know it's it's straightforward just hook that to your game object like you can get up and going in like 10 15 minutes with our system so you got this software side the Harvard sites being iterated on this is kind of like using production molds now yeah injection molded plastic you're getting down to your ID everything's getting finalized what's the roadmap to getting this out delivering on the cake for starters yeah our timeline is like we already have some developers working with our kind of pre-production units we're gonna have a canary group or kind of an early beta test that's like q1 yeah yeah it's gonna be a smaller group of people that love bug hunting this way goes and then general availability like the the bulk of the Kickstarter units will go out q2 you know GDC time absolutely or a lot of helpers gonna be interested it really is one of those technologies that you have to put on and yeah say that about a lot of the RNA are technologies but like it is don't know how good it looks until you put it on so we're really anxious about our Kickstarter video we're super proud about it we're all but also wringing her hands because we did compositing in it because to show the experience you kind of have to like fudge it a little bit and like you have ly slow camp camera angles and you have like stuff flying off the board which is true for the people that would have been that are being it's not necessarily true with him you have a camera that's like five degrees off the board or something yeah but what we're doing is we're taking all of the composited shots and we're doing like side by sides of like here's film through the glasses and here's the composited shot yeah so hopefully people will give us a little bit of a leeway because we're trying to sell the experience because it really is magical when you try it and if you absolutely and having used a bunch of VR headsets it really is it's a different flavor of it and I think the tabletop aspect is super super cool yeah yeah congratulations with the launch of the Kickstarter I know it's been a long time coming yeah and thank you so much for having here to check it out thank you that was a really enjoyable conversation for me and I want to thank Jared for being so open about the technology in these tilt five glasses and what's changed since they worked on cast a are and the challenges going forward as they finalize the hardware and also work with developers on the software when they're ready to push this out consumers early next year now did get a chance to use the latest prototype of tilt five for a variety of tech demos that Jerry showed me and first thing on the hardware it's super light they're pointing this as under 90 grams and while I didn't have a scale to to measure it it's definitely the lightest of any VR or AR headset I've used in recent memory it fit perfectly over my glasses of a plastic like I said is looks polish and I think in the version I had there was a little band that could tie so the tighten it to the back of my head and I wanted to do that but once the glasses were on a couple things I immediately noticed one it's a are so I want to see the outside world in the outside world is very visible not only the field of view to the outside world which some other era headsets want to narrow that because they want to hide the fact that you don't have that much of an AR image either but also the clarity of the outside world you know yes it is a little bit darker a little bit tinted then looking through normal glass or plastic but I could interact with people I was looking at things and I didn't feel the need to take off those glasses to read something to look at something you know it is how I think a should be was also really comfortable was the imagery itself and all the things that Gerry talked about in terms of the projectors being really bright even though they're running on a very low power because the retro-reflective materials balancing that light directly back into your eye the imagery of the augmented objects was a vibrant was colorful it was sharp and also had a really nice frame rate and field of view I did some tests where I moved my head left and right so I was going beyond the view of the game board and even when I was looking off to the side of my head I could see the game board I actually still see the images so that 110 degree field of view for that those projectors really helps and really is a different type of AR experience if you've used something like a magic leap or a hololens the smoothness of the motion of the the graphics and the objects that were on the board in the board or floating above the board also made this really comfortable I know Jerry quoted about a hundred and eighty frames per second for the projectors and I'm not sure if that's alternating frames Nighy on each eye or if they're actually 180 on both projectors but regardless the imagery was was super smooth and I after I interviewed her she did give me that demo again where she crashed unity and the image was locked in place I almost couldn't tell that there weren't any additional frames I didn't notice any drop frames at once that reprojection engine they have inside the hardware to do some essentially a time warp and space warp and skewing of the images works now of course if I move my head dramatically a frame or did some crazy lateral movement did look skewed and it wouldn't look right so you're never gonna be running games at like five frames a second but I can imagine if you're running at 30fps or even slightly lower the graphics will still look rock-solid and the images will still be locked and will never feel like they're not a part of the real world even though there's projected images something I was also truly impressed by is that seemingly the tilt five technology solves for the accommodation virgins conflict the idea that these objects wherever they may look like they're floating in space will be in focus as you focus your eyes on them not just because of the stereo overlap I was looking at these cubes floating above the tabletop surface and as well as those spread around and really move my head around them and shifting my eyes focus from one cue to the next and everything looked like they were in the right place it's an AR experience that you don't get out of waveguide bass headsets right now and I'm still trying to wrap my head around exactly what type of optical trick allows for this to happen because they're not generating a light field they don't have that type of rendering power on the system but apparently it's because of the way the projector it's shoot all those rays of light onto this micro surface of this retro reflective material and the way it bounces back in a way the combine at different planes of focus allows you to then shift and then see the objects at those variable frames in that sweet spot which they've designed for it was really cool once one of those things that you really need to try and it's a thing that you don't even think about because things look like the way they're supposed to in the real world at least in the right distances as the way they're supposed to now the compute stuff is also interesting the demos I saw running off of a laptop and as Jerry mentioned you could run multiple tilt five headsets off of a single laptop just based on how much processing power you have on the laptop what frame rate you want to run the games at and also how many USB ports it'll just be USB see right into the headset and so the benefits are of course you'd only need one computer really to do multiple players it's gonna be really open they're not doing their own version of an app store just download the games from Steam or the Google Play Store and also the games can run at different resolutions and then some of the demos I noticed that yes some of them weren't necessarily running at native resolution I could see the tell-tale signs of some anti-alias saying some of the jaggies but again the movement was so smooth and then some of the games that did look like they're running at native resolution that 720p per I was really sharp in terms of the games the demo I did try were representative of some of what they're going for so there was one that was like a marble rolling down a core so it was really cool to be able to kind of look into the course and even put some of the retro-reflective material up and see beyond the tabletop and see how much they're actually rendering their example of a tower defense game where I then it was able to throw some tracking markers with QR codes and then that use that to activate or point with the wand controller and activate things on that play field and one of the cool things is because there is computer vision there's optical tracking of markers they could also do printing of the markers that's transparent are not visible to the naked eye the visible spectrum so it can be something like a CCG car you know a magic card but underneath it there's a layer of a QR code and so you're getting real true mixed reality with things that play in the real world but also work in that salt 5 system their partnership with fantasy grounds I think has a lot of potential because that's an established platform with licenses for RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons and so there's an existing player base so the existing software stack and it's cross platform so people with tilt 5 will be able to play with people who are not in the same room with them who may have tilt 5 sets or may just be playing on a traditional PC or tablet and so that's gonna potentially expand the user base and I think it's really smart of them not to design an air system to try to solve for a are everywhere you know with the complexities of SLAM and mapping and optics that work outside and inside they're trying to solve for a our designer a our system with these parameters of it being a tabletop gaming system or video traditional video gaming system I would love to play a Diablo like RPG or a gauntlet like RPG on this 2x2 game board and look deep into a spiral staircase and and play with friends in the room or not in the room I can't wait for the system to come out there's so me a little time before they actually get this out to backers and so they have time to work on those software experiences working with their dev partners it's a great a good launch suite games and experiences and also to refine that Hardware and further I think they're still tweaking I am you and the software related to that but I really am excited for this and can't wait to play this when this comes out and I'll be backing their Kickstarter and looking forward to that release and if you have questions about it please feel free to post in the comments below but thanks for watching we'll be back next time with more coverage of VR and AR technologies and I'll see you next time
