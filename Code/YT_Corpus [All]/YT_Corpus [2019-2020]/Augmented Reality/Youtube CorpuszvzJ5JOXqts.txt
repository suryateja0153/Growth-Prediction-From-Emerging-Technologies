 [Music] we're excited as part of the 25th anniversary to introduce stronger together a new augmented reality app that shows you the very best of how people responded to this event and lessons that we can learn from it in today's world what we realized is that we wanted to do a media exhibit that was about being stronger together the stronger together augmented reality experience highlights six different storytellers a family member a survivor a first responder journalist investigator and volunteer you'll learn about the events of April 19th 1995 and all the way through to the building of the memorial and the museum from these storytellers who represent the real people who lived through it we are using the very latest in augmented reality technology on mobile devices to deliver this experience the augmented reality enhances the existing museum experience visitors in 3d space will see videos objects artifacts and more as they go through the journey of April 19th and beyond you can walk around survivor tree you can walk in a smaller scale version of the Murrah Building walk completely around it this has been about a year's worth of work between our two teams testing various builds really learning what users are gonna want out of this experience it's a more intimate experience I would say since you're really getting to hear from the stories of those people that were actually there understand when I found out it's filming us I was excited but when I heard it was gonna play in a museum it was even better having something tangible that you can see and remember these people it was so well done added a whole lot to the actual visit I've never seen technology like that used in a museum before I was surprised at how much it made my experience more enjoyable one of our biggest challenges is making sure we meet our visitors where they are pictures and media coverage about human I'm gonna make sure we're reaching them by using these digital tools to teach them this story and why it's still relevant today 25 years later [Music]
