 [Music] interested in immersive design but aren't sure how to get started we're here to demystify designing for augmented reality first off augmented reality blends the digital information with the users physical environment in other words AR augments the users base reality to provide them additional content or context about that reality AR is important because it enables us to have interfaces that are more lifelike understandable and seamless with the actual world around us at Google we rapidly prototype for AR in order to show how blending the physical and the digital can help our users and we're going to show you how to get started prototyping a our experiences with things you have laying on the office in 60 seconds let's say a user is learning a new language what if they could scan the world around them and automatically see the translation usually our next step would be to jump into 2d wireframes with ar we need to think in 360 so we proceeded by prototyping with things around us it can be as lightweight as using paper or modeling clay or blocks to show potential UI or AR objects in 3d space plus we can play with motion to D UI tools can be great for mocking up AR micro interactions and it can be even faster than paper to take this to the next level of fidelity we'd bring this into video editing tools and there you have it a quick prototype that serves as an augmented reality proof of concept to learn more check out google's augmented reality design guidelines for pointers on the UX of AR considerations that's it for now don't forget to Like and subscribe happy AR prototyping [Music] you
