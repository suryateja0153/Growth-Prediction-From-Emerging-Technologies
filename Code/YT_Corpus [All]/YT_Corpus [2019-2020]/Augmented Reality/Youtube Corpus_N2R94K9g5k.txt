 hello welcome today we're gonna update creator cam now all my favorite youtubers like to jabrils, brackeys, Blackthorneprod, Dani, they're always doing these game jams and it looks like so much fun but I prefer little to no human interaction so in the last video I did one by myself hey put me down we made a prototype and put it on the App Store what me down I said no I thought the prototype turned out pretty good unhand me human but I suffer from a very severe case of project A.D.D so I threw it in the trash almost immediately not to mention I got other projects calling my name I love you come back to me a couple days later I'm out skating with my friend Jerry this is gonna be Jerry cuz he's really tall dude brah you should put your app on the real life doodle subreddit your real life doodles what the hell is that... free focus group all right boys back on now I subscribe to the belief that you should get your MVP out there as quick as possible because any work you do before user testing is just guesswork and potentially a huge waste of time now I know what you're thinking but Matt you're giving us all this advice about making apps and you've never actually made a successful app in your life well that's not entirely either way I don't know any of the intricacies involved with the real-life doodling community like maybe there's some artistic quality that the app can capture or maybe the hardcore people might say it's cheating but this is what we need to find out so let's make a post okay so what ended up doing pretty well we got like 30,000 views 97% up voted pretty good for spending $0 so let's see what they say oh the app is wonderful I'm a new customer dude that app is awesome well isn't this just fantastic amazing it but very slow probably is on your Android pixel potato how are you doing the movement tracking as if I would give away my secrets alright let's get into the suggestions would be nice if you had more options for mouths and eyes okay is there a way to scale the mouth and eyes there most certainly is not alright so idea successfully validated let's get to work first of all we need to update the UI if you let a small child design an app in mspaint it would probably look better than what I have so I tried to darken the colors a little bit on the menu screens but I left the buttons on the main screen white because I found if you use darker buttons over top of the camera feed you can't really see them so I tied up some other loose ends and put some tutorial screens where I thought they might be needed now some people were reporting some bugs mainly around app permissions I guess there's still a few people out there wearing tinfoil hats that actually decline permissions so I spent some time handling the edge cases and I tried to populate air modal's in places where you need that permission to continue so currently I have toggles for the mouth and eyes and you just drag them to move them around the people of Reddit wanted to be able to rotate and scale them so I added some rotate and scale toggles into the app and gave it to my girlfriend to get some user feedback all right so try this out I don't want to tell you how it works just see if you can figure it out man it doesn't even work it's broken what do you mean it broke to clarify the app works exactly as intended it's just not intuitive as much as I want my girlfriend to be wrong she's exactly right now it took me a minute to unpack what she meant by broken but once I remove my ego from the equation I realized that 99% of all app usage comes from the big ones like Instagram Facebook etc now all these apps have rotate and scale functionality so if the app doesn't work like theirs it's going to seem broken so Instagram in particular lets you move rotate and scale all at the same time regardless of how many fingers you have on the screen it took me a little bit to figure out that logic but I'm pretty happy with the results all right how is it now I mean it's better but it's still broken that's perfect surprisingly on reddit and nobody said how shitty the lip-syncing was but I figure if we're gonna update the app such a core feature deserves a second look I came upon this plugin by oculus it does real-time lip-syncing SiC and it has plug-ins for Android and iOS SiC and it's free so this is actually really cool in linguistics you have phonemes which are all the different sounds your mouth makes when you talk viz Eames are the visual representation of those sounds so this oculus plug-in takes microphone input and maps the sounds to all these visual shapes that your mouth can make so I spent a few days testing and integrating this with nat mic and here's what I got hey pick me I'm the most popular yeah but all the cool kids play me oh you never picked me now I really wanted this to work but my main issue was the microphone gain being way different on all types of Android and iOS devices so this is still an issue with this plug-in it works much worse on iOS than it does on Android and not to mention performance is not great there's a lot more latency than with my shitty implementation so I ended up scrapping it and I put back what I have the next thing the real-life doodlers suggested was more options for items so I made some new mouths and eyes I added some sunglasses and then I had an epiphany I should have had those thug life glasses in a joint now I know you're thinking Matt you cannot put drug-related content in your app it was then I realized I should just let people upload whatever into various images they want that way I don't have to worry about holding these inappropriate pngs in the app this is a little bit more challenging but basically I use the native gallery plug-in to let people pull photos from the camera roll I resaved the photos to local storage in the app and resize them to max width and height a 512 they get stored in a scroll view so you can add as many as you want and now you can use whatever drug related paraphernalia that in one when I scroll through the subreddit the main thing I'm missing it might actually be doable is animation now what we've learned so far is that we should do some market research check out some other apps that do animation and just emulate something that we know works but did I do that I sure didn't instead I came up with my own little system because I figured it'd be easier to code I think the most efficient way to make animations would be let the user draw one layer and then duplicate that layer again and again with the ability to rotate and transform the original layer I think the charm though of real-life doodles is that each layer it seems to be drawn by hand so that's what I want after I made a main layer that you can draw on and then you can add additional layers which the app will cycle through when you're no longer in the drawing screen so you can cycle through the layers and edit or delete frames that you don't like all right so this Creator cam update is live if you want to check it out on Android or iOS I'll put the link down in the description and you can tell me how trashed it is in the comments so yeah my project ad D is in full effect I've been playing around this little virtual assistant for work I hooked it up to this chat bot with Cathy Jas and I can't stop talking to it how old are you regardless how many times you ask for it what's your favorite food electricity is there enough food on earth how big is that it is 27,000 miles across so maybe we'll do the next video on something like that but in the meantime I have been doing some unity tutorials on the 3rd Aurora YouTube channel so make sure to head over there check that out also in addition to our discord group my buddy Joe char put a LinkedIn group together so I'll put a link to that down in the description as well so with that we'll see you in the next one good bye
