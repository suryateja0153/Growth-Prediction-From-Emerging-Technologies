 [Music] hi welcome to this module this module is in continuation with our last module and the focus is on tissue and cell culture techniques right so if we see what we have seen in the last lecture right we have seen how the what is the importance of understanding the tissue and cell culture techniques right and how they are interrelated when you talk about developing the bioengineering platform or a biomedical device or in terms of medical device then how this tissue and cell culture techniques can be used if I go for the next slide and if you see here then what you see is that how the cell name came into existence then we discussed about beginning of the cell theory and then we saw what exactly cell theory means what is cell culture we discussed rate and we discussed three different points you know or you can say terms one is in vivo second is ex vivo and third one was in vitro right now in vivo within the body xu and take out the tissue from the body and you do the experiments the in vitro is when you develop the cells in the laboratory and use the microphone except or anesthetic platform like transfer to study the tissue properties or cell properties now further what we developed is what are the types of cell cultures and how we can isolate the cells or how can we culture the cells from a given organ we also saw some terminologies such as primary circle chiral cell line adren cells confluence passage ink right and then what are the how the tissue culture process flow works so we have seen two different approach we also seen how the sub culturing works end cryopreservation works so if you want to preserve these cells for a long time what is the process flow correct so today what we are focusing on is what are the application of this tissue culture why we should understand this new culture and how it is added to cancer diagnosis right so yeah let us see today a tissue culture system is an excellent model system for studying normal physiology cell biology and biochemistry of cells right so for a bioengineering lab right if I want to work in a bioengineering lab a bio is biology engineering is engineering laboratory now if you see X recently when you talk about bioengineering it's a mixer it's an interdisciplinary branch where the engineers works with scientists right now when I say that that means that electronics engineer working with a biologist or a mechanical engineer working with the biologist or you know robotics engineer working with the biologist to mimic a biomedical robots so when you talk about interdisciplinary research is not just about two different fields is how we can merge the expertise of different labs and to work on a particular problem let me give you few examples suppose I want to understand of from given set of drugs which drug would be effective or which drug has a higher efficacy for for the patient right if that is my idea I need to understand how the how we can take out the cells from the patient and how can we lower the cells how can we make the in vivo situation that can be that can be that can happen only when we have expertise from the cell biologists group but when you want to understand how the fluid will flow in the body and how can we mimic this in your situation on the in-vitro platform we require micro fluidics and that's why the engineering comes into picture right it includes the chemical engineering it ignores a material science it includes the electronics engineering because you it includes packaging of the device finally what we want to see is we have to control the amount of liquid flowing or drug flowing through the channel such that it infuses into the cells and based on the efficacy based on the effectiveness of the drug the cells will die or it will sustain so if the cell dies we say the drug is more effective how many no cells are dying right can we create a platform that's what my point about bioengineering would be when we study different projects with different different problems and there is a indeed in traditional research so it provides a facility in experimenting with the varying engineering parameters I just discussed that are used to design the sensors which will finally used for primary biological tissues now as I said it can be used to understand the effect of drugs radiation toxic components onto the cells and tissue so we can use either conventional biological protocol or we can use Micro engineering devices microphone X maps names etc right so studying mutagenesis and carcinogenesis is another understanding of tissue culture helps us to understand both the problems or to study both the problems well how the carcinogenesis works and then we can also understand that this this tissue culture systems are widely employed for large scale manufacturing compounds that has biological reasons like vaccines insulin interferon and other therapeutic proteins so if I want to give you a few examples how we can use this tissue culture let me show it to you a few examples here I'll open a new slide okay and let me show you a few examples of yeah so suppose there is a equipment call co2 incubator co2 incubator the parameters within it is 5% co2 95 percent RH 37 degrees centigrade so if you see this these are the parameters or the environment within the co2 incubator what's what is why it is 5% co2 90 percent relative humidity and 37 degree centigrade because this will help the cells to survive right and if the cells are there if you lower the cells in a you bottom plate right and you put the media with growth components then the cells will clump together to form a spheroid alright so again what's the point this is a cell culture technique that we have a co2 incubator we have five which has the following parameters now these parameters are because these are the same parameters that are used or that is existing within a human body right if you see our temperature is 37 degree centigrade 5% co2 90 over Sun even relative humidity that's how the cells are surviving the cells are growing right so if I take these cells and if I want to understand how can i implement a micro engineering or engineering idea to study the cells or to study the drug that is our question okay so now what will I do I have something called or trance well T are a and he'll transfer consists of a well so this is this is a well right this is a well here and there is a mess this is a mess right like this so if I load my spheroids what is the right group of cells together forming within the incubator right spheroid okay if I load the spheroids with matrigel what's called matrigel m8t are I GTL mate region what is material so when you see a cancer within a body is always surrounded by extracellular matrix extracellular matrix extra cellular matrix okay this extracellular matrix provides a nutrition and the remaining growth hormones to the to the cancerous tissue so this matter is gel has similar constituents like this ECM okay so what we are doing is we are growing the cells of within the co2 incubator with the help of cell culture techniques and then this growing of cells and clumping it together forms of spheroid this Freud I will take it and I will load in a trance well right and this trance well is having along with the spirits it has a mate region all right this was easy now what I will do now I will load drug here drug here okay and if the drug is effective this drug with diffuse through material Doug will diffuse through material you know drug diffuses through material what will happen if the drug is effective this cell let's say we take up one single cell and there is a nucleus right and if the cell if the drug is effective the cell will lies lies or it is fragmented defragment and it broke breaks into pieces okay as you mean a very easy language zooming in a very easy language whatever I said their cell will get lized now if the cell is lies the Constituent within the cells will come out so we can use two different ways one is called biomarker if I use a biomarker then I can understand when the cell is breaking the fluorescence will change the the there will be creation of light why because we have use a biomarker such that the biomarker will highlight these cells and its cytoplasm or its nucleus so if I want if I want to know that this is a cell then I will use something called DP dapi tapi will stain the nucleus with blue color with blue color okay let's not go into this detail right now we don't worry about this I'll teach you when the time comes right now let us understand that this is my current way of understanding the efficacy of drug if the drug is effective the cells would die okay so the question is every time here the cell and the drug are in a static contact it is a static platform right static there is nothing moving static but if I can if I consider human body is human body static no right the plur continuously flows in our body it is a dynamic system it is a dynamic model then how can we trust a static model when our body itself is a dynamic model so in in our body when when there is a drug is it in continuous contact with the material or with the cells continuous no it's flowing right in entirely through the body so can we create a platform that can mimic the in vivo situation situations within the body on to the in vitro so this is Potomac emitter because it is in the laboratory so such that it can have or it can have the properties of the dynamic model that is our body so what can we do for that we can develop the micro fluidic system micro fluidic alright microphonic system mica for DIC system all right so let's see how we can clear this megafrog system okay so I have a channel I will teach you how to create it okay right now you assume that with the help of micro-engineering you have formed a microfluidic channel this is a channel in which you have a drug in a reservoir right and you are created Inlet it flows through here it comes out here and it flows continuously alright now this is your channel which one this is your channel here I have inter digitated electrodes for a interdigital occurs when you take a metal and you pattern the metal better the metal look I'll teach you how to do this one this becomes our inter digitated electrodes and you can measure resistance so these are all metal lines metal lines metal lines okay now this inter digitated electrodes right now if I want to measure the distance of this since the the lines are not sorted they are open the resistance would be infinite right if I place cells on this along with material I'll have some value of resistance let's say resistance r1 or base resistance RB right when when I am placing when I am placing the cells in material alright so when I place cells in material onto this chip then I will have resistance RB right so let us assume that there are cells in this and the group of cells right which are on this inter digitated electrodes all right this one's easy so I have resistance RB correct base resistance now if I flow the drug so this is when the drug is not there okay is when I am not playing the drug I have based the resistance RB now if I start flowing the drug what will happen the drug will diffuse through mate region it will diffuse diffusion diffuse right how you can I give an example of diffusion is example he is when you lead a scented stick right in hindi we call agarbatti right then what happens that even in the corner of a room when you lead accented stick the other corner of the room you will feel the fragrance of that right the phenomenon by which this the the fragrance comes to the another side of the room is a diffusion phenomena right these are the diffusion occurs this is an example of a diffusion there are many examples of diffusion and this giving very easy example all right so now with the with the phenomena of diffusion the drug molecules will start diffusing into the Metra gel and what is there in the material there are cells in the material so this Turk if you see the slide this truck when it it goes through diffuses through the material what will happen if I magnify this one right if I magnify this one this is what happens that there is a electrodes there is this material with cancer cells and the drug is diffusing onto the chip when drug diffuses the cells would if the drug is effective the drug is effective the cells would lies right it will be defragmented so when the cells are defragmented the constituents within the cell will come out and that causes change in the conductivity now that change in conductivity will change the resistance right so we have a new resistance value initial resistance value was RB you a new resistance in presence of drug 1 let's say so Rd 1 correct so if I use the similar platform and flow drug - this is drug 1 right now instead of drug 1 if I flow drug 2 then depending on the efficacy depending on the effectiveness of the drug again the drug will diffuse and depending on the effectiveness of the drug again the cells would lies and I will see a change in resistance Rd - this is from second platform you understand okay for each drug we will use a separate platform so if I just delete everything so I can explain you quickly in a easier way what we discussed is that if we have multiple drugs okay we have let us say drug one drug to end up three correct now we should use a multiple channels multiple microphones platform like this and here what we have is inter digitated electrodes like this correct we have inter digitated electrodes now this drug one is loaded into reservoir one reservoir two reservoir three and we are flowing the drug into micro farad platform and drug will come back to the reserve where reservoir okay so this is my microfluidic platform what what I am looking at I am looking at initially a resistance values which is our B base resistance RB RB when I load cells with nitrogen okay this is my resistance value C without loading any cells I should have the resistance infinite right when I load cells with material I have a resistance RB right how many cells I am loading depending on the microfluidic platform I can load few thousands of cells per ml about let's say 10,000 10,000 cells per milliliter that is our concentration of the cells whether the cells we loaded we loaded the cells here in this particular platform all right so now you assume that when we flow drug one the drug one diffuses through the material and I will have resistance Rd one this Adie one would be different than RB if depending on how effective our drug is you know drug is effective the conductivity would increase because the cell would lies when the cell lies is the Constituent within the cell comes out when the Constituent within the cell comes out the conductivity increases and that caused the resistance to decrease all right now similarly when I flow that drug to it diffuses to the material I will have Rd - I will float draft three I'll have resistance Rd three right base the distance resistance when drug is flowing in each case as I said if the drug is effective the cells would lies and conductivity would be higher resistance would be lower so using this platform what we can do is we can understand which drug is effective right so easy because depending on the change in resistance we can see that what is the how many cells would have been lies where to do our multiple experiments to understand the quantification how many cells are lies but we can do or we can use this platform as a screening platform whatever screening drug screening platform right if you see back what I mean is so now if the Rd one that resistance Rd one that is right that I down here our D 1 is less than our D 2 is less than our D 3 right then odd-even is as an ally do and also I find that our D 1 is less than our D 3 then I can see that the resistance of the chip right this introduced electrodes right is less when I use drug one compared to drug 2 or drug 3 if that is the case then my drug 1 is more effective compared to dock 2 and R 3 and for the for the cells that we have extracted from the patient's we should use this particular micro fluidic platform and the drug 1 or based on the microfluidic platform we can select drug 1 over drug 2 and drug 3 that means we have screen which drug would be effective for a given patient now the the point here is that why we should understand cells in tissue culture because when you take out the cells from the patient right we have to keep the cells alive and how can you keep the cells alive using the tissue culture or cell culture that gee if I want to study the group of cells like spheroid I to grow the cells within the co2 incubator again cell culture you got it the microfluidic platform is based on micro engineering and that's why it is MEMS based device micro electromechanical systems based device understood this is just one example out of many on ongoing research in lot of laboratory around the world and what we see here is that we can use the platform for drug screening right now I give an example here that this is a static platform if you see the slide static platform right while all three here Mac photic 1 2 & 3 is a or our dynamic platforms these are dynamic models right dynamic the trance well this one is a static platform you understand the difference the dynamic platform would be better compared to a static platform for studying the drug scanning since we can mimic the in your situation better in this particular case as we are flowing the media instead of blood we can also use blood and load the drug and then you flow the drug into the microphone a chip so there can be multiple applications as well ok so let's go to the next slide and what we see this is the applications so now let us see the advantages of tissue culture technique the first advantage is see it gives a good control of the environment ok then why good control of environment because like I said we can we can grow the cells with a similar environment like our body right like our body okay now this is not this is TT this is cuter incubator that helps to control the and control the growth and the cell culture right but when you understand the tissue culture when you grate the tissue then the environment when you grow the tissue within the laboratory would be similar to what is there in the body that so the good control of the environment means it will retain most of the property of how these cells would be there within the body that that's how one of the advantages there second is that characterization and homogenization of this issue sample second and the third one is the economic scale and mechanization we can always induce that and finally in vitro modeling and in vivo conditions we can use in with remodeling and in vivo conditions right so if you see the next slide what are the limitations right so the limitations are the cell culture techniques need a great deal of expertise if there is a contamination if there is a material contamination cells will die so we require a semi skilled or not semi scale actually a skilled person orchids skilled personnel to operate the tissue culture laboratory okay so culturing technique requires a great deal of expertise tissue sample consists of mixture of heterogeneous cell populations because you can you can have different cells and you want to grow a tissue out of it you can use that continuous growing of cells often exhibit genetic instability then so the why this is limitation mixture of it raja'na cell population because if I want to understand a study a particular cells out of which the tissue is from I and if I if I have the multiple tissue samples may consist of multiple cells like heterogeneous a heterogeneity then the homogeneity is less and then I cannot study a particular cells or group of cells I had to rely on the heterogeneity of the cell so it's kind of difficult because I don't know what to study that right so that is the limitation continuous growing of cells often exhibit genetic instability then we have differences in the behavior cells in cultured and natural form and finally it should include proper balance of hormones so if you want to see how a tissue culture lab setup looks like this is an example from Caltech however we have the similar kind of facility in our Institute and a small facility in my department in my laboratory which I will show it to you as a part of your lab class okay so if you see the tissue culture lab setup there is a cell counter centrifuge right there are incubators which are shown here there are waste bins right then there is a hot room hotter ways to grow the bacteria there are microscope room quarantine room then we have a glass trial where we have laminar flow hoods we can have a storage freezer for nitrogen your nitrogen freezers these freezers are for the crab preservation of the cells then we have a preparation area Oh one's autoclaves right wash-up area and there are things so the the most of the facilities right they are kind of in a cleanroom environment not really required now when you are that depends on what kind of you know applications you are working on otherwise it is always good to maintain a clean room for this kind of study since you are taking care of removing the bacterial contamination as far as possible the quality of air is better compared to a normal laboratory environment right now there is a hot room if you are seeing a hot room why hot room is required because we have to keep these cells alive at 37 degree centigrade difficult to grow all these cells grow the bacteria right we require a room which can maintain that is degree centigrade right why we require autoclave autoclave is required to clean wash right kill the remaining bacteria if any ourselves if any from the class well before we discard into the bio waste bag now we have one to heat the materials of course you know it we have several cylinders we have a nitrogen cylinder co2 cylinder we sometimes also use a compressed air so we have multiple cylinders over there and there the the system's depends on a stability on non cellular components some of the applications requires non-sterile some of the applications required sterile components right all the operations in operation theater they are all sterile that's why where you will see or when you are using a robotic arm to perform the surgery I do not exactly you are using what I mean is when the surgeon is using the robotic arm for performing surgery you see it is covered by a lot of plastic and lot of other things right only the tip of that is access to the environment this is to maintain the sterility the most like the the the infection the material infection generally occurs because of it transmitted to our hand and that's why it's very important to keep ourself sterile as well as the equipment's today and like I said bacteria is enemy to cell so if you are growing a cancer cell if you put bacterial cells for dying right so we need to be careful when we are operating or using this kind of facility now if you go to the next one these are from the equipment and chemicals required for working in a biosafety class and the the class of this biosafety hood is divided into four first is BSL one where we can use an N non-pathogenic strains of E coli if there is a BSL 2 which is biosafety level 2 we can use staff or us where if it is biosafety level 3 we can use micro bacterium tuberculosis and if it is by soft 11 for then and then only we can use Ebola or Marburg viruses and Zika this enough stuff okay so this way I will not see in our our our course this is also we will not see will see biosafety level two I'll show it to you how the system operates in a real situation in my laboratory okay just to understand it has a LCD display to maintain the flow rate it has a power lock water proof socket there is water and care step as adjustable stand for the height of the for the personal and you have to put a bio safe biohazard level when you are using bio you know it's always a good idea to put a biohazard label whenever we are working with a Banerjee sample okay now this is what is called bio safety level 2 so what is this bio safety hood or cabinet this is where the primary tissues are processed to obtain the culture it is equipped with all precautionary features to eliminate contamination right as well as hazard to the personal and the link that issue the different essential parts of purse of tea would are shown in the figure like I said water gas step LCD display handle power log mass of the labeled water proof socket and we type in take trivial right let's see so this video that I will play now demonstrates how a biological safety hood cabinet works to protect us and how it is helping the laboratory workers by reducing the risk of exposure right we need to understand the biological safety hood as when we work in this particular hood there is ellipse lap safety protocols which will help prevent contamination of our work and protect us at the same time so it's very important you see this video in detail right and then we will continue the next slide so let me play the video [Music] this video demonstrates how biological safety cabinets work to protect you providing protection to laboratory workers product and the environment while reducing the risk of exposure thoroughly understanding how a biological safety cabinet works while following established lab safety protocols will help prevent contamination of your work and protect you at the same time when used correctly a properly installed and certified biological safety cabinet provides personnel environmental and product protection for work with biological materials including infectious agents and recombinant DNA this video depicts free-standing class 2 type-a - biological safety cabinet or BSC it includes HEPA filters for exhaust and supply air the work surface the opening to the work surface the airfoil front and rear air intake grilles the plenum the BSC's air filtration system works to keep potentially contaminated air from seeping back onto the worker air flows through the window opening into the front grille through the plenum then through the HEPA filters 30% of the filtered air is exhausted the remaining 70% which is now HEPA filtered is recycled back into the workspace to ensure maximum protection in using a BSC here are some essential reminders one if the cabinet has been turned off you must turn it on and wait at least 15 minutes before beginning your work to set up the interior workspace to work from clean to dirty and work consistently from one direction toward the other to prevent cross-contamination three place your chair at a comfortable height and in the middle of your workspace to ensure you can reach everything you need inside the cabinet without discomfort please keep in mind that you must work at least 10 centimetres inside the BSC to guarantee uninterrupted airflow cabinets should never be overcrowded over crowding the BSC can block air grilles airflow can also be disrupted by sudden or sweeping movements slow direct movements work best too much foot traffic can cause problems as well and should be kept at a minimum if pedestrians are unavoidable keep people at least one metre from your BSC and remember to check nearby doors or supply vents to determine if they disrupt the cabinet's airflow when you have completed your work any reusable items should be wiped down with disinfectant before removing them from the BSC next the interior surfaces of the BSC you should be decontaminated using the appropriate disinfectant for a contact time recommended for the agent used to be sure a second decontamination is advisable in summary there are a small number of best practices to follow in using a biological safety cabinet let's go over them one last time work at least 10 centimetres inside of the BSC do not block front and rear grilles too many objects in the BSC can disrupt the airflow set up workspace in a direction from clean to dirty use slow direct movements minimize foot traffic within 1 meter of the BSC placement of the BSC away from doors and room air supply vents ops maintain airflow so now having seen the video now you have all the idea that how a biosafety hole works right now I like I said the focus of the today's lecture is to understand the bios of the cell and tissue culture however it is also to understand what are the equipment and chemicals required and such one such equipment like we discussed in the previous example is a co2 incubator as you can see the co2 incubator from thermo scientific is shown right over here and you can see here the t 75 flask c 75 or T 25 flasks are there along with petri dish along with trans well you can see here right the petri dish with cells loaded here these are T 75 flasks with cells loaded and there is a media that's why because of the media you can see a red color within the within the glass where's now the use of co2 incubator is that we can grow the cells in a controlled environment and like I discussed the parameters usually are 37 degree centigrade temperature 95% humidity 5% co2 and this is the core equipment of any tissue culture laboratory it gives a control over contamination which is a major issue in tissue culture labs and now the the size can vary from tabletop to those that can fill an entire small room some of the incubators can be programmed to cycle different temperature and humidity level if you see here we can program different temperature and different humidity level depending on the application of the work ok so to this let us finish our this particular module and we'll continue understanding tissue and cell culture in one more module and then we will finish the this particular topic then we will actually go to understand what exactly is cancer and how can we develop several systems related to cancer right it is it is more of understanding of how tissue and cell culture laboratory looks like what are the equipment that are used to maintain these cells and or to grow the tissues within a controlled environment right and then you take care I'll see you in the next class
