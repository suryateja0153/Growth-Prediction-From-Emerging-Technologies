 [Music] hello everyone welcome to another lecture of drug memory engineering and principles we are going to continue our discussion and that we are having on this particular module which is on vaccines so just a quick recap of what we learned in the last class so in the last class we were looking at gene therapy and using genes as vaccines so delivering the whole plasmid containing your gene of interest into these cells itself so what will happen is because now that you have delivered them let's say to a cell these cells will produce the protein in the cytoplasm and then it will signal as is something that is being produced by a viral or a cytoplasmic more that classman response so that was the whole idea there we learn few things in the last class in regards to that one was now we can use this for older oral deliveries to take care of some of the food allergies in this case we looked at peanut allergy then we also talked about other vaccines in the other vaccines we had several different formulations one was depo for mission so what we were doing is basically injecting something or implanting something which act as a depo so the antigens are here rather than letting the nditions flow around and find the immune cell this particular one was asking the immune cells to come to its site only so and the way this was doing it it was releasing chemokines and because chemokines are being released here right at this point the highest concentration of chemo kind is there and as it moves further away the concentration of chemo can was decreasing and this gradient caused all these a PCS to move in and survey the site and once they come in there are also antigens that are loaded this could be either in the same gel the same as the chemokines are loaded or they could be particles encapsulating your antigens and then these ap C's are going to come and take up your nditions which will then cause them enhancement or signal as well as whatever response they need to activate so it nothing is but is acting as a kind of a lymph node artificial lymph node and obviously there are several papers out there which actually do this lymph node mimicking and do a much much more comprehensive sort of setup to get complete mimicking of that but this is a preliminary paper showing that you can get that and basically asks the B C's to come to the site get activated generate the immune response rather than actually letting the individual find the ABCs and then when of that different type of vaccine we will talked about was using particles and complement system activation so in this particular example we saw that how the author's first of all were using size to target lymphatics so what they did is they used it the five nanometer and 100 nanometer particles and they of course found the 25 nanometer is easier for diffusion in the lymphatic systems the size it can go into the lymphatics much easily than the hundred nanometer and then what they did is of this 25 nanometer they prepared these particles from two different conjugation chemistry's one that did result in an hydroxyl present on the surface and one that resulted in methoxy group present on the surface and obviously this is more nucleophilic then the methoxy group which is fairly inert and what they found is this did a much much better job in in up regulating the complement system so the complement system started to get activated and that act as an innate immune response so the second response caused a lot more activation of the ABCs and much better vaccines and then the one that only used the methyl group so this is what we had learned there are several other examples it's I mean I can probably make a whole course out of just these examples of various types of vaccines which are different from the conventional vaccines as I'm giving you some flavor of it now we're going to talk about another type of vaccine and that is particular for a disease and these are cancer vaccines and cancer vaccines are fairly widely used in research phase not so much in the clinical phase although there are some examples and we'll talk about that but there's a lot and lot of enthusiasm as well as hope that these cancer vaccines in the research phase will succeed and ultimately translate to the clinics because as we all know cancer is a big big challenge that faces humanity at this point pretty much all of us probably knows somebody or the other who's either suffering from cancer or who has died because of cancer and and the way a society is going the cancer incident rate are increasing every year and so it's it's very important that we are able to tackle this problem as quickly as possible so first of all before we describe cancer vaccines I'll just give you a brief overview what cancer is I'm again sure most of you know about this is nothing but this uncontrolled growth of cells which were not supposed to do that at least not the way the body was designed these cancer cells actually routinely arise in a body so right from your childhood all the way to the old age we have these periodic Konza cells coming up again and again however and the reason they're coming they're coming up because they caused by mutations in some gene so during the replication maybe one gene gets mutated most of the time those genes are at some places that are benign so they don't cause anything sometimes those gene lead to a dysfunctional cell and the cell just dies but then in some cases these these mutations lead to at a very very specific place that either confers the ability to proliferate at a much higher pace or gives it enhance survival capabilities so that can grow even in harsh environments and that these little things lead to eventually development of cancer cancerous cells now because there are mutations so the proteins that are being produced are not the sequence that they're supposed to be so let's say there's a mutation in some of the gene that causes up regulation in proliferation so because of that mutation now your original gene that the body knows is no longer exists there's a mutation maybe few amino acids has changed maybe few minutes at a place the structure is different so there is some antigens because now we can call them integers because these are not something that the body knows about so this is not natural these are something that have been mutated so that's there are some antigens in these antigens are what the immune system can detect so it's false it's fairly feasible for the immune system now to be able to detect such abbreviated research mutated proteins so and then again this happens as I said much it a much more rate than we know the immune system does for continuously survey for these cancerous cell that are being generated and again almost all of the times the immune system is very good and adapt in destroying these cancer cells so that's why we don't really see cancer being developed as often as it could but then there are few cases in which the Muse stand then fails to destroy them maybe they're not as immuno genic these antigens maybe the immune system is not able to survey the whole of the body and then once that happens these cancer cells and proliferate and form tumors and that's what lead to tumor formation so again and that's what we're trying to tackle here we are saying that what if we had the body in tackling those and again like your conventional vaccines cancer vaccines can also be divided into two different types one is prophylactic vaccine as the name suggests and as we discussed in the past is given before the cancer has happened so let's see how this how does that work so and then this really simple reason is some cancers are actually caused by some Co viruses so we have previously talked about how I did know virus retroviruses can actually go in to your genome and put in their genome in they're putting in basically more promoters and very strong promoters in front of genes they were not supposed to be there sometimes they can go and put these promoters in front of let's say a protein that helps in survival a protein that helps in proliferation and that may cause the cancer to develop so one of the bigger example of this is a cervical cancer in cervical cancer most of the time it's actually caused by a virus and at a very high frequency actually and so this virus goes in and because of its process it develops these cervical cancer in our cells so very traditionally what is being done is if you vaccinate against these viruses these pathogens that are leading to humble genes being expressed you basically get rid of cancer so if these viruses don't get chance to actually go in and inject the genetic material that will be then then it not be able to activate any oncogenes and our body will be protected from such viruses so again few examples here is a hepatitis B vaccine is used to prevent liver cancer so if you get a heavy with this hepatitis B infection you have a higher tendency to get liver cancer however if you get hepatitis B vaccine you will not get hepatitis B disease and because of that the liver cancer incidence will also go down so this is given as a prophylactic treatment so even before you're getting cancer even before you getting hepatitis B disease you've been given a vaccine that directly or indirectly leads to prevention of liver cancer similarly the cervical cancer we talked about the this is through the HPV virus which is a human papilloma virus and this virus alone is actually responsible for almost 70 percent of cervical cancers so as I said the incidence of cancer infected with HPV is very very high and they almost 70% the cancer of cervix is observed because of this infection so if we somehow give a vaccine before this virus has chance to infect us we not only protect against the disease but will prevent the cervical cancer incidences by quite a big margin okay so there was on the prophylactic vaccines not much as I said this is mostly an indirect way at least at this point of time people haven't been vaccinated directly for a cancer cell which is not caused by any other pathogen in a prophylactic manner so that's where the therapeutic vaccines then become very important because these are what will be more clinically relevant at least in most of the cases where a patient is coming in with a disease already with cancer already and then we want the body's immune system to be able to fight that cancer and so the goal though overall here is to increase the immune response against humour antigens so those tumor antigens that are caused by the mutations in your in your normal cell initially if we can get those immune responses against these antigens to go up then the immune system can come and kill your cancer cell right so at this point the major problem is that the immune system is not detecting that these are cancer cells or not able to do much against these because it doesn't think that these are cancerous or there are too many of them or could be several reasons so somehow we can strengthen the immune response against these particular antigens we'll be able to hopefully cure cancer through our own immune system itself the problem is is actually very hard to generate immune response because these antigens are very similar to our own antigens so now we had now we are talking about let's say if this is a protein that the body already has all that has changed is maybe one or two amino acids here and mutated so the body is find it very difficult first of all to identify that there is a change here and then secondly there is really no other signal the body gets to get activated for your immune response because when you are talking about a bacterial cell coming in we had talked about there's so many different innate immune pathways going up the innate cells recognizing the patterns maybe the flagella maybe the LPS maybe the DNA the CPG Islands and all so all of this was a very very good activator of the immune response and not only that the proteins that these bacterial cells are secreting let's say if they're secreting a protein this protein was completely foreign so each and every peptide sequence that makes this protein is new to the body so the body can generate immune response against all of these regions and so there's very high chance that you'll get antibodies you'll get cytotoxic T cells to be able to recognize this kill whatever niche this particular bacteria or other pathogens are surviving now but in this case first of all you don't have much co stimulatory molecule much co-stimulation I should say it has less co-stimulation and then the invasion itself is very very small as well maybe only when indigent will send in one protein so all of those result in quite a difficult task for the immune system to be able to mount a good response against it and then not only that what then complicates the problem is because these cells are now rapidly dividing sometimes the mutation could actually be in in enzymes that are supposed to take care of the fidelity of the DNA replication so what I mean by that is let's say let's say there is an enzyme that checks whether the DNA replication has happened correctly or not checks correctness of DNA replication so now if this enzyme got mutated itself then what will happen not only there's one mutation here but every subsequent time the cell is going to divide there is a chance that there is going to be more mutations or the mutations getting accumulated at a much higher rate and so that's what it means you can also have a higher mutation rate that is being developed and then that means that let's say let's let's just say that here's one cell that was cancerous it goes ahead and let me clear this area so it goes goes ahead and starts dividing makes several of these now because this enzyme wasn't working that is that is responsible for making sure that there is a correct DNA replication that is happening what will happen is as it divides further maybe one one of the protein gets mutated and it is a being another type of cancer cell so now what will happen is this will divide further you know basely the red the original cancer cells will continue to divide and then it could again happen that another other cell gets mutated through these green line as well so let's say another yellow cell gets invaded right and then this is gonna be surrounded by the red original cells so this can actually continue to go on and so now what you are doing is not only you have a tumor because there's a kid there's a mutation but now as the time is progressing as the tumors are becoming larger and larger you are actually accumulating more mutations and more different types of cells and so then it becomes very hard for the body to be able to control for all this because let's say if the immune system does come in is able to recognize one of these types it will still not be able to the chance for it to be able to recognize all three all ten types that might be there in that large tumor is very low and so that's why there are several variants of tumor antigens that comes up and eventually it becomes a harder job for the immune system to be able to handle that so but nonetheless there are some vaccines like the other vaccines they have been classified into different categories so when is the autologous tumor cell vaccine and as the name suggests is that means that this is from your own tumor cells so let's say a patient comes in or an animal is induced a tumor you isolate the cells from the tumor regions maybe at the time a biopsy when it's being confirmed that the tumor is there we isolate some part of the tumor anyways so we isolate some cells realize them so when I lies these cells and initially let's say this was a cell and maybe one of the protein had this mutation here so let's save analyze this cell all of the proteins come out I then mix it with some adjuvants so what I can do is now I mix it with some LPS or I mix it with some flagella flagellin protein and then put it back in the body so now what is happening is earlier as I said that these tumor cells are not activating the immune system as much as let's say a bacterial cell would so now what I've done is because I've given these co-stimulatory signals this is gonna lead to a much enhanced response against any muted protein mutated protein that is present in your lies it so at this point you are basically not really testing as to what is the mutation you're just taking the whole cells utilizing them up you hope that that cell now is containing or that cell lies it is now getting several proteins a time you did it and you inject it back in the body along with some adjuvants and then let the immune system figure out what is wrong which is the protein that needs to target and one of the advantage here is you are actually presenting the entire spectrum of your individual so all the antigens that may be present maybe one maybe five I've been presented to the immune system which same system can then sort through and mount a response oh maybe let's say this one had to two or three proteins that were mutated and even though only one maybe one protein is more immuno genic than the other because of the mutations so then it becomes a higher chance for the immune system to at least detect one of these different mutations and be able to kill the cell the this also as I said this also causes transduction of stimulated proteins such as il L 12 and GM CSF so because of all that you will have much better response so the innate immunity has kicked in in a much better way however there is some risk of autoimmunity now because as I said you are taking the whole lies eight and adding it with adjuvants and putting it back in the body so now this lies it even though it contains some of the antigens which are mutated from the normal cell this also contains several functioning and intact proteins several intact original proteins that you are now supplying with adjuvants so there is a little bit of chance that if the adjuvant has worked very well or the immune system got activated to such a high amount that some of these original proteins some of these original self antigens may be recognized by the immune system and immune system may mount the response against them so if that happens then what will happen then your immune system is going to go even to healthy cells mount the response against them because these healthy cells are producing these proteins and by that logic to see the self antigen and that may cause even more destruction then what you wanted and not not to mention I just said how do you get this tumor sample it may involve some surgical procedure needed to be done to get this initial isolation of the cell done and so it's invasive you need quite a bit of tumor sample again if you're gonna go ahead and inject it you want to give as much indigenous possible so you want the substantial amount of team assembled to be present as well so here are just a list of some of the tumor invasion mechanisms that have been known in the literature so first of all is a physical barrier itself so as I said that the tumor is growing fairly rapidly and it's filling of whatever space it can find so obviously this space never existed before this was supposed to be only a single cell now it is converted into many cells so it's just pushing around on the body it's a very tight network its mechanical properties are much higher than the surrounding tissue in terms of stiffness and all so it's harder for now the immune cell let's say this is an APC which is coming to survey the area it's harder for this cell to be able to penetrate deep inside this because it will have to navigate through all kinds of cells and to be able to find all different antigens that are present in this tumor microenvironment so there's a physical barrier just imposed by the team architecture then you have induction of host my light and lymphoid suppressor so not only that the human environment is very complex it actually signals in such a way that it causes suppression of your myeloid and lymphoid cells so they don't really work very well sometimes it it causes t-regulatory cells which we discussed in the past which are t-cells that will actually regulate and tell the immune system to calm down to be present in much higher quantity in the tumor region than in the surrounding so that means that even if the activated immune cell is coming it's not going to be able to do much because when it sees these it thinks that this is a site that it doesn't need to get activated on and the tumor then can protect itself from that there are direct mechanisms through which tumor binds to these t-cells that are actually immuno genic and actually blocks their function so they can't really do their job there are expression of proteases that interfere with the cytotoxicity so obviously let's say if I try to deliver a protein that kills the cell but there are lots of proteases in the surrounding then that protein that I'm delivering it gets degraded in that environment so it's hard for those proteins to survive there are certain expression of fasts like in so it goes back to what I was saying earlier so it expresses some of these proteins on these surfaces which causes the immune system to not really go 100% against these particular tumor cells there's a down regulation of cytokine receptors so the cytokines don't really signal it very well on these so one of the way the cells can die is lots of cytokines come in bind to it and the cell functioning gets disturbed but the tumor cells can have down regulation of such receptors and that may not happen I already mentioned sometimes there are also resistance to apoptosis so maybe the mutation in such a gene that it doesn't die and continues to proliferate and so they are much more Hardy and much more adapt to be able to survive in harsh environment that immune system can present the diesels can actually not be able to even recognize it and there we already talked about that it's not very immunogenic as well as the environment itself is very taller than taller genic environment not letting the immune system get activated in that area even let's say if if the body does able to mount the response if the immune system is able to ignite a particular antigen as I said the mutation rate is very high so there will be parts of regions of this tumor which would even mutate that and have some other mutation that is causing now tumor so because of all that the body may not be able to clear out the whole of the tumor cell even then some of the tumor cells may survive because they are slightly different and they then continue to proliferate and grow the tumor it also down regulates some of the MHC molecules so it doesn't really process the antigen so every cell has these in mouse every cell has these MHC molecules that are presenting the antigen but if the number of these receptors are lower so let's say there's a certain density of these receptors and most healthy cells what Timur does it then decreases this number so that not a whole lot of them are being presented so the immune system can really recognize it then the expression of ligands for killer cells are inhibited as well as it's also shed these ligands out so that the immune cells are not able to recognize this so here's what ideally we would like to have in cancer vaccines so you give these cancer vaccines to genetic cells or macrophages which are invisible Indic cells they get activated against the antigen so this probably is along with some co-stimulatory molecule and this is gonna go ahead and activate the CTLs the cytotoxic t-cells because in this case the antibody can be useful but it really won't do much stuff you want to kill the cells itself so cytotoxic T cells and T helper cells are the major players and so this is the immune activation part of it this is what ideally we would like and then these to go to the tumor cells and start killing it using various mechanisms by the by secreting enzyme and poor foreign or if'n gamma to further boost this response however what actually happens is as I said this tumors are secreting all these several proteins that are causing immune tolerance so tgf-beta I do veg F gelatin it's causing activation of T regs there's also PD PD one BD L one that is also present that is causing the tumor associated macrophages and the different types of immune cells to not get activated and all of this result in modulation of this immune response that we want it and do not go very active against these cells and be able to then protect this tumor cell obviously at the same time most patients also get conventional therapies such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy but then they suffer from various drawbacks that they are not able to penetrate inside a dense tumor tissue they are not able to kill oil uma cells because of mutations these tumor cells anyways are fairly strong in resisting cell death and eventually they're able to survive and obviously there are tumor antigens in the surrounding that you can again use for cancer vaccine so this is kind of an whole axis of how this whole process is taking place in our body so what are some of the desirable properties of cancer vaccines so of course when is its targeting antigens preferentially that are exclusively on tumors but not on healthy tissue again if you use antigens that are present on healthy tissues then you have autoimmune the spawns being generated it should be fairly safe and non-toxic to human cells of course and that's true with any kind of treatment you what about the quantity so can you deliver enough to get sufficient number of your immune cells to be activated whatever the quality is the ones that are activating is being able to go and kill the cells you can express t-cell whether they express t-cell receptors with high ability to the target antigen so well they'll bind to it give the desired function traffic to the edema sites so be able to go and find where it is and then further navigate inside the tumor as well and then how much of the duration of response is given by these cells whether these cells are active so for enough duration do we will to kill all of the tumor cells in a large tuber okay so we will stop here and we'll continue this in the next class thank you
