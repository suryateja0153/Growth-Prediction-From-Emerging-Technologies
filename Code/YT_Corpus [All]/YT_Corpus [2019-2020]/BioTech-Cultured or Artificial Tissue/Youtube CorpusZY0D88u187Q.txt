 that let's get going I would like to turn it over to the president of the Children's Tumor foundation and that is a net bakker Annette please take it away good evening everybody and I would really like to thank everybody who is taking the time tonight to participate in the update on the nf2 accelerator you will observe that we in that Children's Tumor Foundation have really chosen for a portfolio approach and for the investors on the call portfolio is a way to balance risk and rewards with the end goal to really maximize the return on investment and as you know our return on investments is really to bring drugs to the clinic for clinical trials for the non investors on the call I would like to present it a little bit different it is a little bit like the race you're seeing here where instead of betting on one runner the Foundation has chosen to bet on multiple runners towards that means in fact practically that for a moment we are betting on drugs that are out there so that we can help the nf2 patients today while also investing in D let's say unknown holy grail which is nf2 gene therapy so tonight it is my absolute pleasure to introduce you to Salvatore la Rosa who is our chief scientific officer to give you an update of what the initiatives are that we have and we also are very fortunate to have two guests on the phone tonight one is dr. Plotkin from MGH who is the principal investigator of the brig at inept clinical trial and he will explain you where we stand and where we go and the other person is mr. Michael Wooten who is the TV professor of the company called nx2 therapeutics and will give you an update on the nf2 gene therapy towards the end Michelle will give you an update on where we stand with fundraising wise for the nf2 accelerator and with that I really would like to thank everybody for being here tonight and we're hoping to get a lot of questions from you so with that let me turn it over to salvo to give you an overview of where we stand okay thank you on that I hope you guys hear me just getting confirmation yes from the captions so as you see here in the overview we'll have we'll cover the first three points that are the main pillar of dnf2 accelerator initiative and I would like to again you know explain a little bit about the clinical drug pipeline these are what we are what Annette said we are trying to push drugs that are easy to be translated into treatments and we have some frontrunners with Regatta nib and Scott will soon talk about this and then we are trying to make sure we are making investments to to bring the next drugs in the clinic after bruh cabinet and then after that we are definitely trying to fuel new ideas in new science for enough to treatments as well then the second point is is not only having drugs but also having a system in place that will allow us to select drugs that are they have better capacity better chance to get to the to the finish line to get approved by the FDA and here we are working with the experts to leverage some of the technology for instance with large animal models and I will talk about the mini-pigs initiative we're funding for nf2 and other models that we want to make available to all searchers and then at the end Michael is going to talk about the recent investments where we're doing with and have to tear up UNIX and their approach to gene therapy for f2 and then of course some important dates fundraising and joining so let's go to the first runner the breakout in a clinical trial so what I want to do is first of all explain you briefly where is this drug coming from and then I will pass the mic to to Scott and he will actually talk about this trial where we are and you know all of the details about it so where's this drug coming from bucatini was identified in sonatas nf2 and for those of you who know and heard about this project it was started in 2014 and we invested 3.3 million CT have had a pivotal role in this not only in pulling this initiative together but also coordinating it and it was a major effort 12 labs across the world and they were like sorry yes 12 last eight different institutions so if you see here on my bullet points the program was completed in May 2000 18 and these are the major results so we tested over 2000 drugs we also tested out of these drugs 170 different drug combinations meaning two drugs together and we saw that there was a clear advantage of testing combinations versus single drugs then we'll look at you know even more like 10 drugs in in to see what was the effect and if you see on the right of your screen is like you know taking a funnel where you have all of this drug at the beginning you funnel your through your system that is making more and more selectively and selecting always the best and at the end you have a potential therapeutics potential drug so that's where Brigade nip came out of course there is a lot of other data there and we are trying to see what is next after bruh gardening but this is clear that the number one results of zeros in f2 is this drug and now we are about to enter a clinical trial with this drug so I will turn to Scott and he will talk about you know the the parking for platform trial current status in the next phase so I'm gonna stop sharing my screen I know Scott you want to share your slides right we cannot hear you I'm not seeing Scott did not Auto see Scott either you know thing I wonder if you know he got bumped off you know is here before but not I don't I don't see Scott here okay can you I mute Scott I'm looking for the name Scott Plotkin and I don't see him is he hot is he logged in yes he's logged in you should ID 67 Albert do you see him house who saw you should be able to see it because you're I don't I don't I don't see him either in the attendees list either it's almost like he just disconnected somehow so just for everybody I have Scott on the phone is logging out and logging in again just few minutes sorry I'll keep an eye on him and promote him once I see them you there he goes can anyone hear me yep you can know I could hear remember I was talking to a net in the beginning so that's why it was confusing so I apologized let me weave not just not going yeah we promoted you to present us so you couldn't show your screen I will in one sec and I want to make sure the captions are working working for me also I see them okay then give me one more second to figure out how to show my screen share screen can anyone see my screen yes look us we see it it's good great well thank you very much for the opportunity to provide an update on all of our work I do apologize I've been sick the past two days and I probably sound like it and we'll give be a little bit feeble but I'll do my best this is a an update that I also provided to the Department of Defense NF Consortium recently so this is the same information we provided to investigators so as mentioned previously this work comes out of the NF 2 Sano dos project and is a collaboration between Children's Tumor foundation Takeda Pharmaceuticals and a group of investigators and what I'm going to tell you tonight in a few minutes is about and innovative trowel design that incorporates the use of the drug bug actinin but I want to emphasize that this trial is far bigger than any single drug and I hope to convince you of that shortly it's the main reason that it's taken us some time to get this up and running so this trial is called the innovative trial for understanding the impact of targeted therapies and nf2 and we're going to engrave a tit into it at f/2 and just before I start can you remind me Salva how many minutes so I can tie myself here that I have or you want me to speak just take the time you need Scott we just keep in mind and we were kind of late already but anyway okay so this is a brief table or a limited table I should say of many of the clinical trials that have been run in the past decade for nf2 related tumors and one of the points that I like to make is that for clinicians and for patients our development of drugs and nf2 has been incredibly slow and there are many reasons for that one of the reasons is that it takes years to get a trial through the regulatory process and we're looking for better designs to make that faster so this is a summary of some of the challenges and opportunities for nf2 patients and clinicians we know that current therapies such as surgery and radiation have worse outcomes than for sporadic tourists meaning similar tumors and patients who don't have NF too everyone is aware of course that there's no approved therapies for nf2 right now and the point that I'm trying to make tonight is the time between Clark trials is way too long but a second important problem is that when we have two trials it's difficult to compare the results to say drug a versus drug B and that's because different trials have different designs and for that reason the results may not be comparable so I want to tell you about some of the work that's going on in oncology more broadly where we're designing new trials that answer or address some of these questions the first thing I want to explain to you is the concept of a basket trial in this basket trial tests the effect of one drug on a single mutation and a variety of tumor types at the same time so for example we know that some types of lung cancer and some types of breast cancer can be caused by the same genetic variation even though the cancer types are very different and in a basket trial you could take drug a and treat a breast cancer with a mutation and a lung cancer with the same mutation in the same trial so instead of the traditional one drug for one tumor type a basket trial allows you to enroll multiple different tumor types that share a common cause into a clinical trial and we call it a basket trial because all of these different tumor types get play placed in the same basket a platform trial is a trial design that incorporates not multiple tumors right that's the basket is multiple tumor types a platform trial is something that has multiple drugs at the same time and the way a platform works is that individuals get randomized or allocated two different drugs so the nice thing about a platform trial is that all of these drugs are provided to participants using the same eligibility criteria that is they all have the same reason for joining the trial and so it promotes comparability or comparisons between the treatment arms so these two designs are being applied broadly in oncology now and our goal in the Intuit nf2 trial is to combine this platform and basket models into a single trial so that we can take the broadest range of nf2 related tumors into treatment and use multiple drugs to be screened in a sequential fashion that is one after the other and platform trials by design are flexible that is if one of the drug arms or the experimental arms doesn't look good it can be stopped and if new drugs become available you can add them into the trial without having to start a whole new trial there's an expedited way to add these trials and what it requires to do this is a pipeline and that is the work that Children's Tumor foundation along with investigators have been doing with Takeda for the past two years that is not focusing just on drug a but focusing on trying to develop a relationship with a major pharmaceutical partner that can fill our pipeline of promising drugs for the next decade and here is a schematic of how we envision this working this slide is a reminder that I'm presenting you our design but this is likely to of so if this if you are viewing this beyond 2019 there may be changes to this trowel design with that understanding I'll walk you through it salvo can you see or Simon my pointer moving around yes we can okay in the top left you see the platform trial the portion shows that patients have common eligibility so the same types of reasons to get in the trial and we evaluate the success with the common endpoints so this is going to encourage comparison between the drugs now patients with nf2 in order to enroll have to have a tumor that's growing we're not going to provide drugs to individuals who have stable tourists because we don't want to incur side-effects without benefit one of the novel designs is that this is a basket so instead of only focusing on vestibular schwannoma this trial will allow us to enroll vestibular schwannoma patients patients who have growing non vestibular schwannomas or growing meningioma or for the first time ever growing ependymomas spinal tumors individuals will be randomized which means like a coin toss to either receive drug a drug B or drug C these are called individual drug substudy so the top ox is what we call the master protocol and the box below are the individual drug some studies now one thing that's important is when you start off with only a single drug such as brig at snip our first drug there will be no randomization but in the future as we build our pipeline patients can be treated with a number of drugs at that time after being on the study we will look at the MRI scan to see who's respond to MERS our responding in which not if some tomber remains stable or shrinks they'll stay on the individual drug substudy if the tumor grows what we see then is that this individual comes off of that individual substudy whoops comes back into the master protocol where we will observe them if they choose by getting routine MRI scans until there is evidence that the tumor is growing and then they can potentially be randomized a second time to a different drug if available so imagine a scenario where there are three drugs if a person's on drug a and the tumor grows they come back into the master protocol once the washout period is done because there has to be a wait time so the medicine leaves the body before you can start a new medicine you can immediately get randomized to the second drug and so we hope that when the trial is mature that the wait time between experimental agents is somewhere between three and six months and the goal is to give patients as many opportunities with promising drugs as is possible I want to stop there for a moment and just see if there's any obvious questions and I can't see the chat so Simon could I ask you to just if you see any questions could you relay them to me please sure so we have a question from and Noble and she's asking do they know what any of the side effects are with any of those yes we have a I can't only tell you about the first drug so far and I'm gonna tell you later and the talk so why don't I wait but I will say that this drug or gadget up is FDA approved for treatment of patients who have lung cancer and we have a lot of information about the side effect profile which is mostly nausea vomiting rash swelling and things like that but generally well tolerated a couple other questions one from John Morris are the drugs only coming from Takeda at this point drugs are only going to come from Takeda the nice thing about working with a large pharmaceutical company is that they have an enormous pipeline I think our vision moving forward would be to have a trial that incorporates multiple companies but being realistic we know that there are intellectual property issues with trials meaning that companies ten-to-one exclusive rights and so it is a challenge in some cases to work with multiple companies but that would be one of our future ange if possible and a question from Barbara Franklin will the initial basket include three drugs which hang on one second is the shots moving will the national vet will the initial best include three drugs which will all treat vs or men or a pen so look remember the basket is a term for the multiple different tumor types so all four tumor types are eligible from the get-go the first drug there will only be a single drug when we start and that'll be we're gadget --iv which will be drug a but all four tumor types will be eligible for treatment and a follow-up from Barbara what if a major pharma company has a very logical drug will there still be clinical trials for it I'm sorry say one more type what if a major pharma company has a very logical drug will there still be clinical trials for it sure it probably at this point on December 11 2019 would not be the Intuit nf2 trial but we are still open for business every institution and in the DoD F consortium to run trials we would never turn away a promising drug and I think and Noble said as a follow-up to the side effects question she said she meant more along the lines of total fatigue that's a good question I would say every drug I've ever worked with has fatigue and so I'd have to look back in and really think look back on the specifics for Berg Aetna to see if it's out of proportion to other medicines okay I think that's all the questions for the moment okay now given the amount of time we have I'm gonna try to focus on on areas that I think are most productive this is a list for the doctors on how we're gonna assess whether the drugs are active or effective and I'll just point out that in addition to looking at the shrinkage on MRI scan we're going to be looking at safety and tolerability of course hearing response for individuals who have measurable hearing quality of life and we're going to be looking at a variety of biomarkers meaning looking at our Chi vil or stored tumor samples as well as blood assessment on genetics so as of today subject to change the way to get into the study these are the inclusion criteria we have to an individual has to have a diagnosis of nf2 excuse me the company did not want us to treat anyone under the 18 but because we and and Children's Tumor Foundation have been very strong advocates we have been able to explain to them the importance of treating individuals younger than 18 so at this point we're open aged 12 and up and the reason it's not below age 12 is many of the medicines we're studying do not have safety data in the young children and therefore the companies are not prepared to do new risk in this setting I mentioned that tumors have to be growing there's two possible definitions it's growing over the last 36 months either a 20% increase in volume or 2 millimeter increase in linear dimension it has the tumors have to be measurable which means that you have to be able to see them on MRI patients have to have a life expectancy of more than a year meaning you can't be so sick that we worry that you're not going to do well and a performing status over 70% which means for most people the ability to at least do some walking that's a rough idea but you have to get the specifics at the time of enrollment and the exclusion criteria if you're on chemotherapy or getting radiation we don't mix medicines radiation within the last three years because it confounds or confuses our ability to understand who's responding or who's not you have to be able to tolerate MRI scans no major illnesses and pregnant or lactating women are not eligible just because we don't know the effect of these medicines in that group of individuals so I'm gonna in the last few minutes just tell you about how many individuals we hope to enroll on the master study we want to have 80 individuals and on each individual drug we hope to have 40 and these numbers are easily changed so these are just what we're using to start things off the statistical plan is modern and flexible it's what we call an adaptive design and so the way that adaptive design works that patients will be enrolled in two stages in the first stage 20 individuals with any of the tumors we talked about will be accrued or enrolled we want at least two people per tumor type so two people with vestibular schwannoma and two people with non vestibular schwannoma after 20 people are treated we're gonna look at the MRI scans and we're gonna try to figure out of the four different tumor types which one looks the most promising maybe the drug works really well in meningioma and works terrible and schwannoma or maybe it works great in schwannoma but not in ependymoma we will then take that information take two of the four groups and the last 20 subjects the second 20 will be accrued only into those two baskets because we are trying to maximize treatment of people whose tumors are likely to respond to the medicine a power statement and I guess I won't go over these cenotes nf2 work that we talked about previously since salvo did that I'm gonna see if there's anything else no I thought maybe you can address when is the trial likely to start I think is a question from Earl as well I see yeah in fact we have a few questions after the answer that will throw a few others that you okay well so the stage where now is we're undergoing ethics review which is for those who are following the details that's an institutional review board or IRB we are the each institution has a different protocol or way of reviewing these at Mass General Hospital which will be the coordinating Center we have two stages and we're in the middle of those right now and so I think that we're hoping in the next month or two that we will be able to insert enrolling patients that's our hope Christmas is always a very challenging time of the year to get things through these regulatory groups another question from Erin lipof can Scott please speak to any off-label usage of Borgata Ned for nf2 and outcomes for the same you know I'm not aware of any published data on the off-label use this is always a good question because we're gonna have a choice as a community are we gonna enroll patients we the doctors and our patients going to be willing to be enrolled on the clinical trial or will people prescribe this or take this off label my hope is that we will have enough individuals who will go on the trial because that will be our only way of formally learning whether it works so I don't know what's gonna go on in the community but I hope that we'll have enough individuals that will beyond the trial the next question from Barbara Franklin will those in trial have to go to specific centers or local hospital so like all clinical trials the United States government regulates them very carefully and as part of that each site has to have federal approval to be part of the trial which means that local your local doctor can't just do this so the answer is that will be sites and we're trying to arrange it such that they are spread across the United States but we all know that there's never enough sites to be convenient for everybody and one of the things we're trying to do is to make this more to make it easier for people who travel and if we're able to get it through the regulatory bodies there may be ways of doing three months between visits in some cases so I'll keep you posted on that depending on how it turns out through the Ethics Board scope just to make sure that we are all and that we don't raise expectations the in a month we will be submitting the protocol to the FDA right it's not that in a month we will be able to enroll the first patients just to make sure that we're all not raising expectations we're yeah I mean I'm struggling with an unknowable answer which is people want understandably one an answer and on the other hand we don't can you and I would you being see chemi being empty MGH investigation team we don't control it so you're right absolutely right in that that I don't think we'll be enrolling patients in a month but I don't know where we'll be it will almost certainly be long on that but it's hard for you to know the exact time um another few other questions this is related to this I don't know if anything to add but Rhema bogan asked when does the face to trial for bruh gotten its start and from there if the results are promising one will it be available as a treatment method similar to how Avastin is used now well it's an FDA approved drug rima which means that anyone can technically prescribe it but that does not mean insurance will pay and I already stated that my hope is that we as a community try to enroll enough patients so that we get an answer here having said that I think a next point is well-taken that I don't want to come across as too optimistic that we'll be enrolling in January because she's right that's not likely so you know I think first quarters is our first quarter of 2020 would be my hope but you never know what you run into in your review and so it's hard to know for sure when first patient will be allowed to start from John Morris what about patients with multiple tumor types I thought that was common enough to what basket are they in so it's a great question and the answer is you have to have a growing tumor so if there's what we call these target tumors and non target tumors and so it'll be up to the clinician and to the individual how to define this so if an individual has a growing schwannoma know growing meningioma they can choose if they only have one type of growing tumor that would be the logical choice from we've got quite a few questions from our be Harrison what sites have been identified to date so we have done a competitive application process with the goal of identifying sites that see large numbers of nf2 patients and are have the infrastructure to enroll patients to clinical trials that selection process is not entirely complete yet in that we do have an idea of who it's gonna be but we have not negotiated budgets and so until sites are willing to accept budgets it's not finalized so until the process is finalized I don't think it's going or near finalized I should say we're not going to be discussing individual sites and unless and that feels differently no I think it is careful not to give the names of the site yet we are discussing as you can imagine everybody was participate it's a little bit a competitive trial to participate in and we want to make sure that those sites that can recruit the patients as quickly as possible will be the ones that will participate in this trial and we also want to don't want to include too many sites because then it becomes just a nightmare two or three more questions Lisa Lewis is asking will any sites be considered slash approved in Canada or only the US at this at this point it's to my knowledge it's the US and there's a lot of reasons for that which is I have tried personally to open trials in Canada and in other countries it's incredibly difficult and costs millions of extra dollars so at this point I'm not aware that of any possibility of doing in Canada at this point I mean I don't know if you feel any differently in that but it's Inc you need an incredible amount of infrastructure you know I I agree question from Michelle white if I'm supposed to start Avastin in the next week would that disqualify me or would I be able to come off of it and still participate you could so what you can do what you should do or two different questions so obviously this is something to discuss with your treating physician but there will be allowed a washout period for people to to start so it would not disqualify there's not in some kind of clinical trials there's a disqualifies you can't receive the drug of interest that's not the case here I think that's it for another was one other question but I'm going to put that towards the end since we were focused on clinical trials at the moment so and also keep in mind that it's nine o'clock okay sorry about going along no no I think this was good but Selma I'm going to let you sort of take lead on the next piece if you can stop sharing Scott a little thick from there or can I think I can get okay I'm going to come where left as you can see from this slide I'll go faster from here because I want to get Michael I think it's very exciting but what I want you to see in terms of where our project is and how our fundraising initiative and money is allocated that I put the price tag of fundraising target for each one of this initiative that is listed under the nf2 accelerator and we have managed to secure three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the Britannic trial of course this is not covering the entire budget because in Takeda pharmaceutical is taking a bigger portion of this definitely bigger so it's going to be a funding and CTF is helping to fund you know the the money needed to let's say cover the cost of the pie so that is absolutely necessary for you know this to happen so is it gonna be three hundred fifty thousand dollars that we are initially allocating and we gotta spend as soon as you know the trial is gonna start okay so I just want to say go back a little bit and and tell you how and how we're planning to to move forward because it's true that regard name is the front-runner and is ready to go and probably next year very soon we'll have it in first patients those that's what we hope but what can we do to create that pipeline that Scott was mentioning now that we have a platform that can accommodate multiple drugs now the the next need is to fill a pipeline where we can actually create more drugs opportunity so new drug testing so we want other drugs in clinics for nf2 and how do we make sure we have a pipeline of option first of all CTF is looking at different opportunities we launched recently request for application or RFA for new nf2 drug testing proposal and funded three groups recently one is the group of junior mesh it must shoot at MGH where she's actually taking a second look at the cenotes enough to data that contains a lot of data and there are new drugs combinations that have you know the capability to be the next drug after regarding it so this we just funded her work is gonna be testing in animal models and then if this is promising we'll make sure that you know it will get to the clinic also we are funding a group in Spain from Elizabeth Castellanos that is looking at different drugs Hunt ascends oligonucleotides these are you know innovative drugs that have promise to act differently I'm not going to the specifics but it's very interesting to see it's very early a little bit early because this is gonna be only in cells and then we will need to move it into animals and then into clinical trials but this is a completely different angle that will give us an idea on the technology and then we are also funding to linky at Georgetown University with a DDI where she is looking at a pathway called hippo Yap todd's and these inhibitors are very active for nf2 in cells and animal so she's testing specific drugs to see if the effect is what we actually hope for and that will be a smooth transition into the clinic in the next year if this is available and working in addition to this we are open for receiving other applications in our drug discovery initiative Register reports program is open we waiting for application until the end of the year and next year we also will launch new RFA or more drug testing proposal project on this part is going to be six hundred and forty thousand dollars is our fundraising target over you know the the whole initiative of the accelerator and in addition to this if you think about drugs we also want new ideas and years are coming from basic science research so we are adding to the drugs that are already there that are ready to go into animals and we are adding a component to create new discoveries to look at different mechanism to fuel new research and our Young Investigator award program is the perfect program to start these new discoveries so researchers have access to experienced enough mentors and labs to explore new science we have now opened for proposal on t-34 and what is really important it is this is the first year because of this initiative because of your support that we have an nf2 restricted budget set aside for this program of six hundred and forty thousand dollars and this is gonna fuel also the next wave of investigators for an f2 because giving a grant to a young researcher well as a very high chance that will stay in the field and you know will establish is career with working on enough to we hope so moving forward I'm going to talk about how this the other part of the proposal of the accelerator that is improved drug selection and nf2 models as you can see here the price tag that we put on is four hundred and twenty thousand dollars some of this money has already been spent for instance in large animal models for enough to and this is what I'm gonna talk next as you can see on this light there there's been some a little bit of work I would say already done by cdmrp which is the congressionally directed medical research we if I grant to University of Minnesota and recombine ethics which is a company that is specialized to create engineer mini pigs genetically engineer mini-pigs you can see here this is a mini pig the founder of an nf2 colony that has been genetically engineered to develop enough to the same way as patients are doing so this is not any artificial manipulation is is born with it as any person with an f2 and Marco Jovic Nene has received a grant from us that is looking to see if these animals will develop nf2 and is going to use this to understand etiology disease develop in the progression and the application of novel imaging and monitoring technique as you know as finds and mini pigs are the most they're very they're closer in terms of you know to the physiology of humans more than you know mouse or a mice or rats that are normally used for you know drug testing so this this new model will definitely help us to close the gap and maybe have better model to to test those you know do new testing and the other things that we're trying to do is to increase the testing capacity for nf2 drugs what we see is that you know there are sometimes there is it takes a very long time to create the opportunity for companies but also for other researchers to access and f2 models I met myself we are receiving a lot of calls nowadays from companies but also from other researchers drugs and sometimes this models are you know exchanged or you know this contract that needs to be done they're not as easy as you know we would like to be so we are working with way club and other experts and of two experts to create these models and make it available for everybody who wants to test a drug for enough to I think this should not be the bottleneck the bottleneck has to be the number of ideas that we have but not the models that are available to test that idea so is mainly for different ages we are the first stage of generating the models and then we'll move to validate the phenotype establishing a testing protocol and keep colonies alive and available for those who want access to them all so that will create opportunity for everybody to test new drugs and then it brings me to the NF to gene therapy I am my pleasure to introduce you to Michael wooden is think the CEO of nf2 therapeutics I can introduce himself it's it's been a great pleasure we've been working with Michael since many years we also have a collaboration for an f1 and Michael I will leave this light on and you can talk through the project undertaking thank you very much salvo so this is Mike wooden I am the CEO of nf2 therapeutics and the company was founded by three individuals myself Scot Plotkin who you've already heard from and Mark de Souza as salvo mentioned the three of us founded another company called inflection therapeutics in inflection is focused on nf1 and inflection is developing a topical mek inhibitor for cutaneous neurofibromas in nf1 and has moved very quickly in in that development program will be in the clinic in 2020 with trials in in that program so we're very excited to be focused on nf2 and the NFP therapy program builds on some work that was previously funded by the Children's Tumor Foundation and that previous work we were looking at if we using brute force restored the NF to protein if we restored Merlin to Anna cellular model of the disease could we restore function and we worked with dr. Helen Morrison and what she was able to demonstrate in her lab was that if the Merlin protein was restored function what's stored in a cellular model of the disease and so that was a very exciting discovery and it was the basis for the gene therapy program that we are undertaking I'm getting some feedback can people hear me okay yes Michael you've come across very clearly okay thank you so the the focus of nf2 therapeutics is to develop a disease modifying gene replacement therapy for nf2 and we are developing an AAV based gene therapy which will restore Merlin and essentially the for folks who may not be familiar with gene therapy what gene therapy does is hijack a virus and engineer that virus so that it's normal behavior of infecting cells is leverage but rather than taking over the cell enforcing a cell to produce copies of itself the virus takes over the cell and forces the cell to produce copies of a protein of interest in this case the Merlin protein and the gene therapy is a a V based a a V stands for adeno-associated virus and the reason for that is that a a V based gene therapies have been in a number of approved therapies and they have been safe and effective so they have not had significant toxicities associated and they have been disease-modifying so life-changing for the therapies where they have been approved another sort of attractive factor of these is that they don't incorporate themselves into the genome of the individual so they don't modify the the genetic material in the in the patient's genome they will not be passed down to subsequent generations they the the virus attaches it to the cell it is taken up by the cell and then the genetic material goes to the nucleus of the of the cell but it does not incorporate itself into the the chromosomes of the of the cell and so our our current activity we are synthesizing vectors and we will by the end of the year have the the the vectors that so the the virus with the payload that we intend to deliver and we have two studies that we are planning for 2020 one is a non-human primate study and so that study will be in seinem august macaques so in monkeys and the reason to work in monkeys is that with gene therapy it's important to have a model that is close to humans and some of the other model systems that have been used in other research programs don't translate well to the human experience for gene therapy the way that non-human primates do so that's that's the rationale for that study and and the the non-human primate study is really going to be looking at a number of things one is toxicity and first of all toxicity of the virus and I should say that one of the other appealing factors of the AAV virus and why it's used for gene therapy is it doesn't it doesn't create illness in humans so humans can be infected by the virus but there isn't a there's not a disease associated with the virus and however for approval and to develop a new drug you have to demonstrate that there is no toxicity associated with the virus and so that's the purpose of this study we'll also be able to understand if there is toxicity associated with the overexpression of the protein so will will have over expression of the Merlin protein and we'll be able to understand the impact of the in the non-human primate study as well as the bio distribution of the AAV and specifically if we are seeing transduction in the cells of interest and that's really what's vital is that we confirm that the virus is being taken up by the cells of interest so that we know that we are getting that the protein into the cells of interest so that we can restore function the the second study that we're planning for 2020 is a mouse study and this is a transgenic Mouse it will be in the lab of dr. marcoh giovannini and in that study we'll also be looking at toxicity in bio distribution because the his his model is a disease model of nf2 we will also be looking at tumor regression so we're very excited to to be embarking on this work and love to have any any questions that folks have about the gene therapy program we do have questions that go back to the cenotes earlier but um if anyone has any questions for Michael please do type them in okay I see one from Tony Pendleton in addition to looking at restoring Merlin function has anyone looked at the 2011 study missense mutations in the nf2 gene result in the quantitative loss of Merlin protein and minimally affecting intrinsic function that's 32 different molecules that significantly increased Merlin a flight slowed the degradation of Maryland yes Scott I don't know if you're still on with us if that's one that you want to speak to oh okay good I can unmute myself yeah thank you so I'm trying to remember off the top of my head that manuscript and and a half to admit I don't I'm certainly happy to look at it I guess Mike my first thought is just to say that there are many many approaches one could take to restoring gene function or protein function and I think at this age we wanted to take the approach that we thought was the most likely to lead to information that would be helpful there are many ongoing gene therapy programs where replacement is the goal such as an SMA or in hemophilia and so we wanted to take what we thought was the least risky most likely path to get an answer so I can look back in that 2011 study but that was at least my rationale and might feel free to add if you want but that's how I think about it yes certainly a the you know relative to small molecules the development time lines have demin tended to be longer with gene therapy development and we certainly our strategy is is to take a a path that gives us the best chance of getting something that would be clinically relevant as as quickly as possible and it's got feel free to to add in any other thoughts just on the overall gene therapy program I thought you did a great job so I mean really great let's see if there's more questions I'm looking at this thought Anja Toni responded said thank you for the answer one of the molecules was a naturally derived botanical quercetin yeah I would like to see more replication of that data before we would put in a big effort but I know I know what you talk about now I'm gonna look it up so this is Annette maybe maybe one reply to the imitation paper is that although those are things that we don't know right if you have a functional or a non-functional Merlin what we did see though and that was kind of the study that Michael was talking about earlier to our joy if you re Express Merlin in the Schwann cells that are null or so are not having functional Merlin we did see a serious reduction in growth so that gave us confidence that potential in re expressing Merlin would be a good strategy to stop the growth of the schwannomas question from Barbara Franklin will this approach work for all mutation types splice site nonsense etc so again that's a great question from a very smart person good job Barbara and so I think that's gonna be part of the development so just to reframe that question when you if the goal is to replace the protein you know the gene and then the protein it assumes that the tumors lacked the protein and there are certain genetic alterations like missense alterations where that may or may not be true and I think that the way that we're approaching this is to take again the most implica proach instead of trying to get in all its complexity which is to take a situation where there is we think defective protein and then put the gene back in and ensure that that works and then then identify the subgroups that are most likely to respond and there's a lot of questions about them so to put this in larger and the bigger perspective to my knowledge nobody has done gene replacement therapy in a tumor syndrome if you think about hemophilia as an example hemophilia is a genetic condition where people are born lacking the ability to produce certain clotting proteins that are made by the liver and that these individuals with hemophilia bleed spontaneously and historically we've helped these individuals by providing these clotting factors back into their bloodstream through blood transfusions and so replacing that protein was straightforward because you the cells need about 7 or 10 percent of normal levels to have clotting ability if you think about NF too now we know that individuals are born with one normal copy of the NF 2 gene and one not normal copy and tumors are the instance and we're both copies we believe are lost in the majority of cases with little or no NF to protein are the problem is we've had technical challenges and measuring protein levels exactly with themselves that is NF to protein Merlin in cells and so replacing that the key thing here at this stage is to show that if you can reintroduce the NF to gene what is the effect on tumors that do they disappear do they stop growing we don't know the answer yet and that's the that's the initial studies that Michael was talking about was getting this proof-of-concept in place that will enable us to question from Michael sky what kinds of research do you envision occurring as a result of youth investigator initiative strictly clinical research or more broad research on NF across the lifespan such as a qualitative study about therapeutics it's for you guys right is this for the young investigator so the young investigator Awards are normally looking at new novel idea in basic science and this is where we are focusing instead so basically looking at lines developing new way to you know solve the problem of NF to for instance identifying a new pathway or identifying new modality to do it and then the other approach we are taking is to create and the conditions to have multiple drug access the platform that Scott was mentioning so front-loading the clinical pipeline with more drugs and this is what we need to do that is a lot of preclinical studies and this is the other part of the you know the three proposal that I already mentioned we are going to fund plus you know the new proposal that we are going to fund in the future and we have to Borgata nib questions which I'm going to toss out here and then we'll also just keep in mind it's 9:30 we have we still have most of the groups though listening in so thank you everyone for hanging in with us tonight so we have a question from an anonymous person asking how our participants being selected for the Borgata net trial through the NF registry or does the site choose or are there other ways well it's identical to any clinical trial which is somebody has to be evaluated at a trial site so if somebody believes that they qualify they can call a trial site so let's say you live in Maine and you want to come to Mass General just using that as an example we have patients who contact us and say oh I heard about this trial can we you know be evaluated sometimes physicians will contact a trial site and say I have a patient that I would like you to evaluate so it's very open we do want to when the time is right in the trials open we'll need to basement heavily get the word out to patients and clinicians and so forth question from Tony Pendleton was the research completed by sonidos on the use of forgotten had published was tumor shrinkage shown in animals question mark in vs question mark in men G meningioma question mark I can't find anything on PubMed yeah that's right so a manuscript is complete and in the final edits are happening so I would say that it should be soon to be submitted but it does take a while from submission to acceptance so you're correct is not yet published the data has been presented in in scientific forums and there has been in mouse models seeing it dependent I have to be careful how I say this because I've noticed in other mouse models but you know I shrug decrease signal associated with tumor so a shrinkage if you go by the light admitted by certain tumors compared to untreated tumors for both men and german Swannanoa so we as far as we can tell from the animal models which are not perfectly predictive very exciting question from Barbara Franklin are there any combo drugs you're considering or one than the next at this point we're considering one then the next given the complexity of combining drugs but I'm gonna tell you how Scott Plotkin feels so please take this following statement as only a personal opinion which is for some patients combining new drug with Evis ISM AB or Avastin it's a combination I've always been interested in we do not have formal plans to combine Avastin with any of these drugs but at off for my own personal interest not associated with this trial I think that's going to be something that we would be interested in down the line and then we'll take this question then we'll probably need to move to the next section from Tawney again is there a way for us to read the Branton of research now think that it's likely that the manuscript will be disseminated or made available until the publication and that's because during the this process it gets vetted by other professionals and usually no I don't think it's likely the only thing I want to mention is there is a there is a public abstract that I think is in our conference page from last year in where this presented so there is an abstract that is public and I think that's what the editor will allow as a distribution before the full publication this is available and I think there are other public abstract of presentation that scientific conferences that are available but still Scott is right and the publication will not take long to come out I'm sorry I mean yeah maybe one extra thing for what we are more than happy to put on the website is the Facebook life that jaishree Blakely did last year or a couple of months ago specifically around bracket a nip where the data came from what the whole process was of some models that has led to brick at an F how the trial looks but I can guarantee you and I think we can all guarantee you that in fact the whole synodos project has led to a lot of discussion around drugs drug combinations efficacy interpretation so it is not I just want to make sure that everybody understands that the fact that there is a delay in publication is not because the the the project has stalled it is because there is a lot of discussion ongoing and as we all know scientists are opinionated so we've had a lot of heated discussions that will only make the paper better so it's I understand that you want to read it now let's make sure maybe Simon we can look at get a facebook life on the website so people have something to look at yep so it is live will repost it because it's probably falling back as it Annette pointed out it's been a few months so I'm will repost on on our blog and on social media and we'll actually send out a link after this again not tonight but in coming days with a link to this webinar but also a link to that has forgotten it webinar so that you all can click and watch ok and I think I solved what you want to take us to the next section absolutely yes thank you so thank you to Michael Scott for you know this insightful discussion one last thing I want to add to what has been said about Brigadoon Abe is that you know the data is being already public through the NF portal so this hasn't stopped new research to be conducted on this data the data is already in you know released so if you go to en after a portal you log into the into the portal as you know and request access you can actually see the whole data already available so what we are trying to do is if those that needs to do follow-up research on this data this has already been possible since many months actually we released it probably last summer and and you know so there are new proposals that are coming follow up from you know the data like the which is proposal that we are already funding so this has not been the say hampering future research okay with that said I would like to quickly move to the next section and give you just a summary of one important date so for those of you who are you know listening and are interested in submitting proposal for all of the opportunities that I was mentioning before we have why a proposal now open for submission until January 4 2020 so if you have a postdoc or you have a pre doc student that you know you think you have a nice and have two projects you want them to work with please apply and we'll take it into consideration we have set aside a budget reserved for an f2 so we have bigger capacity than previous years because we want to focus on an f2 research and then you know a new cycle of DDI are our grants is now open until the end of December 31st all details are on the research section of the CTF dot-org website in January just for you to keep it on the rather we'll open calls for Anu drug discovery initiative collaboration with Dell open and Dell open is a problem that stands for DNA encoded libraries in collaboration with Bruschi up tech Russia is the biggest hero in the world and they agreed to give this technology or provide the technology to applicants of TDI so we launched this together all details will gonna be published very soon we announced we announced I think the collaboration a few weeks ago and details are being worked out and this call is gonna open early generally so keep an eye open and then throughout the 2020 we'll announce new funding opportunities so and with this set I'm gonna move it to you know where we stand with funding so I would like Michelle to take over from here and through Thank You Szabo and I hope everybody can hear me okay I want to thank everybody on the phone as all of you are investors in this project whether you have given a dollar whether you've raised a dollar whether you've helped just from a marketing perspective or social media perspective each and every one of you is important to are ensuring that we can move the needle for nf2 research forward so for that I thank you and I'm going to talk a little bit about our current funding thank our current funders and also let you know about what you can do so as you can see this project is 2.4 million dollar project it was launched on world and f2 Awareness Day in 2019 which is May 22nd and we were thrilled to be able to announce this Aveo webinar just as we're doing this evening and grateful that we can provide you with an update on the progress since then we have raised about a million dollars to date and that is thanks to many of you on the phone and many of your friends and many of your family members our goal is to secure the remaining 1.4 million on or before world nf2 Awareness Day May 22nd 2020 though as salvo has wonderfully outlined here we have assigned six hundred and fourteen thousand of the 1 million we still have three hundred and eighty six thousand dollars to be directed and still yet to be raised is 124 I'd like to talk a little bit about our major funders salvo I don't know if you can click on our major funders I'll start with up great so our major funders this is a snapshot many of you on the phone night not all of you but many of you who have given generously of your time your treasure and your talent to help us get to that 1 million over the course of the last six and a half months a special shout out to the Tom's family as they seed funded this project late last year early 2019 with about a half a million dollars if not more about five hundred and thirty five hundred fifty thousand and we are truly grateful to them and their vision for helping to make this project happen and as well many of you again on the phone the Morris family Carol Harrison Tala ger the brain and family the Harrison family Peggy Wallace who is instrumental in helping much of this research to take shape Suzanne Tracy Galloway who has provided $100,000 match towards this project he'll finally Rick orbits and his wife Erica Hartman forbit Horvitz the Robbins family and many many more so thank you now I'm gonna let you know what you can do to help us in raising the awareness to help us get to that 1.4 million left to raise before May 22nd 2020 so salvo I'm gonna have a go back to the main slide and go to be what you can help us what you can do so in terms of next steps we have created an external nf2 accelerator campaign committee I want to thank John Morris and RB Harrison both of whom are on the phone this evening and both of whom are nf2 parents for agreeing to be the co-chairs for this committee and there are a number of our committee members or people members of our community who have agreed to be committee members as well including Tracy Galloway Edith Garrett Laura and Ron Levine lipof and Rowland Tom's as well so I want to thank everybody currently the accelerator campaign committee what we'll be doing is really helping us look at strategies for fundraising but also how we can mark it and do outreach to the nm2 community to keep them apprised of what we were doing on the research side they want to make sure that we're shouting from the rooftops the successes that are happening in the nf2 community cts successes everybody else successes we can't do this without you and we need your help to make sure that we're reaching out to the community to let them know what's but how can you help us do that um you can make a donation at CTF or slash end nf2 is open to make any a donation of any size whether that is one dollar or whether that is a million dollars or anywhere in between we also have the ability for our constituency to create a friends-and-family campaign we will create a website for you that you can then use to send out to your friends and family to help to raise more money the host a Facebook fundraiser we know these are incredibly successful two of our constituents just raised fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars during their birthday fundraisers submit your Energon story to CTF - or tell your story we want to make sure that we can talk about NF - and talk to our patient stories they're so inspiring and they help others know that they're not alone we post a lot of stories and updates on our social media platforms make sure you're following us on Facebook and on Twitter and on Instagram and on LinkedIn and repost what you read from us host an event could be a dinner between friends it could be a cultivation event it could just be an awareness fund to make sure that people know about CTF make sure they know about NF and nf2 specifically be one of our advocates we have a patient engagement program which Tracy Andros leads talk to myself or anybody on the phone tonight any of the staff members that you work with find out how you can be more involved in the patient engagement and learn how you can help us in terms of reviewing research that's being that'd staff a table at an NF clinic we have a wonderful volunteer out in California who actually staffs a clinic once a month at UCLA we can do more of that if you're free let us know we'd happy to connect you with Heather on our NF clinic team and to be sure that we can work with our and up clinics to have a table it's a great way for us to make sure that we're reaching more patients and then again ensuring that I feel as if they you being with family and not alone again talking to other patients and other family members and participating in our NF Awareness Month in May we do an amazing shine a light program which is not just our walks but they are our ability to raise awareness and make our cities and our major monuments go blue and green if you're interested in learning more talk to me talk to Simon and of course there are so many other ways to participate and raise money for energy research whether that is through a walk or a special event or doing a DIY event creating something of your own the sky's the limit in terms of what we can do again I want to thank you if you've raised a dollar you've given a dollar you've helped us raise awareness you're investing in this program and as one of our major supporters said recently and I'm not a researcher we have researchers on the program tonight who will be finding those cures but your dollar may be the dollar that absolutely helps us find that cure so you want to thank you you can email me or call me my email and my phone number is at the bottom of this slide and I look forward to hearing from all of you on how you'd like to help and get more involved any other questions from folks I'm sorry not to go ahead yeah no I just wanted to make one general observation one of the biggest problems so I was in China last year to talk about the Children's Tumor Foundation and about an F in general there is about a half million patients in China that have an F I visited two three or four clinics that see NF patients and that was for a total of I estimated about 3,000 patients what they told me there is that the biggest problem is that people do not know what and see what an F is and I think raising awareness and making sure that everybody knows what an F is will automatically raise our funds for all the funders that are funding NF research but I think our biggest enemy these days is that people do not know what an F is so shout it out over the roof that the world knows what an F is so we can get the word down this is my plea for the night if anyone has any questions please feel free to type them in or if anyone would actually like to speak just let us know in the chat function or I think there's a thing called raise your hand you can click that and we'll just give it a few minutes to see if anyone would like to I know it's easier to speak sometimes than to type in if anyone would like to do that please let us know so we just got to thank you from Shawnee thank you Tony okay we'll give it another 30 seconds or so John Morris no questions nice job thank you thank you John will give another 20 25 seconds for anyone has anything they'd like to say or if they'd like to be unmuted we're happy to do that so maybe I'm Simon I received one question on how the foundation decides on which and if two initiatives will be included or not and that is in fact a very it's a great question it is really driven by the NF research and clinical community what we found so what we really for example for cenotes for NF - we posted our observation that the patients were confused that certain drugs were reported to work and other drugs were reported to not work so we just threw that out way of speaking on the websites and asked the research community to come up with a great idea to tackle that problem and that is then where Scotland jaishree and waits and Jim gazella came out of the woods assembled a team to really tackle that problem and that is what led to Brie gotten it into some other drugs that are upcoming the Young Investigator Awards drug discovery initiative are all driven by the community the also the NF - gene therapy was of course something we threw out there a couple of years ago saying this is really working for other rare diseases what about NF and f1 is such a big gene that that is going to be complicated for replacement therapy but NF 2 is doable so can somebody come up with an idea so just to say we just throw out what we think is important and then we let the research community through out their best ideas they get then subsequently peer reviewed by the best and brightest specialists in the world they can really assess and select the best initiatives and then the other the studies that will be funded so it's really a process of peer review initiatives us just throwing out problems rather than answers okay I'm not seeing any other questions so with that I think we would come to the close of this webinar thank you everyone for participating thank you for being patient while we were worked up that kink so if any one salvo Scot and that Michael if anyone has anything else they'd like to close that on now thank you everybody for you know being patients and stay with us tonight I hope this was useful and looking forward to the next update Michelle anything from you that should not be muted okay anyone else well maybe one thing is that if for a next webinar there are certain things that people really want us to talk about or tackle please let us know because we are just informing you of what we are doing for the moment and how we are making progress towards ending NF 2 which is the obsession that I think we all have on the phone tonight but if there are certain specific topics you would be interested to hear about we can absolutely adapt webinars to to your require to your request yes that's excellent yes so if you have ideas they can feel free to reach out to anyone that was on this call or most easily if you don't know our email address it's a info at CTA org and we'll make sure that your your ideas your questions your requests get forwarded to the right folks at the foundation or where as part of our partnership teams I think that may be it thank you everyone as we said earlier this has been recorded in the coming days we will send a email to you all letting you know where it's been posted and then we would encourage you to share it with our the community as a net said before we need to spread the word with that thank you everybody and have a good night
