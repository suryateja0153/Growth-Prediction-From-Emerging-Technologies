 So first of all I'd like to give you a little bit of my background. I have been in the pharmaceutical industry for 26 years and I have been associated with Penn in some teaching function or some laboratory function since 1978. 1988 1978 I was in the clinical laboratory. I'm a microbiologist a bacteriologist slash virologist by trade and by background and  I got my PhD from Penn and I have been-- I was in charge--I've been in charge of the tuberculosis laboratory and back in nineteen years-- (overlapping voices) I thought somebody was trying to ask me something. I have been in charge of the tuberculosis library from 1978 to 1981 and-- (overlapping voices) After that in 1988 I became part of the faculty and have kind of been on ever since and until I became an emeritus just recently. So, this is how we're going to do it today. I gave my little introduction, I've done lots of other things besides science but one thing you can also understand from me--one thing you can also understand from me is that I have-- like I said I've done a lot of other things I can share with you later about besides some science. And I will give you one thing I like to do is keep track of the recent drug approval updates because I like to look at trends and where people are doing their research and where the jobs are for the young people that I talk to people graduating from college and people in college who need internships. And I have been successful in placing some people so that helps me that's what my trans information is really for and so we also look at initial public offerings I'll explain to you what those are in the different therapeutic areas so that we can see the trends that people are interested in. We'll have a discussion of of different theories possibly the ecological impact which is the most important thing to me I'm an ecologist uh my background too uh and then I'm going to at the end um hopefully this will take about a half hour or so with the slides and then at the end i'm going to talk about the penn experience and how you can make the best of the four years uh three or four years whichever or even five that you plan to to spread your education out over and then we can have a Q and A. I want to first explain to you what the uh discovery process is like in the pharmaceutical industry. And let's see if you can see my--can you see my little cursor there my little pointer? I'm going to go to laboratory discovery that's the first step in looking for a new drug and um and also after you get it after you look at thousands and thousands of leads in laboratory discovery then you go to pre-clinical research now clinical research complete pre-clinical research the word clinical just means that it's in a human so if it's pre-clinical that means it has not had a human it has not been yet any human. So there's pre-clinical research and then after you've done the lab and pre-clinical research which usually is about a three at least a three-year period then you can file for an investigational new drug or an IND. It goes down there there see and then then you're in the human being from now on. And phase one is where you give it to healthy human volunteers and see just nobody's going to have any drastic terrible reactions either in their either in their entire body or in their tissues and then if that if you pass that that's usually a small group of people like around 40 to 50 people and um if you pass phase one and then go to phase two phase two is a group of people that have the specific disease that you're looking for. So if you're looking at chronic obstructive pulmonary disease you're looking specifically at people that have that disease and then if you do well in phase two which knocks most drugs out phase two is the first really big failure point and if you get past that then you go to phase three which means that your drug which has promise not only uh goes into people that have the disease chronic disruptive pulmonary disease but people that have all kinds of other things so now you're in the hodgepodge now we are trying to cure that specific disease with the background of a lot of other types of sicknesses and people taking other types of drugs which can really mess things up and can really uh mean vicious challenges for your drug okay. So now uh by the time you've gotten done all that you're at about eight to ten years at least maybe sometimes twelve years and once you announced your product that you're going to go forward with on your IND your patent starts and your patent lasts for only 20 years on on your drug and so after that patent starts you've gone through all these phases you might be 12 years into your process and you've eaten up 12 years of your 20-year patent so that means you're only going to have eight years to try and recoup the investigation of the expenses of that drug so um anyway so that's that's why it's a time labor process and it after so many decades and using up so many possible leads the industry finally said you know i'm not only doing this but the smaller companies like the small biotechs and all if you look to the bottom they're going through the same process so maybe i don't have to go through this process with every drug i'll just come i'll just look at some of these smaller companies and see if they have a promising drug that's in phase one or phase two and i'll just buy it from them and start from there if it has promise well um so that meant that instead of everybody doing r d over here in the large industry that they would also um they would uh allow people to have a job of looking around the world and see who was in phase one or phase two or even pre-clinical research for the kind of drug that they were looking for and they would buy it from them or buy the company or what have you some people wouldn't want to sell their company even though maybe the the pharmaceutical industry was offering them 500 million dollars for it or um or even a billion dollars for it some people want to stick that out in the company and other people are looking to exit they're looking to sell their drug and go on and do something else or else work for the larger company so anyway so it became customary for the r d effort to shift outside the company a bit and look at these other smaller companies and the earlier you come the earlier that you take the product from these companies you see it gets redder that means there's more risk involved some people had not so great research early on and they were trying to hide it and or some people just just didn't have the right idea so you had to be very careful the earlier you look obviously if you had somebody who wanted to give up their drug in phase three that would be the best but the earlier you looked at and if it was a good promise other companies would be looking too so become very competitive the earlier you looked the more risk you had see increasing risk to adverse unmanageable levels here and so the industry became an outside they had quite a bit of outside interest also along those lines became new trends genetic techniques etc and also most recently artificial intelligence there are now more than 100 artificial intelligence i have at this time i think there were 93 the time i made this slide but the artificial intelligence looking for drugs now uh there are now problem from well more than 100 companies uh in the united states and in the world um looking at artificial intelligence and um it turned out artificial intelligence was not great in looking at the final product necessarily but it could really help you in steps along the way if you wanted to test an antibody test that would take you normally three to four weeks this this artificial intelligence could help you do hundreds of thousands of tests on the antibody within a couple hours seriously and um then came along the replacement of animal testing that's one of the more recent trends where instead of looking at animals people wanted to look and see a way drugs were performing humans why did that happen uh not just the altruistic thing that people didn't want to you know test in animals anymore which i'm glad there's more of a feeling in that that people aren't thrilled about testing in animals and giving up animals for testing but it turned out also the animals had different ways that they metabolized drugs and different types of bone and different types of other tissues than humans did so something that they could something that looked very good in an animal sometimes a company could really get burned because when they got in the immune system didn't work quite as good and it turned out uh one study that happened like that was perfume uh perfume type substance in dogs um and uh turned out that it was just wasn't good for humans it had caused some reactions and stuff so uh but there there's all kinds of ways that people have gotten burned just for looking at animal data and trying to make predictions off of it so um a place called emulate which is a spin-off of the wiss institute in boston came along with something called tissue on the slide an organ in the chip things like that where they can make a little uh technological piece of equipment that would predict exactly how human systems would react and the fda is actually looking at that as a possible test mechanism so there's their new areas and genetics has just exploded as you can imagine i want to just tell you the kind uh two types of terminology that you're going to uh hear off and on as you read articles and i'll tell you which sites uh at the end i'll tell you which sites are the best to really to really keep up with the pharmaceutical industry but there are nces new chemical entities or what we call small molecules you'll see in the literature uh people talking about small molecules that's a new compound from chemical sources with a fixed molecular structure and you can duplicate it and the only thing you have to do is before you can get money from it is wait till the patent runs out and then you have the duplication is called a generic so you know there are lots of generics now and that is really uh the generics as you'll see have really taken over this industry in a lot of ways um but uh at least in terms of some numbers of compounds then there are biologics or large molecules antibodies and proteins uh that so other proteins so that they're very large literally they're large molecules and the protein is usually from a living source and it cannot exactly be duplicated and the reason why it cannot exactly be duplicated is because one of the reasons why one of the key reasons is because there are so many steps in duplicating that protein and the pharmaceutical industry put their heads together on this one and they said they started patenting certain steps each step so you can't make that molecule through the same process that they did so you would have to go around it and hopefully get something that's close enough so um since you had to go for something that was similar enough and had similar activity they called them instead of generics with large molecules they call them biosimilars and this is one area that you're going to hear of in the 20s that's going to be huge it already has been huge um but they tend to be very expensive molecules because of the amount of work that goes into them and they're very hard to get onto the market because um the company that has the original molecule or protein um has patented maybe nine or ten steps along the way and uh every time somebody tries to come out with a biosimilar they the company original company takes them to court and say hey you know this process over here may be all patent but this process here is not off patent and so they're able to hold them up for another couple of years and so uh usually they're monoclonal antibodies or antibody drug conjugates they're they're they've been taken from a living source okay now going back to the small molecules again um i've taken a rolling uh 10-year average if you take a if you take one year at a time you get bars that go up and down and up and down and up and down um they yield a trend but you have to look at them over large periods and so what i've done is i've taken 10-year rolling average and where you take a 10-year group and you kick out the end or you kick out the beginning and add on to the end and so so it's rolling um and it gives you a nice smooth curve as you can see it gives you almost like a growth curve and you see there was a dip uh what happened there in the early 2000s with the dip was that we began to use up targets and there just wasn't you know everybody was trying to look for something some target and they just weren't available anymore because we've already had all the drugs out look at all the drugs we've already had all the drugs out that could be applied to those targets so then with new technology and other things artificial intelligence now and all kinds of things we started to get new targets and up goes the chart again and that will happen for a while and uh so i keep looking at that to see when that starts down again you can only take so many targets before you use them up again and and you know and then you've got to use new technology and and things like that um now just to show you what things would look like if you use one year at a time see how they go up and down and up and down if you look at new products the other thing that helps the industry out a lot is that if you look at the bright blue bars at the bottom they're brand new molecules both small molecules and large molecules they're brand new molecules for that year as you can see we have 41 approvals so far in this year through august um but the other the larger the the larger bars are um are other things that you can do with that drug for example there are new formulations or um new ways of injecting them or new delivery methods other new delivery methods etc and every one of those is a new payday for the industry and so we count those too it's not just when a drug was initially brought out on the market but also these other things for example merck brought a drug out for uh cancer for uh for uh melanoma in 2014 and every year it gets two or three new cancers that the testing is completed for and so it adds up it has about 14 different cancers that it that it's effective for so uh so all these things are other ways that the pharmaceutical industry can try and reimburse the expenses men and you have to you have to understand too they have you know for 10 years of researching a drug and all the equipment and the people's salaries and the people's health care that work for them there's a lot of expenses that they have accumulated in those 10 years um now looking at the small molecules again each one of these colors is a different therapeutic area that you can see on the right here oncology neurology awesome immediately connect and um the oncology is uh the cancer oncology is the largest one that we've been successful for so far um the united states has made a commitment since the kennedy administration back in the 1960s that they would spend more money on cancer and they would uh agree to attack cancer so you see looking at the graph down here oncology is the green and if you look um it has been the occupier of of cancer of research and in fact you can see it's almost ready to break a record this year 11 and 12 were the earlier tops it's already got nine and this year this week it's going to have 10 and so we're only about two thirds of the way through the year so we're going to set a record patient cancer this year this other blue this bright blue behind it was neurology everybody got into looking for alzheimer's disease and um in parkinson's disease but so many big companies have been burned because they had a promising lead and spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on it only to see those leads fail so they've given up a little bit on neurology and farmed that out to some of the smaller companies um and one thing i want to show you um is looking at oncology uh if you look at all these are the mechanisms of actions of all the drugs that have been discovered this year and everything is one one one one one one but if you look at oncology there's one type of mechanism seven you see in there and it turns out that that green mechanism that's the signaling mechanism seven new cancer compounds this year come out which affect the signaling mechanism and i'm going to show you later on how that works i'm going to show you guys show you right now i'm just going to show you uh right now with what that uh how that mechanism uh works and then i'm going to go into detail later because it's an important mechanism you see right here these are called g protein couple of receptors these things that look like seven tubes in the rel and they have those along the membrane and when a compound hits those they send off a reaction and it goes into the this type of receptor over here often times and it signals uh certain things for the cell to do and those signals are very very important in whether a cell can turn cancerous or not once they found out there's signaling molecules there's g protein coupled receptors you can see there's six or seven companies a year that find new ways to attack cancer through those molecules this is also this receptor is important for another thing which i'm going to talk to you about a little later when we get into ecology because this receptor helps people helps humans and animals actually it's all throughout the animal kingdom um and there are some surrogates and bacteria in plants but this type of receptor is very very important all throughout the animal kingdom and it helps animals to care it's one of the receptors one of the jobs of that receptor is to help animals and people to care about other things and so we are not only one reason why i feel strongly about things the way i do in this world is we're not only able to care as a species uh and as animals as a species but we are actually hardwired to do so so don't let anybody tell you that caring is not a big deal because caring about other members of the species we're hardwired to do it and other species too and i'm going to show you that at the end that's worth sticking around for right pheromones and all those kinds of things all work off of this receptor so we'll come back to that very shortly um now the monoclonal antibodies the large molecules even with those and you can see those are those have caught on recently but even news you can see cancer oncology again it monopolizes that the gray in here which is also important is the anti-inflammatory things like arthritis multiple sclerosis and that kind of thing so those are important with molecules monoclonal antibodies also um and this is just a list of the drugs that have been approved this year the brand new drugs and uh what you can see that's very interesting if you um i'm just going to tell you about this because it takes a lot of looking but they're very smaller they're smaller companies awesome often trevina dr reddy's labs aztecs farm cosmo technology ultragenics so the smaller groups with that new technology have been able to to nab things and you can see it over here with the market cap those that are not in red are small companies okay and these are the diseases and there's a lot of offshoot diseases not big ones but some things like uh duchenne muscular dystrophy spinal muscular atrophy here's one acute pain it's the recent opioid that's been um it's been on added on to the market and i'll tell you about that a little bit because i'm writing a paper on that um and then i have also here the large molecules the by three bio assemblers this year which are having trouble taking off in america because the big companies are fighting them with their patents but in europe you see it's a different story um there's a different patent system and um different rules for their drugs there and um and then there's some other uh large molecules uh down here this is one i wanted to talk to about going into business and you suddenly take a couple of your colleagues when you're ready to get out of pen and say hey look we can do these things we can we can uh do some proteomics we're pretty good at uh gene stuff and all that kind of stuff why don't we start a company and um you know we can get some targets to go after and a lot of people take that and not only people in college but people who are in their 60s and 70s that retire and say hey let's start our own company let's do it and so what you have to do is you have to get funding because it's expensive lab equipment is expensive renting laboratory space is expensive so the first thing you do um there are three sources that you can go to crowdfunding um when you're familiar with crowdfunding where somebody gets a get something on the computer and says please donate to this i'm going to start this and so um so crowdfunding is one thing angels are another thing and angels are little companies that give up to three to five hundred thousand dollars so but that could be as you know as you'll find out three to five hundred thousand dollars can be eaten up very quickly but angels are very good to help you get started and then the last resort that you have is the triple f over here of that theft which means uh these are the these are the ones you can turn to family friends and fools okay that's a little acronym that we use with people starting families friends and fools that invest their money in and somebody's idea and uh so these are the three sources you can use but then when you get some excitement when you get a lead and you're in the early stage then venture capitalists start looking at you and they're talking about series a here which can be 30 to 40 million dollars now we're talking because you've probably hired about 10 people very expensive nothing eats up money like people don't you fire far probably hired about 10 people you've got big sequencers and all these other things that are that are eating up money and you've got all kinds of things that you have to do raw materials that you have to get from the resources so um so uh 40 to 50 million dollars will hold you for a little while but if your idea looks like it's going to take off remember somebody's watching you the pharmaceutical companies in the area say hey you know how much you want for that compound i'll take it off your hands and bring it over to my area and so not everybody goes through b c and d some of them just go through series a and then the company either merges with them buys them out buys the compound uh whatever you know you've decided to do and that's a very wealthy payday um some people get out at that point and some people stay in and say well let's see what else i can get um but that's how it goes and when you finally if you finally said wait a minute i'm going to hold on to my idea i'm going to start a company and i'm going for a big area here i'm going for the big bucks and i'm going for i want to build a company of 100 people or a couple hundred people or maybe a thousand people and so you offer stock in your company ipo an initial public offering that's the very first public offering of your stock and so that's what that's what uh that's when you're in the big time now you've got the public trying to fund you and if you don't have an idea if your idea is not going to work the analysts and the public find out real fast and start dumping your stock but whenever you have an initial public often i make offering i make notice of that and i've been doing that since 2016. and this is just 2020 okay and um you can see first of all i do couple things i do location and i do break down to this right down to the city and um but california and massachusetts are the two biggest areas where new biotechnology companies form you can see this year 17 and 14. 17 in california 14 in massachusetts and it's neck and neck between those two states every year and so um those are so if i know that there's a new company forming that way i tell students about it so upon graduation so they can jump in and get a head start you know ahead of other people that might be looking around the country and you can see pennsylvania just has two right now the reason why california and massachusetts um are so often front of everybody is they have built a society almost they they have resources and they have you know all kinds of investments going in there so they built campuses of companies um uh in in california massachusetts they might have uh 300 companies on a campus and that kind of thing and so they've they've culturalized it they've got they've got a biotech culture in san francisco in cambridge massachusetts and other places throughout the state so that's why they're off ahead of everybody and hell by the way these greens cancer see that see how many ten companies were formed so so far this year on cancer um and if i look at just this year and and the timing you know here you got the months of the year but then i keep the previous years like i said i've been doing this since 2016. i keep the previous years and you can see cancer as the years go by and cancer's going to set a record this year and new companies so it's not just new compounds it's new companies okay and if you took that green at the bottom and made a graph just to the cancer just to the green you can see how it's going up and this year by the way this week i haven't had a chance to get it on yet this morning there's going to be 19 this morning and so we're gonna we're going to break the record um and if you put it in a pie chart i always liked pie charts when i was in uh uh college in in high school because i was getting hungry you know pie charts made me think of food anyway um but i always liked pie and shorts it always helped me to visualize things nicely and uh if you look at here you can easily see the cancer is dominating where the new companies are going in 2020 and it has been that way recently so some trends from this part of the database uh and i'm finished with that part of the database right now and i'm going to say number one there's a surge in ipos you know i know that for the individual worker life has not been easy at this particular time of the year but there are a lot of new companies being formed and um biotech companies are replacing aspects of big pharma r d the new chemical entities are high but from smaller companies and a wealth of funding from 2018 on into biotech from ventura capital oncology research cancer research is very high now there's more than a hundred artificial intelligence companies in biotech and then there's organ on a chip trying to replace animals and testing which is a good thing okay and now i'm going to go back to this receptor i promised you about a little bit um tell you just a little bit about this because this is the most important receptor i think that we have in our bodies and like i say this is involved in signaling and i'm going to talk to you about ecology a little bit and taking things from the environment taking signals from the environment not only do we do that at humans we do that as humans and other members of the ecosystem do that as animals and um and plants even too because um well plants don't use this specific receptor but all animals do and humans do um of course we are an animal but uh looking at the g protein couple receptors um let me give you an example of how this does something for in the environment say you've got an olfactory cell remember the olfactory tissue in your nose that's involved with smell dogs are the best in that one um but let me uh show you how this cell works in a human so this is one cell looking at one olfactory cell and um you may have 25 000 g protein couple receptors on the membrane of this one cell say let's say for that we've got uh 25 000 and in some case that's even a low number um now on saturday evening you and your body say well let's go out and let's have you know let's have a good time and uh we'll we'll see who we can meet and all that kind of stuff and so the guy gets in the car guy goes to pick up his buddy the guy gets in the car and he's got tons of aftershave on okay and the guy driving says whoa man how much aftershave did you put on um but it hits seem that way um because the guy has 25 000 deep protein couple receptors and is on factory cell whole factory cell uh taking in that in so but after a while after just a few minutes the guy driving the car doesn't even notice it anymore he doesn't smell it anymore because what happens is the g protein couple receptors sent this signal to the nucleus which sent it to the brain and back and instead of 25 000 receptors on this cell it downloads them off of the cell and now you've only got about 5 000 up there and all the rest have been pulled into the cell some of them have been broken down and some of them have been waited to recycle but uh 20 000 receptors have been pulled in off of the over the cell and that's what happens that's you know the same way somebody gets into the car with a lot of perfume when i was working my way through college i worked in an oil refinery and the petroleum smell the carbon the biocarbon smell and the oil refinement you know it's very wicked when you first get in there but 10 minutes you didn't even notice it anymore you could work there all day all week you know because you didn't notice it coming in and out of there because your this cell was kind enough to downgrade the number of receptors your brain says you know you don't need that many receptors that's a pretty strong molecule so they downloaded the number of receptors and now you're used to it you know and that you just try that sometimes that it smells only one of the things it works with it also works with um pheromones your sexual drive it also works with various chemicals and biochemicals that um you know that your body needs but it look it seeks out the environment and sees what's in the environment and your environment could be just this room okay um but a lot of things happen on the basis of those receptors one of the most prominent one of the most not predominant but i'd say one of the most important g protein couple receptors that people that become a household word almost because they've destroyed some families they've destroyed some people and destroyed some communities here in philadelphia and that is the mu opioid receptor is a g-protein double receptor and there are various kinds of that and you know people have been trying to look at things that would compete with this re compete with the opioids for this type of receptor and they have found some and that's why some people you know you'll get that drug when you see somebody has passed out on the street you come up and give them that drug and it saves their life uh from an overdose and because you're you're given their g protein double receptors uh they're given competition to the opioid drug and um so that's a very important one but there's a bunch like that and um you know this is the receptor that looks at the environment and makes you care especially prominent in dogs and cats and other animals but you know humans uh we have it too and so we are cis we are capable of caring and reacting to our environment okay we are capable of doing not only are we capable of doing it we are hardwired for we we've got the goods to do that okay that's why i know we can care as a species because we got the goods okay and uh so i wanted to um another thing about the environment um uh this is called a web of causation which you know if you think about things if you ever have some extra credits to take and you want to take an ecology course because that's the thing that is pressing this planet right now and everything works off ecology it can be the ecology of a school it can be ecology of a of a group that works together in a lab it can be um ecology of a little pond um or it can be the ecology of your gut your your intestine and that's what happens with uh um with certain diseases where you know you'll take one drug for something else and you'll get a diarrhea because the the flora the microflora of your intestine has been changed and you can't change one thing in an ecosystem without uh changing other things you cannot one thing where you know you've got an ecosystem is because you can't change something in the ecosystem without changing something else and so what you do whenever you've got an issue or a problem or a paper to write you look at the problem like this right here this is called a web of color causation it was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by mcmahon and pew of harvard and um what they what they do is they take an issue and then they look at uh what affects that issue now there are some webs like this and you can see them all you got to do is go on in google and put web of causation and they'll show you different forms but um there are some like this that the closer you get to the issue the more important the box is that was not mcmahon and pew's web of causation their web of causation was to take everything in the environment make sure you've got everything in the environment put it on the screen and give them equal weight and then you can decide as you sift through it which things were important because the important thing could sometimes be out here and you weren't looking for it okay so that's the mcmahon and pew web of causation and if you change one of these boxes you change other things and so that's that's what um that's what this is and you go to write a paper um and if a professor sees something like this he will say well i know one thing he certainly has thought out the problem he certainly has thought about the problem and you can even take one box and talk about it versus another uh you know and take then take another box and talk about it or um your professor can say to you this is really fascinating and i see you've looked at this but how about this over here have you tried there because he's been in the field longer and he can help you so the web of causation is very important to get to know i think it's helped me it's how i looked at my opioid what i'm doing with these two other professors um that are working on this and also i'm looking at another thing with uh g protein couple receptors of course um looking at an environment but uh important thing to remember about environments you can't change one thing without changing other things in the environment you can't do that and so if you think um if you think you're going to uh litter without um changing other things in the planet not gonna happen let me tell you something about new viruses we're almost done here so we've got a good good amount of time uh let me tell you something about new organisms in the environment because that's how a glaxosmithkline that's how we used to look for new antibiotics was take take soil out of the environment there are bacteria and viruses in the environment all the time that are just there they're okay you know and but they're one mutation one mutation away from becoming something really bad so you taking your throat plastic bottles in the environment and that kind of thing not only are they going to plug things up and and cause floods and stuff but aside from that stuff leeches out of those bottles out of the plastic and now the other materials that are in paper and all that stuff leaches out of there it turns out to be a mutagen for some bacterium that would normally not be you you wouldn't worry about it all and you know so you get new viruses and new bacteria spun off all the time um you get some protective ones spun off too but you get new ones spun off all the time people say where the heck did testing come from well you know you got to learn to take care of your planet and keep your environment clean okay i always tell people you know you wouldn't have people come into your house and when they finished a candy bar they would throw the wrapper down on the floor you wouldn't want that it's the same thing in the in the environment you can't throw things out the car window and expect nothing to happen you know this is your home this is your planet and this planet has really been abused these past few decades really really been abused and uh it doesn't have much more left to to be abused i mean the audubon people here told me that in 10 years we will have one-third of the species of birds in pennsylvania that we do today so we are abusing the daylights out of this planet and we're not going anywhere soon as far as finding a new planet to live on okay so we gotta you gotta think about the environment and get people get other people to think about the environment in this planet and that's especially true because if you look at the way our population grows uh here's a neat chart that i got from the census bureau from 1ad uh you can see how long it took to get a billion people okay and then 2 billion and then 3 billion and look at the change in years how quickly it happens by 2023 we should be up at 8 billion and i took this off of the census thing myself on friday this is friday afternoon we had seven billion six hundred thousand people uh in the uh in the world and we had 330 million people in the united states and um uh every time every time somebody says hi to me you know i mess up my account i have to start all that now i'm just kidding of course i got this um the census bureau has a has a chart that turns over all the time and you can get it at any given second and see what the what the population is so um uh just don't forget you know you've got a lot of people to convince and you've got a lot of people to get fed and um it all works off of the environment um and you're going to learn about things at penn that will help you do that and in fact environmental engineers are becoming a new area of workers that are getting pretty good salaries i want to tell you look into environmental engineering sometime so your future is really quite bright especially when we get over the virus thing maybe next semester you'll be all back here you've got a world full of opportunities you'll have personalized medicine where you can take a person's immune system and adapt it you can work with their genes you can work with proteins and always remember one thing the plan with the ecosystem in mind um because it doesn't help you come out with new things and perturb what's already there and send it into haywire you know and i can give you lots of examples if you haven't had enough i can give you more examples when it happens especially with microbiology and and with medicine i can i can tell you um and with that i'd like to say uh uh welcome to pen um you've got a lot of opportunity for careers in science and um i would say and come on now um and and uh show me your face because uh i'm going to i'm going to give you some pointers on on getting through here we've got some time and uh i can tell you by some of the mistakes that i made when i was an undergraduate in college and one thing you've got to do is make your time at penn count okay thank you javier for coming on make your time at penn count and um and start in right away the best thing you can do in college is starting right away and my freshman year i remember you know you have a tendency to put some things off but you've got to start in studying right away remember in high school where you said um teacher said to you this paper will be due on october 20th and so now you didn't know a lot at that particular time but you knew one thing october 19th was going to be bad okay the night of october 19th was going to be awfully bad you know don't let that happen in college okay when somebody gives you a paper you start in right away make sure it's something that if you can choose the topic that you like and there usually will be a chance to choose the topic make sure it's something that you like so you can start looking at it right away and make your causal web do whatever and you'd be surprised what'll come out of that and you won't have everything to do at the last minute and the other thing that you can do um along those lines um now that you don't have i know you don't have the chance to rub elbows with each other because some of you are talking from home in different parts of the country and different parts of the world actually um but what you can do you see this technology that we're using now and i've done this before in fact i did that with that with uh that cell with the receptors on it you know you can get interest groups together you can get study groups together you can get all kinds of things that you can do in four or five groups of people online um you can talk about music or you can listen to music together and you can meet people um or you can um you know what i did when i was at merck actually this because uh this was kind of neat and it was just the thing it seemed like a natural thing to do thank you all for coming on and you are a great looking group and um i just i took the reset all the different receptors and you know there are lots of different receptors on on the cell i took a person who was an expert in each one of those receptors and i invited them to webinars and we had a monthly webinar group because i wanted them to learn since all the receptors talk to each other i mean just think of the cell with each one of you being a receptor all the receptors talk to each other it's an environment i called it cellular ecology because the receptors made up an environment made up an ecosystem and i said uh do you guys know how your receptors talk to each other no because they they spent so much time looking at the receptor you have to very competitive but they were fascinated by the idea this guy over here was working on a different receptor how do our receptors talk to each other and that group met monthly and uh we had people offering us money uh by the end of the thing uh societies and stuff but you can do things like that you can either take an interest group where you need to relax or you can take a group where hey um let's have a study group and you get together five people online like this and you say what did that guy mean when he said uh the cirrus principle what did he mean by that i know he tried to explain i didn't get it did you get it and you could have a statement wharton has little rooms like that where you can get together and and i'm sure other places do too where you can study well you're not going to get a chance to do that for this semester maybe but you can do it on the computer anything that you can do in person just about you can do on the computer so um you can get study groups that you formed and you can meet people you can meet each other you know and um um and then when you come back to penn be it the second semester or what have you probably um won't be hopefully won't be too much um because you know people are working on things as we speak um when you come back to penn you can say hey i'm going to look up katie that that that young lady that i used to have coffee with online i'm going to look her up and i can't wait to meet nathan because you know he you know he he was a good guy online and he kept our group moving so i'm going to look him up when i get so you've already got things you can do for the second semester when you come back on campus you're going to have friends and so yeah take down names and say hey i'm going to get your email um and um you know you can uh you could say i'm gonna get your email and would you like to be part of a study group or would you like to be part of an interest group in uh rock music or country music or whatever happens to me or would you like to be part of an interest group in philosophy or in anything um and uh and i'm having trouble with calculus um i don't know if there was ever a person born who didn't have trouble with calculus i think even isaac newton must have had trouble with i'm just kidding but um i i can't think of anybody who who uh it was just so i mean it just took me down in my freshman year i just had the worst time with calculus and so i would have given anything for a group like this to say you know i have no idea and i was good in math but calculus was just hard for me and um remember what i said for your schoolwork start in right away and come home for your cl you know you don't have to come home for your class right now but when your class is done read through your notes and print them i found even if i had the tv on when i was in my dorm or my off-campus house even if i had the tv on if i just read through my psych notes or whatever they would imprint and i could remember what i was doing or what i was seeing when you know when i saw that phrase later in a test i could remember what it was doing and so they imprint on your brain so just take five minutes before you go down to dinner and read through some of your notes or something like that or before you eat a meal and you will be amazed at the difference that makes and you you may sometimes um be able to be able to get ahead you know be it you'll be ahead by by a few days and that's helpful because you know sometimes you fall behind unnecessarily sometimes you're going along the semester and you're a couple days ahead and all of a sudden you get the flu and you know if you don't feel like looking at that stuff you know and your cumulative average is very important so you don't want it to go down so um you know at least when you lose a couple of days you'll be you know you'll be able to uh you'll be able to not be so bad off like you were if you were behind to begin with and then got sick and so you're going to have all kinds of things like that i mean some of you like i said when you come back on campus next year or maybe even in your study groups you know one thing that i found that some of you are going to fall in love you know and nothing does a number on a cumulative average like falling alone let me tell you that just destroys every year because you get weeks behind when you're pining away you're but anyway but uh but there could be all kinds of things that you're going to that you're going to get involved with during the course of semester that will interfere and maybe take you back by a couple day maybe you got to go to somebody's wedding in arkansas or something way far away and you lose two three days so it doesn't hurt to be a couple of days ahead you know and and think about the study groups think about a plan your advisor and on think about having a four-year plan that you can stick to and and see when you have some open credits and and things of that nature and make good relationships with your professors because uh you do that by working hard in his class if you're having a class that you're doing very very well in first of all it can tell you something that you're doing very very well in that class obviously you're good at it okay and so if you um if that professor comes to you know comes to respect your work um then when time comes that he's looking for a lab assistant and you need some extra money or if you're looking for an internship you know um and then he he wants somebody whose work he can trust um and so that's kind of a thing that you know and he will probably write you a letter of recommendation i've written a lot of recommendations in my time in fact i've gotten people i've gotten people from one of these lectures i've gotten a personal job in a new company one time and um and it was an animal health company and it was just what they wanted because they did their um they did their uh work assignments to get money for school they did their work assignments um in uh in the veterinarian school so do that and and any relationship that you make can be very positive later um and i want you to remember that this is very important sometimes you know i know pen's a difficult place sometimes you know because it's it doesn't want to hurt you it wants to challenge you okay so make sure if you get upset there's nothing in life you know uh almost nothing that can't be fixed okay you remember that so before you get too despondent if you're having some issues pen's got all kinds of support systems you know make sure you know you make use of those support systems they're there for you and uh as over the coming week you'll probably learn about some of those support systems where you can just talk to somebody and i mean if you need somebody to talk to we're all here for you but before you give up on yourself you know there are very few things that can't be fixed and um we all make mistakes and we all do things we all get in a hole make sure um that you take advantage of the resources that are available to you um and um and make sure that you talk to people and that's why it's good to have little little groups that you can do on the computer because you can talk over things and uh am i nuts or did this guy just give us a hundred page thing you know uh you know and or you know you can come you know this is happening at home and i'm all offset because you know when somebody can talk you through that so um and lastly very last thing now i'm going to turn you lucif unless you have some questions very lastly don't forget to i usually say at this point call home okay but you don't have to do that because probably most of you are at home or maybe an apartment but make sure you say to your folks whoever it is parents guardians friends who have helped you along to this part make sure you say to them um how much you appreciate appreciated that i mean one thing i wish in my life because i had told i had used words to say more to my parents um i can't do that anymore and i wished i had done it when they were still around because um you get only one chance to express yourself you know and make sure you get to do that um if you you know you people right now are successful you're at a successful pinnacle in life there will be a lot of people that would trade places with you right now and so make sure you say um hey mom have i ever told you how much i appreciate and how wonderful i feel about everything that you've done to get me to this point have i ever told you that mom and she'll say oh that's so sweet that is really so sweet and it's a really good try but i've already allotted all the expenses that i can for your spending money there's numbers but but anyway uh verbalize things to the people around you that care uh and that have gotten you to this point um before you're someplace 40 years later you said what i wish i would have said you know so thank you for attending my talk and at this point i will take any questions i will stay here for as long as somebody and you have to go other places now um online and stuff don't forget about the little group stuff okay don't forget about that
