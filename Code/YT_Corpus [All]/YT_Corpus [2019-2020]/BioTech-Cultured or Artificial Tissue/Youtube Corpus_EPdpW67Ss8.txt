 thank you all for coming I take it that you folks don't have basketball tickets or maybe you do Victor tells me his lab is here and that all of you will be treated to pizza afterwards but so thanks very much for coming and and right this is the spring 2009 Dean's lecture series and I'm Mike whiteford I am the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and it is my very distinct pleasure to welcome all of you to this very special event tonight's lecture is the sixth in the deans lecture series the lecture highlights faculty excellence in achievement in the areas of teaching discovery and outreach in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences we have invited some of the most outstanding members of the Elias faculty to present lectures on their own and varied areas of scholarly expertise we hope of course that this all helps to stimulate intellectual discussion among our College University faculty staff and students and for the greater Iowa State community tonight's lecture is Professor Victor Lynn he joins a distinguished list of la s faculty members who have been part of this series which was inaugurated in 2006 the researchers and scholars have shared their knowledge on topics ranging from bamboo to baseball and from primates primates to poets the most recent recent speaker was dr. Peggy Mook associate professor of classical studies in our department of world languages and cultures she presented her results of a very exciting bit of work that she's doing excavating an ancient Greek city on the island of Crete and yes she really does dig her work for the college okay that's thank you very much I will yes and we'll try one more time last spring Lynne Clark professor professor of ecology evolution and organismal biology bamboozled us with her lecture on woody bamboo plants 75 of which she has had the honor of naming Eli Rosenberg professor and then chair of the department of physics and astronomy took to the mound to explain the physics of baseball and prior to Eli was Jill preached associate professor of anthropology whose work was featured last year in the National Geographic magazine and on the PBS television show Nova Jill discussed her groundbreaking chimpanzee research in Senegal and I want to mention that Jill will be present Joel fries spring 2009 presidential University lecture right here in this very room on March 2nd her presentation will begin at 8 p.m. and our very first Dean's lecture series speaker was Neil Bowers now emeritus distinguished professor in Liberal Arts and Sciences and professor of English his lecture was entitled dead poet talking tonight's lecture will be equally informative and enlightening although on a much much much smaller scale Victor Lin is a professor of chemistry at Iowa State University and his talk tonight is entitled nanotechnology a fantastic voyage dr. Lin will discuss his work on nanotechnology specifically research in Mazal porous silica nanoparticles or in other words teensy eensy bits and that is scientific jargon of sand with lots of holes in them professor Lin is borrowing his title from the 1966 science fiction film Fantastic Voyage some of you might remember that but many of you in this room were probably too young to remember the movie where a submarine and crew are shrunken so small that they are injected into the bloodstream of an important scientist to repair his lethal blood clot professor Lin will explain how his research of nano particles particle su itsy-bitsy that millions are needed to stretch one yard is related to this old film Victor Lin is from a long line of outstanding faculty researchers from the Iowa State University Department of Chemistry and he has a national leader in the use of nanotechnology for many valuable and important purposes Victor is a member of a team of iowa state plant scientists and chemists who have successfully used nanotechnology to penetrate plant cell walls the team was able to simultaneously deliver a genetic and a chemical that triggers the cells expression with controlled precision think about the future prospects for that he is also the inventor of a nano sphere based catalyst that reacts to vegetable with vegetable oils and animal fats with meth all to produce bio diesel fuel Victor is a founder of a startup company that is using that he uses to produce and develop biodiesel technology ladies and gentlemen please join me this evening in welcoming the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences spring 2009 Dean's lecture series to the podium dr. Victor Lin first of all let me thank Mike for the very kind introduction so you know with all these outstanding speakers before me so I'll try my best to not to put you to sleep with chemistry so so let me begin by sort of offer a little bit explanation about the title of my talk so Mike already gave you a pretty thorough descriptions about the scientific well this the sci-fi movie that was made in 1966 and hopefully by the end of today's lecture I could convince you a sci-fi movie could one day become a reality so let me first sort of say that too many people that this prefix nano means a lot of different things for a scientific researcher like myself you know I first learned about this term when I was a postdoctoral researcher in the late 90s and at that time this this term was used very widely and by a lot of scientific researchers or even industrial entrepreneurs and so on and so forth and so you know when I first learned about this word is sort of like it sounded like a Budds word to me and so you know but I quickly learned about one thing when I started my independent scientific research career here at Iowa state that this prefix nano sometimes means research funding so so let me just throw a few numbers out to the audience that in 2001 in United States we're talking about federal funding agencies the total amount of the dollars that was used for to fund the nanotechnology research was 464 million dollars and that was a number back in the 2001 so in 2008 the new number came out its 1.5 billion dollars so as you can imagine this actually we not even reach the sort of the the you know it's not even the decade and the scientific funding that sort of been used in this area has tripled and so and obviously United States is not the only country that sort of heavily invested in this area Japan a lot of European countries and China and so on and so forth they are all sort of joined this this this interesting race to trying to develop new nanotechnology so to me of course that is an incentive but as a basic scientist I'm more interested in what this preface could actually do for me in providing something that could be useful in a sort of a daily living so what is nano so tiny tiny itsy-bitsy stuff is correct well in fact one nanometer it's one billionth of a meter and so this is the kind of thing that you typically see in fact I actually downloaded this picture from just simply did a google search and so one thing I would like to point out to use it's not just looking at this different kind of a length scale but the these pictures so we can actually see that of course that you know a human being is actually a few meters long and then when you go to the other end of the spectrum when we're talking about atoms it's a it's around a few lines strong and so you know when I first starting to used and put this prefix on to some of my grandpa bozo some of my senior colleagues actually came to me and says that well you know guess what all chemists are actually playing in this length scale meaning that every single molecule that the chemist will make falls into this length scale so what's the big deal about nanotechnology meaning that you know if you look at a simple molecule here it could easily exceed this 10 angstrom meaning that it will be above 1 nanometer in length so essentially that sort of got me thinking exactly what is the definition of nanotechnology what is that were so different than the kind of conventional chemistry that we do on a daily basis so it turns out this definitions of nanoscience and nanotechnology was sort of was a moving target a few years ago and the most recent definition by the National Science Foundation in the United States it's in this sort of shaded area so is anything that's above one nanometer but below 200 nanometers falls into their definitions of nanoscience so with this shaded area I would like you to actually take a look at what kind of object that falls into this size regime so one thing I like to point out to you is that this is a virus okay and later I'll explain to you why I particularly would like to draw your attention to this object here but some of the bigger artificial molecule for example polymer also falls into this this range so now let's think about why is this thing such a big deal why would the government spend so many dollars into this areas of research so who started this whole thing it turns out actually there was a very famous sentence there's plenty of room at the bottom was actually first said by Richard Feynman who was a Nobel laureate won his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 and the amazing part is that not only that you know this is his first this is the first photo that shows up on his badge when he was a last animal scientist and then you know when he became the faculty member at Caltech and you know then this is one of the privileged you get to be a faculty member you could point at people and you know and then he obviously did a lot of thinking so what actually intrigues me was that the this this the statement was actually made before he won the Nobel Prize so the first nanotechnology lecture was actually started with the questions why can we write the 24 volumes or the incas encyclopedia the Britannica on the head of a pen okay so turns out I'm just gonna move this thing because I like to walk around so this this lecture this talk was given and they after dinner talk that this is actually December 29th 1959 so notice the date is actually before he got a Nobel Prize and this was a sort of an annual American physic physics society meeting at Caltech so what this whole talk was about was that he was actually giving this talk and describing how one could actually make a molecular machine that with atomic precision that allow you to use this machine to do a lot of different things so this whole speech actually it's quite inspirational to me that is to say well this actually imply you don't just make a molecule that falls into this nanometer sized regime the true definition of nanotechnology is perhaps whatever the products should it be chemical should it be a particle should it be a different kinds of material or even a biological system the the real meanings of nanotechnology is that this object must function in the multiple way so obviously I was not the only one that sort of came up with this definitions of nanotechnology in fact there's a sci-fi versions of nanotechnology as Mike described so it actually took me a while to sort of get these posters and so this is indeed a story about four men and a woman that they jumps into a submarine and this whole thing get reduced in size into something that is so small is smaller than a blood cells that actually get injected into the blood streams so essentially this whole movie can boil down to blood streams nano medics okay or announcer jhin's so this thing's will go in and repair any kind of damage that you know when they encounters these these red blood cells or immune systems then they becomes you know this becomes such a sort of dangerous journey for them and so is this kind of a nano surgeons or now Maddox just a pipe dreams and if you think about if you behave like sort of simple-minded scientists like myself I start to analyze what are the prerequisites that's needed to build such kind of machines and in fact this is actually the drive the the driving force for me to actually start my independent research so the first thing you need to do is that you must create something that's capable of carrying and releasing various cargoes okay the second thing you need to have well if you put it in the cartoon fashion if you could actually have a cap you know micro capsule like this that allow you to release or load different kinds of cargo and this will be a very interesting machine the second thing you want to be able to achieve is that this object that you create should be structurally stable to protect the cargo okay so something looked like that if you could actually have a sort of like your tiny little space shuttle that actually instead of flying the space but that you travel in your bloodstreams this will be ideal the third things is that obviously you have to be able to do a lot of different functions meaning that this object has to be multifunctional the four things is that this object needs to know where to go so it has to be target directing so based on the four prerequisites that are outlined here this is almost like we're buying a car right you know you need a car that could carry and release you the door should open you know when you want them to be open the car should be a Volvo okay so or MSAD so that could protect you upon collision okay you gotta have the headlights you gotta have the windshield wiper you gotta have a lot of different thing multifunctional these days a good car will give you a GPS so essentially what you're doing here is buying a car the only difference is that if you want to apply this kind of things in the biological system then this object must be biocompatible what that means is that when this object traveling and encountering a lot of different biological species it better not trigger any kind of immune response otherwise it will bring harms to the biological objects so with this as the motivation can we actually start doing something and as a sort of about inorganic chemists often time when I want to do something I will I will always go to mother nature and ask for some advice and one of the things that I figure it out is that is there such a download in the delivery system in nature as I mentioned to you virus turns out to be right around 100 nanometer in size so it's a nano object okay and turns out virus is a great delivery vehicle so I would like to show you a movie that I downloaded from NSF this is actually a bacteriophage t4 virus ready to infect its host cells so here's the movie you can see this very strange-looking almost like an alien spaceship object that's ready to land on a yourself and the landing is actually quite sophisticated so they got these peptides and the protein that actually binds to the cell surface receptors so these are the proteins or the pea or the the the peptides and then a secondary landing gear also touch upon the surface then they start drilling a hole okay injecting the RNA into the inside of the cells okay so you can see that is so efficient some viruses could even establish a tubular structure that allowed these structures species inside of the cells go back into the virus so this is actually quite sophisticated right so this is an object that fulfilled all those prerequisite that I just mentioned to you so how come we cannot use the virus as a nano you know surgeons turns out while virus scale is on the agenda right so not virus is all good okay and often time however there is a take-home message that is if I could shrink the nano delivery vehicle that I want to bill to this size Regine's just live virus it is quite smart it could bypass your immune response that's why every time you have a viral infection the doctor just look at you and says go home drink more water okay so unlike bacteria which will trigger the immune response viruses that you're quite smart so perhaps there is a reason why they pacifically you know sort of define themselves and evolve themselves into that size regime now how because we cannot use the virus directly can we make some sort of artificial structure that allow us to actually embark in such a kind of journey and build this now delivery device well again let's ask mother nature is there a three-dimensional stable structures that with high volume and with high surface area so allow you to accommodate a lot of gas molecules well turns out we don't have to look very far this I'm sure everybody in the audience knows recognize this is a honeycomb and one thing amazes me is that a beehive this is essentially the building block of the Beehive and as we all know a small beehive such as this one often time accommodate millions of bees so what the means is that if you utilize the space three-dimensionally one can actually build something very stable yet can highly accommodating that allows you to pack a lot of different things into a very small unit volume so with that I started to go to the whiteboard and start drawing something like this if I could only build a device let's take let's say I will have the ability to build this nano honeycomb and with then I could hide these drug molecule inside of these porous and then if I could actually put a tiny little cap there so that they won't leak out and then if this cap could be smart enough when I want them to open then they can open and that would be ideal then I can put some side directing stuff for example antibody that that it's well known that will recognize a specific receptor on the cell surface so this whole device will be side directing now today I hope to convince you we could indeed make some of the structure that looks like this that the release can be triggered by some naturally produced chemical or even using a simple photon irradiation now as I mentioned right the virus didn't just take the drug to the local tissue they actually drill a hole and then inject the cargo inside of the cells because that's the most efficient way to get your cargo into the the destination and there are several challenges if you look at the animal cells this is a animal cells it has this lipid bilayer that's called a cellular membrane and the penetration of this is not so easy and if you think about animal cell being difficult wait until you run into the plant cells in addition to the cell membrane you have the cell wall that are even thicker and so how can you ask your nano device to be able to penetrate these natural barriers so the challenge number one is that can you deliver functional molecule through the cell membrane or penetrate the cell wall the second challenge is that can you control the timing and the amount of the intracellular release because if you bring in just a few molecules inside it won't do its job often time the biogenic concentration it's right around micromolar to millimolar that is to say you know one thousandth of a molar or one millionth of a molar concentration so can you accomplish this these are grand challenges so one of the thing that I found myself lucky was that there was a paper that was published in Nature of over a decade ago in 1992 by a group of Exxon a group of scientists that works at Exxon I started mobile this is before they merged so I always got confused so mobile scientists they actually take a very simple soap molecule the surfactant molecule when you introduce them into water they selves assemble and form these structures that call my cells where they hide the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail in the core regime and then they all the circle the open circle representing the charged groups that are water soluble they faced the the waters so this whole structure could allow these by polar molecule to form the unique structure in an aqueous solution then what they do is they take these soap molecule they form these almost like the bubbles they change the pH they change the concentration they change the shape of this affected micelle in from something severe co2 something look like a rod and then just like how you a pack cigarettes become controlling the concentration you can pack them into array and then what they do is they throw some chemical that they will form the silica structure so the silica as you know is silicon dioxide is the fundamental building block of sand so essentially what they ends up doing is that they make a composite material so the walls are made of silica where these in between these walls they actually encapsulate the surfactant molecule then upon calcination meaning that if you burn these organic species away or you do the ad you know acidic extraction meaning that you could you could do some dilution and extraction you can extract those organic molecule out you ends up having an inorganic structure and this inorganic structure it has this unique structure that looked just like the honeycomb and the amazing part that I found was that the surface area of this material one single brand of molecule give you a football field so above 900 square meter per gram so which means that if you could use this thing as a solid support one could not only low a lot of molecule if you do the surface chemistry you put some functional groups on it on the surface of this material it will give you a lot of active sites so I found this material to be very intriguing and so I follow the recipe just like so many other scientists out there I could indeed make large quantities of this material okay and if you put this things under a transmission electron microscope so this is a microscope that allow you to look at almost to the atomic levels of the resolutions of how these atoms are arranged and one sees this you see some of the light colored dots you see some of the darker gray and black areas so these light colored dots represent the openings of the vacuum meaning the channel the pores so we're looking down the pores so if you pay attention to some of this region you notice that this light circle are packing the hexagonal symmetry meaning just like honeycomb these things are actually monodisperse in size meaning the size of the openings are almost the same there are actually pack in a very ordered fashion the bad part however is that when i zoom out when i started taking a look you know at the particle morphology meaning the shapes of these particle turns out to be quite bad so here's a scale bar of one micron so one millionth of a meter you can actually see that some particles are large some are small they're fused together so suffice to say this is a more morphus material so you can find some nano particles among this bunch but the majorities are much larger than that so turns out when I search in literature and I did a pretty thorough jobs before us no one ever used this material for biomedical application and it turns out when we did the first experiment our laboratory would put some animal cells and we trying to culture them on top of these silicon particles turns out they get wiped out within a couple of weeks the bow compatibilities of this material turns out to be quite bad that was the first Challenger we ran into so we knew right then we need to fix this problem so you may ask this question right I mean I don't know about elsewhere but you know I have a ten year old and the seven-year-old sometimes follow into the playground and a lot of time you see them like to play sand and some of the kids are smarter not to put the sand in their mouth but some of them like to lick them up okay nobody died okay so one asked this question so how come you know this that the particle that are made of the same chemical compositions to be so toxic and caused the damage to the animal cells in our case and the other thing I noticed is that a lot of good thing that happened before I was born that's what some one lesson I learned that is in 1966 people already published a paper in nature about this hemolysis that is to say if you inject the amorphous silica just like those particle that has shown you before into the bloodstream what happened was when they encountered the red blood cells the red blood cells were severely damaged all the internal contain uncontained like hemoglobin Zanda these these nice cargos within the red blood cells got leaked out so it is what it means is that the amorphous silica has the ability to lyse the cells and then rupture the membrane so that these red blood cell will die so this hemolysis effect was well documented in even in 1966 so many of my colleagues started to ask me this question why on earth do you want to use sand as a biomedical delivery vehicle and it turns out you know I have my reason because not only on the inorganic chemist well that's the reason I told my senior colleagues but the true reason is because I would like to build something structurally stable when you already taken these things when it goes through the extreme axilla T's of your stomach it will not get destroyed so that all those precious drugs or a target will not get decomposed turns out to make a long story short we found a way to make this happen I'll just give you the results and spare you with the details of the chemistry slides turns out we by using different kinds of chemical precursors we can make a whole range of different shapes and sizes starting from tubes fat noodle Saphir raspberry bars you name it we can make it so these particle in fact have a very unique pore structures so show here are two TEM again the transmission electron micrograph of these particles to your right we're looking down the opening of the pores again so hopefully you can see the light colored dot there packing the hexagonal symmetry the size of these these dots are identical that is to say this is a very mono dispersed pore structure to your left this is the side view we turn this particle 90 degree could see these parallel stripes these stripes representing the pores channels so they straight through the course the equatorial ones are longest you go to the polar region to become shallow one interesting aspect is that there is no interconnection between these channel just like honeycomb they're all independent and parallel to each other so why is this advantageous to us because we can literally treat them like tiny little sponge ball just like sponge you throw them into any solution it will soak up whatever is in that solution so we can make a drug solution and then we sprinkle these dry tiny little itsy Lizzy's sponge particle into the solution if the drug the molecular size of the drug is small enough they could diffuse into the porous matrix of this material then what we did was to drop two giant rocks on both sides of this tunnel and block these truck from leaking out and the way that we did it is to use the hinge use this linker and this linker as I was showing show you turns out to be chemical or photo label that is to say we could use those external stimuli as the trigger to cut the hinge pop the cap and then trigger the release no one thing the first system that we did was to use something that is very quite common in biology this disulfide linkage so many proteins particularly antibodies they used the disulfide bond as their way to form a rigid structure but they could actually exchange and then do some you know refinements of the structure so that is to say this kind of chemical linkage is cleavable you could actually cut them in fact an antioxidant such as those those growth ion that you go to the GNC you could buy a bottle of that can cleave this kind of bond and so if we use this as a covalent linkage to to connect or the cap to our porous material then one could imagine you could actually by sending in a chemical that could actually reduce disulfide bond here the u-clip perhaps cut this things and then allow the cap to diffuse away then this entrapped you know drug molecule can quickly follow and it turns out the strategy was successful we can indeed make something looks like this so I would just simply tell you this these this lower-right plot not only we could actually control that the the rate of the release we found a very interesting effect that is this is a plot that plotted the the release concentration meaning the cargo concentration against the trigger concentration what we saw was a threshold meaning that at a very low trigger concentration there was almost no release when it when the concentration of the trigger above the threshold here all the sudden you have the onslaught the massive release and this could be explained by those I saw a quite a few chemistry stood in there so in case you're a general chemistry TA here is the lessons so any reversible equilibrium reaction is governed by the equilibrium constant correct so the Tauri the product of a two reactant has to be larger than equilibrium constant in order for you to drive the reaction from the left to the right and that is to say in our scenario this reaction this reversible reactions is dictated by the concentration of the linker and the trigger so if the trigger concentration is too low you're not going to be able to trigger this reaction in the forward direction that is to say no release then when you concentration is too high enough you could trigger the release the one interesting take-home message is that this is now a smart particle that is to say if you put it in a local environment when you have no trigger this thing's will stay put as a loaded gun only when you stumble into a local environment you have higher enough of the triggers concentration then the gate opening will happen so perhaps we could take advantage of this kind of situation to be able to differentiate a cancer tissue versus a normal tissue that is to say if the cancer tissue over expressed a certain chemical so that the local concentration of that particular chemical at that particular tissue is much higher than the normal tissue then this bullets will know when and how to fire okay so you can actually use anything that's large enough to block those pores as the cap so I'd like to show you one system that we use tiny tiny little magnet the iron oxide as the cap so that we could encapsulate a guest molecule such a fluorescent dye inside of this whole assembly the reason why we like to put a magnet there is that now this whole system will be attractive to external magnetic force that is to say you put a magnet there this whole thing will follow and be accumulated near the the surface of the magnet so here is a picture well we have two magnet that's behind these two cuvettes you can see the agglomerations of these you know metal fouling dart particles around that side of the cuvette when we sends in a chemical trigger interestingly 17 hours laters you could actually see the solution now look completely green that is the color of this fluorescent dye but in addition to that you notice that the agglomeration the color of this of glamor ation changed changes as well on the right this is the control so this looks completely black here you know and in this one that looks kind of grayish so if you think about it the iron oxide is actually black in color silica as you know just like sand and glass they're actually white so if you flip this things 90 degree you will see that once we cut the hinge the only magnetic species are those aren't oxide so they get accumulate closer to the magnet that's behind the screen here whereas the white silica particle get elbow out so you see this kind of grayish color another example that I'd like to show you it's a movie actually this is Bryant ruin who is sitting in the audience brian is holding a probably not a cyclone refrigerator refrigerator but some kind of refrigerator magnet so and what we did was that we take those particle we load them with fluorescent dye we fed them to a human cervical cancer cells so then we put a magnet on this size will accumulate all those cells that have swallowed our particle to the left and then when I started the movie Brian's gonna move this this very weak magnet from the left to the right and I'd like you to pay attention to what happened to those cells so you can see they've sort of a light color lining here those are the cells let me start the movie now he's moving the magnet to the right and hopefully you could see it starts pretty slow you can see the blob that just jumped can't see that you can see these these cells these sort of these blobs are moving from the left to the right okay and now he's gonna move the magnet from the right back to the left okay this time he didn't let these cells to sort of rest too long and now you can actually see these cells are coming back much faster can you see that so there are two table messages one is that this is a very weak magnet the fact that you could actually use the magnet to drag these cells from left and right tells you one thing because these are animals well actually human soup your cancer cell they have the adhesive protein they tend to latch onto the quartz surface oftentimes you need to trip Sinai's them you need to actually destroy those adhesive protein in order to move them the fact now without the trypsin ization you can actually move them from left and right tells you that the number of the particle that gets swollen by these cells are in a very large number and another interesting effect is that the iron oxide is a high dielectric constant material it will quench the fluorescence when the four the four SS species are very close to that magnet a magnet and the fact we could actually see these cells that are glowing in the sort of blue fluorescent tells you they are already intracellular release that took place and so we have tested a lot of naturally to produce to sell produce antioxidant turns out we found a molecule that's called a dihedral lipoic acid that is actually quite effective in Salvage oxidizing and then reduce this disulfide which is the hinge of a particle and then trigger the release turns out this release is actually quite fast so that is to say if we could actually use the system as of tiny little nano rulers and go into all different kinds of the cells to measure the antioxidant accident level of all these different cells type and in help if this cancer cell shows more of the antioxidant then we have a smart bullets to kill cancer like to show you another system that where we put a polymer on the outsides of this particle this polymer is quite interesting that the room temperature is completely soluble in water the water can go in so this is hydrophilic you elevate the temperature slightly to 40 degrees Celsius all the sudden the intracellular hydrogen bonding took over this whole polymer become hydrophobic so the reason why we're interesting doing this is that if we could actually coat the silica particle whether the rim of this polymer then perhaps the particle behavior can be altered when it you know based on the environment these particles are located and also based on the surrounding temperature turns out the strategy also worked you can actually see that at 25 degree in water you could disperse these particles very homogeneous lee form a suspension and when you heat it up to 40 degree all of a sudden the solution becomes clear all the particle precipitate down at the bottoms of this cube of this test tube if you put an organic solvent on top and then the water at the bottom the bottom water solution looks milky when you have the Hanako that evenly dispersed at room temperature when you heat the temperature up all the sudden this thing becomes clear these particles fighting their way into the organic phase the reason why they couldn't go all the way in is because silicon is actually quite heavy okay so using a cartoon to represent what happens is that you could by doing this kind of nano chemistry you could even alter the nature the physical natures of these particle from something complete water-soluble to something organic soluble so recently very recently one of my students have decided okay well he must take control of this release he does not want to be at the sort of nature's mercy so he doesn't want a way for the natural cell produced antioxidant he decided to just shine the light so he decided to put a cap that has a photo labile linker that is to say once you shine the light to this structure the bond can be cleaved and then to pop the cap so turns out he was successful by doing some irradiation you could actually trigger the release and he could use this thing to control the timing when he would like to kill a human liver cells so when it's dark you could actually see the cells are quite heavily you know alive and after the rady radiations cells are destroyed and the cargo he used is actually anti cancer cell well anti tumour drugs taxol so this is to tell you that one could actually use the thing know another thing I'd like to mention to you quickly is that well one can actually use a variety of different thing as the cap to even change the charge profile of the species if we put something that's highly positively charged like this poly a an idol amine polymer one can actually change the overall surface charge from negative to positive the reason why we like to do that is that if you have a particle that's actually a highly positive charge then you can actually electrostatically form a complex with the plasma DNA so we could actually just these DNA will be just like the ribbons we that should get rapped this this this little gift box and in addition we could hide these tiny little drugs inside of the porous matrix so the idea is to take advantage of this whole structure and hopefully they could behave like the Trojan horse when you present them to the cell membrane if they can be swallowed by the cells if we could find a way to do the intracellular control release then the DNA could go to the nucleus and do the gene transfection whereas the drug can come out and keep and do its biological functions so this may be a very simple cartoon in the reality it's never that quite easy right you have so many different methods mechanisms for a cell to swallow and foreign objects such as nanoparticle inside this the plasmid and suffice to say regardless which kind of mechanism they all ends up inside a bubble that is to say regardless is defined you know phagocytosis or the these kind of a classroom media endocytosis your foreign objects the first thing that ends up inside of self is being wrapped around inside a lipid bilayer vesicle can we break free from this is the key okay turns out what we have found is that as nm animal cell can indeed swallow up a lot of our particle inside so you can see this is actually a Chinese hamster ovarian cells there is a very big nucleus and all these dark particles are actually armies of pores now silicon nanoparticle so there the number is actually you know above a hundred per cell and they're actually quite power compatible as you can see there are a lot of these funny shapes of the intracellular organelles those are the mitochondria so many people would think that mitochondria are the power plants of the cell so when the cell died these intracellular ghen ISM disappeared very very rapidly so the factor that seed the mitochondria in a very close proximity to the agglomeration of your silica particle indicating that these silly silica particles are not killing the cell when they're being swallowed this is the slide on my students favorite that here shows one silica particle to mitochondria here and here and a wiggling nucleus membrane and a goji so this is sort of like you could see that this particle is peaceably coexist with all these intracellular organelles and the interesting that we found is by decorating the outside surface of this particle we could control how long these things were get wrapped inside the vesicle or how fast we want them to come out and start playing with these inter cell organelle inside themselves so if we use this they can trap more than six hours if we use something like a mean very quickly they come out so I'm not going to detail that we could use the strategy to do gene transfection these are all the different types of the animal cells we can reach a varieties of the gene transfection efficiencies these numbers are actually quite high as you can see even the primary cells and neurons even their dendrites actually shows the high 4s and intensity that is means that the high degrees of the green fluorescent protein expression in this case no we could also make the small pores as you can see the separation between lines are more are closely here in comparisons with this we could actually expand the pore diameter to make something that would make the pores bigger to accommodate a bigger molecule such as a enzyme we could actually put a saddle comb see which is an enzyme that's membrane impermeable and then we'd load them inside the particle we could actually take them through the cell membrane and then release them inside themselves as you can see they started highly localized around the particle eventually the diffuse and you could actually see the whole cells now look green fluorescent them now this strategy is all good so we have published a lot of papers in this area to highlight that one can indeed use this Trojan horse approach to accomplish a lot of interesting applications in biomedical area or the biotech nology area and we sort of went into a barrier when I started the collaboration with my dear friend Khan Juan in agronomy as Mike mentioned that we team up together and in hope to use this kind of nanoparticle technology to be able to accomplish this cell wall penetration challenge turns out all the trick that we learned from the animal cell study didn't quite work in this case turns out we literally have to sugarcoat this particle so mmm is always a good thing so turns out when you sugarcoat these things they actually find their way through the cell wall into the cell membrane into the cell membrane and go inside of the cells so this is just sort of a you know these are actually two to plan cells you can actually see without the sugar coating most of the green particles are outside of the cells with the sugar coating they're inside of the plant cells so we could actually do that we can do to change trance factions and we'll also deliver a chemical and we would control the timing of this release so we could actually transfer even some very big object such as this tobacco leaf here okay you can actually see the green fluorescent spots on this leaf and so all this is good however I did not really answer one question that is what about this hemolysis this toxic in fact that I mentioned very beginning on my talk it turns out lots of people study why is the silica particles so damaging to the red blood cells turns out there is a good reason the silicate which is an anionic species like to hang around with the sort of tertiary ammonium groups on the red blood cell membrane so the more of this kind of electrostatic attraction that you have the tighter these two object will combine with each other and in some cases these particle will actually have enough of the binding with the cell membrane to change the shape of the cells so that is to say when you throw some silica particle to the red blood cells instead of having a smooth cell surface now you see these kind of spikes so this speculation it's one of the reason why this membrane now is been twisted to the strange form and then eventually it ruptures and the cell dies and we were quite surprised when we start investigating and compare our particle which is shaped like this this is a more facility cut ok the skull bar is from it's the same 50 nanometer here 50 nanometer there okay so I would like to drive your attention to this photo photograph here that when you put the red blood cell in the pure ion free water then obviously because of this osmotic pressure the red blood cells will release all the cargo and then you can actually see once we centrifuge it down the cells remains are at the bottom okay you look at the supernatant is that you quite read all the hemoglobin was released up here when we put in more for silica same thing habits you could actually see the super nathan's are indeed very very wet if you use just a PBS buffer meaning a on a highly ionic water solution that these cells like to be in they're quite happy the supernatant is completely clear whereas in this case when we introduce our me support silicon nano particle after the centrifuge we see that the supernatant are actually cleared very very clear that is to say in contrast to this hemolysis ii fact that the commonly observed within Morpha silica our immune support silicon Allanson fear would not trigger that now the question is why well we are obviously very happy about this result because that means our particle is that you're quite biocompatible now if we compare the amount of these ni onyx groups on these solids Sevierville particle versus our particle we were in a great surprise because if you count a number of those silicate groups ours is at least twenty times more because we have such a huge surface area because all these pores they all have this silicate however because they're inside the pores these silicate groups are not accessible to the cell membrane because the cell is a much bigger object than all so that is to say allow me to use this analogy nobody would like to drive on the New Year highway or let's say in these days we'll be selling California is the same thing because there forward potholes okay so you are in the bumpy ride and in fact this is very similar in our case instead of having a smooth surface where all these silicate group are accessible to the membrane the cell membrane so the cell membrane was so the wrap around this object and caused the circulation in our case every so many nano meter there is a big vacuum there's a big gap that these cell membrane we have to jump over to reach out to another bonding spots so almost that this is the you know this is the basketball whereas this is a golf ball okay so this indentation this poor structure prevents a close association between the cell membrane and the silica particle so in fact but creating this a unique structure these guys are now biocompatible okay now I gotta quickly switch gear and I know I don't have much time left but I'd like to tell you the other type of research we do has something to do we're using these same kind of means of porous material for catalysis application particularly biofuel the reason why we're interested in biofuel well one reason is again you know you could get some research funding being in Iowa and that's the you know honest truth the other thing is that you know we must live in a sustainable society well many of you have seen this kind of pictures well this is the upsala glacier in argentina 1920 a cover with thick ice 2004 well all the ice melted so this of course you've seen lots of this picture global warming right so is global warming for real or not living in Iowa sometimes hard to believe that but particularly winter however I like the following slides this is very convincing to me if you look at the ladies underwear 18th century this is what it looks like now we're over here I think the debate is over personally okay so there is a global warming okay so well since we're now so we cannot continue to burn the fossil fuel we must find a way to live in the sustainable society that is to say we got to look at our ancestor what did they do they use all these things around them like garbage are your cultural crops grass biomass they use these things for energy they sometimes even use this to make wines cheese well I don't know in some part of the world I think they do use some garbage to make fermentated species however the the kind of a conventional we live in the petroleum-based society that is to say all these refinery infrastructures are geared towards those hydrocarbons that is completely hydrophobic we don't have to worry about the corrosion now we're in in a big surprise we have to deal with these biological species a lot of them are water-soluble one big problem of the ethanol industry in the state of Iowa is transportation they cannot use the oil pipeline because they didn't make those prime I wasn't made of stainless steel so if you charge your ethanol into the pipeline it will corrode those by my that's why all the ethanol has to be trained or trucked so the economical radius of transporting the ethanol that's produced in Iowa can only reach out to Chicago 350 mile that's the economical radius it cannot go to California they cannot go to New York so can we use the nanotechnology to help to create new calles or the refinery methods to help to eliminate or overcomes on these technology challenge like to give you one example that is something I like to work with in the past three four years now I'd like to convert oil to biodiesel this is a very simple chemical reaction you take this molecule triglyceride you cut between this carbon oxygen bond you put the methanol here this own Emmy here you replace this molecule with that you end up having a methyl ester this is biodiesel Dada's glycerin very simple reaction but if you look we're in Iowa we are we definitely in no shortage of soybean however if you look this is 2007 how many biodiesel plant in the United States 86 2006 the majority is actually in the Midwest and the southeast of course these are agricultural states no now we have approximately 151 about these are producing factories okay so the number is greatly increasing and one thing I would like to point out is even Hawaii got to biodiesel plants okay so obviously this is a booming industry no but if you look no but if you look no but if you look no but if you look no but if you look no but if you look now but if you
