facility on the ISS the primary difference between t a NGO l a b-1 and t a NGO lab2 is an upgraded fan system which allows for a greater he projection capability this enables research with greater power draw and lower temperature requirements topic research topic life sciences all living organisms on earth are continually influenced by gravitational forces on both macro and molecular levels the microgravity conditions in space induced changes in DNA regulation expression of genes and cell structure and function understanding the impact of gravitational force on living systems and their biochemical processes advances research in the fields of biology genetics healthcare medicine microbiology plant and crop sciences nanotechnology and pharmaceutical and regenerative medicine topic research examples topic stem cell research it has been shown that stem cells the master cells that produce all organ and tissue cell types may grow faster in microgravity as compared to cells grown conventionally in gravity the conditions in space also allow for the formation of three-dimensional tissues coupled with the differentiation of stem cells into different cell types that better mimic the functions of tissues and organ systems one scientist is experimenting with human stem cells in space to improve treatments for stroke victims the goal is to expand the population of stem cells that will induce regeneration of neurons and blood vessels in patients who have for the hemorrhagic stroke this kind of research is being conducted in labs on earth using incubators but growing the stem cells takes an extended period of time this scientist believes that testing in space will accelerate the growth of the cells researchers are also using a technology called organs on chips or tissues on chips to build tiny versions of human systems these microchip like devices are embedded with living cells that will react in space as if the full organ was there scientists believe these chips will eventually replace traditional dish cultures and animal testing for studying disease and testing new drugs the latest tissues on chip experiment on the ISS involves growing functional bone tissue topic protein crystallization microgravity also allows scientists to grow more higher quality protein crystals that could help improve drug design scientists choose to conduct this type of research on the ISS because it's easier to maintain uniform temperatures in liquids in microgravity because of the absence of convection driving the mixing of fluids with different temperature and density without convection the movement of fluids of different density and temperature occurs because of diffusion which is slower than convection this makes the process of growing crystals more precise u.s. lab researchers are growing protein crystals of the Parkinson's disease protein lrr k2 when grown in labs on earth the proteins crystals are small and have numerous defects scientists believe the effects of microgravity will allow the protein crystals to grow larger and with minimal flaws which would make the structure easier to analyze if successful scientists believe they could develop a drug that would inhibit this protein either venting or slowing the progression of this disease this type of research could also be useful for cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease because scientists have not been able to grow crystals of the active proteins on earth with good enough quality to image protein crystallization could also have an impact on the delivery method of a cancer drug that is currently on the market the hope is that the lack of gravity induced variability while formulating the drug on the ISS could help the company improve the administration and effectiveness of the drug by turning an hours-long intravenous infusion into a simple injection topic bone glue another scientist is testing a new glue that fixes fractured bone and stabilizes the seal between metal hardware and bones the researcher found that when the bone was glued back together on earth the materials eventually converted to new bone over time the researcher is now testing the glue in space to see if it accelerates the formation of new bone this scientist believes that surgeries on fractured bone could become a lot less complicated if bone glue were used instead of metal plates screws and rods topic analyzing bacterial growth scientists are also analyzing bacterial growth on the ISS and the mutations that may determine the next super bug or strains of bacteria that have resistance to multiple antibiotic drugs observing these mutations will help them develop medicines that will eliminate bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus mr sa which is easily spread and very difficult to treat topic immune system responses one study aims to find treatments for age-related illnesses by observing how microgravity affects T cells the type of white blood cells responsible for immune responses in low-gravity T cells only activate around half as often or less than the control samples indicating a reduced ability to fight infection because living in microgravity accelerates the same type of problems that old age does this researcher is interested in determining the earliest point at which T cells become different in space topic genetic changes in DNA using a machine to analyze genes one researcher is testing whether astronauts experienced genetic changes in their DNA that would cause them to have weakened immune systems when in space the findings in this experiment are important because it will determine if astronauts would be able to conduct experiments in space for extended periods of time topic experiments with model organisms for example scientists are using micro gravities unique ability to accelerate bone deterioration to study rodent bone loss in space the experiment involves studying how Nell won a molecule in humans that has the ability to grow new bone works as a treatment for preventing bone loss in mice in space the findings could lead to the development of treatments in bone restoration bone loss prevention and bone grafting topic remote sensing the orbital path of the ss travels over the regions of earth that contain more than 90 percent of the Earth's population giving scientists a unique view of our

attached to the spaceship to monitor changes in the ozone layer topic monitoring meteor showers from space a camera was installed on the ISS for a two-year period to monitor meteor showers from space this investigation helped scientists better understand the behavior of asteroids and comets and how they have affected our planet the results from the study could also help protect us from potential collisions topic red tide research red tide harmful algal bloom that releases toxins into our oceans has been studied on the ISS using a special imager that was attached to the spaceship scientists collected data that helped them detect and classify algal blooms topic physical sciences the loss of buoyancy in space allows scientists to conduct fundamental research in fluid dynamics combustion and material sciences gaining more understanding of these concepts facilitates advances in the fields of transportation power generation manufacturing and medicine while at the same time evolving standards for safety and efficiency in multiple disciplines topic research examples topic artificial limbs one of the biggest challenges in space travel is the effect that radiation has on both man-made and natural materials that's why scientists are seeing if a new gel like material designed to be used to make life like synthetic muscles for artificial limbs used by humans and robots could survive a trip to Mars this material is being tested on the ISS to determine if it retains its durability flexibility and strength with high levels of radiation topic study that focuses on how certain pharmaceuticals dissolve a pharmaceutical company is conducting an experiment on liquid-solid interactions and how pharmaceuticals dissolve in microgravity the results could lead to more effective medicines that last longer on the shelf topic surgical robots surgical robots are being tested in space to increase the efficiency of research conducted on the ISS the robots will be able to perform small dexterous tasks which will both expand the type of research that can be performed in space as well as give the flight crew more time to focus on other experiments topic consumer products to companies are conducting experiments in space in order to improve consumer products one company is testing a more efficient showerhead that uses an oscillating chip to break up the water and release it faster so that we use less water in the shower another is studying how a compound called silica forms in microgravity so it can produce more fuel-efficient tyres topic technology development the u.s. laboratory serves as a testing facility for new developments in remote sensing technology as well as innovations in computing electronics and hardware prototyping it also has microgravity enabled material production and manufacturing facilities the lab also tests robotics and advanced materials to see if they can withstand the harsh microgravity environment the results will provide valuable information for future space stations and next-generation satellites topic research examples topic 3d printer a 3d printer on the ISS is scheduled to produce parts for satellites and other spacecraft medical research components an exercise device for autodesk wrenchers dot and parts for high school projects researchers believe that manufacturing large structures in space as opposed to sending them from Earth will broaden space development and exploration even as far as producing habitats on the moon and sending drones to explore other planets topic cotton sustainability researchers are studying innovative methods to increase cotton sustainability ranging from improving the plants to use less water to getting real-time data from Earth Observation to farmers in order to make informed decisions that conserve water and aid in the management of field crops topic bone densitometry the first x-ray machine installed on the space station called the bone densitometer allows astronauts to study
