 [Music] hello my name is Anna Torres Keshe - this video will cover the topic of supply problems in marine biotechnology to enter the market or in case of marine drugs to enter the clinical trials continuous supply of biomass or selective metabolites is crucial however working sufficient yields is not that easy the so called supply problem is still one of the weakest points in many biotechnological processes however first development of such technologies as synthetic chemistry genetic engineering as well as advances in culture and aquaculture techniques may provide some solutions in this video I will focus on the cultivation methods specifically developed for marine organisms both aquaculture and Mary Carter involve cultivating organisms under defined conditions however Mary Carter requires cultivation in Saline waters while aquaculture involves cultivation in fresh waters so in case of marine organisms under artificial conditions Mary culture is often perceived as a wing of aquaculture that is undertaken in situ in the marine environment [Music] aquaculture is well-established for the production of some invertebrates fish macro fights and macro algae especially in case of fish and shrimps the strategy had been developed many years ago and now it brings big profits especially to food and feed industries at the different levels application of aquaculture solves the supply problem in many branches of blue biotechnology not only food and feed but also cosmetic production biofuels bio remediation and novel technologies however for many years application of this method for obtaining high value-added products including Marine Barracks has been neglected this has changed recently and many trials especially in case of invertebrates aquaculture have been undertaken one of the examples could be production of the paramedic medicine overall for the treatment of psoriasis evarro is marine cysteine turpenoid hydro kenan originally detected in the marine sponge it can be chemically synthesized in 20 steps however in low yields moreover this process involves several expensive substrates the more economically feasible method would be Maori culture since Averell is naturally produced in relatively large quantities up to 3 grams of overall are obtained from one kilogram of sponge the question is whether maximal growth rates correlate with the production of bioactive metabolites unfortunately in this case the answer is No one cultivation technology enables the highest growth rate while the other the highest bioactivity cultivation in bioreactors fermentated and photobioreactors or in other laboratory cultures is realized for some types of invertebrate cells and micro organisms including micro algae marine fungi and bacteria unlike previous strategies cultivation in bioreactors is often used for manufacturing mooring drugs for example fermentation plays an important role in the production of anti-cancer drug traffic teddy sold by Pharma Mar under the brand name young delis original compound was detected in the marine tunicate but later its biosynthesis by symbiotic bacterium was established yields obtained from the tunicate are extremely low one ton of animals is needed to isolate one gram of traffic Teddy the current supply is based on the semi synthetic process that starts from suppressing be an antibiotic obtained by fermentation of the bacterial cell known as fluorescence a big opportunity in this field would be utilization of salt tolerant fermentation method suitable for production of natural compounds by marine microorganisms [Music] mixed cultures are also a promising option to overcome supply problems for example the induction of biosynthetic pathway of cytotoxic liberal tolerance a to D was observed only when marine fungus libertas species was culture through marine gammaproteobacteria supply problem is an important issue that could hamper launching the new marine products to the market however the other important obstacle is how to match by discovery with the potent markets scientists work within very specific fields and they have no idea what market applications their discoveries may have thank you [Music]
