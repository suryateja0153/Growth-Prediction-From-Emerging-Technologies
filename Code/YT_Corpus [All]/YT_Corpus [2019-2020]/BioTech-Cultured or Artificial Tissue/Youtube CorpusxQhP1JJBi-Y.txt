 [Music] most farmers get paid for the bushels of grain that they produce bushels of corn or bushels of wheat without regard to how that produce is produced and that of course removes the incentive for farmers to focus on those things they get paid for volume so they invest in methods and technologies that will enable them to produce more but not in the things that allow them to produce better or in a more sustainable way I'm David Abel and this is climate rising a podcast from Harvard Business School that looks at the challenges and opportunities that climate change presents for businesses today we're talking about food how we grow it and its impact on the climate since factory farming took off after the Industrial Revolution the way we use land and the scale of the work has changed dramatically now we have a massive industry that feeds billions of people but the success of growing food to accommodate an ever-growing population has had consequences agriculture is now one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases and about a quarter of all its climate pollution is produced by growing crops and related uses of the land that includes the clear-cutting of forests for grazing methane from cattle and the vast amounts of fossil fuels and chemicals it often takes to run a farm at the same time the warming is changing growing seasons and giving rise to viruses and pests as these changes take hold were now seeing a wave of new efforts to use more sustainable methods to feed the planet seven point seven billion people with the population expected to swell by another two billion by 2050 there's an increasing urgency for sweeping changes to how we grow our food [Music] joining us to discuss these new agricultural practices are David Perry the president and CEO of indigo agriculture a boston-based firm that calls itself an agricultural technology company and Harvard Business School professor David Bell David Perry as an entrepreneur who has built businesses and other sectors such as pharmaceuticals and life sciences take us through how you came to focus on agriculture what are the primary challenges and what are the opportunities for your company and others in trying to nudge the industry to more sustainable or climate friendly practices I really spent the last 20 years of my life starting and running technology and biotech companies when my last company was purchased I had the opportunity to step back and think about what I wanted to do next and I concluded that focusing on the problems of food and agriculture or some of the biggest problems that face us as a society and as a planet and therefore you know a really worthwhile thing to focus on it helps that I grew up on a farm so I was probably biased in that direction to a certain extent but what I concluded from that time was that there are four big problems facing us from this perspective one is that the population is growing faster than agricultural production is growing so if we want to feed 10 billion people by 2050 we need to do something differently - is that the current methods of Agriculture are consuming a lot more of the earth's resources than we can afford to devote to that 3 is that the current methods of Agriculture are producing less and less healthy food as we focus on volume instead of quality you know they as one might expect the quality goes down and then finally farmers aren't making any money and about 40% of the people on the planet are somehow involved in agriculture and a surprisingly large number of them live below the poverty line today David Bell you've studied all aspects of the food industry from farming to distribution to consumer habits what's the proverbial low-hanging fruit to cut emissions from the growing of crops to the plating of meals or restaurants I think the the low-hanging fruit for the food system is one in the farmer and I don't think we when we get talked further I don't the farmers a bad guy in this but farming does contribute a whole bunch and the other is the consumer I'm laying the blame for the other is the consumer you know operating ovens driving to restaurants driving to stores wastes huge potential there David Perry if there's a growing consensus in the industry that far more needs to be done to make agriculture more sustainable why is it taking so long for many businesses to act and what should regulators be doing to encourage them one is a I believe there is that consensus there sure a broad recognition in the agricultural industry that things have to fundamentally change despite that agriculture has been really slow to adopt new technologies and methods in fact in McKinsey every year ranks industries based on their technology adoption and in Agriculture's dead last of the large industries they're the why is something we've spent a lot of time thinking about we can easily say what it's not it's not size of Industry so agriculture is third or fourth largest industry in the world depending on the year it's not important you know we depend on agriculture multiple times per day to continue our livelihood and it's not the technology itself the same technologies that are driving other industries like computing power networking DNA sequencing the development of sensors all apply equally well degra culture so that technologies are available they just haven't been applied it's our belief that a big part of the reason for that is the system itself agriculture is a commodity or agriculture system is set up as a commodity so most farmers get paid for the bushels of grain that they produce bushels of corn of week without regard to how that produce is produced or what the quality is assuming it meets certain specs and that of course removes the incentive for farmers to focus on those things they get paid for volume so they invest in methods and technologies that will enable them to produce more but not in the things that allow them to produce better or in a more sustainable way and I think you know that system is gonna have to change for us to see real progress here but as soon as it does change you know there's a lot of things stacked up that should enable really rapid progress but are there any actions that you think policymakers a regulator should be should be taking here to encourage them to press them yeah that mean there's there's two ways we could approach this problem we could provide economic incentives for the behaviors that we want or we could provide regulations to try to restrict the behaviors we don't want farmers are very difficult to regulate both both because of their mindset you know hit all generalizations are wrong but if you were gonna make a generalization about farmers they're very independent and they value that independence greatly and they're also a diverse group that's really hard to monitor and so forth so you know my strong belief and in Indigo's mindset is the way we solve these problems is providing incentives that we want rather than regulations to prevent and you know we can do that both from the both from the government side and from consumers and consumer focused brands what are some examples of incentives that would be effective one of the most interesting things here from my perspective is the the power that agriculture has to fundamentally impact climate change for the better so we talked about the way it's contributing to the problem but the ability of agricultural soils to sequester atmospheric carbon co2 is enormous to put it in perspective if we could take every acre on earth that's coal debated and get it from where it is today which is about 1% carbon up to around 3% carbon which is probably where it was before we cultivated it we could we could capture every molecule of co2 the human beings have put into the atmosphere since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution now there's a lot of assumptions in there obviously but it gives you a sense of the size of the potential solution here agricultural soils are an enormous potential sink for atmospheric carbon if we worked for example to pay farmers to practice agriculture in such a way that it sequestered carbon and we know how to do it something like $20 per ton of co2 I think would provide the right incentives and we could see an enormous shift in farming practices towards methods that sequester carbon in the soil David Bell do you have any thoughts about how that might actually be translated into some kind of policy how that would actually work and and any other examples of other ways that you've seen farms doing this the right way well USDA has incentives to get farmers to lay some land fallow to rotate crops to things that they haven't been doing Italy installing barriers to stop erosion of soil I'm not sure what the uptake of that has been but it's a step in the right direction to give farmers a financial incentive to treat land well I do agree that if we're going to take the carbon out of the atmosphere it has to obviously us to go somewhere the moment is going into the oceans or staying in the air the land is an obvious place if we could put some of the trees back that have been clear-cut it over the last 40 years or whatever that is obviously another great possible sink but the land is is definitely an opportunity David Perry you have mentioned how we need to make the agricultural industry based less on commodities so that farmers aren't just compensated as you said for producing a bushel of corn but that they're making more money by producing a bushel with less impact on the environment can you tell us what you mean when you talk about D commoditizing the industry and how that might happen let's start by talking about how we got here you know agriculture is about ten thousand years old for the vast majority that time farmers knew exactly who they were producing food for it was only about a hundred years ago that we changed that system so during that time the turn of the last century people were moving off of farms in into urban environments so we had to set up a system that allowed us to grow food far from where it was needed store it transported by rail or ship and then get it on the on the table of the consumers and so to do that we created a commodity system so that every bushel assuming it met a certain number of certain specs was worth the same so it was really effective like you know that system has worked and in fed billions of people but we've come a long way in the last hundred years and technologies now allow us to do things like track the way that grain is produced on a field by field basis and provide traceability all the way from the farm to its ultimate destination and if we implement those practices now the buyers of grain for example wheat can can specify certain things perhaps it's the quality that we I want a minimum protein spec or I want wheat that's grown from a certain type of seeds because I believe that will produce better flour or I want it grown in a way that sequester's more carbon in the soil then gets emitted so that's actually carbon positive technology now allows that to happen the direct connection of buyers to farmers and the traceability of the goods from the farm to the buyer once we put that in place we've now D commoditized agriculture and you know created the footing for a really dramatic change David Bell agriculture may be the most subsidized industry with all kinds of governments port for crops and investments why shouldn't we effectively be paying farmers to be reducing their emissions well again I challenge the premise a bit that agriculture is heavily subsidized the subsidy is relative to the amount of money we're talking about farmers by and large are not wealthy people and the subsidies come in the form of historically came in the form of crop insurance so if you had a terrible year farmers can't afford a terrible year and so you have subsidies from the government but the WTO twenty years ago whenever it was said this government's cannot subsidize particular crops you can't give subsidies in a way that make farmers want to grow one crop or another so you have to be agnostic one way of being agnostic is to give farmers subsidies to help their farm be more sustainable much of the land in the United States and and across the world is is being operated by farmers these are the people that are in charge of our environment by and large and so I think that depends on government priorities but I think that the government giving incentives to farmers to make their land sustainable is a good thing the other incentive is from manufacturers as as David was saying and then factors who want to deliver to their customers certain types of wheat or certain products with certain characteristics can contract with farmers or give incentives to farmers to produce what it is they want and that's probably more powerful incentive David Perry your company indigo agriculture has plans to use microbes to replace pesticides and other natural means to reduce the need for artificial fertilizers can you tell us about those efforts what's new about them and how viable they are in the near future and on a large scale so it's important to recognize that the what we think of today as modern or conventional agriculture is also relatively recent it was it was only post-world War two you know the last time we were worried about a growing population exceeding our ability to to produce food resulted in what's called now known as the Green Revolution perhaps somewhat ironically and the result of the Green Revolution was a focus on seed plant breeding and the resulting improved seeds fertilizer production especially nitrogen fertilizer production which was a relatively new technology created in World War two and the use of chemical pesticides insecticides fungicides and herbicides and so you know these these methods really took hold in the middle of mid 1900s and are practiced widely today again they were effective so you know the adoption of the methods advocated for in the Green Revolution probably allowed us to feed a billion people we couldn't have fed otherwise but technologies come a long way since then specifically we now understand that a lot of those techniques and tools aren't very good for either us as consumers or the environment you know nitrogen produces runoff that's causing algae blooms and lakes and streams and and dead zones and oceans we've got co2 that we just talked about we've got pesticide residue in our food and we've got new alternatives so microbiology is one of those really just in the last 10 or 15 years largely through focus on human health we've realized that every single organism has microbes inside of it and those microbes are necessary for the larger organized organism to both reproduce and thrive and that's true in humans and it's true in plants in fact over the last 200 million years plants and organisms have evolved so that there are microorganisms that that protect plants against pretty much every stress that plant might encounter whether it's drought or sort of environmental stresses or whether it's disease or insects and so what indigo and and other scientists like us are doing is identifying those microbes in nature that have already evolved the capability to protect plants against these things and using these natural solutions that are already in the environment they're already in our food supply all we have to do is concentrate them and apply them where the stresses are to to be able to you know improve the yields of plants protect them against stress and I'm in a healthier and more sustainable way and can you give us some sense of how that this actually works in practice and how far along you are we we now have you know come microbes commercialized and coating seeds on over a million acres in the world so we've we've made a lot of progress and we we expect that number to be close to four million by the end of 2019 it is quite a revolution really that the old technology use of spray fertilizer over the fields willy-nilly but you're putting it actually on the seed so that that you're not wasting it's it's like drip irrigation where you you're bringing the water to exactly where it's needed you're bringing the fertilizer and other vehicles precisely to the seed are there any adverse reactions that you're finding to the introduction of microbes well no is the short answer and a big part of that is we're not really introducing them again everything we're using we're finding in nature so these are things that are already found in these crops and already found in our food supply really all we're doing is concentrating them where they're necessary where they're needed so we do a lot of safety testing but but the presumption of safety is pretty strong because we're not creating anything modifying anything or introducing anything into the environment that's not already there can I go back to something David was talking about earlier which is commoditizing food in the same period that production has taken off over the last hundred years yield has taken off over the last hundred years the price of food or put in another way they the percent of household expenditures going onto food has gone down from like 40 percent to 10 percent and nobody want nobody want to pay more for anything nobody want to pay more for food but if people didn't pay more for food this could allow farmers to have the luxury of spending more in the farms again I'm not really talking about subsidies of farms but there is a trend these days for people to be more educated about food and I think as people become more educated about foods they'll be more discerning and be more willing like other things like willing to pay more for foods they like their foods they think are healthy that money will get passed down the chain David Perry your company has been building a digital marketplace to connect farmers directly to buyers allowing farmers to get paid more for catering to the buyers specific requests can you tell us how that works and why you see this as a means of promoting sustainability and reducing emissions and and you had mentioned that the makers of Budweiser were involved in this as well tell us a little bit about that well we talked earlier about you know the promise of D commoditizing agriculture and what that would mean if farmers could get paid for producing things of higher quality and more sustainably so our hypothesis was that if you directly connect the buyers who already want these things with farmers who are capable of producing it for a price then you effectively are d commoditizing agriculture you're allowing every farmer to produce what the consumer wants which means instead of a commodity it's a specialty product with a greater margin and so we set up an e-commerce platform that we call indigo marketplace we launched this in September of last year so just about six months ago we now have about 8,000 farmers who've put up for sale almost twelve billion dollars worth of crop we have thousands of buyers representing about 16 billion dollars worth of current demand and marketplace and we're doing tens of millions of transactions each week it's literally the fastest growing thing I've ever been associated with how unique is this David Belle I mean is there any example of this kind of thing so one example we wrote about this year is on Zespri it's the New Zealand Kiwi Growers Association like all farmers not all farmers most farmers most farmers very small you know they're in the middle of the United States or in the middle of New Zealand or wherever it is and the history of the kiwi fruit industry has been bad you know low prices farmers competing as well anyway they set up a for-profit co-op run by people with marketing experience and the front-end marketing organization is now passing back to farmers what it is that consumers want and they pay farmers according to whether they're producing that the farmers are right on this and now they're producing fruits earlier or sweeter or the sudden the other the quality cycle that David was talking about cuts off the farmer from the consumer so they have no incentive they have no knowledge to grow anything but what they're growing and I think as as retailers as food companies start to realize that the consumer is more educated they will be passing on to the farmer more precise requirements will start to eat away at the commodity business and we're seeing this with anheuser-busch today to continue in the beer Thea so so about two or three weeks ago we announced that anheuser-busch will be buying 2.2 million bushels of rice from us through marketplace specifically they're looking for rice that's produced with less nitrogen fertilizer using less water and having fewer greenhouse gas emissions and they're paying about a 15% premium for that so it's a perfect example of a you know a consumer focused brand a blue-collar consumer focused brand recognizing a need in being willing to pay farmers for producing them why is anheuser-busch and other companies why are they willing to spend more money on something that you know maybe they're their customers don't care about or know about well it goes back to honeycomb one possibility is that they they really do care about I probably do care about the ingredients but it really to care from environmental point but the greens but I bet it's really consumer interest as as I certainly there was a beer drinker that the craft beer business is taking off like crazy and people are always looking for an edge in appealing to consumers of beer is different because of I mean you know Budweiser has produced a mainstream beer for four hours line now as long as I know but now the game is different and the game is moving towards custom custom foods custom beers and you need to find an edge and you can often find the edge with a farmer for your company and to go agriculture what what is your ultimate goal what what are you trying to do where do you hope to be in a few years well we we describe our mission is harnessing nature to help farmers sustainably feed the planet and there's three key pillars to that improving farmer profitability improving environmental sustainability and improving consumer health if we're successful in by we I mean the the bigger we I think in in five or six years we could reduce fertilizer usage by half on indigo farms we can reduce insecticide and fungicide use by over ninety percent and we can improve farm profitability by billions of dollars if you look at the I'm going back to these yield graphs if you if you look at the yield of corn per acre in the United States it was flat from when records started in 1866 through 1920 and there's taken off like a rocket since then the US government had a policy of trying to increase food production get people to eat more if you look at photographs from the 1910 1920s people look very thin and that's changed and to a certain extent in the United States anyway there's over food production and now the emphasis from the government is on healthy eating rather than caloric eating and and I think that in the same way that science solved the yield problem the statistics are unbelievable I think science is now turning to the other question which is how to how be more sustainable at how we grow crops how do we grow healthier foods in the healthier ways I think I think science will will take up this challenge and be ever more productive and what would you say David Perry to folks who would be skeptical that you can do what you're what you're promising you know Jeff Bezos has a quote that he uses a lot which is something along the lines of if you want to be understood you probably shouldn't do anything innovative we're seeking to do things differently because we think there's an opportunity to make a significant positive change in the world be into skeptics we don't really pay much attention we just ask them to watch [Music] [Applause] and now a story from Harvard Business School professor Mike TOEFL the agriculture sector has adopted lots of technology in terms of seeds fertilizers and pesticides over the past decades to become much more productive but as David Perry indicated a McKinsey report reveals that the agriculture sector has been a laggard in adopting information technology and that represents a huge opportunity to make the sector even more efficient throughout the supply chain agriculture supply chains are complicated but let's simplify it into four stages where IT and biotech innovations can dramatically reduce its climate impact what we eat the seeds that get planted how they're grown and how crops are shipped along each step of this chain there are really exciting innovations going on that can reduce the climate impact of the agriculture industry first we're seeing some shifts in the foods we're seeking to eat plant-based meat alternatives like those sold by beyond meat and impossible foods are scaling at rapid rates with the backing of venture capital and a widely publicized IPO think of the impossible whopper served at Burger King and the number of people engaging in meatless days or who are vegan are also on the rise what about seeds as David Perry mentioned some seeds are being developed to thrive with less carbon based fertilizer also seeds are being developed to be more resilient to drought or sea water incursion as Syngenta is working on on the growing side regenerative agriculture practices like no-till farming have the potential to increase carbon content in soils which would enable agriculture to become a massive engine of carbon sequestration finally in the supply chain we lose nearly 30 percent of our food as waste which is a massive problem food waste is a third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions we need lots of innovation here one example is the organization called Daily table which provides a b2c solution that brings nutritious food that would otherwise be wasted to markets in low-income areas another company full harvest provides a b2b solution that delivers imperfect and surplus produce that would otherwise be wasted directly from farms to businesses like markets and restaurants so agriculture lagging in the use of information technology means there are tons of opportunities to improve efficiency and to create new businesses and business models that can be profitable while also dramatically reducing the climate impacts of food and agriculture that's it for climate rising this week in our next episode we'll look at where and how we buy food my customers are generally agnostic about what they put on their menus if the consumer wants pickled beets they will sell pickled beets they may be today tied up with their brand with the certain products that they sell but they know that those brands can evolve and have evolved over the histories of these companies and they're able to adapt thanks for joining us I'm your host David Abel this is climate rising podcast produced by Harvard Business School you can subscribe on Apple podcasts or wherever you listen and please
