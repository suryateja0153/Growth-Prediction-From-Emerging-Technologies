 hello good evening and welcome welcome  to the event digital field trip with   alexandra daisy ginsberg and josef settele - a  collaboration between science notes magazine   and state studio as part of berlin science  week. welcome from hypertopia welcome   from state studio an art science gallery and  exhibition laboratory that has been opened in   2018 as a space for artists and scientists and  curious others to explore the creative friction   between art and science and rethink  the questions that shape our tomorrow. in challenging and desperate times like this  when it seems that nothing less is at stake than   renegotiating the very relationship that we have  with our planet we are desperately looking for new   questions new answers new ways of thinking  and new modes of operating such new impulses   are often found at the intersection where to  seemingly disconnected fields in the collide   such an intersection where interesting things  emerge is certainly the intersection between   the fields of the arts and the sciences over the  last couple of years a lot of really stunning   and exciting projects of collaborations  between artists and scientists have emerged and this very fascinating  intersection is also the topic of   tonight's event. we want to investigate and  explore together how the arts and the sciences   can come together to create meaningful  new impulses for a sustainable future hypertopia as an exhibition has been  opened on october 23rd just one week   before the lockdown and it shows exciting  works of artists working at the intersection   of science and arts that anticipate a  post-crisis future to explore approaches   for a meaningful present currently unfortunately  we're close due to the covert regulations so   we're even more happy and excited to be able  to present to you tonight this digital event   as part of berlin science week this event is  part of the discourse program of hypertopia   the general idea of the discourse program is  to take the exhibition and its artistic works   as a starting point for further discussions  and together with partners explore the extended   context and the questions behind the different  perspectives the starting point for today's event   is the work designing for the sixth extinction by  alexandra daisy ginsberg which you're seeing just   in the back of me right now. It is a really  amazingly inspiring work which invites us to   dive deeper into the past and possible futures of  synthetic biology and biodiversity we're very very   excited about a very special guest of this evening  professor dr josef settele one of the world's   leading experts on the topic of biodiversity  as i said the event is a collaboration between   science notes and and state studio and we  started to collaborate with science nodes as   state studio since our opening in 2018 we  wanted to go forward to produce a event   together since the very beginning and tonight is  finally the first time that we're gonna do that   so i'm really happy about this i'm really  excited to be presenting this event together with   science notes tonight to you and i'm  super excited also to have with us tonight   the publishing director of science notes thomas  susanka whom i would love to hand over right now. hi chris and hi everybody it's great to be  here virtually in the state studio finally   yeah i've been looking forward to this very much  as well in fact today very much because i don't   have to refresh my browser and worry about the  election in the us which of course will has also   implications for the topic of tonight but yeah i'm  looking forward to not thinking about that for two   hours and i'm looking forward to like what we do  tonight right we will let art and science collide   and hopefully create some ideas and  visions for the sustainable future and   the futures and possible futures of biodiversity  so here at science nodes magazine what we try to   do at the science notes project we explore  new ways of science journalism right and   bring science on stage and or in this case  virtually and we love using powerful science   stories with illustration with photography  with music and with art and so it's great   that we finally meet here together and on our  last issue in fact we we dove into the oceans   and explored the science of of the oceans and its  implications for also for by world biodiversity   and our next stop will take us into the wilderness  and in fact that journey starts tonight right   we hope to include some pieces of hypertopia  exhibition in that issue but tonight is in   fact the first starting point of our exploration  of the wilderness and it's it's just great to   have like two fantastically fitting people here a  highly remarkable stunningly visionary artist and   together with as you already said chris with one  of the world's most prolific researchers in the   field of biodiversity so i'm really super excited  looking forward to it and i don't want to talk too   much because it's not about me it's about about  the two people that follow so everybody have fun thanks thomas so yeah what's what's awaiting  us tonight the schedule of the evening   is as such we will start with a guided  tour through the exhibition of hypertopia   which then is followed by a 50-minute life  talk and introduction by professor dr youssef   settler into the topic of biodiversity  from a scientific and political perspective   and then we will hear a 30-minute lecture  from the artist dr alexandra ginsberg   laying out her view on the relationship  between biodiversities synthetic biology   and the anthropocene after that the first part  of the evening closes and we go forward into the   second part the much more interactive part where  you are invited to join us on a little soon life   interaction where we will explore as a playful  thought experiment in small groups the possible   future of synthetic biodiversity and synthetic  biology together so let's get started let's get   started with a tour of the exhibition hypertopia  by my very dear colleague johanna wallenborn of   the artistic directors of the exhibition  hypertopia and co-founder of state studio welcome to state studio we are an art science  gallery based in berlin schöneberg and my name   is johanna wallenborn and i'm happy to present  our latest exhibition hypertopia to you today   so i'm going to be your guide and i'm going  to take you on a quick tour now so come on in. for his stories there were no shadows  echoes now that we are here where are we   still on the same planet for  sure but voices are shifting.   how did we get here, what stance should we  take, what actions. and where are we heading?   hypertopia is a journey between  past present and future.   it is a place that follows the question of how  the persistent moment of a perceived state of   emergency can transform the relationship between  man nature and technology in a way that opens up   niches of hope. the exhibition is inspired by  a vision of collective change and consciousness   and wants to explore a post-crisis future to  help pinpoint meaningful actions in the present.   with a selection of artistic positions  propositions and different exploratory projects   that incorporate scientific  methods and speculative ideas   hypertopia challenges hierarchies probes ideas and  imagine scenarios for a new planetary optimism.   hypertopia combines the notion of collective   consciousness with that of  the conscious collective   to bring awareness to the interdependence of  actions actors disciplines and different times. in the exhibition space symbiotic coexistence  confronts instrumentalized ecosystems in a   biosynthetic future data activism meets  fictional narratives from non-humans   and humans are dissected and reassembled  in search of the origin of our being. the exhibition includes works by himali sing  soin, ani liu, dominic koch, jana maria dohman,   oriana persico and salvatore iakonesi, the  curious minds and alexandra daisy ginsberg. i would like to introduce the work of alexandra  daisy ginsberg designing for the extinction. in   her work the artist investigates the potential  impact of synthetic biology on biodiversity and   conservation while conservationists struggle  to reverse the effects of the anthropocene   and protect endangered species bioengineers and  synthetic biologists are working on engineering   new organisms in designing for the sixth  extinction ginsberg opens up this possible   future where companion species are designed to  support endangered species and organisms while   taking an ambiguous look at what would the wild   look like in a biosynthetic future and can  we actually preserve by looking forward. in this version of the future ginsberg  proposes different types of companion species   including a slug that leaves a trail of alkali to  neutralize acidic soil this mobile bioremediation   unit is designed to neutralize high  soil acid levels caused by pollution   the chassis is designed to disturb the  topsoil as it moves outlets on its lower   surface disperse an alkali hydroscopic so  a fluid that absorbs moisture from the air   it can replicate up to 10 times but it has a kill  switch or a pathogenic pump to treat the infection   that causes sudden oak death at full inflation the  membrane pump pushes serum into the infection site   post-injection the pump deflates  decouples and spores are released   the device operates using a six-space dna code  that produces synthetic materials to prevent   ingestion by natural organisms these fictional  design species are ecological machines that fill   the void left by vanished organisms or offer novel  protection against more harmful invasive species   diseases and pollution it makes us wonder could  we tolerate rewilding using synthetic biology   to make nature better and if nature is totally  industrialized for the benefit of society which   for some is the logical endpoint of synthetic  biology will nature still exist for us to save. thank you very much, johanna, for the for  the tour. i hope you got a little insight   into the exhibition and can take this  as a starting point and inspiration for   the further program of tonight with that  being said i would love to hand over to thomas   for the next part of tonight's program. yeah thanks chris yeah i'd like to introduce   our first speaker professor joseph settele.  he's here and i'm happy to see him again.   he was already a speaker at science notes  at the club event a couple of years ago and   well there's so many things about him that i could  say right now but i just want to give you like   two two things first is what's he doing in the  first place and well he he was heading the report   of the intergovernmental platform on  their biodiversity and ecosystem services   and that is something that most people don't even  ever have heard of right and everybody knows the   ipcc and the ipbs that is this right same thing  for biodiversity so it's a really fascinatingly   crazy work that they are doing because  they what they do is they connect the dots   of all the biodiversity researchers around the  globe and so josef told me about what he's doing   and this is just an impressive work they connect  so many studies and they help actually to build   this broad picture that we have for biodiversity  so all that we know about the state of the world   today in terms of biodiversity that's thanks  to the ipbs and and thanks to to the work of   professor settele so this is really remarkable  and so it's really exciting in the context of   the topic of tonight to have him speak about  that and the other thing is that i still have   in mind that he's a true biologist and his focus  of research is butterflies and so when he was   at our first event he showed us some pictures of  him as a young man with a net running through the   through the meadows and collecting butterflies  and he's one of these types of scientists that can   really make you engaged with the science and they  open your eyes for the wonders of nature and it's   manifold interconnections and dependencies and  intricacies and by telling these stunning stories   like very local stunning stories of butterflies  and wasps and how they and ants in fact how   they interconnect and how they depend on  each other that's what made me remind like   why it is so important to to look at biodiversity  and to develop ideas for for a future where we   can protect biodiversity and and yeah  develop ideas for for sustainability so   it's i'm looking forward to to your talk professor  zachary it's great to have you here again and yeah   zoom is yours okay thank you thomas pleasure  to be here so i will try to make my best   it's not so much about the nitty-gritty details  today the ones you mentioned but it's kind of   the big pictures right to draw and it's based on  the work we have done in the recent four years   of a large team of people so i tried to get my  presentation started let's see how it works.  can you see it now okay it's the wrong one it's  the one if the you could just see one slide or   you see many slides okay okay so here's my name  once again and just by the way if somebody wants   to have some more information you can contact  me by the email and i tend to answer most of   the emails in the reasonable time frames put it  like this i'm doing this presentation on behalf   of many of my colleagues but especially of my  host institution which is ufc in germany and idif   the center for integrative biodiversity research  and i talk about this ipes or global assessment   on biodiversity and ecosystem services about  the main findings we had in this report   this is the summary for policymakers which we  have approved in the process like in the ipcc   where all the partner governments which are around  140 governments now agree sentence by sentence on   a common text which kind of summarizes the work  we've done over the years which in total is 1   600 site pages the original text but this  one is only 40 pages that will just try to   extract some of the main points but first of all  it's teamwork so that's the core team working on   this one and i had a pleasure training with a  colleague from brazil with an anthropologist   eduardo brandisio another colleague from argentina  sandra diaz working on social systems and awesome   planned ecology to work together with the two of  them so the three of us said the honor pleasure   duty task whatever you might call it to let's say  coordinate this bunch of people it's like a big   ant mount something like this it's 150 core offers  an additional 350 other offers invoices 500 people   who worked on this report and many others out  there who made comments and provided material   so some of the main findings we had have  been summarized in quite some pr events   last year and the main thing is that the biosphere  and the atmosphere upon which humanity as a whole   depends have been deeply reconfigured by  people so three quarters of the land area is   very significantly altered two-thirds of the ocean  area is experiencing increasing cumulative impacts   and we have lost more than 85 percent of wetlands  ever since men took over the kind of let's say   rule of this of this of this planet relates to  today's topic this kind of let's say the signs   of a six extinction crisis we are not yet there  so let's say six extinction is still not happening   but we are on the way to it it's about extinction  here you can see some statistics on certain groups   of amphibians and other mammals and birds we can  see in the last fifty two hundred years we had a   dramatic increase in the cumulative number of  species or percentage of species which got extinct   so amphibians at the moment we lost 2.5  which doesn't sound a lot but it's at   least 150 species out of 6 000 but it's just the  starting point of things which are ongoing now   you can see on the bottom there is the  baseline the natural extinction which   also takes place is greyish bar it's  quite different from what we experience   so in summary the global extinction rate is  at least tens to hundreds of times higher   than it has ever been on average over the last 10  million years and that's a big human impact here   we also looked at other things so they called  nature's contributions to people or some call it   services different categories of ecosystem  functioning which we use for our human well-being   let's say number two for example well known as  the pollination part but many others regulation   of air quality or fresh water quality etc going  as far down as the let's say cultural aspect like   learning inspiration or supporting identities  and maintainers of options is number 18 and all   of them show in the last 50 years or the majority  of them shows a deep decline in their let's say   way how they can support us so in summary taking  these 18 elements is 18 services the potential of   nature to contribute continuously and sustainably  to a good quality of life for humans has decreased   in nearly all investigated contributions  these are 14 out of 18. so that's the kind   of ecosystem component which is important here  which is heavily based of course on biodiversity   so you can summarize we have we have dramatically  reconfigured the fabric of life of the planet   and we also pointed out there in much  more detail of course the world is   becoming much more interconnected yet  and increasingly unequal so we have more   connectedness but also much more inequality  across the globe but also on local scales we also try to look at how we can  meet the global societal goals   through urgent concerted efforts and we  have to address direct drivers of change   which have accumulated accelerated during the last  50 years to levels unprecedented in human history   and these direct drivers are across the  different biomes across terrestrial fresh   water and marine life are mainly land use and sea  use chains for the last 50 years until now direct   exploitation which in the fish in the marine  party's fisheries for example climate change   already posing a threat already number three up  to now and it will surely increase and overtake   some of the others in the future it's pollution  it's also invasive species number five which have   been mentioned as before in the exhibition  as one example of a very important aspect   but what's more important of course meeting  these societal goals has we need let's say   concerted efforts to addressing us the root causes  the indirect drivers of nature deterioration   and these are the ones which relate  to social values about our life about   the way we act about demography about culture  about economic and technological components   institutions governance and also conflicts all  these things are the let's say the basic the   background course of all the things we  experience which needs a big effort for   the whole society across very different parts of  society including arts including science including   agriculture whatever it is they all have to be  included here so the main points are the change   of governance the economic systems equity and very  important component it's also about cross-sector   planning it's about incentives and last but not  least it's about social narratives and values so   what are we aiming for are we going for the best  gdp for a somatic product are we going for human   well-being and i think we need a shift here in  our attitude towards how we deal with our planet we also made some scenario work and we said that  plausible scenarios which include transformative   change i come to this in the moment are compatible  with the 2030 sustainability objectives that's the   sdgs sustainability development goals and 2050  vision for biodiversity important components are   changes in production consumption of energy and  food it's a low to moderate population growth   and it's nature friendly and socially fair climate  adaptation and mitigation because there are also   conflicts there we have to deal with land with our  resource which is limited and we have to produce   foods we want to conserve biodiversity we want  to let's say compensate for climate failures we   had etc so the options for our future that's the  transformative change part requires a fundamental   system-wide reorganization of technological  economic and social factors including paradigms   targets and values i had this before already  our narratives are very important here   so in a nutshell if you summarize the entire  report we can say the most comprehensive global   picture of the links within nature and  people in the recent times ever produced   the trends we explored are worrying and clearly  unsustainable and it's a call for action we need   prompt action go further and faster we have to  tackle the root courses i mentioned of nature's   deterioration and we need coordination  and integration across sectors and scales   so having said this i would like to go a  bit into the detail of the process because   some people might know about the report but only  a few people know what's behind it so what was   the background what was the effort we did so the  summary which i mentioned in the beginning for   policy makers the 40-page document as i said was  done in a concerted effort across the government   and across science sentence by sentence  which was agreed as a consensus document   then you're sitting here in a big  room you have the text in front of you   and you go line by line and each government can  make a comment and finally hopefully agree on the   text of the one sentence and you continue that's  a matter of lots of patience and lots of diplomacy   and also physical let's say a good condition  is also required in the work that's my working   place here the food supply is a bit limited  an apple and some water you're trying to get   comments from your colleague by the email and on  the laptop and also watch what's out there in the   in the in the hall or people asking you  what are the questions you have to answer   and if there are things you can't agree then  there are so-called breaks the lunch break   for example doesn't mean you go for lunch  you just stay there and discuss with your   colleagues from different governments to agree on  certain topics and come back with a solution for   the text which have been has not been agreed  beforehand so you have to agree on this one   it's a very long process it's a whole week of  working from morning until late in the night   you go out there to discuss graphs so i had this  graph which i have just shown a while ago that   was a negotiation just on the graphs one day we  took one day only for 11 figures to get them right   we redone the whole figures overnight and  discuss them again the adopted version for   the trusted version the next day for another  whole day if you're lucky then finally you end   up in the plenary that's the one here and you  agree on this figure it's a consensus document   then you go to the press there was a media launch  that was also on the may 6 200 2019 with bob   watson who was the chair of ipes and some other  colleagues for example from unesco you present   something this was a picture taken by a colleague  by a friend of mine a journalist actually from a   newspaper in germany from that site and he has  asked me a question he sent me this picture and   actually how he looked at me by asking me from his  office was like this so just sitting there relax   and say okay let's ask him some nasty questions  we were sitting there in this kind of press hall   with 80 journalists in in the place and 700 online  and they just try to squeeze something out of you   in the end it was worth the effort so on the same  day there was an invitation with macro here that   was in the lsa palace it was one hour exchange  about the state of biodiversity about the things   politicians can do and he took up quite a  lot of the information we have assembled in   a joint activity between governments and  science there was a big kind of press in   the next week's headlines all across the globe  mainly focusing on the extinction of species so   we said we have one million species which are  thrown to extinction if you don't counteract   it's important to have this counteraction as a  component so at the moment we are not yet there   but we are on the way to lose at least one eighth  of the species on the globe if you really don't   react and encounter in a different direction you  have different responses here also in social media   there was pope francis there was greater humber  called hillary clinton you name it justin trudeau   or al gore so everybody seems to be aware of  this kind of phenomenon this kind of problem   it also goes up to the economy so the world  economic forum this spring this february actually   in in their voice highlighted the most important  global risks actually the likelihood and the   impacts and there are different groups of people  judging on this one the one is multi-stakeholders   known as global shapers but all they all  came up with was that biodiversity loss   is on the top four issues we have to deal  with also from an economic viewpoint and   it's very similar if you look at the other one  which is climate action failure so climate and   biodiversity surely are two of the most important  components we have to deal with also to serve our   economy to serve our well-being in the longer  term having said this i'm of course an optimist   i will just publish this book tomorrow which is in  german but it's a kind of writer of let's say my   personal view on things which combines climate  loss climate change species loss and pandemics   which is also an important component which has  lots to do with biodiversity if this i want   to thank you for your attention i hope it's some  good input for the things you're doing and i guess   this link between science and art is really one  of the let's say important interesting challenging   and also let's say nice things we have to do also  to solve the problems strongly thank you very much thank you very much josef i think chris i think we should just like really  let this sit here and maybe directly connect this   to to to the our topic because just what joseph  said at the end is that it's really important to   bring the fields together and then create ideas  i think the urgency is is pretty much clear so   let's just move on directly to to daisy ginsberg  chris i had it over to you thomas thanks thanks   let's do that and yeah let's also take this really  as a starting point for for further reflection i   it's it was really fascinating to see also the  social dynamics that's behind such such political   important decisions and and really what's at stake  with with biodiversity and professor settler you   mentioned the importance of social norms and  values and you know renegotiating how we go   about dealing with our relationship to nature  and that's exactly what what alexandra daisy   ginsberg is is working on so i'm really excited  to be able to introduce her as our next speaker   dr alexandra daisy ginsberg is a world-renowned  artist working at the intersection of art design   technology and sustainability her works  are often created and conceptualized   in exchange in collaboration with researchers  and often times also with tech companies   where she examined examines our fraud  relationship with nature and technology   she explores subjects as diverse as artificial  intelligence synthetic biology conservation and   evolution and she investigates as one of her main  themes our human impulse to better the world she   reads architecture at the university of cambridge  and design at harvard received the masters   of design interactions at the royal college of  arts in london and has been exhibited all around   the world her works are shown in places such as  moma in new york the museum of contemporary arts   in tokyo the center pompidou and the royal academy  she received the word technology award for design   in 2011 and the london design medal for emerging  talent in 2012 and she's currently also one of   the nominees for the falling walls science and the  arts prize i'm really excited to have daisy's talk   tonight with us the talk has been pre-recorded as  daisy is currently spending time in the english   countryside with limited access to to a stable  internet connection so what you will see here has   been recorded this week so with no further ado  i'd love to invite you to dive into the work of   alexandra daisy ginsberg it's great to be with you  this evening i'm sorry we're not all together in   person i'm actually up in the lake district in the  north of england at the moment so you can see the   posters behind me and this evening i'm going to  introduce might tell you a little bit about the   piece designing for the sixth extinction which  is in the exhibition hypertopia at state studios i want to talk to start by  talking about solutionism   this is a term which has been adopted and  defined by the technology critic f jenny   morizov and it's this idea that humans can  solve difficult problems using technology   and he's written about it in the  context especially of silicon valley and there's a sort of overriding  belief in silicon valley that   we can solve the problems that society creates  just by creating new technologies so for example   amazon packages being stolen from your front door  can be solved by creating something like a ring   doorbell so you can pretend to be at home and  deter burglars or at least film the thefts and   even the most enormous problems can be solved we  just need the right technologies so the kind of   greatest extent of this is the  idea of geoengineering that we   can intervene on a global scale to mitigate  to mitigate the effects of climate breakdown   and this you know is such a huge decision and we  cannot know the unintended consequences of such   an act and you know the questions of how we would  even reach a global consensus on such a decision   remain unanswered so this idea that our faith and  technological solutions is enough avoids these   social or other complicated political mechanisms  that we need to address problems and underpinning   this is the optimistic belief that problems can  or could be solved and that these problems should   be solved that life should be frictionless and  trouble free we don't need to deal with or think   about the environmental or social consequences or  the demands that will get us to a complex solution   solutionism is utopian this idea that all humans  want the same thing that we all have the same   dreams and we will all be treated equally  in the process of making the world better   according to those setting the visions it doesn't  take the complexity into consideration of human   societies let alone the complex ecosystems  that we live admit amidst on this planet and underlying this is the idea that  design and technology can make things   better and we can leave to one side here designs  entrapment in capitalist systems of production   we design stuff for landfill and that's really  been the emergence of design from the industrial   revolution the idea that we design or the  the job of the designer sort of emerged   to differentiate one set of products from  another that's not really the core idea of   design because designers solve problems  but i'm quite sort of fascinated by this   fundamental desire to design this utopian  belief that we can make the world better   herbert simon the political scientist described  design as a process to change existing conditions   to preferred or better ones which is what the  sociologist richard howes calls a utopian impulse but what about problems that are so big  that designers or anyone can't solve them   what does it mean to solve a problem  like human induced climate breakdown   and biodiversity collapse can it even be  solved a reusable bottle rather than a   single use bottle is a small step but this is a  bit like rearranging the chairs on the titanic   the changes needed at the scale of social systems  values elections which is pretty pertinent today   and international agreements and challenging  this fundamental incompatibility of a vision of   sustainability and the reality of growth that our  economy relies on gross domestic product or gdp is   our universal measure of better in 2020 that's how  we measure whether countries are getting better   so we all take a role in changing the course of  of the future that we're part of but tonight i   really want to talk more fundamentally in about  this idea of this better nature that we imagine there's an imaginary that's being created of of  a sort of identic nature and is that what we're   talking about when we want to make nature better  we're talking about going back to this place   going backwards and some might say that  we just need to remove us from the picture   and i think there was an interesting discussion  last year around paul antonelli's broken nature   exhibition at the milan trinale which  described as a path to a more elegant   extinction for humanity but that's not a hopeful  position which is why i think there was some   backlash to that proposition  although it is a fascinating one   and i think it's not necessarily pessimistic to  imagine that we can't make things better but i   think we're optimists as a human i get out of  bed even if the world looks pretty dismal and i   think 2020 is a pretty dismal year but the fact  that we can imagine it otherwise that it could   somehow be better is fundamental to being human  and ernst's block explored this perhaps unique   trait of human hopefulness in the principles of  hope his seminal work which was written in some   of the darkest years of the 20th century during  the 1930s and 1940s even if we think that things   are bad means that we think a better world is  possible humans are hopeful animals so it may   not be possible to make the world better but we  should at least try but what is a better world   and i wrote my phd about this question of better  i became fascinated as i heard technologists   entrepreneurs designers and advertising campaigns  politicians talking about making things better i   began to wonder what was better who's better  was being delivered and who gets to decide   i'd come to this space through my exploration of  a field of techno science called synthetic biology   which is now is not so new but at the time was a  new approach to genetic engineering which i first   heard about in 2008 and i was fascinated because  engineers were coming into biology and promising   to make biology easier to engineer and it seemed  to me that they were promising to transform   biology and life with it into a 21st century  design discipline and i wanted to know what   would they design what would good design be and  who would get to decide and since 2008 i've been   to developing a practice to find ways to ask these  questions forcing me to reflect on my role in it   as well but really trying to understand this  human desire to alter nature to make it better and the provocation i originally made of  biologists as designers has become increasingly   real and from the beginning i heard synthetic  biologists promising a better future and i wanted   to know what was better to them and i began to  realize that within this community of engineers   and scientists better had very different meanings  with very different visions and values attached   so synthetic biology emerged around 1999 as its  visionary engineers sought to make biology better   making it easier to engineer by their definition   the idea that you could engineer dna like a form  of code was sort of fundamental to this practice   you'd be able to design code and program biology  to do useful things for humans bringing biology   under human control meant that even undergraduates  can use it to make useful things for people this   image here is a very early example of that it's  a plate of bacteria that have been engineered to   go dark when exposed to light like photographic  film this is 16 years old from 2004   around 2005 i think a second meaning  of better began to emerge that this   new better biology could make the world better  engineers and scientists started to engineer   microbes to do things like produce fuel and  that was the dream that we would be able   to create biofuels and at the same time create  a world of sustainable abundance where we could   have what we want without changing our behaviors  we could link the economy to the environment and   consume without changing anything so sugar  cane grown in brazil could be used to power   jets and to sell this idea of better these  visionaries promised disruption but without   really disrupting anything and big oil was  investing in this the oil companies and   this was a vision that the same players could  create the same products but without changing   very much so we have the same systems in place  but and the same kinds of transport and the same   people making the money and nothing has really  changed except that we're growing sugarcane   and destroying forests and what happened with  that future was that bioengineering at the time   couldn't compete with oil prices and many of  these companies pivoted to making much more   expensive products by the litre so a gallon of  face cream is more valuable than a gallon of oil   but this green veneer that making things with  biology is naturally better i think still remains   and i also identified a third more radical meaning  of better and that is bettering nature itself   reinventing nature making nature better solving  its problems whether they're human created or not   and design begins to look like this and mosquito  engineered so it's progeny don't survive this is   made by a company called oxitec and has been  in trials and released into the environment   for years now and that is a beginning of  a spectrum to engineering ourselves to   changing our own nature and experiments  on gene editing human embryos are   well underway and with this come all sorts of  unintended societal consequences potentially and i became really interested in this third area  in 2013 when i went to a conference that was held   at cambridge university where conservationists  and synthetic biologists were meeting   for the first time they were discussing  essentially if they have anything in common or conversely would they be a problem  for each other and i was struck by   their wildly different ideas of what was better  conservationists are in a way looking backwards   trying to protect biodiversity from humanity  meanwhile the synthetic biologists are busy   inventing new biodiversity for the same benefit  of humanity and what i hadn't been aware of at   to this point were efforts actually to try and  combine these two fields so a very interesting   idea was being discussed at the meeting could  synthetic biology be used to infect nature   to save it for example engineering corals so  it could withstand warmer waters or to engineer   mosquitoes as i've mentioned before or to try and  combat avian malaria a disease wiping out birds   in hawaii for example i began to wonder  what would the wilds look like in this   synthetic biological future if we were engineering  organisms to preserve nature and that's the idea   behind the work designing for this extinction  which is in the exhibition at hypertopia i wanted to create a work that would be a method  to explore these questions and identify issues   and i was working independently but consulting  expert synthetic biologists and conversation   conservationists along the way and the process  of making the work and then presenting the work   to scientists for me is a way to actually  instigate discussion so i wanted to explore   how the stream of engineering nature that they  were proposing would be managed whose interests   would be served and what kinds of philosophical  ontological and administrative issues might arise   so the main part of the work is this large  photograph of a forest and there's a series of   smaller prints models and a timeline if you look  closer at the large image which in the exhibition   is is a large light box looking like a window out  into a forest you see this pristine biodiverse   forest but as you look closer you begin to see  unusual organisms lurking in the undergrowth   in the fiction that i created these companion  species would be designed to preserve biodiversity   and released into the wild the organisms  are described in the small images alongside   and with accompanying texts and they're described  only as machines and i purposely chose to use the   very instrumental language of patent applications  i was experimenting with what does it mean to take   away the living-ness of a life form and just  turn it into a machine so for example this   self-inflating anti-pathogenic membrane pump is  a kind of fungus that i've imagined that would be   designed to fight a very real tree pathogen called  sudden oak death for which no cure yet exists   the fungus-like device would inflate when it  detects disease and inject a pathogenic serum into   the tree that would help to mitigate the disease  now this is a fictional organism but within the   patent i reference very real ideas from synthetic  biology which i was collecting in my research   for example this device would work on an expanded  dna system so an expanded dna code with extra   bases like a different operating system and this  would separate it from nature in inverted commas   that's actually a very real technology that's  being created and does and it's been proposed   as a way to make design biology safer for  release as in theory would run differently   wouldn't be able to interact in the same way it's  a bit like mac versus os mac versus windows this   is the mobile bio remediation unit a slug-like  device that releases alkali slime to neutralize   acidic soils caused by pollution and with all  of these organisms that i imagined it contains   a kill switch which again is a very real idea  that is being developed and researched as a way to   limit the lifespan of engineered organisms so it  would have a way to terminate itself it would die so this is again sort of exploring this technical  language of the patent application as a way to remove our care from these organisms now this work builds an alternative  world to reveal problems and issues   and the timeline and that's very small on the  screen is a way that sort of reveals the research   behind this project and explores the processes  behind how something like this might happen   how current and past trends might emerge from past  and present decisions how this future might emerge   and at the at the sort of inflection point  in the center is this moment where synthetic   biologists and conservationists are having these  crucial discussions about the future of nature   i was curious though how things like  designing biology to kill itself   might be the outcome of an agreement where  different groups have to come together to actually   decide something a bit like geoengineering  how do you decide when you really can't know   all the consequences so in the right hand side  of the diagram is my exploration of the system   the kinds of institutions that might be created to  enable this process so biodesigners being hired by   corporations to engage in the form  of biodiversity offsetting which is   actually a current ecological practice where  one piece of land is available for development   and another piece of land can be remediated  to account for the loss of a pristine space this work looks utopian in the side in this  presentation that i've created nature is saved   with these new kinds of devices that are roaming  around freely but what's crucial for me and   and the way i've developed my practice over the  last sort of 10 15 years is that i really enjoy   troublemaking and by that i mean sort of using the  works as a provocation not just to the public or   general public like me but also back into the  field of science so i present my work to the   field to debate with those making decisions now  so these aren't speculative designs to explore   preferable futures but actually for me ways to  change potentially the present so when there were   headlines like synthetic creatures could save the  planet in discovery news and i got an email from   someone in the synthetic biology community who  was worried that promising that nature would be   saved would actually harm the future of synthetic  biology because the public might be disappointed   when scientists failed to save nature  and i was sort of accused of being   potentially ruining the future of the science  in some way by by another member of the field   but what's crucial is i wasn't actually promising  this but i was reflecting on synthetic biology's   own promises and taking using the work as a way  to take that back to the field to prompt further   reflection and i was really happy when  the editors of this scientific journal   fungal genetics and biology used one of  the images on the cover and they used   this image and referenced it in the  editorial as a way to prompt discussion   to their readers who are expert scientists  about what they should or shouldn't design   and i think that for me was a really kind  of big moment in my practice this was   about five years ago where i realized how  these works can be used for discussion   if we go back to this sort of edenic edenic  space i think what's really important to think   about here is that the organisms themselves didn't  choose their features in designing for the sixth   extinction we're choosing what gets to be made  and what gets to live and what doesn't you know   the ostrich didn't decide to grow a longer neck to  get a better vantage point over the other animals   the way that biology and biological evolution  works is an evolutionary relationship with context   but humans can imagine plan design and vision and  i think there's a very different set of forces   as a result of that and if we come back to this  question of what is better for nature we have to   remember that nature and we're part of that nature  doesn't really operate this way so better is a   human idea and although we're part of nature maybe  this this idea of anticipation of hopefulness   is something unique to us but i think it's also  crucial to remember that it has human values so we   and human measures better in nature really only  means survival across species not individuals so   we can add kill switches to organisms but  that's not then working in a natural way   but i think as we're facing the state of climate  emergency and biodiversity collapse we really   need to think differently and this is where  there's been a shift in my work in some way   since the designing for the sixth extinction  project because we have to be thinking   about our role in this natural world and  what's better for nature is better for us   i think in 2020 we're seeing multiple crises of  imagine of i think in 2020 we're seeing multiple   crises of health environment economy and social  injustice and i think there's also a crisis of   imagination and action and i'm trying to  continue to tease out these problems of   better in the work and the conflicts of modernity  and colonial action over the last few centuries   and also fundamentally how in our quest for new  and better we ignore value in what already exists   and i'm really curious why we feel loss for  certain species why we care and how we can create   artworks that really tease out a response and  a reflection on these questions so i'm sort   of working to continue to ask questions to tell  stories imagine alternatives but crucially also   to enable action we're going to share one other  project briefly that i made last year and is   sort of setting the stage for the next thing i'm  going to do which i can't talk about this evening   so this work is called resurrecting sublime  and it's a collaboration with christina   aguipakis who's the creative director of  gingko bioworks a biotechnology company   and synthetic biology company in boston and  the smell researcher and artist cecil tolas   and we've brought back the smell of three flowers  that were each made extinct by human colonial   action and the project started when christina  in 2016 went to the harvard university herbarium   she was looking for extinct flowers  in the shells there and she found 20   including these three and from each she  took tiny tissue samples from the pressed   dried flowers these were all flowers that  had been extinct for a few hundred years   she took the dna back to gingko and scientists  there with help from paleogeneticists   were able to extract dna and from these tiny  samples they developed the technology to   determine the smell molecules that each plant may  have produced the list of molecules were sent to   sizzle tolas in her lab and she reconstructed  the smells of each flower in her lab i'm going   to play a little bit of video now that evokes  the the one of the sites of these lost flowers so so that was the southern slope of mount haleakala  in hawaii and the flower that you saw very briefly   on that tree was a hibiscudelphus wilderianis  and that tree went extinct in 1912 so it's   the most recent extinction of the three flowers  that we explored and the simulation is built in   unreal engine a computer game engine and that  was an effort to try and imagine what that   place was like at the time of extinction because  these flowers weren't alone they were part of a   landscape and this image here is the albexilum  stipulatum the second flower which once grew on   a very small island in the ohio river in the  usa and that island itself has also now gone   the hibiscude elfis in hawaii was lost to colonial  cattle ranching as the lava forests were destroyed   and in this case the orbexian stipulatum  was lost before the island itself was lost   only grew in this one place and the island was  flooded when a dam was built in the 1920s so its   very particular habitat is gone each of these  flowers was intricately linked to a place and   what's unusual for me sort of about these  flowers is that i would never have known   they would have existed otherwise these are three  very obscure flowers from very specific ecosystems   and i wanted to find a way to evoke a feeling  of loss for something that we would never have   known otherwise that we missed because  we would never have known it existed   so as part of our collaborative work my role  was to build these installations where you   could experience the smells that sizzle had  created based on the work that ginkgo had done   so this is at the santetian biennial in 2019 where  we built these large latrines where the smells of   each flower diffused in the spaces and around you  is the soundtrack that you heard sort of being   played around the space so this sort of throbbing  humming recreation of a lost landscape in the   between on the left is the other lava boulders to  simulate that lost landscape and on the right to   the limestone outcrop of rock island and there's  this desire to create a tangible experience   to bring back this lost space how do you feel  a landscape that you can never be in again   and i wanted to get people inside these  works and in that experience of this very   abstract deconstructed nature you used  to move from the museum diorama into   where you would normally see an animal or a plant  and actually the humans become the subject on view   we can watch other people becoming part of this  extinction experience and the most recent version   of this which is at the natural history museum  in burn in switzerland in an exhibition called   apocalypse you actually enter the diorama and  we really went for it because this is a museum   filled with natural history dioramas you enter  at the back not knowing where you're going to   end up and you become part of the scenery so  humans are inside the space as the smell of   the orbiculum stipulation is diffused around them  and then they can exit by the small hidden door   and emerge into the gallery space and watch other  humans sitting inside this this lost environment and this is you know for me a different way of  working from designing for the sixth extinction   the ambiguity in this work is very important to me  this is not a solution this is not de-extinction   this is a way to evoke something much more  fragile and less tangible but trying to   talk about the desires and the actions  of humans rather than the solutions   so again artists and scientists working together  is a way to unravel the stories of these plants   but all we're left with is a memory an imperfect  trace and a reminder that we need to be better to   other species to other places and to other peoples  and this raises a lot of question for me questions   for me about the role of the artist are we  storytellers are we creating emotional responses   are we trigging triggering new perspectives  or connecting disparate stories and groups   and species together and i think there's another  step and that's what i'm exploring next which is   the sort of the move to action how do you not  just engage people but help them to do something   better to do something different so i'm going  to come back to this question to end of what   is better for nature and i think as we ask that  and try to answer it we can imagine that other   worlds are possible but we have to define what we  mean by better artists can reflect society we can   challenge it and communicate it in different  ways we can help imagine but we also need to   be demanding as citizens of the planet earth who  gets to imagine how do we get to contribute to   that imagination who gets to decide and how do  we demand decision changes and again today is   such a crucial day and a painful day as we kind  of see the balance of the world hanging there this is you know where i'm at and there's more  to follow in in my practice as it develops but   i think each of us can follow this mantra  this this sort of set of of actions to kind   of demand change it's not just about imagining  that someone else will do it but how do we   help enable a better future not just for us but  for other species and for other peoples thank you thank you very much to alexandra daisy ginsberg  for this thought-inspiring tour through her works   and and speculations what is better for nature  can we better the world and and what happens if we   try doing so with with all what's at stake  with biodiversity it becomes self-evident   that we all have to embrace the the gravity  and complexity and of this problem and also   the intangibilities and we all have to become part  of the solution we all have to get involved and   that's right what we want to be doing now we  want to take jesus invitation by word and take   her work designing for the sixth extinction as  a basis for further speculation and reflection   with that being said this is the end of the  first part of the evening if you're watching from   youtube then this is where the program will end  for now for everyone that is on zoom we'll have   a five-minute break and after that we will start  with the interactive part of the evening that   leaves me to nothing less than thanking very much  the speakers professor settler and alexandra daisy   ginsberg as well as spelling science week for  for hosting the program and yeah you the audience   for taking the time and diving with us into  this topic and also thank you very much to   science notes and to you thomas and i would  say with that being said let's let's get active
