 [Music] thank you all for coming tonight I am so excited about this event I can't even tell you I am a huge fan of Paul's this is Paul Shapiro he's the author of clean meat he's also been on Ted had given a few TED talks he's also the founder of better meats I read your book cover-to-cover when I found it and I don't do that for very many books and ended up writing a whole summary of your book in my textbook just loved it found it so insightful and influential and I'm sure all of you are gonna find his thoughts and insights here influential too so we're super excited to have you I'm excited Melissa and I read her book quirky we didn't say this you should read it is a phenomenal look at what are the common traits of really really influential innovators and inventors not like one-hit wonders or they did one really cool thing but people who have really done a lot in multiple fields or they've done really cool multiple companies like wow hey man Elon Musk Einstein in fact one little piece of trivia and these guys over here cannot answer it because they already knew the answer because I gave it to them today that I learned from Melissa's book okay you guys ready no googling of any of this all right who was the I don't have control but they can we raise the volume of the mic a little bit yeah Doug thank you okay piece of trivia for you the first time a woman won the Nobel Prize was who Marie Curie very nicely done the second time a woman won the Nobel Prize was whom Marie Curie the third time a woman won the Nobel Prize Oh might have to skip a few I don't know if they're exactly an order was it the next one anybody Marie Curie his daughter thanks for coming well all right read her book and you'll be a really interesting conversationalist at cocktail parties okay you're embarrassing me now but thank you Paul I really want to understand what inspired you to write this book when you when I read it it was like totally new to me some of the stuff in there I hadn't even come across my radar I'd never seen it in Twitter feed how did you find out about this what what kind of background work did you have to do to take a lot of research just tell tell us something about the beginning stages of writing this book well for decades I've been very concerned about food sustainability both from an animal welfare perspective from a perspective of the planet and climate change Public Health and frankly how we're going to feed 9 billion people in just 30 years from now because the problem is that the planet isn't getting any bigger humanity's footprint on the planet is getting bigger but the planet is not getting any bigger and we're not colonizing any other planets anytime soon so as humanity continues to swell in our numbers the question will be how can we continue to feed all of these billions of new people many of whom want to eat meat they want to eat an American diet that's high in meat and eggs and milk which are very resource intensive products to produce and so it's a nightmare from an animal welfare perspective it's a nightmare from a climate perspective land use its wildlife extinction all of these problems it is exacerbating and so the problem is that despite all of the publicity we all know that these are problems and yet it doesn't actually influence most of us because meat consumption continues to rise and so I have been worried for many years about what can we actually do to reduce the number of animals who are raising and slaughtering for food for to help solve this very serious problem of food sustainability and I while I wish that we would have a mass outbreak of plant-based eating I have a feeling that people are not converting to vegetarians because the evidence doesn't show it in fact per capita rates of vegetarianism in the US haven't changed in decades and per person basis actually meat consumption is going up it's going up here it's going up in China it's going up in Brazil and India and Mexico and all the places where it matters most it's going up and so the question becomes if giving people facts is not enough to change our behavior what can we do that can actually make a difference and the answer seemed to me to give people meat that doesn't have all the downsides and so I had known about this idea of growing meat without animals so tell my real meat here not alternatives to meat not substitutes meat but real meat grown for me Emel cells since around like 20 years ago because NASA had funded this research that was really intended for growing meat in space but many people including people in my social circle when the study got published they actually succeeded in growing meat outside of a fish they thought well I do this in space why not do it here on earth and so I was friends with many of the people were interested in this space where they broke they were growing fish the fish yeah yeah the first time any human successfully cultured animal cells to grow muscle was a goldfish actually and it was a nasa-funded study 20 years ago in New York by the way but anyway so I was aware of this but to me it was always science fiction it was never something that was actually a realistic possibility I thought huh this is something cool in the future maybe if I had an interest or knowledge of tissue engineering maybe I would devote myself to this but it was always something I just kind of hoped would happen but in 2013 when the first cultured hamburger was debuted by mark post who's a dutch physician who grew the first burger which fought with funding from Google co-founder Sergey Brin that's when I started thinking that this was actually something that was a true possibility now that burger costs over $300,000 to grow you know it's like the most expensive burger anyone's ever grown or eaten but then you know you fast forward till I 2016 and Memphis meats gets founded and I was good friends or so am friends with uma valetti the founder and we were talking about this one time he was a very successful cardiologist and he was talking about leaving his job to go start this company and I I stupidly gave him some bad advice I told him you know you're about to enter the most lucrative earning career earning decade of your career you know you're like 40 years old like you you're just gonna earn a ton of money you could just pay other people to do this I keep on earning the money and just you know if you really want this to happen you're gonna have a huge amount to donate or to invest but we agreed that somebody ought to do it I just wondered whether he should fund it rather than lead it stupid me thankfully he did not take my advice and he started the company and that's when I thought somebody needs to write about this what were you doing at the time at the time I was working in the animal welfare field and I was primarily lobbying to pass laws relating to food sustainability the welfare of animals climate change and so on and I had increasingly been coming to the thought that food technology may do more to solve these problems than public policies it's not that public policies aren't important by any means but it is that we are probably going to have to innovate our way out of this and we need policies to support the innovators we need policies to help subsidize the research and so on but I just thought you know the primary reason we stopped hunting whales in America was not because people felt bad for whales it's because Abraham Gesner invented kerosene and patented it and within just a few decades of that type of invention the whaling industry been decimated by 95% and people in the antebellum United States have been complaining about whaling for a long time I mean everybody had whale oil lamps but people were very upset about the treatment of whales in fact there were letters to the editor in newspapers in antebellum America calling for the cessation to our hunting of whales because they were concerned about extinction you know in the 1850s and then in 1861 a Harper's Weekly publishes a senatorial cartoon of these whales all dressed in a beautiful black tie ball clinking their glasses of the big banner behind them it says we whale no more for our blubber and they're toasting to the kerosene industry for freeing them and if you think about the animal welfare movement in America which was really founded right here in New York City that after the Civil War many of the anti-slavery activists started these animal welfare groups like the ASPCA because they were concerned about the treatment of horses and they crusaded for better treatment of horses they crusaded for mandatory resting hours watering stations sabbath days of the horses couldn't be worked and then Henry Ford comes along and does more for horses than they ever dreamt of doing you know Henry Ford liberated horses without caring about them and the list goes on you know the reason we don't use carrier pigeons anymore isn't because we don't care about because we care about pigeons because we have better ways to transmit information so you look at all these categories of animals who have essentially been relieved of their of their service to human to put it very mildly and diplomatically by technology and so I thought this could be the same we could have a similar technology and that is why I thought if we are going to ever reach a day where we actually are raising fewer animals for food it's probably going to come about through technology rather than just trying to persuade people to do the right thing in other words you can persuade people to turn off their lights more or you can invent a light bulb that just uses a lot less energy should do both but the latter is gonna do more good gadgets oh so you heard about uma and how did Emma get started what made a cardiologist think he could figure out how to grow meat outside of an animal so LUMO was a donor to animal welfare charities this is how I came to know him and he ended up being on the board of of new harvest which is a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting cellular agriculture and the pace of progress was glacial and he thought I wish I totally agreed with him that if this remained in the realm of academia it would never become commercialized he thought somebody has to be the first entrepreneur to start one of these companies and even though the first burger had been debuted a couple years earlier nobody had started a company this is all just academic research and so uma had been a promoter of this and being on the board of new harvest but at some point he decided I'm gonna take the very risky move he was very high up of me I think he was like the head of the Minnesota American Heart Association or the Minnesota chapter of the aah a maybe he was high up in the field of Cardiology and he had been thinking since his days as a medical student when he had been implanting stem cells into patients hearts and watching the muscle regrow he'd been thinking about this that if we can do it in a patient why couldn't we do it outside of the patient why couldn't we do it instead of using you know heart muscle we could grow the muscle that people eat so he did have a connection of the technology he had a huge connection with the technology and a passion for animal welfare he grew up in India he saw some many scenes that I detail in the book that really had a searing impact on him relating to the treatment of animals who were being slaughtered and he wished at that time that he could somehow be a part of ending that of violence toward animals and lo and behold a couple decades later now he's a pioneer in the space I think he's probably the best funded pioneer in the space too yeah so they just announced their Series B which is 161 million dollars which is a bigger raise for that round then all money invested in all other companies combined in this space Wow it's Memphis meets right Memphis meets yeah and that got funded by I think Bill Gates and Richard Branson and Softbank yeah cool but so I ended up having a whole group of tech MBAs in a class that we teach they're doing the alt meet space as a technological disruption and they all got to pick different organizations to analyze and develop deployment strategies for them and one of the groups yesterday they were doing their practice runs for their deployments so to slide and it had 27 different icons for companies that are doing cultured me yeah yeah that's amazing and you know you have five years ago there was zero and now I are any of them on the store shelves yet oh no no no not one ounce of cultured meat has been sold anywhere on earth so there's at least 28 companies working on this yeah and even if no government has yet authorized the sale of these but even if they did you would have miniscule sales right now because it still costs a lot to produce this yeah and so you know as companies like beyond and impossible have really taken off with plants to me is your plant based music yeah right thank you so with their plant based means they've been taking off and you know some people have wondered like well do we really need cultivated me right like if beyond and impossible can make this product and you know I think it's kind of like saying if you know right now wind energy is let's say cheaper than solar you know you know do we need solar well yeah you wanted all-of-the-above strategy right like the problem of fossil fuels is so severe you want win do you want solar you want geothermal and so on I was about to say you want nuclear I don't want to create an and controversy here but probably well you don't think you're creating yeah you probably wonder but anyway point is I'll talk to Charles he would know better than I but point is that in the same way that fossil fuels are so C or such a severe problem you want lots of alternatives yeah factory farms are such a problem you want lots of alternatives you want plant-based meat you want cultivated meat you want me grin from microbes you want people to blend meat I'm sure we'll talk about that later with plant-based and animal protein blends you want people simply to eat less or no meat I mean there's all these options out there but we need all of them and so cultivated meat is still a very important strategy but no it's completely not commercialized and it will not be a major part of the protein industry for years to come so it sounds like animal welfare issues brought you and uma to this sphere yeah but when I see people going vegan now and it seems like there's a lot more vegan alternatives and more vegan restaurants and in Italy now to get the coveted food standard you have to actually offer vegan really good vegan items on your menu so it's taking off but I most the people I talk to for them it's about environmental footprint yes so a lot of people might not realize the the massive environmental footprint that cows make for example yeah so you know vegan eating is of course far more mainstream now I made the decision to become a vegan in 1993 and I can assure you back then people did not know what the word meant when you told them they thought you were from Vegas like it was they didn't it was not the same as it is today and now it's like an embarrassment of riches cause it's like you're driving you're like oh should I go to a Carl's jr. should I go to Burger King you know like all these vegan options are everywhere but yes the short answer to the question is that if we're concerned about climate if we're concerned about land-use wildlife extinction and so many other pressing environmental problems we must be concerned about energy but we also have to be concerned about food the corner of the United Nations animal agriculture contributes about 15% of all the greenhouse gas emissions in the world which is more than all of transportation combined more than all the planes buts cars trucks all combined and it's not just climate change which is of course the existential crisis that we face but it is also biodiversity problems while that extinction the number one cause of so many problems that are driving it this is why environmental groups like the Center for Biological Diversity say that if you're concerned about wildlife extinction the number one you think you should do is eat less meat factor they have a whole campaign called take extinction off your plate which should you go to take extinction off your plate calm it's surprisingly nobody on that URL but it's they have a whole website just about why if you're concerned about wildlife extinction the easiest thing you can do is to last meet because animal agriculture is such a leading driver of the extinction okay so somebody told me and I might have read it you might have even something you wrote but I read one day and I thought it was really cute that there's also a huge efficiency angle here because a cow is optimized to be a cow and there are a lot of things involved in being a cow that aren't making meat that you can eat right so so there's some ratio of like how many calories that go into a cow to make one calorie of meat that's gonna be that could be radically changed potentially it is a lot of calories you could say thank you thank you so yeah I mean you know look cows did not evolve to become efficient meat producers right they evolved with far different pressures on them and when you think about growing meat - one of the reasons why I cultivated me takes so many fewer resources is because you're enough to do all the things that a cow does you don't have to produce a skeleton and horns and eyes and intestines and all the things that calories into the cow are actually going toward when you can just devote the calories in toward growing the meat that people actually want to eat and so you know the statistics vary and it depends on what type of agricultural system you're using but no matter what you're talking about at least ten and probably more calories into the cow for every one calorie that you're gonna get out in the form of edible flesh and so why not become a lot more efficient why not use a sliver of the resources of the land the water the emissions that are needed to grow meat rather than to raise a whole animal in fact it was Winston Churchill who in 1931 predicted this in 1931 essay before he became Prime Minister of Britain he wrote this essay called 50 years hence and it is essentially a prediction of what the world would be like in 50 years and he predicted that we would escape what he called the absurdity of raising an entire chicken just to get the wing that we want now he may have been off by a few decades but he was pretty prophetic because just a few decades after his prediction people are actually now growing cultivated chicken nuggets and chicken other types of beaten meat products and a Viet and then many times in fact I'm proud to say I think that I've eaten a great a variety of Queen meats than any other person on the planet now having even Queen beef duck fish liver tree so even foie gras when you're writing a book all these people won't bring you in and let you eat it but even just about last month I ate two different companies queen fish I ate a yellowtail and a salmon fish so first to me yes but Melissa you know I'm not the target audience here so yeah I think so but you know I would it would be better to do a back-to-back blind taste test between that product the sushi fish yeah that would be a better thing to do but yes to me it tasted like fish okay and I mean it should taste like fish because it is you know it's not like you're taking plants and trying to get them to taste like me these are actual fish cells that are yep so I mean you can grow in one case it was a whole muscle in the other case it was a ground but yes I mean yeah you can probably tell textural differences in some cases I didn't do back to best tasting so I don't know cool yeah you know one of the you made knowledge in your book and you actually told a story from history that I found really powerful and it was about ice yeah and maybe I'll let you tell it because you'll do it better than I will not ice of the vanilla kind but rather ice of the things are too young to remember vanilla I think that there's some people in here okay so if you rewind the clock 150 years actually the same time that whales were dodging cartoons in the Atlantic Ocean at that time the only way that anybody had to get ice was from nature there was a big ice industry where people are harvesting big blocks of ice from lakes where it had naturally frozen and they created insulated boots and they shipped it all over the world they shipped it all over in court and interestingly enough even to India where people of course had never even seen ice however it wasn't for the Indians was for the British colonizers who were really hot on a subcontinent it said they wanted to buy this ice but point is that you had a major ice industry creating Barrens of ice and then you have the advent of refrigeration when they had to ship it yeah truck oh well there were no trucks but there were boats yeah okay so yeah highways there aren't a lot of highways back in the eighteen fifties yeah yeah and so you had this major ice industry and then you have refrigeration and all of a sudden you have a much more efficient way to produce ice instead of getting it from nature you make it through technology but it's still ice right however the ice barons were livid over this technological innovation and they railed against what they called artificial ice they said it's unnatural it could it could sicken your kids it goes against God that God has provided ice and now you're gonna take this into your hands and you think that you can do this well you know at that time the irony was that the artificial ice was actually safer because they were filtering or boiling the water before they cooled it into ice and whereas the ice of that era was you know coming from a time during the Industrial Revolution where the waters were quite polluted and they didn't have cars yet and so you know they had horses dragging this ice out then train the horses to hold it in during this time so you got horses dragging this ice out of polluted lakes versus filtered water that's getting frozen into and what into ice and so it was actually much safer as the ultimate irony but you fast forward to today and needless to say we all have artificial ice makers in our homes we call them freezers we don't think there's anything unnatural about it at all and we dropped the artificial moniker I suspect that in the future we're gonna think about meat in a similar way that for millennia just in the same way we only had to get the only way to get ice was out of nature the only way we had to get meat was out of animals bodies well now we invented a technology to take the same substrate animal cells or water but now animal cells and make meat and some people may think of it as somehow an artificial method but I think that in the future people are gonna think thank God that we invented this way to do this in a much cleaner safer more sustainable and heyou more humane way that i'm so glad that we no longer have to raise in torment and slaughter billions of animals in order to produce the meat that we want and so I'm pretty bullish on the except that we can use technological innovation to create a better world it's not to say that anything from nature is bad but it is to say that nature can sometimes be improved upon smallpox high child mortality rates poison ivy these are all natural you know it's unnatural reading anesthesia and so on so in this is a case where I think what we can improve on nature and we can do something that actually is going to be better for the planet because we used a technological innovation I don't think it's a nice analog because I hadn't thought about the water being filtered for the ice but so you're saying that the when you make ice at home it's cleaner than ice dragged from a lake yeah how many of you want to eat ice out of the Hudson River I mean like no not one person would do that but I've also heard that if they when they make this let's say they make beef grown in a lab it won't have any the bacteria won't have any antibiotics or the steroids like it's supposed to actually last longer because it goes be as contaminated with all this stuff yeah so think about raw meat now right now if you are going to go to the supermarket and you buy raw meat they tell you to treat it almost like it's hazardous waste right like if you could put it in a separate bag can't touch your other groceries take it home if it touches your counter you got a disinfect your counter if it touches your hands you got to wash your hands but they don't tell you to do that with your zucchini and the reason is because there's feces in the meat u coli salmonella Campylobacter these are intestinal pathogens that can sicken us if we don't cook the crap out of our meat literally that's what you do you cook the crap out of the meat and only that makes it safe to consume whereas with clean meat it's called clean meat yes because it's an allusion to clean energy but it's also just cleaner think about it you're not growing intestines so you don't have to worry so much about intestinal pathogens you're just growing that muscle and for that reason you're right Melissa that if you are to take a regular piece of meat and a piece of meat that is grown and you put them in containers next to each other at room temperature it's much longer before the Queen meat starts to go bad now that's I mean they're still going to tell you to refrigerate it obviously they want to be safe but you will have far fewer concerns about food safety with this type of meat than the meat that we of today okay so now let's talk about plant meat for a minute what is the environmental footprint of plant meat how do you see these two facing off against each other from an environmental perspective so it's an it's an important question and I'm going to answer it but before I do I just want to say I believe that very few people consider the environment when we buy food some people do younger people especially but most people I think buy food for three reasons taste price and convenience but you there's many people including your the fact that you're even here tonight probably means that you have a concern about the sustainability of your food and so let me answer the question plant-based is going to be better for the planet it's gonna take fewer resources energy yep it'll be less energy it will be just fewer resources in general not just energy but in general and so the better that plant-based meat gets the better we will have a chance of saving the planet at the same time lots of people want what they perceive is the so-called real thing there's lots of people who will view plant-based meat as good as it gets as a substitute and for those people who want the so-called real thing I think clean meat is a really important innovation to allow them to literally have their meat and eat it too to let them eat the same exact product that would have come out of an animal except now it's grown without having to take that animal under consideration yeah so that's interesting because you know bacon for example as a product where I've never had a plant-based bacon that I saw it replicated regular bacon yeah it's like the Holy Grail Melissa it's tough it's a pretty complicated type of meat but it's interesting you know I have family in Texas that looks at me like I'm rocking some serious smack when I talk about any type of alternative meat they actually they actually seem like almost offended by it it's heretical to them and do you think one of the others gonna what is your hypothesis on which of these is going to be more acceptable to this sort of vehemently carnivorous people population or will they not adopt either of these oh I think there will be adoption I think that I don't think it'll ever be total displacement I mean we saw horse-drawn carriages so you know but I do think it'll be perceived as like a quaint relic of a distant past but if I were if I were placing bets right now I guess if I were an investor and we're placing bets I would probably be betting on the plant based base right now but I'm very glad that there are investors who are so enthusiastic about Queen meat because I think in the future as these costs come down that yes I really do think that they're gonna play a really big part of the future meat market and it'll live in parallel yeah yeah so I mean I am you know I started a plant based company so you can tell where I think the most urgent need is right so better meets this plant base yes so we can get into that too I'm happy to talk about as much about that later okay well yeah I do it later that's cool well we can do whatever you want actually but I'm watching the time here all right um so in short I think that you know the the space is wide open like people think oh we already have beyond an impossible what more do you need well as Dan and I were talking about earlier when you look at the space right now like burgers and the plant-based or like this much of it chicken is like this much pork is like this much and then seafood is like this much and then eggs are like this much Oh milk is like this much to milk doing well yeah milk is doing really well but even all of that all the beef pork chicken fish all of that is still less than 1% of the meat market you know you take milk as an example plant-based milk is now 13% of the fluid milk sales in this country yeah plant-based meat is still under 1% less than 1% of the meat market is plant-based and so if you're thinking about getting involved in this space yourself I wouldn't think about it as saturated I would think about it as a wide-open white space where there is so much more that we need so many more companies so much more innovation so many more categories of meat I don't understand why for example people are you know you have burgers which are trying to compete on cost with commodity beef which is very cheap whereas for the same price you could be making crab or Lobster and compete on cost with the actual crab and lobster you're doing plant-based cross station meat at the high end yeah so you have I mean you know vast numbers of crabs and lobsters are boiled to death for this market but wine you know if you're gonna compete on cost for the meat why not go for these more expensive meats that are still going to have a big impact from a both animal welfare and sustainability perspective so pretty much thought their theme I starting a company think crab and lobster it's a good low-hanging since a low hanging fruit but it's more like a low-hanging crustacean it's probably even more expensive than that stuff than that if you really put our minds to it I okay so what about that so I'm going back to the cultured meat thing the biggest obstacle is always something to meet well cost is huge and then the ick factor and I used to think the ick factor was gonna be a really big obstacle and then I started seeing people eating like crickets and bugs to me still is ick but I guess people get over it pretty quickly nice very good they do I totally thank you yes I think you're right Melissa I think you know if you look at the three biggest hurdles for the Queen meat companies it's gonna be cost government regulation and consumer acceptance what about laying also the the existing beef industry or poultry industry are they fighting this yeah that's a that's not going to government regulation perspective yeah so if it's cost government regulation and consumer acceptance the resistance from the cattlemen so to speak is that the government regulation to either try to outright ban it which they're trying to do so for example in Washington State they introduced a bill did not become a law but they introduced a bill that would have just banned the sale of cultured meat and ban the sale not regulated what it could be called it's done what protectionism here's the only only real answer but other states you know they're trying to pass laws saying that you can't call it meat which is you know not only obvious protectionism but it's also a problem because let's say you're allergic to fish this is fish like is this isn't artificial fish it's not plant-based fishes actual fish so if you're allergic to fish you will be allergic to clean fish so for lots of reasons we you know should not be doing you're seeing labeling yeah I'm gonna have to call it fish I think so but to your point about the ick factor I think this is the least of the concern in that if it tastes good and it's affordable people will eat it I mean just think about how we produce meat today most people we meet today not because of how its produced but really in spite of how it is produced I mean think about it most chicken that we raised today comes from birds who were confined by the tens of thousands wing to wing and windowless sheds living in their own feces pumped full of antibiotics and they never see his sunlight and then when it's time to slaughter them of course nobody wants to hear what happens next and so you just think about how unnatural unsustainable and inhumane our current methods of meat production are you think actually queenly it seems like the naturally preferable option and it's not just that we can look at the actual consumer surveys on this and depending on how you ask the question depending on what you call it if you want to call it something disgusting like lab-grown meat or if you want to call it something nicer like Queen or cultivated meat you get wildly different responses but even the most pessimistic even the ones that are the worst worded surveys still find that about 20% of people say they'd be happy to eat it and I mean 20% that's a massive massive number I mean imagine if 20% of the meat industry were replaced by clean meat we have economic consequences that would be complete I mean so dramatic it's hard to even imagine and so what's 20% of the well are doing it that writes the market exactly no anybody's willing to do it it becomes totally normal yeah so I mean I believe that people will be very happy to eat it think that it's cheaper yeah and you know look yeah well if it's cheaper it's good game over at that point but even when it's more expensive I think there will be a lot of people who are happy to eat it and I mean there's lots of foods that are that seem strange I mean think think about actually consider a time like after we domesticated cows but before we invented cheese so people are drinking milk but they've never heard of cheese they never envisioned brie or Gouda or Swiss or American or cheddar or anything right is a completely novel culinary experience to all humans nobody's ever even contemplated it let alone experienced it and now it's like widespread right I mean you know like cheese consumption is widespread even though 2/3 of humanity is electricians haunt you still have cheese consumption all over because people really like the taste of it and so you could have said at that time oh this is a novel food nobody's ever eaten this before but you can see how over time it becomes the norm and people get used to it and I actually think that something similar will be true with clean meat because it doesn't have to merely mimic the animal products of today it can also create entirely novel culinary experiences that no one has ever had before so you know actually let me tell a brief story if I meant yeah all right so go back to 1830 in 1830 you had this new railroad that was being built it's being built from Baltimore all the way to Ohio which was like the West in 1830 was Ohio am I ever here on this railroad Baltimore to Ohio be you know somebody plays monopoly here yes great property to buy a monopoly but the B&O Railroad barons were building this railroad and the rail cars back then were dragged by horses you had these you had these rails and the horses would go against him well there was one entrepreneur guy named Peter Cooper and Peter Cooper invented a rail car that he called the Tom Thumb and this was a rail car that was powered by a steam engine and nobody believed that a steam engine could ever do better than horses I thought oh this is crazy it's not gonna be able to survive going around the bends and the turns it's not gonna work and so the stagecoach company that was leading the way and was gonna supply the horses for the B&O barons were very upset by Peter Cooper going around touting this and they threw down a challenge to him they said Tom Thumb versus our fastest horse okay 18:30 fastest horse versus Tom Thumb so he accepts it as any good entrepreneur would and they line up in Baltimore parallel tracks they got the Tom Thumb versus a regular car with their fastest horse of the stagecoach company had and they're off to the races each carrying this car full of their human masters the biological horse versus what would come to be known as the iron horse so they're going right and they're neck-and-neck neck-and-neck going about half a mile all of a sudden Tom Thumb switches a belt stalls stops the horse ends up winning the race stagecoach company is really thrilled they say see we told you we're totally vindicated but the B&O barons were so enthusiastic about the Tom Thumb because they saw that for half a mile it actually kept up they placed orders with Peter Cooper turning him into an extremely rich man in fact anybody here ever heard of Cooper Union named after Peter Cooper because he became a major philanthropist after this but the point of the story is this if you think about the trains of 1830 which the Tom Thumb went 18 miles an hour and then compare them to the trains of today where we have trans that are going 200 miles an hour well we don't have them but if you go to China they have them all right 200 mile an hour or if you listen to Elon Musk we're gonna have a hyper loop it's going 700 miles an hour right and so that's how much better in a hundred and fifty years trans have gotten well how much better have horses gotten in that century and a half right basically none they're basically the same animal and so you had huge innovation in trans because we divorced our transportation from a live animal and created a technology that could keep on getting better and better well how much better are cows and pigs and chickens going to get not that much more efficient not that much better and they're gonna be pretty much probably the same animals in the future as they are today but when we divorce meat consumption from livestock rearing how much better can meat consumption get can we create new experiences like cheese like new novel foods like for example imagine if you go to your friend's house right now and they have a bread maker or an ice cream maker on their counter totally unremarkable what if they had a meat maker what if they're ordering stem cells that they could drop in the godel tea bag and make their own meat right there or if you think about a turducken right anybody here ever eat a turducken you know so chickens stuffed inside of a duck inside of a turkey I don't know anybody would want to do that but you eat all three birds meat at one time well instead of just stuffing one bird instead of another bird or on another bird well if you could grow their cells all together and interweave their proteins making a type of meat no one has ever eaten before so I think that in the same way that trains are dramatically different now than in 1830 but all of them are better than horses I think that meat in the future is going to be a lot better now and all of it is going to be better than farm animals that's really cool so a lot of business and economics people in here let's what are your thoughts about what the key challenges or opportunities are that are facing plant-based meat and cultured meat from a business point of view like where the big challenges yeah biggest challenge is creating products that really do the job that mimic the taste and texture of meat and scaling them up as big as beyond an impossible are they are still a miniscule fraction of the meat industry there's about a hundred billion pounds of meat that are sold in the United States each year and last year was probably about 200 million pounds of plant-based meat that was sold in the United States so I'm a mathlete but I think that's about ninety-nine point eight percent of the meat sold is coming from conventional animal agriculture okay and so just think about it even if you had a quintuple wing of demand for these products you're still at 99 percent to 1 and so we just need a lot more scale up in this space we need more companies we need bigger companies we need more capital coming into the space that's what I see and more innovation because people want meat the reason why I'm possible and Beyond have taken off because they marketed their products not to vegetarians but to meat eaters who want meat but want to have better meat and so that I think is going to be a key thing but I would suggest that even as important as it is for those things to happen even if we did have a quintuplet of demand for plant-based meat the fact of the matter is that we're still going to have most meat coming from animals for a long time and that is why I think we need to start not only putting plant-based protein in the meat aisle at supermarkets which is what beyond really pioneered but not just put plant-based protein in the meat aisle but to put it in the meat itself and that's what we at the better meat Co do which is a startup that I co-founded nearly two years ago to make plant-based protein formulas that we sell as ingredients to meat companies so they can use fewer animals so we sell plant-based protein formulas that work to seamlessly blend directly into meat so that if you eat let's say a chicken nugget or a hamburger patty it might have a third or even half less meat in the product but you won't notice any difference it'll taste the same it will look the same but it'll have much less saturated fat much less cholesterol many fewer calories more fiber more sustainable it's just a better product it is literally making better meat we're teamed up with one of the biggest meat companies on the planet Perdue farms the chicken company which makes a 55 he blend called chicken plus which is 50% chicken 50% plant-based really to our shells already since 70 100 grocery stores right now Safeway Albertsons Kroger Walmart you can go get this Purdue chicken plus products and so think about that like if plant-based meat is still less than 1% of the meat market what if every meat producer were to put our product into their is that of 30 to 50% inclusion rate the actual sustainability benefits will be dramatically bigger right because instead of reducing demand by 1% you're reducing demand by 30 or 50 percent in that case and so that's the whole premise behind the better Mikko and we're very proud of that partnership we're proud that some of our investors from green circle capital are in the audience tonight also they had the foresight to see what we are doing and recognize that this was also a good idea but it's a it's an innovation that is in a space that really nobody is pursuing yet because most people were focused on plant-based or cultured but I think that in the same way that electric cars are still less than 1% of the vehicle market well you know hybridizing auto technologies would really go a long way we are hybridizing meat and was it hard to win Purdue over to this idea actually Purdue for a major poultry company I'd say is a pretty innovative and progressive company for this so they have been interested in it from the very first time I talked with them but they're a huge company so it takes a long time it's a long lead time between first conversation to actual going to market it was about a year for us of working with them before it hit stores but it's a product that's selling well in fact it's selling so well that Purdue's CMO announced at the good food Institute conference this year we have Victoria Ram from the good food Institute sitting up there at her conference the CMO of Purdue announced that they like this blended chicken product so much so they're devoting 50 percent five zero percent of their entire 2020 marketing budget just to the chicken plus line so we're gonna start seeing ads on TV if you haven't yet Melissa you should but I hear from people all the time who have told me they're seeing their ads I hear regularly people texting me videos of the atoms we are doing well we need to be doing better but we're doing well yeah we'll see so what do you that's why I heard the Tyson and Cargill were like two of the largest meat in the world have made investments in the cultured meat space that's right have they also made investments in the plant meat space they have yeah so Tyson invested in in a new way of foods which is making plant-based shrimp and so there is investment in both sides on plant-based and cultured but those companies you know they see themselves more as I would say like in the meat space so I think they're probably more naturally gravitating toward the cultivated meat space but they're invested in both in fact Cargill just made a seventy five million dollar investment in puris which is the pea protein maker that for beyond meat so they're definitely positioning themselves as a major ingredient supplier to the plant-based meat industry so I had early on totally pictured small startups displacing these great big incumbents in these industries but it actually sounds like maybe these heavyweights there they're gonna do the disruption themselves it's totally possible I see two different types of meat companies out there I see the Kodak's and I see the cannons and so if you go back 25 years Kodak and Cannon vying for supremacy in the film market and both of them knew about digital in fact Kodak invented digital but I thought it would cannibalize their business and so they suppressed it whereas Canon instead really went for it and we all know what happened right Kodak declare bankruptcy Canon is now the largest manufacturer of digital cameras on the planet and so canon was willing to sacrifice their entire business of print photography pretty much to go to this new innovation just in the same way that Netflix was going to sacrifice DVD mailing for streaming their whole business which but you know it wasn't streaming that put Blockbuster out it was really DVD Malins and then they became a streaming company so if me companies see themselves as forward-thinking innovators they will be embracing this but I don't think all the meat companies do some of them do but not all okay and our regulatory hurdles slowing things down significantly and you know we live in New York I spent a lot of time in California and those are probably not representative states so yeah sadly they're not but I will say the following you know there are regulatory burdens that states are seeking to place right now to protect the local meat industries they're trying to place rules on what you can call plant-based me for some reason calling a hamburger a hamburger despite it having 0% ham does not bother them for some reason calling it a hot dog despite having 0% dog this most of the time oh yeah maybe not 0% listen for some reason calling it peanut butter does not bother them despite it having no butter in it the whisk goes on and on but calling a plant-based meat I'm calling it a plant-based burger that seems to be really upsetting to them and I don't think these laws being driven probably by lobbying from people with a financial interest that is certainly true but those are regulatory hurdles that the plant-based meat industry will have to have to overcome and the good food Institute is doing a good job of lobbying against those bills and do you think we're you think we're getting to a tipping what does it look like that a lot of these companies are gonna be successful well I mean we all know that the mortality rate for startups is very high so I would like to say a lot of these companies will be successful but the history of startups tells us that most won't be obviously better Miko is going to be a multi billion dollar exit but the but for the rest of these losers know you know nobody knows he's gonna win right now I mean we have no idea a company just being first to market doesn't mean that you're gonna win right there's lots of no absolutely usually not the first to market who wins yeah so I mean I you know it's there's a saying that it's hard to make predictions especially about the future and okay well why don't we open it up to questions from the audience um do you want to pick them you pick them you're gonna go alright know what the power of picking I like it all right go to Gabriel up here thanks for a great discussion one comment that I'd like to hear from you is is it possible that negative aspects of the real meat industry that they've done over the last five years including Purdue and others of over injecting the animals with antibiotics and cetera etc has that in a way been an opportunity I said for the alternative meat let's call it whether it's cultured or with its plant food because it got to the point where the meat didn't have any taste huh I've heard many people say that so you know interesting enough I mean there is I was just in Atlanta yesterday and I was at this big poultry industry convention and like antibiotic-free is like all the rage there so you know many of these companies are trying to move and Purdue is stopped using antibiotics altogether but to answer your question I mean I've heard many people say that and I I do think that this is one reason why people are switching to plant-based meat it's not the only one but I think it is one reason why people are switching but if people us are buying these high-end antibiotic grass-fed beef it also creates more cost to parity with these cultured meats which is probably a good thing right yes there's a lot of externalize costs in the meat industry today and as they start internalizing those costs you do help to level that playing field a little bit more it's wouldn't necessarily completely level it or make them completely cost parity but we're very proud that at the better Mikko our plant-based beef enhancers are cost competitive with beef today so does your like if I get up I'm this is not I'm not just going to sell your business or anything like this but hamburger a hamburger are you cheaper the same more expensive than regular like quality Grumpy's yeah for sure so we would we were each Isis there well all of the above so we're gonna be better on saturated fat better on cholesterol better on calories better on fiber and yes better on cost cheaper and better on taste Wow yeah blind taste test focus groups what you find is that generally speaking or the product just tastes better when you have our product and for a variety of reasons that super cool okay other questions all right let's go to this gentleman with the glasses right there yes sir I feel so powerful getting to choose all right you've got your book up and you look ready it's like it's like in 1993 you said this is like Meet the Press yeah sure well this will replace agriculture but it will change where certain agricultural jobs are so think about the impact let's say on the tobacco growers as people stop smoking right we have fewer acres planted for tobacco now and they had to switch to other crops in fact interestingly I don't think there's a causal correlation but there is a correlation between reduction and smoking in the US and increased consumption of humus and so yeah so many of the tobacco gar switched over to growing chickpeas once sabra got acquired by Pepsi they needed a lot more chickpeas and so you know a lot of tobacco growers switch over and so yeah look I don't think that cattle ranchers are gonna become microbiologist obviously but I do think that those microbes need to eat and you have to grow food for them so there will be a disruption in the economy no doubt about it but that's you know what happens I mean you know when I am on an airplane tomorrow I on Saturday rather I can promise you I'm not going to be shedding tears for blockbuster as I'm streaming Netflix flying across the country and you know blockbuster employees lost their jobs and because we had a better alternative and so the key is I think to figure out how we can continue creating an economy that offers people jobs but they don't have to be the same jobs that people have always had all right Bakley we're going to you next ma'am don't worry I'll be quick you have three questions Wow all right now if we're going to you next I was just curious because we were talking in the office and I have this theory and I wondered if you either validate or dispute it that simply taking on Nuggets and burgers you would make a lot of headway I mean people because you're talking about like the texture and stuff and in my mind like we don't have to even get to steak to actually make an impact with what you're talking about because I don't know the numbers but I have to assume it's a high percentage of meat is eaten in the form of burger you know yeah and the you know get AK whatever you know so that quarter of meat is ground like burgers sausages meatballs nuggets and so on yeah so I guess the question is do you do you see that as the first point of attack or do you care I mean how do you how do you view that oh for sure yeah it's a great question but I mean yes no doubt that is the lowest hanging fruit is these type of ground meats ground meats are going to be you know it's probably 90 plus percent of the alternative meat market right now there are some cultured meat companies that are doing thicker cuts of meat but it's hard to do in that sense because in short the you know you have blood vessels and so that oxygenates the all your muscle tissue but when you're in a bioreactor there's no vascular system and so if you're trying to grow a whole cut of meat the muscles on the inside good necrotic because they're not getting the nutrition that they need and so you have to create a vascular system essentially have to create like a scaffold that can actually do that so it's definitely a more complex engineering problem and so on but it's not it's not that it won't be overcome it's just it's not gonna be the first thing I was just talking do you mind sir if we go to this woman she has three questions we're gonna be really rapidly varying answer their questions so first the question is and thank you very much for coming today thank you for question is because you are the only one who will be the successful and of course yes what do you see already new sir right now because I found the number but I don't think this is right I have three point eight medium I don't know where you again there's revenues from so yeah yeah that's a great question if you weren't to sign an NDA and we can talk about your potential investment in the company I'll be very glad to talk about our revenue I'm cool right now but thank you not only the big meat producers but also the big companies and multinational companies like Nestle Kellogg and then Kraft they already have the major plant-based meat companies yeah [Music] incognito incognito yeah and then those are the really big multinationals and yeah you know some companies and they do not the really nice things in the emerging market like baby formulas mmm they can't to sell you know in the US because of regulations so they bring those highly processed well I'm so sorry to interrupt you but there's lots of people want to ask questions there's no make sure that the sellers what do you think about this you know the oh I welcome it I think it's awesome I haven't had incognito but you know interestingly for all the press that we hear about beyond an impossible you know the the behemoth in the space is actually Morningstar they sell the most amount of product in the plant-based meat space they are losing market share but they are still by far the biggest in this space mainly if your legacy but yeah so I mean I I think it's great I like the whole premise of the better Miko is to help the big players do better to lighten their footprint and so if companies like Kellogg and and Kraft can lighten their own footprint by having more of their sales coming from plant-based rather than animal-based meats I would be thrilled all right let's hear it as you know the compared to the real the plant obeys the products have so much of the salt yeah and most of the debuggers they get probably ten times more so than the real burgers it's definitely not ten times that would be there'll be like you know weeks worth of your of your can you'll make your product without using so much of salt yeah there's like the Achilles heel on the space and you know the products the plant-based meat products generally are better for you they have zero cholesterol they have less saturated fat and so on but on salt they don't always stack up as well and I think it's an Achilles heel for the space and I do think that it will have to be addressed in a variety of ways but to answer your question directly about the better meat oh yeah we do offer very low sodium versions of products for those of our customers who want it most of the time when they're making their products they're already you know seasoning it with some salt so they're putting it in their meat already so we don't have to but you know it's a real it is something I think is worth is worth doing worth I would say improving on in this space but thank you what other countries by the way were you referring to when you were you're saying they're having bad practices in other countries okay yeah yeah okay okay I got two I thought you meant plant-based me and I'm sorry yeah sorry all right well thank you for your questions hi so I read that part of the series be that Memphis meats received was regarding a pilot plant and they're gonna have like those the bioreactors like you described do you happen to know how many other companies might be moving on up into these bioreactors or yeah is it just Memphis meat so think about them like how much has been raised by these companies most of them if they've raised it all have raised like single digits Millions meetable in the Netherlands did just announce a 10 million dollar raise and most of meats is also in the tens but most of them have not raised enough where you could really build bioreactors in many sighs you know this is this is like Pharma scale biotech it takes a lot of money to build any type of a large any type of like a large plant even a pilot plant in that case for them it's still gonna be tens of millions of dollars to do so no I think that all of these companies are operating with reactor sizes that are in the tens of liters or maybe a hundred liters at a time but not in the tens of thousands of liters yet how much time do we have left for this one I'm sure we'd only have time for one more question I gotta get Charles in here he's been really going he's been he's been really yeah very vociferously raising his hand this is charles Maslin he's the founder of zeta energy and battery with much higher density energy and higher density per both weight and volume who is and his company has brought in tens of millions of dollars to so he could probably you could probably answer these several questions even better all right Charles what's up yeah when do you see the inflection but it yep Giga factories yet in the battery industry where the the largest investments are really going to be the benefits where they have economies of scale and when do you see that inflection point happening when it turns when enough investment has come into this that it becomes it becomes a numbers game it's a really great question Charles I mean the the honest answer is I really don't know but if I was just speculating on it what I would say is that the Memphis investment is so dramatic it's it's such like a you know punch to the chin that it's going to attract more more investors in the space or saying well gee is you know the money is going there let's do it and so I think you're gonna get a lot closer to that inflection point because of it but this space you know 161 million dollars it of course is a lot of money by any stretch the imagination but in order to actually get to commercial-scale where you would see Queen Mead on supermarket shelves it will take much more than that so I'm thinking as Memphis meats kind of like the Tesla of a cultured meat but we're still at the Roadster stage we still got really well roadsters was roadster was a car that people actually could purchase so they're a little bit preregister okay well thank you so much for all of your questions and for coming I'm sorry we don't have more time as I'm sure we could have talked for another hour but thank you so much thank you melissa and i do want to say before we get up thank you in my selection of questioners i was biased toward the people up here rather than up there I know many of you had questions if you want to ask questions I'm happy to chat afterwards if you want to personally sign your book also I'm happy to do that so you know be around for a few minutes so you can come on down and if you want my email I've got business cards happy to give you that you can reach out to me anytime for any reason always welcome hearing from you thank you again [Applause] [Music]
