 but a mess panel you've already referred to the scale-up questions and how do you scale this up regulatory and occasionally decision support and we have a great panel to a pine there and to give us their wisdom and in doing so we have a wonderful moderator David Shaywitz MD PhD trained here at Harvard who's been a really a wonderful scientist but have had has had experiences in clinical care drug discovery development strategy strategic planning commercialization genomics digital health and even a good stint in the venture capital I mean he's now the founder and principal astounding health ticket virus advisory services he also is an amazing poster child for the effect efficacy at least for him of exercise plus a ketogenic diet and so I hand it over to David thank you very much great all right well thank you that my name is David Chang wits I live in the Bay Area but that all my medical and scientific training in Boston it's not my privilege to be a lecturer in Zach's department I a spent most of my career as a drug and technology developer and more recently as an investor serving as a senior partner Takeda ventures in Palo Alto currently my day job is founder of astounding health tech on my own advisory firm where I serve as a partner to senior R&D leaders trying to incorporate digital and data into the discovery development and deployment of impactful new medicines as many of you know this annual meeting is my absolute positively favored because of the way of a meeting and by that I mean Zak not only bring the most interesting science and technology but also make it abundantly palpably clear that these promising approaches and modalities are exciting and useful only to the degree they effectively serve the needs of the individual patients who are clowning on them this core humanity at the center of rigorous technology is what makes this meeting zach and the department so special and unique I'm especially excited to be here today moderating this panel focused on the paradoxical question of how to think about hyper individualized treatment at scale fortunately we're joined at this this morning by an exceptional group of experts like Amy Duras who can help us think through the operational challenges babbu who will offer a view into the economics or not who will talk about the data management challenges and our second Amy Amy Abernathy who will focus on the role of regulators the speakers will each introduce themselves so let's start with Amy Duras great hi everybody good good morning good afternoon it's an honor to be here although I wish we could be together in person my name is Amy dross I am a co-founder and the CEO of vanetti an enterprise software orchestration platform for personalized medicine my background ranges from policy I've been it I got my start as a patient advocate testifying early and often before Congress as a young child growing up inside the beltway then as a co-author and the executive director of California's three billion dollars stem cell research initiative which established the California Institute for regenerative medicine or affectionately known as CIRM a venture investor at GE and now a co-founder and CEO of vanetti great so vanetti just a quick introduction of our company vanetti was created really from a conversation among Novartis the Mayo Clinic and General Electric we established the company four years ago to provide a new solution for a new set of problems really the most complex supply chain and logistics workflow requirements in the history of medicine the problem statement was put more simply how do you scale out mass customization how do you move from the Model T to the assembly line so our our global scale enterprise software company really provides the connective tissue that ensures automated chain of identity Chain of Custody and chain of condition to ensure that the right patient receives the right therapy at the right time we are fully in conformance with all the regulatory standards our system or system like it is required for commercialization of cellular therapies and many Jean modified therapies we are if you've really focused here on the sort of blue Chevron's in the middle this is the vanetti system these are all of the end and key process steps in production and delivery for highly personalized therapies and then what you see on the outer concentric circle are all the other systems of record EHR limbs ERP mes depending on where the product is and its life cycle we're supporting and we support products from even just sort of pre post IND all the way through commercial phase and so really vanetti provides this essentially railroad and connective tissue among many many many different systems and really offers a source of truth for therapeutic manufacturers and all of their interdependent partners and stakeholders who are required to drive single batch therapies or devices and procedures we're also big part of our value proposition why was so exciting to be invited to join this discussion today is to both create and promulgate standards so when our founding group got together to to really set forth on and creating an independent agnostic platform we acknowledge that the only way to scale out such complexity in workflows and also understanding the science is iterating really in excess of Moore's law under the hood so this dynamism and flexibility was only going to continue I was to create as much process standard along at the entire chain both the supply chain and the value chain as possible I said we spend our time not just working with our customers and trying to conform standards wherever we can to ease the burden on the clinical centers Clinic Euler Lee the clinical centers of excellence who were first implicated in this new modality of therapeutics but we also sit on the SCB the FDA funded standard-setting body and we host a internal supply chain and manufacturing Council in it even for four partners who may not be fully cost you know customized onto the platform but the idea behind the system is to provide a railroad of industrialization so the opportunity again to find conformance wherever we can so that we can industrialize and then optimize this remarkable therapeutic area that's the only way we're actually going to reduce cost we're going to increase access so there's a fundamental belief behind the company that if you can put the smart plumbing in place then you really can hasten true access to patients thank you I'll you'll yield the rest of my time awesome Babu of thank you David so I was asked or tasked to talk about how to think about the value of highly personalized therapies and think about pricing which so I prepared remarks and a simpler question is what is the meaning of life so let me first start with some high-level thoughts on how we think about value in an economics and why health care is obviously very different we don't have whole disciplines that are designed to attach or estimate the value of products that we consume like water bottles or houses or cars we kind of rely on the market and individual decisions to help guide what people value things that know for example if a water bottle was priced at $25 most people wouldn't buy that water bottle and those unless is really really a hot day and they were dying of thirst and the price ultimately falls down to a level that is more commensurate with the value that the water bottle offers so we are in healthcare doing something different in part because we don't have a market that operates in quite the same way as we have a market for houses or cars insurance dictates that the price that individuals pay for drugs or new technologies isn't always the same as the price of the health plan might pay because of the insurance and so as a result we've gotten into this business of trying to estimate what the value is that new new technologies bring now that is really difficult when we're thinking about therapies that are highly individualized that as a result of being highly individualized are much costlier to produce than a therapy that might be producing a large VAT for large swathes of the population the additional challenge is is how do you attach a price or value on something that is fundamentally critical to someone's life that's difficult to do you know nonetheless economists have tried to take on that challenge of devised tools to try to estimate what people are willing to pay for improvements in either the longevity of their life or in the in the quality of life and and that would by itself probably be a whole webinar but suffice to say economists have tried devised tools to try to estimate what people are willing to pay for a quality adjusted life here a year of life that is modified to some extent by what is the quality of that life I want to spend the next few moments taking an extension beyond that way of thinking and say well what is it that's so complicated about valuing highly specialized therapies that makes that sort of exercise different than the exercise that we already have in place to try to measure the value of statin drugs or the value of putting a stent in someone's heart so I want to focus on three ideas the first is something called the insurance value of medical innovation and the idea is the following if someone owns a house and that house burns down most people are unable to fork over several hundred thousand dollars to rebuild that house immediately and what the instead have is an insurance policy against their house burning down and the interesting thing about that insurance policy is that it offers benefit to individuals whose house never burns down so most of us are lucky to have a home that remains erect and it never burns and nonetheless we all have health we all have fire insurance and we derive benefit from that fire insurance for the unlikely event that the house burns down the same logic actually applies to therapies that affect small swathes of the population for which rare disease therapies and specialized therapies I think are becoming increasingly more common there is a value to individuals who never even purchased the therapy who never even have the disease who never need to take the treatment to having that treatment available and it comes through this insurance that we as individuals have against the possibility that we or loved ones will have a disease and will have a therapy available to treat that now this idea of insurance value for those of you who are familiar with the quality adjusted life year and the value that economists or policymakers would sometimes place on an additional year of life to help guide the valuation and pricing of new therapies to put in a perspective the insurance value of medical innovation is probably around ten percent of that value so it's not small so to put it differently there's value that comes to us that is meaningful from therapies that we hopefully will never have to use the second ideas which sometimes is referred to as the spillover value of new medical innovation and so the idea is that if you have a rare disease that affects someone you have a personalized their before them they are not the only recipient of that therapy and they're not the only recipient of better health and better health outcomes that come from that treatment if they have family members who have to take time off from work to be caregivers if they have differences in the interactions with society with families with employers that result from having better health that's obviously valuable and not just the person who's affected by the disease but it's also valuable to others who share relationships with that person and that's not to say that we should use that spillover value that additional value that accrues to others besides someone who's affected by the disease as a justification for for high drug drug prices writ large is it is to say that as we're thinking about where to invest our dollars our public dollars whether into schools education defense roads the NIH we should be measuring the value that new things bring to society in a way that's rigorous and the way that that's accurate and so as I think about therapies that are highly personalized that bring spillover effects not just to the people who are affected by the disease I want to think about measuring the those specific attributes in a way that is accurate the last thing I'll say is an idea which is relatively recent and that is the idea of option value so I'll start with an example of an individual who had HIV in the mid-1980s and at that point in time there was a drug called AZT which was modestly effective had side effects but for for people who were infected with HIV it was nonetheless the only treatment option available about ten years later slightly less than ten years later there were a new set of therapies that came on the market that were much more effective and had better side effect profiles now the first drug AZT actually introduced something called an option value it gave some people who were lucky enough to live long enough for better therapies that additional life that they needed to just live long enough to get those second therapies and so even though a CT as measured by the increment in additional life that have brought individuals would be valuable to those individuals who took the drug there is still this additional value that we called an option value very much like a financial instrument called an option that allowed people to live long enough to get a better more definitive therapy so as we're thinking about pricing technologies that are in this space that is rapidly developing where more and more personalized therapies are introduced into specific diseases we want to think about the value that a therapy brings is also being the value that it offers to individuals who are able to live long enough to a fight to a better treatment occurs the last point I'll say is you know why do we talk about value in health care why did why does it matter I alluded to this in part because we have to think about where to Alec not just scarce healthcare resources but where to invest public and private dollars the other thing that is important real eyes are is a highly research and development intensive industry when we have a water bottle on a hot day we don't expect that water bottle to cost $10 because if it did even though it's highly valuable to me on a hot day someone will be coming out there another vendor another seller would say well I'll sell it for $6 and then another seller would say I'd sell it for $4 and the price would be competed down to the point of almost the cost of production and in general that's what we want for society that's what competitive markets do they lower the price of products to the point where they are close to the cost production and that leaves all the people who have a valuation of that of that product more than the cost able to purchase it and we tend we tend to encourage that in society for healthcare technologies it's different and the reasons it's different is because we have to give innovators an incentive to develop technologies in the first place and so that's why we typically have patents or other forms of regulatory exclusivity to encourage the innovation in products and we allow the manufacturers to capture some of that value that the otherwise would not be able to win when products become generic and we get down to more of the water bottle pricing model so I'll stop there I'm probably not at five minutes but I'll leave some time for others but I'm happy to take questions as they arise later all right well Baku thank you one other quick thing I'm so you are always precocious you both we initially intended to have this just be a quick intro and then so get to some of the questions later you elegantly integrated both of those things so maybe we can go back to Bob who just for a moment just so you can say where you are and what you do I forgot the introduction I'm an economist I'm a physician a professor at Harvard Medical School I spend most of my time working on big data projects that use what we call natural experiments studying for example weather outcomes of individuals who have heart a cardiac arrest on the day of a major Cardiology meeting or worse or better it turns out they're actually better if you have a heart attack and it's reason why we think is because a lot of cardiologists are out of town and the care that you receive is different so I spend most of my time working on those sorts of interesting big data exercises and at the intersection of healthcare and economics and I spend some amount of time also thinking about issues related to the economics of medical medical innovation at a value and price new technologies which are more in line with the comments I just offered today awesome that's fantastic thank you so much again so I just on the introduction aren't up do you want to just do a brief intro of yourself yeah sure thanks David and thanks to DVM I for the opportunity to speak at this conference so my name is Arnim Chatterjee and perspective I'd like to share today is from a company that said squarely in the middle of the pharmaceutical world and is aiming to be in an enabler of data sides to bring hyper individualized therapies to patients and to the market so in metadata I oversee product strategy and our go-to-market across data science products which includes evidence generation and omics and imaging in previous lives I was at McKinsey I let a lot of our work in part my data and analytics and then I was at Merck for some time working in outcomes research and data science and then come from a previous president's administration back in the day when Obama's around and working on at HHS on data science and health technology platforms so if you will allow me to share my slides here see if this works great so what I want to talk about is you know kind of what are we seeing in terms of what scale-up means from the blends of a data science technology company and just kind of two seconds on where we sit in the world so you know metadata is a 20 year old electronic data capture company currently manages more than 50% of the world clinical trial data that's run on a digital platform and acorn was born about 18 months ago as metadata's data science identity so when we talk about data what we're talking about is this historical clinical trial data set that we manage on behalf of our pharmaceutical sponsors and academic institutions it's about six point three million patients and 22,000 trials and the vision here is to create like a you know a better way to understand how patients think about how they perform in and out of experimental therapies if you compare clinical trial data to the real world and how does that actually better enhance the way we think about clinical trials so in the handful of minutes that I have I want to talk about two things one of them is how does it how does it work for a data science company today to power the development of precision therapies and then the second thing I want to do is actually take an example of data science in action that could have a massive impact on hyper image of individualized treatment if it actually were to scale-up and I'll kind of talk through some of the living experiences we've had around that so I think it's important to do a bit of a post-mortem you know we're sort of many years into data science journeys within the biopharma world and if you kind of go back to the core essence of what we're trying to solve for the sources of failure and what plagues you know R&D product teams are pretty much the same so from a design perspective clinically you know trials may continue to demonstrate failures in how they define and demonstrate efficacy there might be safety issues we have problems with operational design as it relates to patient recruitment and enrollment and retention and sometimes you just bet on the wrong biological hypothesis so as we look at like the measurement increment here how has data science scaled up and how is it meaningfully moved the needle against what our page old pharmaceutical problems and what do we do the industrialized solutions so kind of on the forward progress side you know on the positives you know if we look at some of the biggest pharma companies Novartis Janssen they've built out established data science teams these are highly talented mixes of people that incorporate computational biology and machine learning and informatics there are many cases where they're kind of centrally located within the pharmaceutical company they have chief data science officers as they do in the case of Janssen and they're really trying to aim to centralize data sourcing and purchasing biotechs have also kind of followed suit and they're building entire platforms drug discovery that are built upon machine learning so these are certainly like ways to look at the needle moving forward I also think you know this notion of AI and a data science enabled drug discovery has also made some meaningful strides the the company benched I reported and I think they actually stopped counting but you know as their last count there are about three 230 companies that are using AI and life sciences in some way and there been some meaningful achievements you know from companies like recursion and extension and Schrodinger and Adam wise so we need to acknowledge that this is a long process and it's a long road but there has been movement and I think the last thing on the positive is that there has been continuous major yep major appetite for for how do we think about novel data sources on the countervailing side you know there's still this definition of what value is so as we think about like you know how these companies scaled we're still waiting for the homeruns and how you show meaningful value data centralization doesn't necessarily mean that a centralized data there's a disconnect between clinical development and data science as opposed to like how do you think about the back and forth between questions and hypothesis testing and where data might fit and then you know to reap I guess paraphrase Bruce booth and injuries and Horowitz you know if software is eating the world and biology is absolutely consuming software and I think in many cases culture then consumes the biology so we're sort of seeing a perpetual cycle in terms of how these forces kind of go against each other and I think the last thing I want to share is you know of a data science project and methodology that really gets to the heart of precision medicine where if you take something like synthetic controls where you're taking patient level data from a large indication and you're carefully selecting historical patients who are meeting these key eligibility criteria you could basically change the way you think about using data to replace or augment the control arm of a trial and if they've years of enrollment in recruitment time this is huge and single arm trials it's huge and rare indications and even during kovat where you know patient enrollment has taken a beating for certain trials so you're seeing the slides here there's a number of examples where this has worked whether it's been at Flatiron or whether you've seen the homeruns for trying to get access to breakthrough therapy designation what I want to say is if this is such a silver bullet how do we scale this up and we can have a discussion about this but the I'm taking away for how do we kind of scale this is one you have to make data auditable and traceable and qualified and still build that trust the second thing is methodology Before we jump to AI machine learning the bio stats here has to check out and we're seeing kind of you know an example of how do we crawl walk and run and then there are questions around risk modeling you know being part of the ride that pharma companies and biotechs go on with regards to milestones and that gets into how do we define value in terms of what we demonstrate early on at the data science tech company versus what are we doing on behalf of our clients to create those therapies so I'll stop there and turn it over to Amy terrific so with that I Amy Abernethy introduction and a little bit about all the many different things that you do and how you're all the many different ways you're thinking about this emerging and exciting place space that you've update such a large role in defining thank you honored to be here with everyone today and this for me is really meaningful topic I and really my motivating North Star has been my entire career how I take care of this person sitting in front of me it's the hyper individualized personalized medicine question that scales to all the people that send swimming lessons from a clinic in the clinic that we're trying to solve or I was professor of medicine at Duke where I ran the center for running healthcare and we were trying to figure how do we build data platforms and ways to continuously learn and take better and better care of patients that been translated to my next career where I was the chief medical and chief scientific officer at Flatiron health and also was responsible for thinking about how do we develop a lot of the methods that you just heard about with respect to using using oral data for a number of regulatory and scientific purposes and then most they have come to the Food Drug Administration where I have tools on both the principal deputy commissioner of the FDA as well as the acting chief information officer and as begin to this topic of scaling hyper individualized therapy please we're going to talk about the regulatory side in a moment but I thought I would mention one other things relates to my background that also comes along with this issue of scaling as a regulator and from an FDA perspective I got to the FDA where I thought my squares of focus were going to be patient centricity real-world data and personalized medicine and discovered wait a second in order for the FDA's to scale and to meet those needs the FDA itself has to be as efficient and scaled as possible in order to do our work I'd be able to make sure the innovation continues to happen and we're able to regulate the products that came out and as a result I actually stepped back took on the initial role of acting C I know we enhanced the technology modernization action plan in September where we're focused on making sure that we have come on our cloud forward infrastructure at the FDA as well as modern use of data and language in order to allow us to scale our work inside an FTA that matters because as we think about these migrant evangelized therapies we need to make sure that we're not only doing the scientific expertise to evaluate and regulate those therapies and work in concert with industry and with all of you we also have to make sure that we are working as efficiently as possible because here's going to be a lot of regulatory work that goes along with this and so a key part of the technology modernization effort FDA are about allowing FDA regulators to do the mission critical work from a regulatory perspective and reduce the sort of day-to-day grunt work that doesn't need to be done by using technology everything from box to artificial intelligence to just modern data streams and so that's something to keep focus on FDA the other thing that I would point you is what a me draw some highlighted we're on the right-hand corner her slide she mentioned we already have over 900 IEDs for sale in gene therapies and we expect to be improving somewhere on the order of 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy was a year in the next several years if you think of it that we're going to need to be working fast and also as we think about the fact that these kind of tools are often going to come with long periods of follow-up after the initial approval we're not only going to need to work fast for a rapidly expanding look at work but we're going to need to keep that evidence development and diligent regulatory activity going on for a long time and so as FDA we need to be ready along with you and so I think that's one other aspect of scaling that's going to be quite important for our future I'll stop there terrific always it's a pleasure Amy so we will take audience questions so please that contribute them by slide Oh shortly I just wanted to follow up on a couple of points starting with Amy Duras so if I was to sort of summarize what I'm just hearing from today's experts from Amy a Madras is talk it was the value of standards from bob who was talking about sort of the spillover effect that even that when you even when you're development you talk about many things but one of them was when you have a new technology it isn't just the impact on the individual affected but sort of the the broader community the caregivers and and broader community that's affected from RNAV I heard a lot about trust and among that I think all of those topics probably are core to what amy was saying but as well as the idea of needing a modern infrastructure for Amy to Roz could you talk a little bit about standards and to what extent they are how everyone seems to agree that there are so many different areas of technology where if one could agree on standards there'd be so much acceleration and yet it seems where people instances where people collectively agree on that in health care feel more the exception than how has that been going in the course of the work that you've been doing yeah so there are so many different levels of standardization that are required in parallel we deal with every front everything from sort of data standards or the analytics on the analytic side to far more rudimentary and frankly mundane pieces that are just as important certainly for patient safety such as label conventions so many of these hyper individualized therapies as most of you know often cross borders there are different requirements for labels and different geographies even in the same continent so again that just introduces unnecessary risk and opportunity for for error these are you know I think there's some Weaver section the early innings of at least the commercial phase there's tremendous activity as Amy mentioned on the clinical side but just when we get to true scale out is when we achieve commercialization and maybe one one of the fans to your point that I thought was interesting was last year Adam this National Cancer meeting when people were talking you know obviously everyone is so excited for example all these hyper individualized treatments in a context of oncology right but they were it was all of the regulatory requirements that the hospital it was a physician scientist from the Brigham I think who is describing just being massively overwhelmed just to your point by the paperwork by how every regulatory not only me with regulatory authority in the hospital at this society that society had their own little things and it seemed like the paperwork was gonna kill the innovation more than the actual science yeah is that part well your respectively the infrastructure is struggling to keep up with the pace of discovery and so you know the massive efforts like at FDA to really upgrade the the underlying infrastructure I'm so important or we won't be able to really take advantage of this remarkable science I think there is room for optimism here I think there's a increasing focus at least in our industry around sort of what's the low-hanging fruit particularly with regard to the supply chain where there have been so many challenges let's take down a few key standards that we can all agree on across the ecosystem and start to promulgate them I think that will then build the momentum to tackle more the more the more difficult frankly the data analytic side there's a lot as we see in other sectors of Medicine there's a lot of divergence of opinion as to what the right set of standards should be especially when you're dealing with high-value therapies to babu's points you know the the economics of these therapies drive a set of bizarre behavior in our industry unfortunately so I think we're getting some progress I think it's just start with where we can identify convergence and then really build upon that moment and that's certainly what our our company and our group partners is seeking to affect yeah let me have you come a little briefly on an issue of standards and Trust and how you're thinking about it as you think about the challenges of movement from individual therapies to scaling them and then maybe I Amy can comment on this Amy Abernethy didn't comment on this as well let me start with you or not yeah sure so I think there's maybe two sides to it so you know how do you sort of create an apples apples way to look at data and are you adhering to what is sort of an industry accepted or academically accepted standard for the way you think about data conversion which doesn't sound like a particularly sexy topic but as you think about this through the lens of like an actual regulatory submission or how are your packaging and presenting that information it actually matters a lot you know so as the industry starts to think about getting towards SDTM formats and omok models and all these things that tie into clinical and real world there has to be sort of a way for us to all fine alignment on you know what is the quote unquote acceptable way to submit and we struggle and think a lot about that you know in terms of what does it mean to standardize data at scale and how do you create fidelity within the data you know because at the end of it I think what we're trying to do is come up with a way that can validate the fact that we're pulling data from multiple streams from different sources from different parts of the world and they certainly don't speak to each other this is a problem that plagues not only healthcare but all technology so how are we getting that there's there is a commonly regarded way of doing this and I think that's sort of the problem that every organization is going through right now Amy the Tower of Babel challenged their appease if we look for example at the case of Mila presented in the New England Journal back in October the editorial that was written by what cocking Peter marks that went along with that case actually proposed a systematic framework it gives you the checklist that then it starts to set up the framework for the stamp or the standard will look at it from a regulatory lens so they asked you know what do we know in the hyper individualized therapy space when this particular therapy as it relates to safety what do we know about biological plausibility dosing manufacturing purity they also acted they also said that one of the elements of making the regulatory decisions going to be about urgency and they mentioned ethics but also how are we going to determine whether or not this intervention is efficacious so in to do a case Emelia having prior history of understanding for seizure experience and whether or not new intervention now modified seizures was important and then one of the stopping rules and so they actually laid out a framework which is an additional kind of standard and frameworks to steal from a regulatory perspective because allows us to now community communicate across the industry here's what the thinking is and then that starts to translate to guidances in other places you can see it so I think that in order to push this whole field chord with scale up and scale you need essentially connecting transmissions but you also need ways of thinking about how you're going to monitor outcomes to make sure that working is expected terrific thank you so much Amy everybody I'm I think Zack may have some audience questions I'm going to turn the questions over to Zack thank you very much I'm reminded that by the way of how frustrating it is on the one hand to have a medium like zoom where you don't want to actually spend too much time because it's the no other hand the tangent between that and the audience where we have two fine individuals who can give us so much insight and have so little time so in that spirit let me tell you that we're gonna use our slide oh interface to have you ask questions and while you're thinking of questions which by the way are beginning to pile up through slide a while their questions are asked we're going to exercise your slide no mechanical abilities by first giving you the the trivia and then the quiz so Rachel could you first pull up the trivia question our right let's I'm very pleased that I spoofed use my fake name feat Italia which I wish I will make billions anyway now it's going alright everyone okay let's now go to the actual [Music] well I hope you all had a nice SATs stress flashbacks but which you can thank me we now go to the question the part of it all right let's see a lot of a lot of choices here sure what about the value of rare disease research as a way to develop understanding and new tools that could be women hell sorry that could be then applied to common diseases is that a Parsi perceived part of the value so the question is can we use rare disease individualized therapy to inform common disease therapies I I would welcome an answer by Amy you want to pick an answer does does the FDA or is that not beyond the FDA to start it's not the FDA's role to something well can this rare disease therapy apply to a common so from a defining value from an FDA perspective we really think that the individual medical product and it's not think about it from a rare versus Rizzi sources lardy's perspective either I think that the one thing that I will say is the rare disease space teaches us a lot about hm also more common diseases and so there is great value in learning in the representation and applying it across but from the standpoint of dollar value I need to let you answer that all right I have a question I have a question here for for Babu data scale and correctness is only a part along as health insurance companies can profit by selected pricing and exclusion patients risk loss of care by sharing information like familial DNA and what concrete efforts do you think we should take to get basically social protection and it seems to me let's see for health insurance Gina should actually be protecting this legislation that should protect your health insurance from any discriminatory pricing I'm not sure that's true yet of life insurance Baco and think the comment of that not specifically I mean I would say that this is an area where I think regularly regulation is obviously is is critical I will say that you know there is one thing that we have observed with insurance companies are rare disease treatments there you know often with what we see is that certain treatments are not covered it's less so now but either not covered or they're placed on higher cost certain tiers in part because insurance companies have historically used their benefit design to try to attract and not attract certain types of enrollees who may have higher higher costs so when we think about therapies like Carty and other more advanced is to get expensive therapies this is what I'd have in the back of my mind is what are the things that insurance companies might what strategies might they employ to try to not attract these types of enrollees which is something obviously from a public policy perspective we want to kind of watch watch out for so because of the brutality of this medium we have to end this session now and for that I apologize
