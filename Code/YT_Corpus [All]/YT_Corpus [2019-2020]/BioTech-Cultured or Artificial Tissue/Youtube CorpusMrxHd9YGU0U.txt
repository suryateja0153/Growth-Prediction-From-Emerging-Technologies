 biomimetic materials and materials developed using inspiration from nature this may be useful in the design of composite materials natural structures have inspired and innovated human creations notable examples of these natural structures include honeycomb structure of the beehive strength of spider silks bird flight mechanics and shark skin water repellency the ethem illogical roots of the neologism new term biomimetic d'oeuvre Eve from Greek since BIOS means life and the meta cost means imitative you topic tissue engineering biomimetic materials in tissue engineering and materials that have been designed such that they elicit specified cellular responses mediated by interactions with scaffold tethered peptides from extracellular matrix ECM proteins essentially the incorporation of cell binding peptides into biomaterials via chemical or physical modification amino acids located within the peptides are used as building blocks by other biological structures these peptides are often referred to as self assembling peptides since they can be modified to contain biologically active motifs this allows them to replicate information derived from tissue and to reproduce the same information independently thus these peptides act as building blocks capable of conducting multiple biochemical activities including tissue engineering it should be noted that tissue engineering research currently being performed on both short chain and long chain peptides is still in early stages such peptides include both native long chains of ECM proteins as well as short peptide sequences derived from intact ECM proteins the idea is that the biomimetic material will mimic some of the roles that an ECM plays in neural tissue in addition to promoting cellular growth and mobilization the incorporated peptides could also mediate by specific protease enzymes or initiate cellular responses not present in a local native tissue in the beginning long chains of ECM proteins including fibronectin FN v tronic tin VN and laminin lane were used but more recently the Vantage's of using short peptides have been discovered short peptides are more advantageous because unlike the long chains that fold randomly upon adsorption causing the active protein domains to be sterically unavailable short peptides remain stable and do not hide the receptor binding domains when absorbed another advantage to short peptides is that they can be replicated more economically due to the smaller size a bi functional cross linker with a long spacer arm is used to tether peptides to the substrate surface if a functional group is not available for attaching the cross linker photochemical immobilization may be used in addition to modifying the surface biomaterials can be modified in bulk meaning that the cell signaling peptides and recognition sites are present not just on the surface but also throughout the bulk of the material the strength of cell attachment cell migration rate and extent of cytoskeletal organization formation is determined by the receptor binding to the ligand bound to the material thus receptor ligand affinity the density of the ligand and the spatial distribution of the ligand must be carefully considered when designing a biomimetic material topic biomimetic mineralization proteins of their developing enamel extracellular matrix such as amela Chanin control initial mineral deposition nucleation and subsequent crystal growth ultimately determining the physico mechanical properties of the mature mineralized tissue mutations in enamel ECM proteins result in enamel defect such as a melody an ASUS imperfect type one collagen is thought to have a similar role for the formation of dentin and bone nucleate errs bring together mineral ions from the surrounding fluids such as saliva into the form of a crystal lattice structure by stabilizing small nuclei to permit crystal growth forming mineral tissue dental enamel mineral as well as dentin and bone is made of hydroxyapatite with foreign ions incorporated in the structure carbonate fluoride and magnesium are the most common heterotic substituent's in a biomimetic mineralization strategy based on normal enamel history NSS a three-dimensional scaffold is formed to attract and arrange calcium and/or phosphate ions to induce de novo precipitation of hydroxyl apatite two general strategies have been applied one is using fragments known to support natural mineralization proteins such as a mellow genin collagen or dentin phosphor foreign as the basis alternatively de novo macromolecular structures have been designed to support mineralization not based on natural molecules but on rational design topic extracellular matrix proteins many studies utilize laminin 1 when designing a biomimetic material laminin is a component of the extracellular matrix that is able to promote neuron attachment and differentiation in addition to axon growth guidance its primary functional site for bio activity is its called protein domain isoleucine lysine valine alanine valine i kv AV which is located in the alpha minus 1 chain of laminin a recent study by wu chang al synthesized a self-assembled ikv AV peptide nano fiber and tested its effect on the adhesion of neuron like pc-12 cells early cell adhesion is very important for preventing cell degeneration the longer cells are suspended in culture the more likely they are to degenerate the purpose was to develop a biomaterial with good salad hiren sand bioactivity with ikv AV which is able to inhibit differentiation and adhesion of glial cells in addition to promoting neuronal cell adhesion and differentiation the ikv AV peptide domain is on the surface of the Nano fibers so that it is exposed and accessible for promoting cell contact interactions the ikv AV nano fibers promoted stronger salad hiren stan the electrostatic attraction induced by poly l-lysine and cell adherence increased with increasing density of ikv AV until the saturation point was reached i kv AV does not exhibit time-dependent effects because the adherence was shown to be the same at 1 hour and at 3 hours laminin is known to stimulate new right outgrowth and it plays a role in the developing nervous system it is known that gradients are critical for the guidance of growth cones to their target tissues in the developing nervous system there has been much research done on soluble gradients however little emphasis has been placed on gradients of substratum bound substances of the extracellular matrix such as laminin toddler and Bellamkonda fabricated an anisotropic 3d a garros gel with gradients of coupled laminin one lane one concentration gradients of lane one was shown to promote fast a new right extension than the highest neuro right growth rate observed with isotropic Lane one concentrations new rights grew both up and down the gradients but growth was faster at less steep gradients and was faster up the gradients than down the gradients topic biomimetic artificial muscles electroactive polymers eaps are also known as artificial muscles EAPs are polymeric materials and they're able to produce large deformation when applied in an electric field this provides large potential in applications in biotechnology and robotics sensors and actuators topic biomimetic photonic structures the production of structural colors concerns a large array of organisms from bacteria flavo bacterium strain ir1 to multicellular organisms hibiscus tree annum door eater this peel a squid or Christ sacroiliitis summer beetle manipulation of light is not limited to rare and exotic life-forms different organisms evolve different mechanisms to produce structural colors multi-layered cuticle in some insects and plants grating like surface in plants jeremy trickily organized cells in bacteria all of themes stand for a source of inspiration towards the development of structurally colored materials study of the Firefly abdomen revealed the presence of a three layer system comprising the cuticle the photogenic layer and then a reflector layer microscopy of the reflector layer revealed a granulate structure directly inspired from the Firefly reflector layer an artificial granulate film composed of hollow silica beads of about 1.0 5 micrometers was correlated with a high reflection index and could be used to improve light emission in chemiluminescent systems topic artificial enzyme artificial enzyme is a synthetic materials that can mimic partial function of a natural enzyme among em some nano materials have been used to mimic natural enzymes these nanomaterials are termed as nano zaimes nano zaimes as well as other artificial enzymes have found wide applications from biosensing and immunoassays to stem cell growth and pollutant removal
