 [Music] hello everyone welcome to another lecture photography engineering and principles and let's say that I'm gonna continue to talk about drug delivery and various aspects of it so so far what we have learned throughout this course were some initial concepts of how the delivery happens so in traditional forms it's tablets or some capsules or IV injections but then they were we pointed out that what are some of the definitions some pharmacokinetics how they distribute in the body and then we talked about some ways to sort of enhance that delivery so we were talking about sustained release and controlling the system as to how and when to release the drug and during the course of this subject we have learned several strategies we first discuss polymeric conjugates then we talked about some sort of macro devices either reservoirs some pumps some irritable non irritable matrices then we talked about some particles in general how they are synthesized by their useful some injectable hydrogels so all of that we discuss then towards the last two three classes we were discussing protein adsorption which is basically a phenomena that happens on all foreign substances so once you put in an implant the proteins tend to adsorb on those implants and so we pretty much wrapped up the protein adsorption discussion in the last class now we are going to move forward with tissue engineering and this is again a very very explosive field these days quite a lot of research is going on and sex actually very exciting as well as very promising for patients so we will briefly discuss as to what the buzz is all about this engineering I think as you'll see in this course throughout the rest of the course we'll discuss tissue engineering as well as drug delivery simultaneously and this engineering itself involves lot of delivery of different biomolecules or small drugs and so it becomes important to talk about engineering in a course of drug delivery so let's just quickly recap what we learned in the last class we basically as I said finished up our discussion on protein adsorption so why and how their job towards the end we were discussing about multi-layer model which we were saying that if we have a surface it will not only form a single layer of protein but it will have multi layers and then we said that at some point they'll be hard Corona which is fairly stable and doesn't change a whole lot and then the outer layer will be what was defined as soft Karuna and what does this is this is also protein getting adsorbed by some affinity but this has very low affinity so these proteins can actually go in and out whereas the hard Coronas fairly stable then we talked about protein adsorption quantification so there were few things here when was the SDS page so you can take your material you can treat it with SDS heated up SDS is going to denature all protein and will interact very strongly with the protein so that way all the protein that was on the surface will come out and then you can run a paid gel to figure out what is the molecular weight and then follow it up with some kind of a western blot for a specific protein to sort of give you semi quantification of how much amount of proteins are there and then which are the different types of proteins that are also present and then another way to quantify this is to use something called SPR which is the surface plasmon resonance depends on the dielectric of a particular surface as protein adsorbed to it the dielectric changes and that's how you can quantify it burning some standards so these are two of the methods we discussed and then we had a paper discussion which had talked about gold nanoparticles which were coated with poly acrylic acid and we showed at least this paper showed that what can happen is once these foreign substances go in the body all kinds of protein adds up to is in this case a protein that was involved was fibrin region and what was happening in frequent immersion it was getting denatured on the surface of these gold nanoparticles because of that there were some hidden sites which were getting exposed one of those hidden sites was interacting with a receptor called Mac Mun and this mac one then further cost upregulation of NF kappa-b which is again a master regulator for sort of initiation of immune response that resulted in lots of cytokines being released and all downstream processes that are responsible and controlled by NF kappa-b so what we learn here is that even though we feel that gold is a very suitable material it doesn't have much toxicity but depending on its configuration and depending on surface charge surface coatings we find that it can actually cause inflammation right so I mean all of this is essentially leading to inflammation and which could be toxic to the body so if you inject too much of this and the inflammation really goes out of the hand the patient may actually have to go to the hospitals and we have to get me anti-inflammatories and things like that so this is just one thing and what we found is if we replace PA with some other polymer this at least the fibrinogen based inflammation is more than happening but and then similarly the size of the gold fibrin ohmmeter was giving a lot more inflammation whereas 20 nanometre not so much so so there are several factors at play here so just on the basis of the size or the surface coating or the charge as we saw you can have very different outcomes of whatever your therapy is so these are some important things to consider when you design these materials for use in human and patients okay okay so with that let's let's jump in dubash engineering as I said it's a very exciting field and quite a lot of buzz is around it and we are also going to discuss it in the next few classes and so what essentially is tissue engineering this engineering is nothing but is the use of combinations of cells engineering and materials to improve or replace some of the biological tissues that we have in our body some of the examples here are and some of them are very familiar with so you might have seen hip joint replacement so a lot of time metals are used here because of course these two is required the hip joint actually carries the whole body forward so Modell's is a stainless steel titanium very widely used for this sometimes cobalt and chromium in all you have heard about the heart pumps so let's say if your heart cells are not able to pump very well then a pump external pump is put in which gives heart signal to pump at a certain rate if you've heard about total knee replacement which is essentially if you are suffering from osteoarthritis and lot of your cartilage is gotten damaged then you can go in and again this is also based on metal metal materials such as stainless steel these actually are very very widely used in current clinics so you will actually find people already with some some of these sorts of implants another thing that you will often see is in case of complex or sort of large fractures what you'll find is the doctors will put a plate and some screws to sort of stabilize these plates in the fractures and again there that is required because this is a structural organ it needs to bear the weight and so you need to have quite a bit of stability around it and these are some things that are very very widely used in fact if you really look around you might find some people you know that have these implants then we have also heard about obviously we heard about lenses so lens is quite a lot of people use so these could be either the glasses themselves which is not brilliant of the class of tissue engineering because this is something external that you are using but then you have contact lenses and sometimes these contact lenses may also be made out of polymers and all these are very widely used in clinics then you have artificial kidneys and external dialysis that happens so those are again part of that the the ribs and the spine also has implants which are used to stabilize it so this is basically just an overview I mean their lot lot and lots and lots more that is being done now these days with the human tissue engineering and you'll find quite a lot of that you may find people having some sort of deformities in their nose and then their nose this were ascetic purposes has been added with some polymers and you find silicone breast implants so all of those things are there so we will discuss briefly about few of these things it's again as I said tissue engineering could be a whole code by itself but we soon will touch upon some of the concepts that are required especially in drug delivery scenario through this dish engineering module okay so this was one of the very controversial image that was published quite a while back now this is essentially what you're seeing here is a mouse a laboratory Mouse in 97 Josefa Canty's group actually published his groundbreaking paper and what they had done is they have made a year out of a cow cartilage so they'd they took cow cells in this case chondrocytes which are the cells of the cartilage major cells of the cartilage and then they did some dish engineering and grafted it into a scaffold and put it on a mouse bag and let it grow and after certain amount of time they get a structure like this where you can see a sort of very similar to a human ear looking like structure on a mouse back so this was proposed it is one of wave that we can tissue engineer some of these tissues and get them ready for humans so whenever he needed at that point he'll euthanized this mouse take the same plant and use it for humans I mean of course that was the vision at that time we know that there are lots of hurdles that we need to do because some of them are crossed now and then some of them still needs work on before it can become a reality for humans so as I said and then further the technology has improved in this case they were using cow cells now actually several groups have reported similar results using actually human cells so you can actually take cells from a human body culture it for some time implant in some animal either mouse or some other animal and and then have these tissues ready if you need to put it in humans again none of this is actually done so far but then there's quite a lot of excitement as well it's quite a lot of debate about how and whether to do it or not and that is currently going on and just a side note I mean this is of course a nude mice so if you are wondering why this mice is not rejecting these cow cells or human cells because there's a nude mice and what I mean by nude mice is these mites don't have any immune system so these might actually have a heavily susceptible for infections they can't really survive out in the wild they are only grown in laboratory conditions extremely clean conditions to make sure that none of these mites get infected with any sort of pathogen and only then you can put these cells which which can then survive because the mouse immune system is not going to attack them since the mouse does not have immune system so those are called nude Mouse okay so further on dish engineering so I mean this engine can technically be divided into sort of four five domains so I'm just gonna briefly describe these domains one is you generate the whole tissue in vitro and then like in the previous image and then you replace the damaged tissues in patient so in the previous image if it was done in Mouse but then that has lots of ethical as well as translational issues what happens if you implant mouse some of the blood vessels might be from the mouse so those are some of the issues there so an ideal way would be to let's forget about the mouse just use all human cells and grow it in some called some kind of a culture dish get to the whole dish a level and then if the patient comes in with some let's say damaged lung then you replace the lung from the culture dish for the human I mean again this is all at this point I hope that this will happen in future some of the results that have come come up has shown that this can actually happen but in the actual scenario it has never happened so far and that the research and the technology is still needs more work before this can actually happen and needs for all tissues then the other sort of branch of this engineering is to generate part of the tube so this is actually you'll find is more closer to human translation so essentially let's say if I come with a damaged tissue part of my liver is damaged and I can still live without it but my function is sort of hindered or it may continue to get hindered so I want to get some sort of a healing process to start maybe have that whatever the tissue is damaged so my level is now operating it let's say 50% capacity so I want to get that 100% capacity back so you can grow a part of the tissue in vitro and then replace it the damaged portions replace it with the damaged portions on in the patient so that way maybe I wouldn't get to hundred percent 150 percent but maybe 80 percent of the labor is now functional that's the hope in that case so this is again still needs a lot more work before it's start to get used heavily in humans but as you'll see some of this is actually starting to translate and a lot more hope for this section of this engineering to actually go into the humans is currently among the scientists and the clinicians then the next thing is let's not grow the tissue let's that tissue handle how to grow itself but what you can do is you can provide a scaffold so again the same example let's say half of my liver is damaged it's only operating in 50% I have tried to grow a liver tissue in my lab as a scientist and it's very difficult so what you can do is you can instead of doing all this process in vitro in your lab what you can do is you can put the scaffold add the damaged version supplement it let's say with whatever growth actors that you might be requires let's say you put some growth factors maybe some cells and the scaffold of course and give it the right conditions the right properties of these scaffold for the stem cells in that niche to sort of populate this and start to make the damaged tissue and that way you can essentially help the patient destroy some of the function and that was lost during the damage and then the final one which is actually now very widely used in the engineering and we give some examples in the last slide is to adding support or filler material to support the function of the damaged tissue so this could be let's say if I need a structural support so I'm putting in a metal such as stainless steel or titanium to replace bone or to support bone this could be that my lenses are not working in my eyes so I put in a contact lens that again is made out of polymers or my teeths are having issues and what I can do is whatever teeth is having problems I can replace them with some artificial teeth and then there's several several applications the more you read about it the more you will get to know of how different support and filler material are being used actually in clinics so among all this this is this particular point is highly translational highly translational and is actually being used in clinics quite lost currently using clinics and more and more solutions are also coming up the regeneration is again is somewhat translation not as translation as the last point so it is translational and very little is being actually used in clinics and then these two point at at this point more futuristic and then the hope is at some point of time the technology will advance enough that we can reach at this goal at this point I mean the idea is translational but at this point it doesn't in near future at least in the next 2-3 years it doesn't seem like this is going to be of something that's going to be used in Hue in humans quite a lot okay so let's discuss again each of these point in a little more detail so so at this point for a whole tissue replacement let's talk about what are the technologies that are out there so one is and you might have heard of this organ donation in all one is to sort of have it transplanted from another human and so let's say if a human is registered as an organ donor if I am registered as organ donor and I meet an accident and I'm dying at that point some of my tissues which are not damaged in the part of the accident let's say it's eyes or let's says something else those tissues can be then retreat from my body and then put into recipient who's actually suffering from let's say some disease maybe the eyes he's complete he or she is completely blind and needs an eye implant so those can be then transferred and this is again very very heavily used in clinics what you actually find is there's a quite a lot of demand for organs to be donated the in fact they're not enough organs to be donated so that is something that we can consider to become as a to be signing up as an organ donor and that actually helps life when we are not there anymore so some of the issues with this particular thing as I just mentioned there's lack of donors there's a challenge as that disease may spread let's say if a donor it was suffering from some chronic disease could be HIV infectious disease or could be something else and then there's a chance that some of those HIV viruses will end up going to your recipient as well so the disease transmission is high so it needs to be it needs to make sure that whatever organ is being used has been vetted very well to ensure that it won't spread the disease and then the final and the major hurdle with this sort of thing is immune rejection so again all humans are different so if I get an implant from another human my my immune system is not going to like it at all it's gonna continue to attack it and continue to damage it so not only not only my I will suffer from all kinds of problems because my body is in a continual state of inflammation but then the organ will eventually get damaged so what you'll find is most of the time when these organs are donated some kind of immunosuppressants are given so immunosuppressants are given and then over quite a long time and then that then increases the risk of infection because now what I've done is to accept that donor implant we have suppressed my immunity and now because my immunity suppressed I have more susceptible to get infections such as bacterial diseases viruses worms and all kinds of things so all of these become an issue and then most of the time you'll find that only few years is when few years survival of the organ is observed so what this means is even though I'm an immunosuppressant my immune system is still rejecting it the cells in this new donor organ that I received an are also very happy because my immune system continues to attack it even with the immunosuppressants and eventually because of all this the function of the new organ that I've got is continue to go down and down and eventually it will get rejected so for a few years maybe five maybe ten depending on the organ and the side of the location you may end up getting quite a bit of help from this but then it goes back to the issue of lack of donors because what we are saying is one donor is not going to be enough for one recipient for a longer period of time so when there's been many donors from very large amount of donors rather than just from a single donor so some of the strategy is to sort of reduce this immune rejection is then is what is called the HLA typing and we'll talk about more of this HLA and MHC when we get to the immune part of the course but what is essentially being seen is we all humans are divided into several types of HLA so what I mean if I have an particular type of HLA my immune system is closer to another base person who is a similar type of HLA if I have a similar actually to another human that means that my immune system is very similar to that particular human so if I get an organ from those types of donors then those implant will survive longer because my body is not be as quick to reject that implant it will still rejected or still eilen immunosuppressant but the chances of the graph to survive is much higher so those are again some of the things that is done so you'll hear this actually typing them quite a lot when you go go around and look for donors another tissue that has actually very well is the blood so blood donation you'll see all the time I'm sure well some of you might even donated blood or deceived blood but then the blood donation works very well just because these blood cells have a lifecycle of only about three to four months and so and then their immunogenicity is also very low so immune system doesn't really reject them a whole lot and then anyways these cells get recycled everything for months anyways so this blood donation works very well in terms of the organs but then when you talk about big organs in solid organs and those have always risk of immunosuppression the other way that is being now done is to get transplant from genetically modified pigs so pigs has been studied quite a lot for this and they've been found to be very similar to human well of course not as similar as another human but still among all the different species pigs are supposed to be the closest as well as in very similar and sort of the sizes of the organs as well the problem again is going to come back to this issue of the immune rejection however what people are now starting to do is they're continuing to modify pigs for more and more such that whatever different aspects of the immune system and that is recognizing that this is foreign and it's a big thing not a human thing and those slowly and slowly with more and more genetic modification all those things are getting removed from the pigs by genetic modification so what what is resulting in the end is the pigs are becoming very closer to human more so than what they are in the natural state these genetically modified pigs their organs are getting very very similar to human organs and especially the regions that get rejected are being removed more and more so what you find is it's becoming a viable alternative to the human donation just because these pigs are very ideals because if you need an organ you can get it at a very short time right because you can have a pig farm where you can get these pigs and let's say if I come in with a requirement for an eye those pigs can be used to immediately get eyes for my my body so again but again having said all that this is still very far away from reality to be used in clinics so it will still need a lot of work before these things can be become a possible alternative to humans as I said a very mean injection is a still a major issue so on this whole tissue replacement there not many bioengineering approaches that are available so you can't really grow a whole tissue in the body or in an outside in a dish the problem there is it becomes the problem of a size so major limitation is a lack of blood vessels so once so if I have a single monolayer of cells that survives very well in in a laboratory setting but as I start to stack up more and more cells together the oxygen diffusion to the inner core of this tissue will become an issue and that's why in our body you'll find there lots or lots of blood vessels and they're made our job is to make sure that the the blood glucose the oxygen is going to every part of the tissue and when I grow them in vitro in a culture dish it's very hard for me to get to that level of intricacy and that level of distribution as we see in our own organs or in animal organs and that's why you can only get very very thin tissues a millimeter at max and once you start going bigger than that you start seeing quite a lot of cell death in the center which limits sort of the growth of the tissue so this has been a major issue lots and lots of people are working to sort of figure out how we can overcome this how we can also grow blood vessels at the same time to ensure that enough oxygen and glucose and waste material is getting removed from the system so one thing that has come up is 3d printing of the tissue so what people are doing is using 3d printers and essentially making these large tissue structure with let's say vessels going through them or at least the space for the vessels to going through them so the media can actually go through and then the rest of the places they'll grow their tissues and there'll be another blood vessel so that way they can get to little bigger areas so this is the flow and the rest is a tissue so that way they can get to bigger issues but still the problem is there is still a new feel is still very nascent and still to be seen whether something grown from this is going to be very functional in animal setting although quite a lot of research is being done on this and one of the most widely used strategy for a whole dish replacement is for it's called deceleration of tissues and so what has essentially done is the tissue is taken as d cellular eyes so let's say if I take a heart let's say a lung let's say this lung tissue that contains all kinds of things that contains vessels which are full in everywhere in the lungs that can means lots and lots of cells that contains lots of extracellular matrix that makes up the region on which the cells are growing and so what is done is this tissue is taken either from cadavers or from animals this tissue is then treated with several reagents to make it be civilized and what that means is all these cells are removed all the free proteins free genetic material is removed and once that is done most of the things that are recognized by the immune system are these cells and these small small proteins that are different from the humans and once they remove those are fairly non immunogenic material and then you can come in and seed cells from a patient body or from a human source which will then result in a filling of these these sort of hosts of your initial lungs and they also have their blood vessels as well so you can see it all kinds of cells cells represent blood vessels and ethereal cells the cells are present in the lung epithelial cells and culture this and then you can use it as an implant again very widely used in research not a whole lot of it is he being used in clinics okay so we'll stop here and we'll continue the rest in the next class thank you
