 GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. WELCOME TO THE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON LECTURE, WHICH THIS TIME IS AT NIH DIRECTOR'S LECTURE, THE NIH DIRECTOR IS HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE INTRODUCTION TO A SPECIAL PRESENTER. DR. JUDITH CAMPISI IS A REMARKABLE RESEARCHER IN THE AREA OF AGING AND ALSO CANCER AND ALSO IS A FRIEND OF MINE. I'M DELIGHTED THEREFORE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE HER THIS INTRODUCTION. SHE IS CURRENTLY PROFESSOR AT THE BUCK INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON AGING AND SENIOR SCIENTIST AT THE LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY, LIFE SCIENCES DIVISION, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT USC. SHE DID UNDERGRADUATE WORK AND Ph.D. AT STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK IN STONY BROOK, FOLLOWING THAT DID A POSTDOC AT THE DANA-FARBER, AFTER SPENDING SOME SIX YEARS AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AS ASSISTANT AND THEN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, SHE MOVED TO LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB IN 1990, WHERE SHE CONTINUES TO THIS DAY HAVING AN APPOINTMENT BUT THEN IN 2002 SET UP LABORATORY AT THE BUCK INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON AGING. HER RESEARCH HAS I THINK BEEN REMARKABLY CONTRIBUTORY IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PHENOMENON CALLED SENESCENCE. I KNOW JUDY BECAUSE MY OWN LAB WORKS ON PROGERIA, PREMATURE AGING, CELLS UNDERGO SENESCENCE MUCH TOO RAPIDLY AND SO THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE THOSE CELLS LIKEWISE HAVE A SHORTENED LIFESPAN. AND THE KIND OF WORK JUDY HAS DONE AND WILLINGNESS TO DEDICATE HERSELF TO HELPING OUT WITH THIS RARE CONDITION BY SERVING IN MULTIPLE WAYS WITH THE PROGERIA RESEARCH FOUNDATION IS JUST AN INDICATION OF HOW IMPORTANT HER EFFORTS HAVE BEEN IN SHEDDING LIGHT ON THIS COMMON PHENOMENON, IT'S HAPPENING TO SOME OF YOUR CELLS RIGHT NOW AND WE'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. A PARTICULAR PHENOMENON WHICH SHE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MENTION, WHICH I THINK WAS A NEW REVELATION TO MANY OF US IS THE CONCEPT OF SASP, SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED SECRETORY PHENOTYPE, WHICH TAUGHT US SENESCENT CELLS ARE NOT JUST GETTING IN THE WAY BUT OTHERWISE NOT BEING HARMFUL. THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOME PRETTY SERIOUSLY BAD THINGS TO THEIR HEALTHY NEIGHBORS. THE MORE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, THE BETTER SHOT WE WILL HAVE IN GETTING A FULL GRASP ON HOW WE MIGHT GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO MORE PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE HEALTHY AGING. SO, IT IS REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SPECIAL PRESENTERS TO NIH ON WEDNESDAYS, TODAY IS A NICE EXAMPLE OF THAT, TO PUT IT MILDLY. PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING DR. JUDITH CAMPISI. [APPLAUSE] SO THANK YOU, FRANCIS, FOR THE VERY KIND INTRODUCTION. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE, I HAVE FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES, HOPEFULLY MORE AFTER TODAY. THIS IS JUST CLASSIC DISCLOSURE, I'M NOT GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING THE COMPANY IS DOING. BUT I WILL START WITH AGING. AND SO LET'S SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE COULD LIKE TO LIVE A LONG LIFE? [LAUGHTER] GOOD. YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PARTIAL LIST OF THE VERY, VERY MANY DISEASES THAT ARE CONSIDERED AGE-RELATED DISEASES. AND WHAT IS SO REMARKABLE ABOUT THESE DISEASES, VERY DIFFERENT TISSUES, VERY DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF WHAT GOES WRONG, AND YET ALL OF THESE DISEASES HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. THEY ARE EXTREMELY RARE IN YOUNG PEOPLE AND SOMEWHERE AROUND THE MID-POINT OF THE LIFESPAN, SO 50 TO 60 YEARS FOR PEOPLE, ALL OF THESE DISEASES RISE WITH EXPONENTIAL KINETICS. NOW, THOSE OF US WHO WORK ON AGING, WE THINK IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE. AND WE THINK IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE PROBABLY BASIC AGING PROCESSES THAT ARE DRIVING ALL OF THESE DISEASES, AND CAN ACCOUNT FOR MANY OF THE PHENOTYPES WE ASSOCIATE WITH AGING. SO, AS FRANCIS POINTED OUT, TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY OF ONE SUCH PROCESS THAT WE THINK QUALIFIES FOR BEING A BASIC AGE PROCESS, CELLULAR SENESCENCE. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE IDEA THAT WE THINK THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT DRIVES AGING. BUT I THINK WE CAN NOW SAY THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS DRIVING MULTIPLE MANIFESTATIONS OF AGING. SO, WHAT IS CELLULAR SENESCENCE? I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU TWO WAYS THAT PEOPLE IN THE FIELD THINK ABOUT SENESCENCE, AND THEN I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A THIRD WAY WHICH I THINK IS APTLY THE MORE ACCURATE WAY. SO, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CELLS BECOME SENESCENT, SO THIS IS A CELL FATE. AND THIS CELL'S FATE CAN BE ADOPTED BY CELLS IN RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF STRESSES. SO, WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THESE STRESSES IS THEY ARE COMMON DRIVERS OF TWO THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT PHYSIOLOGICALLY, ONE IS CANCER, THE OTHER IS AGING. AND THE FATE THAT THE CELLS ADOPT IS TO UNDERGO WHAT WE CALL A TRY PARTHIDE PHENOTYPE, THEY WILL NEVER GO TO FORM A TUMOR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DIVIDE AGAIN. COUPLED TO THIS GROWTH ARREST ARE TWO OTHER PHENOTYPES, THE CELLS TEND TO RESIST APOPTOSIS, THEY CAN DIE, I'LL SHOW YOU WE CAN GET THEM TO DIE, BUT THEY PREFER NOT TO DIE. THEY ARE FAIRLY STABLE. THEY BEGIN TO SECRETE A WIDE VARIETY OF MOLECULES WHICH I'LL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT AS THE LECTURE GOES ON. THE TRIPARTITE PHENOTYPE WITH BE INDUCED BY LOTS OF THINGS CONSIDERED STRESSORS. MANY OCCUR DURING AGING. BUT THERE'S A SECOND WAY TO THINK ABOUT SENESCENCE, AND IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GETS AT THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF WHY THIS PHENOTYPE EVOLVED. THERE ARE NOW TWO LABS THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE ARE WAVES OF SENESCENCE IN EMBRYO, BOTH MICE AND HUMANS, AND AT LEAST IN MICE IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THOSE SENESCENT CELLS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FINE TUNING THE MORPHOGENESIS IN THE EMBRYO. IN TEXAS THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT LABOR BEGINS WITH A WAVE OF SENESCENCE, AND WHEN YOU UNDERGO EARLY LABOR, EARLY WAVE OF SENESCENCE, AND WOMEN WHO UNDERGO LATE LABOR HAVE A LATE WAVE OF SENESCENCE. IT SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT FOR INITIATING LABOR. AND THEN FINALLY WE AND OTHER LABS HAVE SHOWN THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE IS IMPORTANT FOR OPTIMIZING TISSUE REPAIR AND WOUND HEALING. I THINK THE WAY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SENESCENCE IS EVOLUTIONARY TRADEOFF, POSITIVE ASPECTS, AND WE THINK THIS WAS THE EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE TO DEVELOP THE CELL FATE, BUT THEN I'LL SHOW YOU LATE IN LIFE THE SAME PROCESSES HEALTHY FOR US WHEN WE'RE YOUNG CAN BE DELETERIOUS AND DRIVE AGING PHENOTYPES AND A LARGE NUMBER OF AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES AT LEAST IN A MOUSE. SO THIS IS THE DOWN SIDE. I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THIS IDEA THAT THERE CAN BE SOMETHING THAT WAS UNDER EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE THAT'S GOOD WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG BUT THE SAME THING CAN BE BAD FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE OLD IS MANY DECADES OLD, FIRST DESCRIBED BY GEORGE WILLIAMS, TERMED ANTAGONISTIC PLEIOTROPY. I'LL ARGUE SENESCENCE IS ANTAGONISTIC PLEIOTROPY AND TRIES TO MAKE UNDOING THE BAD THINGS SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING. LET ME VERY BRIEFLY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW WE CAN IDENTIFY SENESCENT CELLS. THERE ARE NOW LITERALLY MORE THAN A DOZEN DIFFERENT MARKERS THAT MANY LABS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO, SO WE CAN -- SOME ARE LISTED HERE. SOME INVOLVE THIS MOLECULES THAT ARE SECRETED BUT THEY ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN CELLS THAT ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY SENESCENT CELLS. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SO FAR AS I CAN TELL, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SENESCENCE-SPECIFIC MARKER. ALL THE MARKERS HAVE LIVES OUTSIDE OF SENESCENCE, AND SO THIS IS SOME CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SENESCENT STATE. THOSE THINKING ABOUT WORKING IN THIS FIELD TAKE HEART. YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT MULTIPLE MARKERS IN ORDER TO HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT A CELL IS INDEED SENESCENT. BUT USING THESE MARKERS, A NUMBER OF LABS NOW HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION, WHEN AND WHERE DO YOU FIND THESE CELLS THAT HAVE ADOPTED THIS SENESCENT CELL STATE? AND THE ANSWER IS TWO-FOLD. THE FIRST IS THEY INCREASE WITH AGE. SO FAR AS I KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN VIRTUALLY EVERY VERTEBRATE SPECIES THAT HAS BEEN EXAMINED, THAT SENESCENT CELLS INCREASE WITH AGE, AND THEY INCREASE IN MULTIPLE TISSUES. ACTUALLY, ALSO EVERY TISSUE THAT HAS BEEN EXAMINED HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ACCUMULATE SENESCENT CELLS WITH AGE. THIS IS HEALING SKIN. THIS IS ONE OF THESE MARKERS, IT'S AN ENZYME, THE BLUE STAINING OF THE DYE THE ENZYME CONVERTS INTO AN INSOLUBLE PRECIPITATE. AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S PRESENT IN THE DERMIS AND EPIDERMIS OF OLDER SKIN BUT VERY RARE IN YOUNG SKIN. THIS EXPERIMENT, YOUNG WAS UNDER 30, OLD WAS OVER 50. SO I PROBABLY JUST GOT HALF THE AUDIENCE HERE DEPRESSED. BUT THAT'S OKAY. I'M GOING TO CHEER YOU UP AT THE END, I THINK. I HOPE. OKAY. BUT THE OTHER PLACE THAT A NUMBER OF LABS HAVE NOW SHOWN CELLS ARE PRESENT IS AT SITES OF AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGY. SO IF YOU COMPARE DISEASED WITH AGE MATCHED HEALTHY TISSUE THERE ARE MORE SENESCENT CELLS IN THE DISEASED TISSUE COMPARED TO AGE MATCHED HEALTHY TISSUE. HERE IS -- THESE ARE SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS FROM THE PULMONARY ARTERY OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISORDER, MAJOR CAUSE OF LUNG FAILURE IN THE ELDERLY. THIS IS AGE MATCH CONTROL, THERE'S ALWAYS MORE IN THE DISEASED TISSUE. THIS IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE. úTHIS IS AUTOPSY MATERIAL, OBVIOUSLY, FROM A PATIENT WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. IF YOU COMPARE THE BRAINS OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE VERSUS AGE-MATCHED BRAIN THAT IS NOT DISEASED THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE SENESCENT CELLS IN THE DISEASED BRAIN BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS FOR THE MOST PART WHAT ARE THE -- THE CELLS THAT ARE SENESCENT ARE ASTROCYTES, NOT NEURONS, NOT MICROGLIA. I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT ASTROCYTES ARE ONE OF THE CELL TYPES THAT CAN GIVE RISE TO BRAIN CANCER. SO AGAIN SUGGESTING, ENFORCING THE IDEA THIS IS AN ANTI-CANCER MECHANISM. SO, IN THINKING ABOUT THIS EVOLUTIONARY BALANCING ACT, I'M GOING TO FIRST DESCRIBE VERY BRIEFLY WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS GROWTH ARREST AND THEN TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THIS SECRETORY PHENOTYPE, BECAUSE WE THINK THIS IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR DRIVING AGING AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES. SO, GROWTH ARREST HAS BEEN -- THAT WAS FIRST STUDIED ACTUALLY BY A NUMBER OF MAJOR LABS THAT WERE WORKING ON THE CELL CYCLE. AND IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT THIS GROWTH ARREST IS IMPOSED BY WHAT ARE ARGUABLY THE TWO MOST POWERFUL TUMOR SUPPRESSOR PATHWAYS THAT WE HAVE ENCODED IN THE HUMAN GENOME, OR THE MAMMALIAN GENOME. AND THAT IS THE PATHWAY THAT'S DRIVEN BY P53, AND PATHWAY THAT'S DRIVEN BY THE RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN. I'LL COME TO THIS POINT IN A MINUTE, P 16INK4A IS IMPORTANT FOR KEEPING RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN IN UNPHOSPHORYLATED FORM. THESE PATHWAYS CAN INDEPENDENTLY DRIVE A CELL INTO SENESCENCE, BUT THEY ALSO TEND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. AND SO OFTEN YOU SEE BOTH, FOR EXAMPLE, P21 AND P16 IN SENESCENT CELLS BUT THEY CAN ALSO SOMETIMES ACT INDEPENDENTLY. THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE IS ACTUALLY EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THOSE PATHWAYS. I'M GOING TO TALK YOU THROUGH WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE. WE FIRST DISCOVERED IT USING ANTIBODY ARRAY, MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO, THERE WERE NO HIGH-THROUGHPUT WAYS OF LOOKING AT SECRETED PROTEINS. WE DEFINED IT AS CONTAINING ABOUT 40 DIFFERENT SECRETED PROTEINS. NOW WITH UNBIASED MASS SPEC ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND BY MORE THAN TEN-FOLD. THE CELLS ARE SECRETING 400 MOLECULES. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS SECRETORY PHENOTYPE IS THAT IT IS VERY ENERGY DEMANDING, AND ENERGY CONSUMING. YOU MAY READ SOMETIMES IN THE LATE PRESS THEY REFER TO SENESCENT CELLS AS ZOMBIE CELLS. THEY ARE NOT ZOMBIES. THEY ARE BALLERINAS. AND THEY ARE EXPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE SECRETING ALL THESE MOLECULES. IT'S HIGHLY COMPLEX, AS I SAID NOW, THERE ARE 400 PROTEINS IDENTIFIED. IT IS THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE MOST IMPORTANT FOR DRIVING AGING PATHOLOGIES AND AGE-RELATED PHENOTYPES. SO, THIS PHENOTYPE, THE SO-CALLED SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED SECRETORY PHENOTYPE WILL VARY WITH CELL TYPE. I'LL SHOW AN EXAMPLE. IT'S DYNAMIC, CHANGES OVER TIME. AND IT DEPENDS UPON HOW THE CELLS WERE INDUCED TO BECOME SENESCENT, WHETHER THROUGH METABOLISM OR DNA DAMAGE OR ANY OF THE OTHER INDUCERS. SO LET ME FIRST SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE CELL TYPE SPECIFICITY. THIS IS ANTIBODY ARRAY, EVERYTHING IN YELLOW IS HIGHLY SECRETED, BLUE OR BLACK IS NO CHANGE OR SECRETED AT LOW LEVELS. AND THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WAS FIRST DONE BY JEAN-PHILIPPE, HE TOOK FIBROBLAST AND EPITHELIAL CELLS FROM THE SAME TISSUE, IN THIS CASE A PROSTATE. A HUMAN PROSTATE. SO, THE GENOTYPE IS THE SAME. BUT THE CELL TYPES ARE DIFFERENT. AND HE INDUCED THE CELLS TO BECOME SENESCENT USING IONIZING RADIATION. AND SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THERE ARE THINGS IN COMMON THAT ARE SECRETED BY BOTH TYPES OF CELLS, BOTH STROMA AND EPITHELIUM, BUT THEY ARE THINGS THAT ARE STROMAL SPECIFIC AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE EPITHELIAL SPECIFIC. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS NOW LOOKING AT DOZENS OF DIFFERENT HUMAN AND MOUSE CELL TYPES THAT EACH CELL TYPE SEEMS TO HAVE ITS OWN COMPLEMENT OF MOLECULES THAT IT SECRETES WHEN IT BECOMES SENESCENT. IT'S ALSO DYNAMIC. I'M SHOWING AN EXAMPLE NOW OF TWO GENES INDUCED UPON IONIZING RADIATION STIMULUS TO INDUCE SENESCENCE IN HUMAN FIBROBLASTS. ONE OF THESE GENES CODES FOR LEUKOTRIENE, I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN A MOMENT, TO REMIND YOU LEUKOTRIENE, THIS IS PARTICULAR LEUKOTRIENE IS PRO FIBROTIC, YOU DO NEED AN INITIAL FIBROTIC RESPONSE IN ORDER TO HEAL A WOUND. YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS IS VERY EARLY INCREASE IN EXPRESSION OF THIS GENE AND THEN IT FALLS. SLOWLY COMES BACK AGAIN AND EVENTUALLY COMES DOWN TO BASELINE. THIS IS THE EXPRESSION OF A GENE THAT CODES FOR A PROSTAGLANDIN, SLOWLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE GENE RISES, STAYS HIGH AS LONG AS CELLS ARE SENESCENT. WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF GENES THAT SEEM TO CHANGE OVER TIME DEPENDING ON PHYSIOLOGIC CONTEXT. FINALLY IT DEPENDS ON THE INDUCER. OOPS, LET'S SEE. THERE WE GO. IT REALLY DEPENDS UPON THE INDUCER. WHAT I'VE LISTED HERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN DRIVE CELLS INTO A SENESCENT STATE. GENOTOXIC STRESS, MANY ONCOGENES WILL DRIVE CELLS INTO SENESCENCE. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GROWTH ARREST BEING TUMOR SUPPRESSIVE. JUST OVER EXPRESSING THE CELL CYCLE INHIBITORS BIKE P 16 OR P21 WILL CAUSE SENESCENCE RESPONSE. MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION ALSO WILL DRIVE CELLS INTO SENESCENCE. AND WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS JUST CODE FOR YOU DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF SECRETED MOLECULES THAT ARE DEPENDENT UPON HOW THE CELLS WERE INDUCED TO SENESCE. ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW IN VIVO, CERTAINLY NOT IN HUMANS, HOW SENESCENT CELLS ARE DRIVEN INTO THIS SENESCENT STATE. WE'RE SORT OF NOW TRYING TO GET AT THAT QUESTION BY CHARACTERIZING THE SECRETOME THAT MAY GIVE HINTS WHETHER IT'S MOSTLY MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION OR MOSTLY DNA DAMAGE, AND SO WE'LL SEE THOSE EXPERIMENTS ARE ONGOING. AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THE SENESCENT STATE IS IT IS SURPRISINGLY HETEROGENEOUS. SO WE'VE DONE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT. WE'VE TAKEN NORMAL HUMAN LUNG FIBROBLASTS, AND TREATED THEM WITH A CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT, DOXORUBICIN, A DNA DAMAGING AGENT, IT'S KNOWN TO CAUSE ACTUALLY -- I JUST GOT -- I JUST LEFT A WORKSHOP THAT WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE NIA AND NCI ON TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY CERTAIN CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS& SEEM TO ACCELERATE AGING IN A PATIENT POPULATION. SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS, DAMAGES DNA, CAUSING CELLS TO BECOME SENESCENT. SO, SAME GENOTYPE. SAME ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS ALL DONE IN TISSUE CULTURE. NOW WHAT WE'VE DONE IS SINGLE CELL ANALYSIS OF THESE TWO POPULATIONS. SO, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU ARE USED TO DEALING WITH SINGLE CELL ANALYSES, BUT BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU CAN ASK THE COMPUTER TO CLUSTER CELLS BASED ON THEIR PATTERN OF GENE EXPRESSION, AND THEN CODE THEM IN DIFFERENT COLORS DEPENDING UPON HOW SIMILAR THEY ARE. SO, THESE ARE NON-SENESCENT CELLS, AND THESE ARE SENESCENT CELLS. AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY ARE WELL SEPARATED. THAT'S WHAT YOU'D EXPECT. WE KNOW THAT THE CELLS HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION, SO WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE SEPARATED. SO, THIS IS AT LOW RESOLUTION. IF YOU NOW ASK THE COMPUTER TO DWELL INTO THOSE TRANSCRIPTOMES AT HIGHER RESOLUTION, AND ASK WHETHER THERE ARE SUBPOPULATIONS, YOU GET A PATTERN THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS. SO, THESE ARE DIFFERENT SUBPOPULATIONS, THESE ARE SENESCENT CELLS, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE SEGREGATING FROM EACH OTHER AND THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE VERY WELL SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS. SO WE'RE NOW TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE PATTERNS MEAN AND WE'RE HOPEFUL, AND THIS IS ONLY HOPE, NO DATA YET, MAYBE WE CAN SAY SOME SUBPROBLEM SUBPOPULATIONS PROMOTING WOUND REPAIR. THIS IS STILL A DREAM. WE'RE REALLY NOT THERE. SO, EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU SO FAR SUGGESTS THAT SENESCENT CELLS ARE SORT OF A SMOKING GUN. THEY ARE PRESENT AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT PLACE TO QUALIFY FOR BEING ONE OF THESE BASIC AGING PROCESSES THAT'S DRIVING THESE DIFFERENT DISEASES. ACTUALLY, I USED TO HAVE A SLIDE OF A SMOKING GUN, AND I'VE JUST DECIDED THIS IS THE WRONG TIME TO BE SHOWING SMOKING GUN. THIS IS A REAL WINERY THOUGH IN NAPA VALLEY, THOSE OF YOU -- I HAVEN'T TASTED THE WINE, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD BUT THERE'S A REAL WINERY WITH THIS NAME. THE TWO QUESTIONS NOW WE NEXT HAD TO TRY TO ADDRESS IS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THE CELLS COULD BE DRIVING DISPARATE DISEASES AND DO THEY ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU SO FAR IS CORRELATION. SO, LET ME START WITH HOW. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT OUR OVERARCHING HYPOTHESIS FOR THE MECHANISM BY WAY A SENESCENT CELL COULD BE DRIVING VERY DISPARATE PATHOLOGY. THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE SECRETOME. THEY TEND TO BIN INTO TWO GROUPS BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER DIFFERENT MOLECULAR CONTROL. WHAT BOTH GROUPS HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE INFLAMMATION. AND SO EVERY ONE OF THOSE DISEASES I SHOWED YOU ON MY FIRST SLIDE HAS EITHER AS A CAUSE OR AN EXACERBATOR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. AND SEVERAL YEARS AGO CLAUDIA FRANCESCO COINED THIS TERM, INFLMAGING, WHAT HAPPENS TO TISSUES WHEN THEY BECOME AGED. MOST PATHOLOGISTS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN FIND IN OLD TISSUES BUT NOT YOUNG TISSUE EVIDENCE OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AS JUDGED BY LOW LEVEL INFILTRATION OF IMMUNE CELLS. I PROBABLY ALSO SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT INFLAMMATION, CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, CAN DESTROY TISSUE BECAUSE OF THE BIOACTIVE MOLECULES THAT INNATE IMMUNE CELLS ARE MAKING BUT IT ALSO CAN DISRUPT NORMAL TISSUES FROM FUNCTIONING. IT CAN PREVENT STEM CELLS FROM FUNCTIONING. AND OF COURSE IT IS A MAJORING RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER. THAT'S THE BAD SIDE. BUT THE GOOD SIDE IS YOU ALSO DO NEED INFLAMMATION IN ORDER TO INITIATE WOUND HEALING, AND TISSUE REPAIR. SO AGAIN IT'S THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE GOOD AND THE OLD. SO I WILL SHOW YOU NOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE AND THEN SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING. SO THE FIRST ARM OF THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE IS THE SO-CALLED P53 DEPENDENT ARM. AND WHAT IS STRIKING ABOUT THIS ARM IS THAT IT IS TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF CHANGES IN TRANSCRIPTION. WE WOULD NEVER HAVE PICKED THIS UP WITH ANY OF OUR HIGH-THROUGHPUT TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSES. AND IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY ALBERT DEVALLOS STUDYING HMGB1, A PROTEIN THAT BINDS DNA SEQUENCE INDEPENDENTLY, BENDS DNA. IN A SEPARATE WORLD, IMMUNOLOGISTS HAD BEEN STUDYING HMGB1 BECAUSE MACROPHAGES SECRETE THIS PROTEIN, WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO INITIATE AN INFLAMMATORY EVENT. AND WHAT ALBERT FOUND IS EVERY SENESCENT CELL HE'S EXAMINED LOSES PROTEIN FROM THE NUCLEUS AND SECRETES IT OUTSIDE THE CELL. HMGB1 WAS THE FOUNDING MEMBER OF A FAMILY OF PROTEINS THAT WERE INITIALLY CALLED ALARMIN, BUT NOW ARE CALLED DAMAGE-ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR PATTERNS, OR DAMPs, THIS WAS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, THERE ARE NOW A NUMBER OF D DAMPs. THE PRIMARY FUNCTION TO ALERT THE TISSUE TO DANGER AND INITIATE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. THE SECOND ARM IS, AGAIN, DISCOVERED BY JEAN-PHILIPPE, ANTIBODY ARRAY. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT ARE FIVE DIFFERENT HUMAN FIBROBLASTS FROM DIFFERENT TISSUE, BREAST, LUNG AND SKIN, AND THEY ARE ALL MADE SENESCENT BY IONIZING RADIATION. WE GET THIS PATTERN, LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE SECRETED BY THE SENESCENT CELLS COMPARED TO NON-SENESCENT COUNTERPART, ALSO LOTS OF PLASTICITY, DEPENDS ON GENOTYPE, TISSUE OF ORIGIN AND ALSO AS WE FOUND OUT LATER TIMING AFTER INITIATION OF SENESCENCE. THIS PROCESS IS -- THIS PART IS MOSTLY DUE TO THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL UPREGULATION OF THE GENES THAT ENCODE THESE PROTEINS, AND IT'S COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF THE P53 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR. SO, THIS I THINK IS A GOOD CLUE AS TO HOW SENESCENT CELLS MIGHT DRIVE AGING BY VIRTUE OF THIS INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE. OF COURSE THE REAL QUESTION NOW IS DO THEY ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING. FIRST I'LL SHOW YOU THREE EXAMPLES IN CULTURE AND THEN I'LL SHOW YOU A MOUSE MODEL THAT GIVES CONFIDENCE THE ANSWER IS YES BECAUSE FRANCIS WOULD HAVE TOLD ME TO STAY IN BERKELEY IF THE ANSWER WAS NO, I THINK. OKAY. SO FIRST EXAMPLE, THIS IS A THREE DIMENSIONAL CULTURE OF MAMMARY EPITHELIAL CELLS FROM PREGNANT MOUSE, SINGLE CELLS UNDERGO LIMITED CELL DIVISION, FORM THESE BEAUTIFUL ALVEOLI, WE ADD HORMONES AND THE CELLS PRODUCE MILK. RED STAINING IS BETA CASSEIN. IF WE EMBED NON-SENESCENT STROMAL CELLS WE GET BEAUTIFUL ALVEOLI, BUT YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF WE EMBED SENESCENT STROMAL CELLS, THESE ALVEOLI ARE MISSHAPEN, NO PRODUCTION HAS FALLEN. SOMETHING THE CELLS ARE MAKING ARE DISRUPTING NORMAL TISSUE STRUCTURES AND FUNCTION. THIS WORK WAS DONE BY SIMONA PARALLELO, ABLE TO IDENTIFY MOLECULES THAT WERE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE, MOSTLY MATRIX METALOPROTEIN PROTEINASES. THESE ARE HUMAN NEURAL STEM CELLS OR MYOBLASTS, AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN IS TAKEN CONDITIONED MEDIUM FROM ASTROCYTES FOR NEURAL STEM CELLS OR FIBRO LIPOGENIC CELLS IN MUSCLE MYOBLASTS, AND KNOW ASK WHETHER THEY CAN DIFFERENTIATE. SO IN THE CASE OF THE MUSCLE WE GET LOTS OF DIFFERENTIATION, BUT IF THAT CONDITION MEDIUM IS SENESCENT, WE REALLY BLOCK A LARGE PART OF THEIR ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE. IN THE CASE OF THE NEURAL STEM CELLS, THIS IS CELL PROLIFERATION, SOMETHING THE CELLS ARE MAKING, THESE ARE SENESCENT ASTROCYTES THAT WE'VE COLLECTED THE CONDITION MEDIUM FROM, AND THERE'S SOMETHING THOSE ASTROCYTES ARE MAKING THAT SUPPRESSES THE ABILITY OF THOSE NEURAL STEM CELLS TO PROLIFERATE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE FACTORS ARE, WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT. AND THE LAST EXAMPLE I'LL SHOW YOU IS SOMETHING THAT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY ANNA CRATOLICA MANY YEARS AGO. WE DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS. THIS IS TUMOR VOLUME, OVER TIME, OF A PRE-MALIGNANT BREAST EPITHELIAL CELL LINE. WE INJECT IT INTO THE MAMMARY GLAND OF THE MOUSE, PRE-MALIGNANT, DON'T FORM TUMORS. IN THE PRESENCE OF SENESCENT MAMMARY FIBROBLASTS, THESE CELLS WILL CONVERT TO FULL BLOWN MALIGNANCY. IF WE -- THIS IS AN IMMUNE COMPETENT MOUSE. IF WE GO TO IMMUNE INCOMPETENT MOUSE AND INJECT HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS INTO THE MAMMARY GLAND, THIS IS WHAT THE TUMOR LOOKS LIKE AFTER SIX WEEKS. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF WE CO-INJECT WITH SENESCENT STROMAL CELLS. THESE CELLS ARE ALSO MUCH BETTER VASCULARIZED THAN THESE CELLS AND METASTASIZE BECAUSE SENESCENT CELLS MAKE A LOT OF VEGF. SO THE MODEL THEN IS WITH AGE WE'RE ACCUMULATING SENESCENT CELLS. AND WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THESE CELLS BY VIRTUE OF WHAT THEY SECRETE WILL AFFECT NEIGHBORING CELLS AND CAUSE THOSE CELLS TO FAIL TO FUNCTION. AND THAT WOULD DESCRIBE -- THAT WOULD EXPLAIN SOME OF THE DEGENERATIVE DISEASES OF AGING. WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS WE'RE ALL ACCUMULATING PRE-MALIGNANT MUTATIONS, SO WE WOULD ARGUE THEN THAT SENESCENT CELLS COULD ALSO, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SECRETIONS, FUEL THE CONVERSION OF PRE-MALIGNANT CELLS INTO TUMOR CELLS, AND THEREFORE EXPLAIN LATE LIFE CANCER, JUST TO REMIND YOU CANCER IS AS MUCH AN AGE-RELATED DISEASE AS MANY OF THE OTHER DEGENERATIVE DISEASES. SO, IF YOU DON'T HAVE SENESCENCE, YOU WILL DIE OF CANCER. IF YOU DO HAVE SENESCENCE, YOU'RE STILL GOING TO DIE OF CANCER. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS? SO WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF TWO STRATEGIES FOR HOW WE MIGHT INTERVENE IN THIS PROCESS AND IMPROVE AT LEAST HEALTH. THE FIRST WAS WHAT IF WE CAN JUST GET THE CELLS TO STOP SECRETING? AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WE'VE PRETTY MUCH ABANDONED THAT APPROACH AS AN APPROACH ALTHOUGH WE'RE STILL STUDYING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BASIC BIOLOGY. AND THE REASON IS WE DID WHAT EVERY GOOD CELLULAR MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST, DRILL DOWN, IDENTIFY PATHWAYS THAT DRIVE SECRETIONS, THE PATHWAYS WERE KNOWN, HAD TARGET GENES AND THEREFORE TARGET PROTEINS. WHAT WAS GREAT IS THERE WERE ALREADY DRUGS TO TARGET PLAYERS IN THE MAJOR PATHWAYS. THEIR ARE THE THREE PATHWAYS THAT DRIVE THE SECRETORY PHENOTYPE, THIS NF-kappaB P38 MAP KINASE PATHWAY, AND THE mTOR PATHWAYS IS IMPORTANT AS A LONGEVITY PATHWAY. THE PROBLEM IS WE CAN INHIBIT THESE PATHWAYS BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IN A HEALTHY ORGANISM BECAUSE ALL OF THESE PATHWAYS ARE IMPORTANT FOR MAINTAINING NORMAL TISSUE HOMEOSTASIS. THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS AS I SAID THERE ARE DRUGS, WE GOT THE DRUGS AND PUT THEM ON THE CELLS, CELL STOPS SECRETING IN IN VIVO AND IN CULTURE, TAKE AWAY THE DRUGS, THEY START SECRETING AGAIN. DRUG COMPANIES LOVE THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE DRUG ALL THE TIME BUT WE FELT THIS IS NOT A WAY TO APPROACH APPROACH AGING. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT SAFE DRUG, DIDN'T SEEM PRACTICAL TO USE DRUGS TO IMPROVE AGING PHENOTYPE. SO, YES, THAT'S THE OTHER PROBLEM. LET'S TRY TO OVERCOME THIS RESISTANCE TO APOPTOSIS AND GET THEM TO JUST GO AWAY, AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE THEM SLOWLY ACCUMULATE AND MAYBE HIT THEM INTERMITTENTLY AND LET THEM DIE. WE MADE A TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL THAT ENABLES US TO DO THIS. WHAT WE DID, SO THIS IS A TRANSGENE, NOT A KNOCK-IN, SO THE ANIMALS HAVE NORMAL COPIES OF EVERY GENE BUT THEY HAVE THIS TRANSGENE, IT'S A BACTERIAL ARTIFICIAL CHROMOSOME THAT CONTAINS THAT P16 INK FORAY LOCUS, DRIVING THE ARTIFICIAL PROTEIN, CONTAINING A LUCIFERASE, WE CAN IMAGE SENESCENT CELLS IN LIVING ANIMALS, IT CONTAINS RED FLUORESCENT PROTEIN SO WE CAN SORT CELLS FROM TISSUES. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT CONTAINS THE HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TO CONVERT THE DRUG INTO A PHOSPHORYLATED DERIVATIVE, A POTENT DNA TERMINATOR. SENESCENT CELLS REPLICATE MITOCHONDRIAL DNA, AND SHOWED THIS DERIVATIVE GETS INTO THE MITOCHONDRIA, FRAGMENTS MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME, CELLS DIE BY APOPTOSIS. MARK DID MOST OF THIS WORK, IN CHARACTERIZING THIS MOUSE MODEL. I'M GOING TO SHOW ONE EXPERIMENT. THIS IS WHOLE BODY LUMINESCENCE IN A MOUSE. SO AT 12 MONTHS OF AGE, THAT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 30 AND 40 YEARS IN HUMAN TERMS, THE SIGNAL IS VERY LOW. AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER WE GET THIS ESSENTIALLY EXPONENTIAL RISE IN LUMINESCENCE. AND WE CAN ELIMINATE ABOUT 80 -- 70 TO 80% OF THAT SIGNAL BY TREATING THE ANIMALS WITH GAM CYCLOVIR. VISCERAL FAT HAS A LOT OF SENESCENT CELLS. IF WE TREAT AGAIN, ABOUT 70 TO 80% CLEARANCE OF THE CELLS. SO, THERE ARE TWO MOUSE MODELS THAT CAN HAVE THIS CAPABILITY. ONE WAS MADE BY US, THE OTHER WAS MADE BY JIM KIRKLAND AND JAN VANDERSEN AT THE MAYO CLINTON. THE SAME PRINCIPLE, P16 DRIVING A KILLER GENE. BETWEEN OUR GROUPS WE'VE NOW SHARED OUR MICE WITH LITERALLY DOZENS OF LABS, EACH OF WHICH IS FOCUSED ON A DIFFERENT AGE-RELATED DISEASE, AND AT THIS POINT THIS SLIDE IS ALREADY OUT OF DATE. I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE REPORTS NOW SHOWING THAT AT LEAST IN A MOUSE SENESCENT CELLS CALLS ARE CAUSAL FOR AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGY, FROM ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKINSON'S'S TO OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOPOROSIS, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. I'LL SHOW YOU ALSO THAT, AGAIN, THE CELLS ARE IMPORTANT FOR WOUND HEALING. WE'VE USED THE MOUSE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT. BUT THIS IS, AGAIN, A WIDE RANGE OF AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES, AND IT REALLY THINK TELLS US THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT CELLULAR SENESCENCE IS A DRIVER, MAJOR DRIVER, OF BASIC AGING -- IT IS A BASIC AGING PROCESS THAT DRIVES A LARGE NUMBER OF AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES, AT LEAST IN A MOUSE. SO, I'LL SHOW YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DATA FROM OUR LAB. WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THE PREMATURE AGING THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED AND IS BEING REPORTED MORE AND MORE NOW AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GENOTOXIC CHEMOTHERAPIE, THIS IS ALSO TRUE ACTUALLY NOW FOR CERTAIN DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO TREAT HIV/AIDS. AND SO, WHAT WE DID WAS THIS AGAIN IS MARCO DEMARIAS WORK. GAVE OUR MICE GENOTOXIC CHEMOTHERAPIES AND CYTOTOXIC CHEMOTHERAPY, IMAGED. THERE'S BURST OF SENESCENT CELLS, DECLINES, NEVER GOES AWAY. THESE ANIMALS SEEM TO HAVE A LONG-TERM BURDEN OF SENESCENT CELLS IN THEIR BODY. NOW WE CAN ASK, WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING THAT BURDEN? THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH CANCER METASTASIS. SO WHAT MARCO DID WAS HE TOOK A BREAST CANCER CELL LINE, LABELED NOW WITH A DIFFERENT LUCIFERASE. WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE TUMOR IN VIVO. IF YOU INJECT INTO THE INGUINAL MAMMARY GLAND OF THE MOUSE THEY METASTASIZE TO LUNG AND LIVER. WE GIVE THE ANIMALS BREAST CANCER, THEN WE GIVE THEM CHEMOTHERAPY, IN THIS CASE AGAIN DOXORUBICIN, AND A FEW DAYS LATER EITHER CLEAR SENESCENT CELLS OR NOT AND ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TUMOR. SO HERE IS THE CONTROL ANIMAL. HERE IS THE PRIMARY TUMOR. HERE IS THE METASTASIS TO THE LIVER AND THE LUNGS. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CLEAR SENESCENT CELLS AFTER THE CHEMOTHERAPY. SO WE HAVE VARIABLE EFFECTS ON THE PRIMARY TUMOR. WE ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS. BUT IN ALL CASES, WE COMPLETELY PREVENTED THE ABILITY OF THOSE CELLS TO MA METASTASIZE, HYPOTHESIS IS CHANGING THE MILIEU OF DISTAL TISSUES AND THEREFORE MAKING THOSE TISSUES INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING METASTATIC GROWTH. BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE CHANGING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRIMARY TUMOR. WE STILL HAVEN'T SORTED THAT OUT. THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH CHEMOTHERAPY ESPECIALLY THE ANTHRACYCLINE DRUGS BIKE DOXORUBICIN IS CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION. WE CAN MEASURE BY ECHO. FRACTIONAL SHORTENING, IF AFTER THE CHEMOTHERAPY WE GIVE THEM GAMCYCLOVERE CAN PREVENT THE DECLINE. ANOTHER IS CLOTTING, WE CAN MEASURE IN A MOUSE, JUST NICK THE TAIL AND MEASURE THE TAIL BLEEDING TIME. AND THE HEMOGLOBIN IN THE PBS. SO DOXORUBICIN WILL SHORTEN THE BLEEDING TIME SO IT'S PRO CLOTTING, AND, AGAIN, WE CAN PRO HAVEN'T THAT - PREVENT THAT IF WE ELIMINATE SENESCENT CELLS. WE'RE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING ONCOLOGISTS MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE PRO AGING SIDE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC REGIMENS. I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW ONE OTHER EXAMPLE OF A VERY DIFFERENT DISEASE. WHICH IS PARKINSON'S DISEASE. THIS IS A COLLABORATION WITH JULIE ANDERSON, A NEUROBIOLOGIST AT THE BUCK INSTITUTE. JULIE WAS STUDYING AUTOPSY MATERIAL FROM HUMANS. SUBSTANTIALA NIGRA FROM PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. THE DISEASED TISSUES SEEM TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF A NUMBER OF SENESCENCE MARKERS. AND SO WE THOUGHT TO TEST THE IDEA THAT SENESCENCE MIGHT BE DRIVING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE. SO TURNS OUT YOU CAN DO THIS IN A MOUSE BY TREATING THE ANIMALS WITH PARAQUAT, AN HERBICIDE THAT CAUSES OXIDATIVE STRESS, BANNED IN CALIFORNIA BUT CASES PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS IN MICE AND HUMANS. WHEN WE ADD TO CELLS IN CULTURE OR ANIMALS, WE NOTICE INDUCE THE SENESCENCE OF ASTROCYTES IN THE BRAIN. NOW WHAT WE CAN DO IS GIVE THE ANIMALS PARAQUAT AND CLEAR SENESCENT CELLS OR NOT, AND ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO MOTOR NEURON FUNCTION. HERE IS AN ASSAY THAT THE MOUSE MUST DO IN ORDER TO REQUIRE SOME MOTOR NEURON COORDINATION, IN ORDER TO DO THIS REARING. AFTER PARAQUAT THEY CAN DO. IF WE CLEAR IT WE CAN PREVENT LOSS OF MOTOR NEURON FUNCTION. AGAIN, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE I THINK WE'RE GAINING CONFIDENCE THAT CELLULAR SENESCENCE MIGHT QUALIFY FOR BEING THE BASIC AGING PROCESS THAT CAN DRIVE VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGE-RELATED DISEASES. SO, THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT GETS BACK TO THE EVOLUTIONARY QUESTION. WHY ON EARTH DID THIS PHENOTYPE EVOLVE? IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, APOPTOSIS IS A REAL GOOD TUMOR SUPPRESSIVE MECHANISM BECAUSE CELLS DIE, CAN'T GO ON TO FORM A TUMOR SO WHY DID WE NEED THIS MESSY, MESSY PHENOTYPE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SECRETIONS THAT THESE CELLS ARE PRODUCING? AND THE ANSWER IS ESPECIALLY THOSE SECRETIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR WOUND HEALING. SO, THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF LUMINESCENCE AT THE SITE OF THE 6 MILLIMETER PUNCH BIOPSY ON THE DORSAL FLANK OF THE ANIMALS. YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A PEAK OF SENESCENCE AT ABOUT FIVE DAYS AFTER WE WOUND THE ANIMALS. THESE ARE FEMALE MICE. I'M GOING TO SHOW DATA IN MALE MICE. MALES AND FEMALES DON'T HEAL THEIR WOUNDS WITH THE SAME TRAJECTORY SO MALES ARE SLOWER THAN FEMALES. SO THIS IS FEMALE MICE. AND WE CAN PREVENT THIS PEAK OF SENESCENCE BY TREATING THE ANIMALS WITH GAMCYCLOVIR AND ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO WOUND HEALING. WOUND HEALING IS RETARDED. SO HERE ARE WILDTYPE ANIMALS. THEY ARE HEALING WOUNDS IN FIVE TO SIX DAYS. THEIR ARE SENESCENT-FREE WOUNDS, AND CLEARLY THEY ARE TAKING LONGER TO HEAL AND ALSO THESE WOUNDS ARE MORE FIBROTIC THAN THESE WOUNDS. SO NOW BECAUSE WE CAN SORT CELLS FROM OUR TRANSGENIC MICE, MARCO DEMARIA SORTED CELLS FROM THE WOUND AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SENESCENT CELLS WERE MAKING THAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT FOR WOUND HEALING, AND HE WAS FAIRLY LUCKY IN THAT HE IDENTIFIED A SINGLE GENE THAT WAS TURNED ON WHICH CODES FOR A RELATIVELY UNDERSTUDIED ISOFORM OF PDGF, PDGF-A. THESE ARE MALE MICE HEALING WOUNDS. HERE ARE SENESCENT-FREE WOUNDS, SLOWER. TOPICALLY APPLIES PDGF-A AND CAN REVERSE THE PHENOTYPE. I SHOWED YOU SENESCENT CELLS ACCUMULATE WITH AGE IN HUMAN SKINS. WOUND HEALING DOESN'T GET BETTER WITH AGE. SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE WHAT I'VE JUST SHOWN YOU WITH WHAT WE KNOW HAPPENS IN THE CLINIC? WE COLLABORATED WITH SIMON MELOFF AT THE BUCK INSTITUTE. HE HAD A TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL IN WHICH HE COULD CONDITIONALLY REMOVE THE CIPRO OXIDE GENE, IT'S UNDER SKIN SPECIFIC PROMOTER THAT'S ACTIVATED BY TAMOXIFEN. SO WHEN WE EXCISE SOD2 FROM THIS MOUSE, IN THE SKIN, WE GET SENESCENT CELLS IN THE SKIN, BUT THESE CELLS NOW ARE CHRONICALLY PRESENT. NOW WE CAN ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO WOUND HEALING. TURNS OUT WOUND HEALING IS, AGAIN, RETARDED. HERE ARE THE ANIMALS WITH CHRONIC SENESCESSENT CELLS VERSUS THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THE PRESENCE OF THAT SENESCENT CELLS. THE IDEA THEN IS THAT WHAT EVOLUTION SELECTED FOR WAS THE TRANSIENT PRESENCE OF THESE CELLS, AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH AGE IS THEY BECOME CHRONICALLY PRESENT. AND THAT IS WHAT CAN BE DRIVING THE PATHOLOGIES THAT WE SEE. SO I WANT TO END WITH A QUESTION. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE TRANSGENIC PEOPLE, AT LEAST NOT SOON. ARE THERE DRUGS THAT CAN DO WHAT OUR TRANSGENE CAN DO THAT HOLD HOPE FOR PEOPLE? AND THE ANSWER IS THERE ARE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LABS, A NUMBER OF COMPANIES NOW, THAT HAVE IDENTIFIED A CLASS OF DRUGS, THEY ARE CALLED SENYLITIC DRUGS AND TARGET PROTEINS THAT ALLOW SENESCENT CELLS TO BECOME SOMEWHAT RESISTANT TO APOPTOSIS AND FORCE THEM TO DIE. THE FIRST JUST COMPLETED PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIALS, SO I THINK THIS IS REASON FOR SOME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THE QUESTION IS, WILL THEY ACTUALLY IMPACT OUR LIFESPAN? THEY CERTAINLY HAVE GOOD PROMISE FOR IMPACTING OUR HEALTH SPAN BUT WHAT ABOUT LIFESPAN? SO, THAT EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE MOUSE, THIS IS FROM THE PUBLICATION. THESE ARE HIS TRANSGENIC MICE. THESE HAVE SENESCENT CELLS. THESE HAVE NO SENESCENT CELLS. HE ELIMINATED SENESCENT CELLS REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN OF THESE MICE. HE GOT A VERY IMPRESSIVE INCREASE IN MEDIAN LIFESPAN, SO THE ANIMALS DIED HEALTHIER. BUT THERE WAS NO EFFECT ON MAXIMUM LIFESPAN. SO EVERYONE ASKED WHAT DO THE ANIMALS DIE OF? A RANGE OF PATHOLOGIES, IT'S NOT ONE THING THAT'S KILLING THESE ANIMALS. SO I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PROMISE OF HEALTH SPAN AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON LIFESPAN, WHICH I THINK IS MUCH, MUCH LESS. THINK ABOUT C. ELEGANS, SIMPLE ORGANISM, WORLD RECORD FOR EXTENDING LIFESPAN IS TEN-FOLD. MOVE UP THE EVOLUTIONARY SCALE A LITTLE BIT, TO DROSOPHILA. AND THERE LESS THAN TWO-FOLD INCREASE IN LIFESPAN. AND MANIPULATION, WHETHER GENETIC OR PHARMACOLOGICAL. THEN YOU MOVE TO THE MOUSE, I EVEN DOUBT THIS 40% BUT CERTAINLY BETWEEN 10 AND 30%. 20% INCREASE, A PAPER IN "NATURE," "CELL" AND "SCIENCE" ALL AT ONCE. I THINK EVOLUTION IS TELLING US SOMETHING WILL SPECIES SPECIFIC MAXIMUM LIFESPAN IS SET, PROBABLY SET BY MODIFYING MULTIPLE GENES. WE MAY NOT SOON HAVE A DRUG THAT CAN TARGET ALL OF THOSE GENES. SO I'LL END WITH THIS IDEA. HERE IS THE WOMAN THAT WAS PRESUMABLY THE OLDEST DOCUMENTED HUMAN THAT WALKED THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THIS IS HER ON HER 121st BIRTHDAY. I DON'T THINK MANY OF YOU WOULD WANT TO AGE THE WAY SHE AGED. SHE HAD CATARACTS, SARCOPENIA, OSTEOPOROSIS. I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS TO EMULATE THIS GUY. DOES ANYBODY RECOGNIZE HIM? IT'S THURGOOD MARSHALL, YEAH, FIRST BLACK SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES, LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. SOMEBODY HAD THE NERVE TO ASK HIM HOW LONG HE PLANS TO LIVE. THIS WAS IN THE 1960s. THIS IS HIS REPLY. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. [LAUGHTER] SO I WILL STOP HERE AND THANK THE MANY PEOPLE IN THE LAB, PAST LAB MEMBERS, AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF COLLABORATORS WITHOUT WHOM NONE OF THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE. [APPLAUSE] TERRIFIC. JUDY, PLEASE, WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS, AND USE THE MICROPHONES IN THE AISLES AS USUAL SO PEOPLE LISTENING BY VIDEO CAN HEAR. WE CAN START RIGHT OVER HERE.  YEAH, A LONG TIME AGO IN PATHOLOGY WE USED TO LOOK AT LIPO FUNCTION, IN THE HEART, SAY THIS IS WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL. THEY WOULD SEE IT IN THE BRAIN, THE FIBERS, ALL OVER THE PLACE, IF YOU CAN ELIMINATE THIS YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM OF SENESCENCE AND AGING AND IT WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED A SPACE-OCCUPATION LESION.  WHY AREN'T YOU SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DISSOLVE IT AND PROBLEM SOLVED?  BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT. YOU CAN REGULATE LYSOSOMAL BEHAVIOR. THAT WILL MAKE THE CELLS LOOK BETTER, BUT IT WON'T STOP THEM FROM SECRETING.  SINCE NOBODY -- OH, THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE. I'LL SAY THANK YOU.  TOWARDS THE END OF THE TRANSIENT WOUND HEALING PROCESS YOU SHOWED, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SENESCENT CELLS YOU RECRUITED, DO THEY DIE OR BECOME NON-SENESCENT?  A GREAT QUESTION, TWO PARTS. ONE PART IS IN THE SKIN WHAT HAPPENS IS PART -- SOME OF THE CELLS GET TRAPPED IN THE SCAB, WE CAN SEE THE SCAB IS LUMINESCENT, MECHANICAL, BUT SCOTT LOWE HAS LOOKED AT LIVER INJURY, WHERE THERE'S NO SCAB. HE'S BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT NATURAL KILLER CELLS WILL IDENTIFY AT LEAST A SUBFRACTION OF SENESCENT CELLS AND WILL ACTIVELY KILL THEM BECAUSE SENESCENT CELLS TEND TO EXPRESS LIGANDS FOR ACTIVATING RECEPTORS ON NATURAL KILLER CELLS. THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE MECHANISM. THE QUESTION THEN IS WHY DO THEY ACCUMULATE WITH AGE? WE DON'T LOSE NATURAL KILLER CELLS WITH AGE. AND SO THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION IN THE FIELD. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT.  A RELATED QUESTION, JUDY, WHAT ABOUT EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT, CLEARLY THE PROCESS MUST BE IMPORTANT FOR MODELING TISSUE, WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE AS SENESCENT CELLS, DO THEY GET WIPED OUT AND HOW?  THEY GET WIPED OUT BUT THE MECHANISM IS NOT KNOWN. THEY ARE TRANSIENTLY PRESENT IN THE EMBRYO, AT SOME POINT YOU DON'T SEE THEM ANYMORE.  YES, PLEASE. SO, THERE'S HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN THE SECRETORY PROFILES, ARE THERE KNOWN LIKE SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PROFILES FOR PRO DAMAGE SENESCENT CELLS AND PRO, YOU KNOW, CELLS INVOLVED IN TISSUE REPAIR?  YES, IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW YET. WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THOSE ANALYSES NOW, TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S A PROFILE THAT SAYS I'M PRO REGENERATION, AND I'M PRO-INFLAMMATORY, OR PATHOLOGICAL INFLAMMATORY. WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS YET.  ANOTHER QUESTION.  IT SEEMS INTRIGUING CELLS WOULD SUDDENLY BEGIN TO OVEREXPRESS 400+ PROTEINS THAT ALL GET SECRETED. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT BRINGS THESE TOGETHER? IS THERE SOME MECHANISM THAT'S BRINGING TOGETHER THE FACT THEY ARE JUST BEING SECRETED OR ARE CELLS ALSO EXPRESSING THINGS THAT GET MISFOLDED, ACCUMULATED IN THE CELLS, OTHER THAN SECRETION?  AUTOPHAGY IS UPGRADED PROBABLY BECAUSE OF PROTEIN AGGREGATION. INHIBITING IS NOT A GOOD CLINICAL STRATEGY. THIS IS HIGHLY BALANCED PROCESS. BUT, YEAH, THEY ARE UNDER E.R. STRESS AND GOLGI STRESS BECAUSE THEY ARE SECRETING SO MUCH AND THEY HAVE TO UPREGULATE AUTOPHAGY TO HANDLE THAT. AND THEY DO. YO SAY SENESCENT CELLS ARE DOMINANT DRIVER OF AGING RATHER THAN TELOMERES?  SO TELOMERES -- SHORT TELOMERES DRIVE CELLS INTO SENESCENCE. THE MORE ACCURATE WAY WHEN A TELOMERE FAILS IT'S A FORM OF DNA DAMAGE, THAT DRIVES CELLS INTO SENESCENCE. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION WE THINK IT'S THE DOMINANT OR ONLY FORM OF AGING. YOU CAN LIVE NATURE IN THE LIFE OF A MOUSE, THEY DON'T LIVE LONGER. THEY JUST DIE HEALTHIER. SO THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER PROCESSES THAT COLLABORATE WITH ACCUMULATION OF THESE CELLS.  JUDY, IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION. WE WILL HAVE A RECEPTION IN THE LIBRARY FOR PEOPLE WHO WISH TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALL DIE HEALTHIER. SO PLEASE JOIN ME AGAIN IN THANKING OUR SPEAKER.  THANK YOU.
