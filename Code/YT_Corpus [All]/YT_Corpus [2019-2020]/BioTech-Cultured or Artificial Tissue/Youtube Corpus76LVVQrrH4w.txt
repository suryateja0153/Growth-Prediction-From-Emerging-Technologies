 [Music] space tangos not your first foray into completely impossible to succeed biotech ventures we had some mutual friends in a company in San Diego that was going to revolutionize the artificial skin industry back in the nineteen some things will say so let's start talking about advanced tissue sciences and the way things look several decades ago in this in this field and the successes we here we all had then and mistakes we all made how does how did what were you thinking in so long ago and trying to do what 80s was trying to do so I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to share some of the experiences from the early days as well as what we're doing now and I guess you could say I must like big challenges right because certainly the in my career I've had the opportunity to do some things that people definitely think we're not going to be able to do and I think that's part of how maybe I have the wherewithal to take on the new challenges that were working on in space right now but from a tissue engineering perspective sure when we started to think about creating a new market for tissue engineered skin it was an emerging market really didn't have anything that existed that looked like it even how to take it through the FDA how to think about scaling it up what the commercialization process looked like pricing back in those days in the early 90s how did you do quality control enough on a piece of skin how big were the pieces so four by six inches but we would grow the equivalent of a football fields worth of skin at the in our manufacturing facility so our Lots and our batch size was quite large and it was never the blockbuster what went wrong yes so we know a lot went right but what went wrong sure well you know I think that there was a lot of excite about the opportunity to end the organ shortage and one of the things that I talk about often is we're still at that 20 some years later right and it I think signals how hard what we're doing really is I mean even for advanced tissue Sciences it didn't hit the mark necessarily for from an analyst perspective in terms of revenues that were generated but did you realize you could charge two million dollars for a seventeen therapy background oh and so now that I know that we can do that if we could rethink that model but that I think speaks to what's changed right in the industry and one of the things I think that's really amazing is I remember the days when we would talk about the fact that we could never use a patient's own cells because it just wasn't economically feasible from an FDA still some people they think that from from an FDA perspective it was very challenging in terms of your manufacturing facilities so the FDA has evolved I've watched Carty therapy is the first time I heard about Carty therapies I just I had to sit down because I thought what's happened in the industry how can that be and what I now realized is that if you can provide benefit that is life-saving if you can cure diseases people will really work to whatever the constraints are from a manufacturing or pricing perspective to be able to bring those to patients and I think that's an important thing not to lose sight of when we're talking about how expensive these therapies are and how difficult they are to manufacture what we did at Advance tissue Sciences I think laid the foundation for people to start thinking about regenerative medicine we may not have ended the organ shortage but we certainly opened up a field for regenerative medicine and I think we're watching some of those successes come forward now if you listen to Bruce Levine's presentation on on cars you know apart from a very large number of awful puns on the word car his presentation really reminds us that once upon a time cars were handmade and extremely expensive and really not available to as much of the population as might benefit from them which of course sounds very familiar when you're talking about car T cell therapies so you're moving on to your current venture which is you know doing stuff in space you know III have a long background in trying to solve cell culture problems and I I don't recall at any point when discussing cell culture problems anyone said to me you know if only we could do this in space it would be so much easier so what are you thinking isn't it hard enough on earth I mean there are plenty but you could do it in the desert you could do it at the bottom of the ocean there are plenty of difficult places to do cell culture so doesn't everyone want to be an astronaut secretly and go to space I mean I think it's so seriously you know in my career obviously I've had some opportunities to do some things that are a little unique and innovation is a word that everybody uses quite a bit in the industry and I think I got a little tired of hearing innovation innovation innovation and I heard about someone doing research in microgravity and I thought well that's fascinating you know that's a variable that you actually really can't take out here on the ground and so when I learned a little bit more about research in microgravity one of the things that really struck me is it is a completely new lens for science and so when you start thinking about how you look at biological systems and what happens in microgravity changes that you see in how cells signal or aggregate or changes in gene expression to me it became a way to really help the field of regenerative medicine and cell based therapies to think about advancing because it's a completely different approach so you might be able to find a pathway or understand a pathway that you can't necessarily on the ground find an answer to or new therapeutic options or manufacturing opportunities up sides for things like stem cells that grow faster in microgravity but are a little bit in their differentiation so to me I think space although it sounds a little bit it's probably as crazy as people thinking that Carty therapy could actually be successful and get people to invest in it do you do you look at it from just a manufacturing perspective or do you seek to understand how humans might benefit or suffer from being in space for extended periods which I think you know even the even the most pessimistic futurist would have to admit that that is somewhere some people are going to spend much more time in the future than in the past absolutely well it for us we really are focused on benefit to life on Earth so we want to help to advance cures therapies product processing for patients here on earth but certainly what we're learning really does help NASA in terms of long-duration exploration goals we have a tissue chip program that we do with the nih that in fact I was you know mentioning earlier it's fascinating because we use that to look at human models for disease and certainly how we can use those for things like drug challenge or understanding biology of a disease but from a NASA perspective at some point you probably see astronauts cells being used to generate those human analogs whether they're chips or organoids and flying alongside of astronauts that you can actually collect cellular data at the same time that you're collecting blood and other samples and heart rates that you can look at the whole astronaut as well as what's happening at the cellular level and it is microgravity being in microgravity it's kind of an accelerated aging effect that you see depression of the immune system bone loss muscle wasting you know all kinds of phenomena that the stress of being in a microgravity environment produces which can help us to study things like diseases of aging but also helps us to find those pathways to help develop countermeasures for astronauts as well so you know the Apollo program waters pens that can write upside down though unintended benefits some more real than others do you think you're going to do you think your first big success will be deliberate or accidental well that's a very good question aren't all the greatest discoveries accidental I mean most of what we know I think it's gonna be a combination to be quite honest with you I think we know enough about terrestrial understanding of stem cell biology and as we start to understand what happens in a microgravity environment I think we're gonna have a moment where we might see something in a way that we've never seen it before there's you commonly hear astronauts talk about sort of the overview effect you know when they look down from space and they see the planet and how that's just this amazing moment for them and I tend to think of research in microgravity as being sort of the microgravity effect when we have that moment where all of a sudden everything that we know about stem cells on the ground maybe makes sense because of what we just learned in microgravity what do you think the first success will be you know for us so let's just say space is an added challenge so we talked a lot about the challenges that happen in the regenerative medicine field but spaces that sort of you know has its own complexity you have to launch on a rocket you have to an astronaut who has to help you get your research into a facility on station that you control from the ground you have to come back down again in a rocket and you certainly you know have to work right now within the constraints of the NASA process because we basically by our payloads and the commercial resupply missions so every time that supplies are sent up for astronauts our research can actually be sent up as well and our pilot scale manufacturing for us as we think about what the space economy looks like mostly every one of you benefit from the space economy right now I know you probably don't realize that but every time that you use your cell phone or you go on the Internet I mean most of the space economy is satellites so it's but what if you is from 250 miles up is the vantage point so you're just looking down you're not actually really using microgravity when you think about the effect on cells that's the microgravity effect and so we really right now rely on things like what happens with physical science in microgravity as well so our first probably entrance into the manufacturing of products we work with a group right now that is making a retinal implant and it's protein polymer based so it's not cell based because I think we have to start we not only have to help the FDA to understand that we want to manufacture off the planet but I think we need to step wise I know what it's like to take things through the FDA that are a little novel and so help them in that process of thinking about how we might actually create GMP manufacturing facilities that might necessarily not be here on the ground but 250 miles overhead so a retinal implant project that we're working on relies on in microgravity you can do very uniform layer layer deposition so if you have something that is a product that helps to correct vision you want it to be as uniform as possible so we're looking at it from a stepwise approach but we'd like to move towards stem cell production I've seen production monoclonal vaccines you know a variety of different biomedical products and what's the timeline here realistically yep so you know we'd like to think about using that same failure is not an option so we work on a very aggressive mentality and as a company space tango is you know committed to by mid 2020 having our own orbital platform where we'll be able to do some of this manufacturing that's an aggressive goal but this year well mid 2020s twenties mid twenty two of the decades so but it's sort of like NASA's goals they're big right as well NASA we're going to land people on probably the moon 20:24 that's an aggressive goal and they think if we set those kinds of goals then it pushes us that harder to meet them good well please come back here before the mid-2020s with your first commercial success thank you very much [Applause] [Music]
