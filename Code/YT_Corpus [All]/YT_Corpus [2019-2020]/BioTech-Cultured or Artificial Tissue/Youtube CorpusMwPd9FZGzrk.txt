 agricultural science as a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of Agriculture veterinary science but not animal science is often excluded from the definition topic agriculture agricultural science and agronomy you the three terms are often confused however they cover different concepts agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use agriculture concerns techniques including the application of agronomic research agronomy is research and development related to studying and improving plant-based crops agricultural sciences include research and development on plant breeding and genetics Plant Pathology horticulture soil science entomology production techniques eg irrigation management recommended nitrogen inputs improving agricultural productivity in terms of quantity and quality eg selection of drought resistant crops and animals development of new pesticides yield sensing technologies simulation models of crop growth in vitro cell culture techniques minimizing the effects of pests weeds insects pathogens nematodes on crop or animal production systems transformation of primary products into end consumer products eg production preservation and packaging of dairy products prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects eg soil degradation waste management bio remediation theoretical production ecology relating to crop production modelling traditional agricultural systems sometimes termed subsistence agriculture which feed most of the poorest people in the world these systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of industrial agriculture which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems food production and demand on a global basis with special attention paid to the major producers such as China India Brazil the u.s. and the EU various Sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment eg soil science agro climatology biology of agricultural crops and animals eg crop science animal science and their included Sciences eg ruminant nutrition farm animal welfare such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering topic agricultural biotechnology agricultural biotechnology as a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques including genetic engineering molecular markers molecular diagnostics vaccines and tissue culture to modify living organisms plants animals and microorganisms topic fertilizer one of the most common yield reducers as because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue which can take a few months to several years to decompose depending on the crop c2n ratio and the local environment topic history you in the 18th century johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulfate as a fertilizer in 1843 John Laws and Joseph Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term field experiments at Rothamsted research station in England some of them are still running in the United States a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887 which used the term agricultural science the Hatch Act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer the Smith Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built after 1906 public expenditures on agricultural research in the u.s. exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years topic prominent agricultural scientists Bakewell Norman Borlaug Luther Burbank George Washington Carver Carl Henry clerk George C clerk Rene Dumont Sir Albert Howard
