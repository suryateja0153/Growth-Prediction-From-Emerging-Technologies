 Kirika a call Kawai mappy here to our co humble to waka kopaka ha - IRRI nova Rana Norton amok wa ikutsu pune no woman ouattara uh her Korriban smith's drew a curve pita a guard or kumatora colliculus a guard Takuya nor era tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa welcome everyone and thank you for coming here today again my name is Nick a guards I'm the principal advisor for ethics at the Ministry of Health I've been at the Ministry for over seven years now I do all the things that Rob explained providing advice to various groups the one thing that I do a little bit differently also is work for the global ethics unit of the World Health Organisation so so doing a little bit of international work as well for the last two years I've been working primarily with the National ethics Advisory Committee on two projects one was the development of these national itical standards and the other was New Zealand hosted the asia-pacific regional meeting of national very ethics committees so we got a chance to discuss these standards with about 38 other countries from the western Pacific region and we're also going to be presenting these standards which we consider a world first in terms of our partnership with principal in Portugal in a couple of weeks so looking forward to that as well my background is in bioethics and philosophy so every master's and bioethics and I currently doing academic work and the ethical challenges faced by learning healthcare systems so some of the things in this niak document or of great interest to me particularly looking at data use integrated research or embedding research into routine care and particularly looking at ways that we can modify inform consent so be excited to hear your views around that today so I'm gonna start off with explaining what ethics is and in particular the foundations for ethics of which there are many I'm going to explain why research ethics matters particularly in news and then I'm going to introduce the partnership of principals I will explain some of the highlights of the niak standards where possible and show some of the new concepts and new standards that we have here now in New Zealand I'll also be doing a bit of looking forward the changing research ethics landscapes ethics and research is constantly evolving and so we're trying to keep head of this and communicate some of the changes that you might start to see over the next five years somewhat due to the health research strategy and somewhat due to international and national developments so we're here today on behalf of the national effects advisory committee for those who do not know niak was established in 2001 and they are an independent advisor to the Minister of Health and they have a number of statutory functions one of which is to advise the minister on any ethical issue for any health and disability matter so they are at bioethics committee generally but they're also tasked with determining nationally consistent ethical standards across a health sector it's important to note that this isn't just for research and that's been evidenced in our national ethical standards that also cover quality improvement and we are picking up some of the work and clinical ethics as well and developing our capacity there as we have some potentially significant moral considerations coming through the use of euthanasia build so you know it's a really broad focus that niak has fortunately we are staffed with some amazing people today we have Mary Ann wood North here Gordon Jackman Carvey McClintock so it's fantastic to have a few members here in the room this project spend you could say it started in 2015 so we've got prior members of Aniak who have come and gone since this has been published in particular you know I want to acknowledge all the people that were involved in creating this document so first and foremost the members of the net ethics Advisory Committee again developing this document we had a number of ways of working one of which was to establish a Ministry of Health working group with the terms of reference who were tasked with effectively belting out a bunch of the content over the course of a couple of months so we have a number of working group members here today as well I want to acknowledge their work and in particular the work of Barry Smith so Barry Smith was on our working group and he passed away before the document was published we've got an example of some of Barry's work bit later today but his contribution was invaluable to their development the staff the ministry of health ethics secretariat the HQ SC health safety Quality Commission invaluable to learn about the effects of quality improvement a little bit of a different ethics framework there but as we'll see a bit later today really important to consider the ethics of those activities as well as health research proper we had over 165 submitters during our public consultation and we worked with other researchers and government agencies as well okay so foundation of ethics so ethics also known as moral philosophy seeks to address philosophical questions about morality when most people think of ethics or morals they might think of rules for distinguishing between right and wrong for example the Golden Rule do unto others as you would have do unto you or you might think of a code of professional conduct like the Hippocratic oath first of all do no harm or a religious creed like the Ten Commandments thou shalt not kill ethical norms such as you should not kill are so ubiquitous or obvious that we might be tempted to regard them as simple common sense on the other hand if morality were nothing other than common sense why are there so many ethical disputes in our society well one plausible explanation for these disagreements is that all people recognize some common ethical norms but they interpret apply and balance them in different ways in light of their own values life and culture for example two people could agree that murder is wrong but disagree about the morality of abortion because they have different understandings of what it is to be a human being so ethics is about identifying ways using frameworks of which there are many to understand moral problems or disagreements bioethics is a subset of ethics and it's about looking at the ethical issues that emerge from advances in biology medicine and technology and in particular the issues that arise from the relationships among life sciences biotechnology medicine politics law philosophy and theology finally Health Research ethics is a subset of bioethics and it's about navigating the ethical tensions that are inherent within all cases of health research with human beings so where did research ethics come from well in the West it was born from tragedy research with human beings has improved healthcare steadily since the first clinical trials were conducted in the early 1930s our standards of care have developed and being better understood through research and enable to our many to live healthy lives however the history of medical research is mired by exploitative and dubious human experimentation and in the wake of each disaster have come new and improved rules protections or expectations for conducting research with human beings so this is an image of 16 doctors and administrators who have found guilty of willing participation and the systematic torture mutilate mutilation and killing of prisoners in experiments during the war atrocities were conducted on thousands of prisoners in the name of scientific knowledge and in particular disabled people were targeted and Exploited another feature that we've addressed in these New York standards the trials highlighted highly unethical medical research conducted by Nazi doctors on the many captors in the concentration camps in World War two and following the war in 1947 at the Nuremberg the Nuremberg code for ethical research involving human subjects was developed marking the first international code of research ethics but having a document published or rules or standards being out doesn't automatically result in an ethical research even with the Nuremberg code established as an international document following 1947 large-scale unethical research in this case with US government support and funding was conducted so this example here in 1932 the Public Health Service working with the Tuskegee Institute began a study to record the natural history of syphilis in the hopes of justifying treatment programs for African Americans and was called the Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the Negro male the study initially involved 600 African American men 399 with syphilis 201 who did not researchers told them in that they were being treated for bad blood this was a local term used to describe several elements including syphilis anaemia and fatigue and in truth they did not receive proper treatment needed to cure their illness and in fact during the study penicillin was developed as a cure but not given to participants in exchange at all and now it's in exchange for taking part in the study the men did receive a few things they had free medical exams they had free meals and they received burial insurance there was no evidence that employment consent had been given to the participants given by the participants they were not given adequate treatment for their disease and now of the nine 399 participants with syphilis 28 men died of syphilis 100 died of related complications 40 wives were infected and 19 of the children were born with congenital syphilis the study ended in 1972 40 years after it began initially it was meant to run for a couple months it only ended after an Associated Press story about the Tuskegee study caused public outcry that led to the in assistant secretary for health and scientific affairs to appoint an ad hoc advisory panel to review the study the result of this in the u.s. they created the National Research Act which then established the National Committee Commission for the protection of human subjects of biomedical and behavioral research and developed the Belmont report which is the leading u.s. research ethics report of the time the Belmont report also put substantial work into developing some of the Western bio ethical principles that we do have adopted here in New Zealand so this this even flow of tragedy in the Western particular and then development of stronger protections and guidelines has continued over time and we have a number of international codified universal principle documents so a few examples are up here on the screen but they all have something in common they purport that the universal principles in these documents should guide practice in order to conduct ethical research so to protect research participants while also generating goods such as generalizable health information these principles are adapted to form a range of internationally recognized codes the Nuremberg code the Belmont report the Declaration of Helsinki and in New Zealand we also dropped some of these universal principles that feature in our codes such as the code of health and disability rights a consumer rights and the health information privacy code the most recent document that we looked at closely during the development of Nia document is the C ons international ethical guidelines now cos mission is to advance public health through guidance on health research including ethics medical product development and safety now this document also brand itself as universal and you know it's fair to say that these guidelines present a gold standard if you look in the first front pages the number of acknowledged ones they have numerous and many you know they had top people internationally developing this document however when developing it they don't have to adhere to culture local laws or local values so it is useful for a starting point and I'd say our national Ithaca standards are you know very much in line with international thinking however we only use them as a reference point this is because ethics in New Zealand has another history the finding morality through tikona the primary indigenous reference for Maori values and ethics are the creation stories which highlights specific relationships that are deemed fundamental to the sustainability of life these relationships are embedded as cour or primary values and provide the framework and foundation for the establishment of teka teka are locally specific practices that aim to enhance these relationships and ensure the preservation of mana justice and equity reflected through power and authority as the environment changes or new situations arise Tekoa are enacted or adapted to provide context specific responses so color and Tacoma provide the primary interface for accessing repositories of cultural knowledge and experience that can be used to inform ethical deliberations tikanga also provide a framework through which Maori can actively engage with ethical issues and can affect consider the effect of the research that it may have on their values or their relationships we also have the Treaty of Waitangi which we'll hear about in more depth later today but this is something unique and of pivotal importance when considering our national it achill documents the treaty partnership provides the opportunity to design together an advanced national health and disability research ethics platform that actually encompasses the two world ethical views there of Western ethics in there dr. calimari or Maori ethics these stances extend the work of previous committees and that they now incorporate tikanga Maori and they make more logical links between maori research theory and practice and in doing so they're consistent with the strategic priorities of the New Zealand Health Research strategy which again as founded on the treaty so when I'm talking about universal ethics here one of the issues around having a universal approach to ethical principles as it doesn't take into account the extent to which cultural traditions influence and enhance ethical study and practice for example the creation stories which is a primary reference for Maori ethics these stories often highlight the nature of relationships how the world is perceived in the way in which people interact with each other and these interactions further inform Takano Maori and the components of Tekoa such as their value of taboo and nowa in the relationships to Foucault popper and wairua which in turn provide a framework through which Maori can actively engage with itical issues determine the rights and wrongs and analyze the harms and benefits in this focus on harms and benefits and relationships there's something that is just being picked up in some of the development of the Western bioethics so our national ethical document is enriched with a range of world views that are complementary to each other in the past some have also expressed concerns that if New Zealand adopts the universal ethics approach then specific cultural issues in the existence of a Maori research ethics that ethic may be overlooked as the outline historically ethics has often been constructed through Western frameworks there may not necessarily be transferable to other contexts and times furthermore Western ethical research has tended to focus on legal requirements in these institutional codes of ethics which often focus on ensuring benefits in fairness to individuals rather than looking at collective rights or communities so researchers have designed documents in the past such as information sheets for prospective participants long privacy statements and consent forms very much a focus on the individual and that's carried over some somewhat from the clinical trials environment the infrastructure that supports that but we're really wanting to bring these other ethical viewpoints to the way that we conduct research here in New Zealand doing novel things like this is something that we're really good at and just to recognize here the long history of Maori research ethics and its development this is just a snapshot the original timeline was about seven pages long about indigenous populations both internationally and locally have long traditions of conducting their own research and experiments and developing their own ethical guidelines now the historical and research on these communities is often conducted by Western researchers using Western research ethics who have a poor understanding of indigenous ethical principles so it it enhances the feeling of disempowerment and exploitation of which is a huge threat to health research one of the best most significant resources their health research has is trust and we can see that Trust isn't the same across the world for some research populations here in New Zealand so social changes over the past 30 years have both increased the awareness of the value that research contributes to health outcomes but also health equity and a reconstruction of what is considered ethical practice particularly with regards to research with Maori communities and the mud and the Maori research community have worked to develop more respectful research relationships and become agents of research that is grounded in Maori concepts so you can see this across the board in terms of development of all of these Maori considerations of things like biobanking use of data into a data care which I'll get to in a moment but the key thing that this national itical document highlights is that we've brought all of this work that's been you know separate for such a long time into one document so we've addressed the criticisms that we've seen that have been lever at the ethics review system and the policy environment for the past 30 years we've brought together t-ara tucker and western bioethics and we've also brought in frameworks from these other documents into our national document so they're all in one place and they apply to everyone so why does research ethics matter in new zealand in particular well I've given you an understanding of why we have different sources of the ethical principles that I'll be explaining in a little while now I'm just going to explain why we need the ethics committees and some degree of ethical oversight of research in New Zealand so there are unfortunately a number of examples of cases of unethical research in New Zealand and I'm just going to look at two of these cases so firstly we are looking at the unfortunate experiment in the Cartwright inquiry so this is often referred to as New Zealand's testy Tuskeegee moment that we had in June 1987 when Metro magazine published the investigative report an unfortunate experiment at National Woman's according to the report woman with cervical cancer in situ had been deceived and mistreated for years at a prestigious Auckland Hospital the revelation leads to an official government inquiry six months of public hearings and most importantly far-reaching reforms that have effectively prevented any such abuses particularly this kind but I think that might not necessarily be correct the inquiry also exposed other unethical practices that it picked up along the way cervical smears being taken from newborn baby girls without their parents consent and expose the hospital's practice of teaching vagina examinations and IUD insertion zon unconsenting woman who had been anesthetized for other operations during the inquiry district district court judge Sylvia Carter I concluded that green's work had varied considerably from what was considered good practice and put his own patients at risk the insurance ooing report the report of the cervical cancer inquiry 1988 contributed to sweeping changes in law and practice around the health and disability consumer rights base so we see the office of the health and disability commissioner established in 1994 we have the code of disability rights come into force in 1996 teaching practice was changed and this was the first that we had independent health ethics committees established in New Zealand so that's the first time that we see ethics committees come into force and in particular there are not institutional ethics committees that are part of the hospital or the university now at the time I believe there are over twenty four of these committees that are now down to four I don't want to get any less than four during the SOT review so we also have the national survival screening program being established so this is a another example of systematic error the government ordered another inquiry into the cervical screening in the Guzman region after it was initiated after it was discovered that a local laboratory had failed to identify hundreds of abnormal spheres as smears the inquiry examined the practices of pathologists dr. Michael Bottrell who owned a laboratory and was responsible for reading the smears his laboratory found at 0.53 high-grade abnormalities compared with the national average of 1% once doctor Bertrille retired in 1996 the rate of high-grade abnormalities jumped to 1.7 one so two hundred twenty two thousand nine hundred and seventy eight sites belonging to twelve thousand one hundred and eight woman who had the smears taken in the region between 1991 and 1996 were re-read nine thousand five hundred and eighty four woman had all of their smears originally reported in reread as normal however a large number of woman 1997 were advised of abnormalities many of which were previously unreported there was a persistent effort again of one woman that finally brought the issue and has been to light between 1990 and 1994 four of her own tests were missing to misreported the first of the three should have been reported as revealing high-grade script that weird lesions the fourth is invasive cancer so finally she was diagnosed with cervical cancer by a gynecologist and head of red radical hysterectomy an extensive radiation therapy by the time she had her treatment her prognosis was a 40% chance that the cancer recurred or metastasizing whereas had she been treated with the high-grade by abnormalities when they were first detected her chance of a cure would have been virtually 100% so the Guzman inquiry delivered 46 recommendations to ensure the safety and quality of the National cervical screening program there was conclusions that there was ample evidence that dr. Bhatt rose underreporting with a wide discrepancy between the results of the Giz burn lab and the australian lab used for the reread 16 woman developed cancer because of the underreporting so this case both shaped the need to report incidental findings but more importantly it highlights the need for an ethics of quality improvement as outlined in the National Ethics advisory committee standards so these cases highlight some of the rationale as to why we made some of the decisions around this national document so now I'm going to go through a little bit of what's actually in the document so they are our national ethical standards health and disability research and quality improvement so the reason we updated the document the first was that they were incredibly outdated this 2012 document was in fact a minor update of a 2009 document resulting from the substantial changes in 2012 we also had two separate documents one for observational research and one for intervention studies this dichotomy is quite a false dichotomy the information on issues that were relevant to both intervention studies or clinical trials and observational research were different in each document just in general having two doc it was was unhelpful the structure of these documents they were very high level so the amount of guidance was limited allowing more points of disagreement between researchers and ethics committee members they were also in print so this is a substantial change for our current niak standards in much of the guidance and particularly in the 2012 document with for intervention studies all of the guidance was put into appendices at the back of the document with no standards on those on those various forms of guidance meaning that they were not actually part of the standards and that's where a lot of the core information was so a lot of good reasons to change I've been talking a lot about tragedy and this this kind of ebb and flow now the key thing to recognize for our current review as well as these national ethical standards are that they're not a reaction to tragedy they were very considered we had a very considered approach similar to what we'll be doing with regards to our operational review we're looking at what works what didn't we've got the right people involved to create this document they're responding as Rob refer to as an increasingly complex ethical landscape they reflect effects that represent New Zealand values in New Zealand culture they're also a strategic document and this is something I'm going to talk about a little bit later as well but looking at what the role of ethics committees are and what the role of bioethics committees are when it comes to strategic aspects such as equity in health so equity issues underpin this document and we'll go through that a little bit later now it's a living document it's online only and it can be updated incredibly easily we're also converting it into a html5 website so it'll be easily accessible online any minor changes particularly of the spelling mistakes that we've been dearly informed of after publishing now we can make those without consulate Asian obviously but the process by which we'll be updating these standards will be twofold one will be windy eight determines that there needs to be a new module so one example that might you know be there in the future is looking at emergency research ethics so you know research ethics and perhaps post disaster so we've already identified a number of areas that we want to consider adding really easy to do that as well as consulting on any further changes so you won't get any surprises coming through but it is very much a living document and the feedback loops that we're referring to here it's something that's been developed over the last five years or so particularly with just being more engaged with researchers and but what we want is you know recognizing that researchers and ethics committees are effectively at the coalface of ethical issues as well as how these standards are actually working on the ground so us as the ethics Secretariat want to work with researchers ethics committee is to get the right feedback and then send they're up to these national bioethics committees so particularly for building the relationship between the health Research Council ethics committee and the niak committee so we've had a lot of positive meetings in that regard as well so I'd say it's all coming together and you know if there is anything that is clearly not working with these standards you know it's something that we can address without waiting five years so addressing the tension the niak standards fulfill a range of functions they give research and ethics committees the language to engage in ethical discussion they provide tools to know when there might be ethical issues that are raised in research they provide guidance on how to mitigate and manage those ethical issues and I have printed it out once and it has more or less a doorstop in my bedroom so it is a long document but necessarily so so the standards what they really do is they enable systematic analysis and resolution of conflicts through an evidence-based application of tiata and bioethical principles one of the things that we're acknowledging is that all health research and quality improvement and disability research will have ethical conflicts or tensions that require ethical consideration the ethical significance of key issues can be understood analyzed and we can find solutions by using these standards so one of the things that we're going to do today is we're introducing this framework for analyzing the ethics of a research study this is something that the ethics committees have had introduced as well and particularly the reason why is that the standards can't cover everything now you'd think with their size that they might but they don't so what you do what you need is the ability to understand how to analyze a particular ethical tension in a study using these high-level ethical principles of tiara ticker and bioethics the standards will be supplementary and they are quite exhaustive so you might not have to do too much of your own ethical thinking of this nature but it shows that these principles in a principles approach based terrific's there's something that you can do in order to make your ethical arguments and these ethics committee meetings so we're going to do that a little bit later now I'm looking at highlights and the impact so this is to generate discussion on some of the new concepts and guidance we're going to break this into two parts well do as much as I can before I hand over to Joel who will be doing some of the case studies that we've developed to show how the standards might work in practice so you know what we hear is we want from researchers that they want to know the impact on researchers how much has changed what our standards and where their standards before the highlights of the changes and some of the themes of the changing ethics landscape so it is a little bit like comparing apples with oranges this is for a number of reasons we had the two sets of documents with a different structure and layout we brought all of that together into one document we looked at all of the frameworks that were across published Maori effects and brought that in as well so some key decisions the standards have a strong indicator function so the consequence is that they're quite long the standards apply to all health and disability research so these are the national standards whether you have to come to an ethics committee or not these are the standards that will be used if you're under investigation through the code of rights these are the standards for New Zealand now they also cover quality improvement innovative practice and health systems research this is a substantial change it's something that's going to take a little bit of time to embed but we're happy to work with quality improvement practitioners as these standards become to be embedded into the health system as I stated that the standards apply whether or not you have ethics committee review ethics is actually about conduct of investigators the ethics oversight from ethics committees should only be for particular cases so we encourage all health practitioners and researchers to read these standards one of the key things that I think is really important with both my niak head on and my Ministry of Health head on is having a proportional approach to tackle oversight so here there are a few examples of where these standards have a risk-based approach to our ethical oversight using the data example we have a set of assessment questions that we'll go into a little bit later today to figure out how risky proposed reuse of health data is and depending on how risky both ethical risk and actual risk of harm how risky that reuses if it's substantially riskier we might require consultation with a community around that reuse if the degree if it is complex or perhaps the data is of a sensitive nature will require stronger data government governance requirements than another use and where I think this is really going to take shape over the next year is the complexity of informed consent processes so we're going to be looking at developing modifications simplifications to the informed consent process when it is reasonable due to the circumstances of the research and the risk of the research and the research population so I want to get flexible with informed consent that achill review should also be proportionate to the risk involved of the activities so through this standard operating operating procedures review we're going to be introducing some different effects review pathways to recognize that research is really broad you know the expertise that you need for particular kinds of research is different across the board but some of these activities should have an expedited review pathway fully online now we do have that to some extent at the moment but they effectively use the same form so you know we're going to be addressing a lot of those issues in terms of the procedural aspects but these niak the niak framework gives us the ability to do that it also introduces a new level of risk that's lower than minimal risk so that again recognizes that a lot of these activities say in quality improvement they are very low risk but they are not without risk so that's a new I guess a new conceptual consideration and online-only so they're going to become a website we recall another substantial change is the structure of the document so initially when we went out for consultation we had all of the standards underneath one place and then all of the commentary and another commentary does not exist at all in the 2012 versions of the documents now this example that I've up here in particular as very smith's example the reason why we put together standards and commentary as these documents sometimes they are aspirational or sometimes they introduce new concepts and we don't expect you to know what these concepts are off the bat so for example standard three point three under the chapter of research in maori research design must demonstrate cultural rigor in order to meet ethical requirements so this concept of cultural rigor Barry was talking about how we obviously would never conduct a study that wasn't scientifically rigorous that didn't have merit that would be unethical so by introducing this term which again is uniquely New Zealand of cultural rigor it puts cultural considerations on equal footing as the science and design of studies which i think is really important in New Zealand so here the commentary underneath the standard three point three a B and C it explains what we mean by this and how as researchers you can consider the standard among your own research so for example cultural rigour can considers among other things the application of cultural concepts norms practices and language in the research process that actively protect Maori individual and collective rights cultural rigour can be ascertained by conversations with Maori especially experienced Maori health researchers who understand the purpose of rigor and research contexts now proportional again you might not want to go and bother experienced Maori health research for every single study a lot of what we've talked about in terms of the last Road choses getting the engagement right for the right studies and understanding what that looks like when we realize again the important and scarce resource of Maori and health systems always being asked to provide informal reviews you know so we want to manage that tension of increased engagement without overburdening so if you are not in your study potentially going to go and talk to an experienced Maori health researcher you can actually ask your questions of yourself so here we might ask what might this research offer to Maori communities what questions should the research try an answer to improve the well-being of Maori communities and what methods are best to use to conduct research with Maori communities now we're also recognizing the role of identity in the role of someone's our own values and experience that they bring to the table and acknowledging that that actually matters in terms of the shape of research and in terms of the research outcomes so if a researchers of non Maori descent the researcher must answer these questions am i the right person to be doing this study and why and what ways does my cultural position help will hinder the study and do I have any conflicts of interest that may impact my objectivity so this is this is you know an example of a new standard where we want people to ask themselves the right questions you know we want to see that thinking start to happen and that's right at the start of studies as well now another key change increasingly health research and quality improvement it involves responsibilities that are broader that extends to institutions and organisations so the standards do use the term researchers or researcher throughout when referring to corresponding responsibilities but the standards actually used the term researcher very broadly so in particular the standards address all those responsible for the conduct of health and disability research and quality improvement activities some of the examples of where this is apparent as data and tissue governance so often the researcher is part of a community or an institution of which they have their own rules for data governance data management we see areas in the standards that are not necessarily researcher driven for example custodians in bio banks custodians and data registries so so a much broader understanding of the obligations now even in some aspects of these standards we provide specific guidance for institutions as opposed to a researcher so that's again in the data governance chapter we'll go into that a little bit later all right what is new so I've done my best to just think about you know what are some of the new aspects of these standards now the best way to show you what's new is these entire chapters are all brand new so the partnership of principles that I'm going to go into detail shortly disability research we've got Gordon presenting on this and this was a huge learning curve for myself and we had a fantastic process that actually I believe is being written up in a paper on the way we engage with community on developing this chapter research benefits and harms this is a key chapter primarily for researchers to have the language to communicate with ethics committees so to understand what makes your research something that should be done and how you've managed or mitigated all of the harms and your research ethical management of vulnerability this is something we'll talk about a bit later today as well but we've moved away from the conception that groups are vulnerable instead we look at the sources of vulnerability what makes someone vulnerable and it's a much more nuanced understanding of vulnerability everyone can be vulnerable vulnerability can be wavering so it can come and go so I think it's a it's a much fairer understanding of vulnerability in health research human tissue and biobanks if you control f-find tissue in the 2012 documents there are zero returns kind of amazing there is guidance at the time from the Health Research Council but this reflected that fragmented ethical guidance situation that we had in New Zealand so so these chapters are brand new they are up to speed they have been developed in partnership with Maori researchers in particular Maui Hudson who put so much effort into his work with too much era and in also - at Attica so you know having the New Zealand view and values come through with regards to use of tissue in health research and storing their tissue health data this is probably one of the biggest new revelations in terms of effects getting a bit of a resurgence both nationally and internationally one of the difficult things with developing national ethnical standards as you obviously always publish them or develop them at a certain time where ethics is developing and evolving and we're seeing data and data ethics be a kind of a resurgence of if it's internationally driven by concepts such as machine learning AI so we had to we had to effectively provide the first national ethical guidance again internationally on new technologies and artificial intelligence we'll talk a little bit a little bit about that later as well stem cells and reprogram cells again some particular areas through our public consultation came through as needing our particular ethical guidance so we address that again with the working groups who understood the technical aspects of this research and you know paired them with the right people who could then consider the ethics of some of these new technologies and of course quality improvement so that's a brand new chapter of the standards guidance concepts or theme so people you know when the standards went live I was asked how you know whether I think a lot of studies would have these new nearly our new youth achill problems that they'd have to deal with and I don't see the niak standards as as creating any new controversial standards in the health research ethics landscape what it did was it made it clear what people were either already doing or developed further the existing ethical guidance some of the other changes are not so much this is a new standard but it's about a new approach to health research ethics and some of these new concepts or themes so first off a very practical example we did put a lot of new guidance on determining whether an activity is research or not this is something that's always faced by our ethics Secretariat likely by research officers as well but it is a really important distinction in terms of say access to health data for an audit versus research so we try to provide clarity to the sector on you know how to get that determination right now an example of the change in concepts or emphasis is consulting and engaging earlier with communities and this general push to having consultation happen earlier on rather than at the end where you say seeking locality review or after ethics committee approval so we realized that this has practical implications so we're working with the locality review officers and we'll be doing work to try and facilitate some of the the processes behind some of these aspirational ethical standards you know this this is the direction that we want to be hidden might not always be possible off the get-go but that's the that's the direction of travel and we're talking about that a little bit later as well equity lens to health research so similar as kin engaging in consulting earlier I'm going to go through a few documents that have equity as their core strategic focus and we're starting to think what the role of ethics committees is with regards to the review of Health Research modifications to informed consent so we have provided a lot more different kinds of informed consent some of which is not really used in New Zealand at all so this is a real opportunity to develop some new templates frameworks and start to popularize a come level with consent that might look a little bit different and this applies both to supported decision-making as well as simplified consent we're looking at health data governance and management or we'll go into this a little bit later but one of the big challenges in developing this document is that we lost two of our biggest protection measures with use of data we're if not already very close to being in the age where identifiability there's not a protection everything can be reoriented now that's a huge blow to ethics which often relied on de-identifying data to make it more reasonable to send data far and wide so we're losing a protection there and the other thing we're losing is the the meaningfulness of informed consent for use of data the reuse is on a scale that repaired renders a lot of those and phone consensus more similar to a future unspecified research consent or a blanket consent which aren't very meaningful so we've had to shift how to respect people in say the absence of informed consent for use of data well in the absence of having that data be de-identified and therefore of lower ethical risk and to address that we've moved towards data governance and management looking at access issues looking at why certain reuses are happening and looking at the relationships between the researchers the data itself in the community from which it comes so this approach again with tiada ticker which focuses a lot more on relationships a twister of then Western bioethics hugely important when looking at data ethics we'll get into that a little bit later on we have strengthened the waiver to use data in tissue without consent I'll go into that a little bit later health systems research ethics this is this is a fairly substantial addition to this document will explain what health research health systems research ethics says but it also generates a number of ethical tensions particularly when it comes to informed consent cluster randomized trial designs so niak has been working really closely with health research council ethics committee and the health and disability Commission on some of these ethical legal tensions so we get to that as well well comparative effectiveness research so this is in relation to the increased embedding of research into routine clinical care this is a shift in the kind of historical distinction from research and treatment being always separate we're going to see a muddying of the waters in it I think an increase in the world of gray in terms of Health Research you know happening more and more in these clinical contexts lastly supported decision-making we've provided a lot more guidance in the document on what this looks like this is highly relevant for increased engagement with disability research but also looking at our aging population dementia research so having safe ways of respecting people and having them be included in research and not just always jumping to a waiver or excluding them lastly this is going to come pretty much after we finish the roadshow going to be working straight on some of these new templates for informed consent templates on what data governance frameworks will look like providing guidance as much as possible once we start to see how these standards are working in practice the new application forms yeah where they'll be developed that you know will reduce so much duplication you know we'll be working with the Health Research Council and seeing you know whether there is alignment that we can have across these different systems and following each one of these roadshow days we're meeting with the institutional ethics committees and seeing what alignment we can have with them as well so we are always trying to make these things easier for you and more consistent guidance so because these standards are very much highly detailed in terms of the commentary we do expect that once they have embedded over the next six to 12 months that the guidance that you'll be receiving you know across the country will be more consistent particularly when aligned with some of these operational change okay so just gonna quickly have a look at the agenda since we've changed the timing I'm just gonna continue on a little bit and then we'll have some general Q&A okay so taking into account that historical separation of Maori and Western bioethics our national standards set out two sets of principles that collectively form our national vertical standards this is something unique to New Zealand I've never seen anything in an international document that has indigenous bioethics and wizard bioethics side by side tiara ticker is the set of maori ethical principles that draws on the foundation of takuna so Maori protocols and practices the tiada ticker means to follow the right path so in this document it's used as a generic set of principles commonly shared by many generations and communities of maori however they have application to all people in our tiara New Zealand the bio ethical principles that appear here have been used in many many sets of human research ethical guidelines so you'll see these in most documents internationally they have carefully established and developed implications as they have been widely used but they also have their limitations so what I'm going to do now this is the first time that we've done this um let's go through each of these principles and what they mean when we consulted we rather when we're doing our consultation meetings you know we basically said we were doing this because we felt like that was very important but today I'm going to explain how these actually work so we've done this by turning the definitions into questions that you might ask of your own research in order to meet these ethical principles in order to navigate some of those ethical tension so tikka refers to what is right and what is good for any particular situation tikka highlights the value of engagement of asking communities about what research questions are important to them although the quality of the information produced by research depends critically on the scientific value of a study the scientific value alone does not make a study socially valuable for example a study could be rigorously designed but lacks social value were neither the research question has actually already been successfully addressed and either prior research or through the community or alternatively if the study question is not appropriate for the community it may be well designed but not ethical to conduct because it won't generate any social value so that's one of the things that you can take away from ticka you know have communities been involved you know where did you find this study question and again not to have researchers discharge their obligations but if you talk to communities about what the ethical issues are in that study they can do a bit of that work for you as they often know same thing with designing patient documentation participant documentation engage with communities and we'll get into that a little bit as well beneficence so beneficence is about individuals and communities and it implies improving or benefiting people's health or broader well-being it's both the basic aim and fundamental justification of good research health research should be designed conducted and reported with the intention to improve outcomes and beneficence requires that those projects do have scientific merit the value to the answer of a scientific question posed by a study must be worth the risk inconvenience and resources that are contribute to answering it in order to be ethically permissible health and disability research with humans including research with human tissue or data must have social value and the scientific and social value can be difficult to quantify but generally it's grounded in three factors the first factor is the quality of the information that's likely to be produced by the study the second is its relevance to significant health problems and the third is its contribution to the creation or evaluation of interventions policies practices that promote that individual or public health the idea of what counts as a benefit is also something that may differ between individuals and communities so researchers should take different views into account either through the informed consent process or engagement with communities to understand what a benefit is now this is relevant for the benefits and harms chapter which gives researchers tables of different benefits in who they crewed to in terms of conducting health research so recognizing that absolutely participants can benefit but researchers will always benefit institutions benefit understanding that there's a wide range of benefits and people who would benefit but also real risks of harm now so you can see the questions here as well and asking days of your own study will help you which meet the principle of beneficence monarch Turner so this refers to caring for others nurturing relationships and being careful in the way that we treat each other out of our respect love generosity sharing and hosting are essential parts of monarch Otunga and up--it and allows us to uphold the mana of all parties so you know you don't really see love and wisdom bioethics but I think it's a really key factor particularly also the concept of hosting so again bringing in the institutions and the fact that you know these studies in the relationships between researchers and participants don't occur in isolation they're all actually connected to the wider research infrastructure as well as the the kind of research endeavor and I'll go into that a little bit later as well so again looking at the relationships and the study respect privacy and confidentiality and looking at research partnerships so again this is something that is relevant in inners throughout this document looking at research not as a one-off but the opportunity to develop long term research relationships and we that's through registries or research partnerships so looking at all of the other possibilities that are within each research project non-maleficence so non-maleficence requires researchers to avoid causing harm to individuals or communities or at least to cause the least amount of harm possible at a community level potential harms may place an iniquitous on a community without providing them a compensating benefit so researchers must put appropriate places to minimize risks of harm and effectively respond to any harm to individuals or communities one change in the document is you're going to likely be asked for management plans not for just full you know follow on clinical trials with new medicines but also for you know your social research having a plan in place for incidental findings that are not necessary clinical but maybe emotional thinking about mental health so I guess the focus on being prepared for some of the potential risks of harm in your research that's going to be a new focus so we have less ad hoc management of harms that occur in research the potential individual benefits and risks of research must be evaluated and it's often done in a two-step process so first the potential individual benefits and risks of harm for each individual research intervention or procedure must be evaluated so looking at every single thing that is done to someone or with someone in a research project is that necessary to answer the research question and are the risks of harm that it takes to get that information worth their corresponding information so doing that for every aspect of a study the second step is the aggregate risks and the potential individual benefits of the entire study now then has to be assessed and considered appropriate now this is a difficult thing this is what if it's committees have to do all the time is they have to look at the actual risks of harm to real people that are in their research project and consider whether those risks are cept able for potential future people and the study may not produce those benefits so it is that you know it's a inhairent risk of research and it's why we constantly have to minimize the risks as much as possible so those those risks need to be considered appropriate in light of the potential benefits to participants as well as the scientific and social value of the research for future people so it's real risks of harm for something that we hope to produce for future people it is it is quite a big ask Papa so this also refers to relationships however the term encompasses the quality of those relationships the reasons for their formation and the structures or processes that have been established to support them the relationship between researchers and participants and New Zealand communities must involve trust respects and integrity you know as referred to earlier that that relationship between researchers and clinicians and communities is one of the most valuable resources in terms of having high levels of recruitment and having people be confident in the research sector part of my PhD that I was working on looks at these relationships potentially changing as research becomes more and more involved at DHBs and I think that we're going to see the shift of people's expectations around what a health system does in terms of research and treatment shifting papa also reminds us that an individual is always part of afonya or wider collective and this then looks at new concepts under informed consent such as collective decision-making a collective information sharing collective participation in either the consent processes or just general collective support for the research data collection as well as looking at the in results of research so data analysis in dissemination of results researchers ultimately need to assess an individual's own preferences in terms of their collective support networks Mahna Mahna refers to power prestige leadership or authority neither bestowed gained or inherited individually and collectively in an infers that each individual has a right to determine their own destiny under their own authority so mana is an influencing factor and leadership into personal and into group relationships including those entailed in research the shared knowledge upholds the manner of research participants mana also has ties into equity and distributive justice in terms of potential actual risks benefits and outcomes and it also looks at those power and authority relationships between participants and researchers and we go into this and the sources of vulnerability and understanding unequal power relationships lastly it's the principle of mana requires that research processes uphold aspects of tea kura maori and looking at local procedures so again understanding local factors respect for people to this underlies the general human rights principled approach similar to autonomy but it's also significant in cases where autonomy isn't entirely prison so for example in particular a person's capacity to exercise informed consent if that is reduced to some extent autonomy being a broad concept typically in the West was thought of individual autonomy but something that we want to recognize here is also relational autonomy so understanding autonomy that is actually shared across a number of people so this recognizes that a person's autonomy can change and it can change over time and it can change depending on the nature and context that they find themselves and so diminished capacity also may be permanent or temporary and we acknowledged us and the standards and we've widened the group of people that we consider able to make informed decisions that would actually represent and form consent but it may not look like a traditional and front consent so we've recognized that and we've recognized the ability to for people to have adequate support and again developing new zealand's research capacity on supported decision-making is another focus that's going to come down the line justice last one justice requires that people are treated fairly and equitably so this is both looking at fairly distributing the benefits and burdens of a study both on individuals as well as populations the studies should be designed to obtain knowledge that benefits the class of persons of which are the participants or they represent the class of persons bearing the burden should receive an appropriate benefit in the class primarily intended to benefit that should be a fair proportion of risks and burdens for the study you know again if you look at the history of research much of it in terms of being exploitive was doing it on one population and the results going to another you see this as a huge issue in global research we're researching in lower-income countries from you know sponsored and well developed countries and their knowledge just going straight over so you know it's something that we have to think about here in New Zealand as well at justice and it kind of linked quite well into this that justice does involve reducing inequities in health outcome so looking at research questions and processes that are relevant for New Zealand and looking at how every case of research could that reduce inequities in health and well-being between populations on the flip side researchers should also consider whether their research may increase iniquities and if so how they're going to medicate their potential effect you know you could have very really well-designed well funded research one particular area but the health outcomes for that population are already better so by improving it further you are in fact increasing inequity so some things to think about so what will end up you know fingers crossed and this is what we see at the ethics committees in terms of the process is on one hand we have our values that we bring as individuals and communities and we cannot we cannot disregard those values we bring them to the table and any ethical deliberation we also have consensus decision-making so particularly at the committee level this is how it makes us put all our values on the table be transparent about it and and discuss what we're about to see here so the facts of the case using those ethical principles that we've gone through supplemented by the ethical guidance and analysis which is in the niak document and hopefully resulting at ethical decisions now across the top there this is perhaps a new aspect to ethical thinking which is the equity focus driven by the health research strategy and driven by now the niak standards so looking forward adding a equity lens to health research ethics so equity equity is found in both of the ethical principles that we have tiada tikar and Western bioethics and it aligns and as closely related to human rights principles particularly the right to health and the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and it's been a key focus in a number of strategic documents coming out on the health sector and it's driven as I say primarily by the health research strategy in terms of its impact on us at the national with its committee level so what is equity so it's the absence of avoidable unfair or remediable differences among groups of people whether those groups are defined socially economically demographically geographically or by any other means of stratification so here in New Zealand obviously we also look at different ethnic populations in those health disparities which ever present and we may hear about later today so we're saying that equity should be a priority focus for all health research activities so how does that look so two areas of importance in terms of inequity not just between Maori and non-maori but we're also looking at people with disabilities having inequitable health outcomes we also have our chapter on Pacific peoples again that's brand-new and they also experienced health inequities so we have some strategic priorities that we want to focus on but this is a shift in terms of the ethics committees role and it's something I don't think we've fully figured out yet so for example in 1993 you know it was recognized that the next big challenge is to recognize ethnic inequalities and the need to actively eliminate them but if an ethical dilemma is that if every ethics committee doesn't ask how will this maintain or reduce inequalities if not why not our ethical practice as part of the ongoing maintenance of the acceptability of inequalities in this circumstance so I think that we're going to be having more of a discussion at the ethics committee interface on whether the researchers have thought this through how that comes out as perhaps questions again for general considerations around inequity and is it a priority area to who and why and are there key relationships that have been engaged when and what happened will it achieve equity how are you going to measure this for Maori looking at indigenous rights being met teeth kanga being incorporated and who's overseeing this and potential for indigenous innovation so workforce development for Maori looking at incorporating language you know down in Christchurch speaker kind of brought to the focus the the number of things that you can do to increase Maori research capacity and both small and substantial and realizing that particularly as much of the small stuff as well and incorporating it into the full design of health research so that's one of the things that we might be seeing another new trend is really recognizing the increased role of consumer and patient engagement in developing research so this is one of the trends coming out of the Australian clinical trials Alliance so they're a body that's working with the Health Research Council in the Ministry of Health and Mb on the health research strategy they have a number of streams of work one of which has increased consumer and patient engagement and it's about the changing relationship with the public so this isn't just about researchers being more involved with consumers you know it applies to bioethics committees and the ministry as well so looking at some of the ways perhaps our bioethics committees can be more involved with consumers in research you know we did have the number of consumers that our public consultation but you know not not perhaps as many as we could in the future and there are different levels of involvement and increased involvement is really well understood for example in disability research so there are there are pockets of gold standard you know throughout New Zealand and some of these areas and I think that that's what we need to tap into in order to bring up bring-bring through some of these these I guess ways of working in health research they're already happening in a lot of areas but you can have individuals that have personal experience and motivations or we can have expert consumers different consumers have different roles and but there are a lot of valuable consequences of engagement with consumers early on and one of the big things which is why we included health systems research into our niak standards that New Zealand is really good at during health research but we're not very good at implementing research so consumer engagement at the beginning of studies have shown that dissemination and up is higher overall so again how can they be involved sitting research priorities planning and design of research the conduct of research particularly I think one of the things you can do off the bat as having better patient or participant related documentation surveys questionnaires evaluating the research results figuring out how to get the impact of all of this research that we're doing you know actually changing practice in New Zealand so that's a huge focus for the health research strategy and new funding ground rounds have gone out on looking at you know building that capacity for New Zealand to do better implementation research dissemination of research findings and not simply recruiting patients as you know participants of clinical trials but building those networks so again networks are something that we're likely to see more and more of in New Zealand just an example of this you know coming through so this was published around the same time as the niak standards it's the Health Research prioritization framework and it's looking at a lot of the things that I've been talking about is it just having a look at it it is that changing nature of health research it's becoming strategic research for research sake isn't going to cut it you know we're going to have to actually look at achieving some of these outcomes that we've been trying to do for such a long time but to be honest they're not necessarily getting anywhere quickly so I think that you know this strategic approach is something to really be aware of when designing your research you know and and just start to think about building some of those relationships there was a 15-year retrospective look at nature looking at ethics in health research I was called the long and bumpy road from shirked to shared they say that ethics used to be from all too scarce to professionalized the ethics of researchers now everybody's business so the pursuit of a more ethical science or health research it's become more associated by building trust creating transparent process is inclusive participation and an openness to uncertainty as opposed to distinguishing between ears an auteur overly academic justifications so the implication of this new model is that most ethical science is the most sociable one and thus scientific excellence depends on greater inclusivity and that's the direction that we are seeing in both was always present in Seattle ticker and indigenous documents recognizing those relationships and I think with genetics is just catching up with some of those key considerations so his bioethics evolves as does any other branch of knowledge and we will continue to build trust we'll build our relationships with you and we'll restrict them you know the health research landscape in New Zealand making it a lot clearer as it's been fragmented for a very long time so I'm just going to close off this section today we will revisit the highlights in some of those concepts that I talked about earlier but to summarize ethics that's about navigating tensions and conflicts between principles and values ethics in the research environment is always changing ethics committees and researchers have to work together to confirm that each case of health with disability research determines that it's a good thing to do both for the individuals and for future people and then it's being done in the best way possible the knee extenders in conjunction with the upcoming operational changes will support ethical decision making that will support consistency and research excellence overall so today we're going to highlight a few further aspects of the standards Joel's going to introduce this framework for analyzing some of those ethical issues you know do get involved in and if you want to but really what we're doing is sharing perspectives values and finding common ground so we consulted on this statement here Walker akin or a canoe which we are all in with no exception and there truly is how niak and how the ministry feels about ethics you know it's everyone's business it's not just about the ethics committees themselves it's about the practice in the way that you form those relationships with your research participants so I will be quiet for the time being thank you very much and I'll hand over to the job [Applause]
