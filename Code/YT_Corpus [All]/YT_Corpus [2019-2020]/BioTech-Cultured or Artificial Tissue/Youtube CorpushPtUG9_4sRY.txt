 protein production is the biotechnological process of generating a specific protein it is typically achieved by the manipulation of gene expression in an organism such that it expresses large amounts of a recombinant gene this includes the transcription of the recombinant DNA to messenger RNA mRNA the translation of mRNA into polypeptide chains which ultimately folded into functional proteins and may be targeted to specific sub cellular or extracellular locations protein production systems in lab jargon also referred to as expression systems are used in the life sciences biotechnology and medicine molecular biology research uses numerous proteins and enzymes many of which are from expression systems particularly DNA polymerase for PCR reverse transcriptase for RNA analysis restriction endonucleases for cloning and to make proteins that are screened in drug discovery as biological targets or as potential drugs themselves there are also significant applications for expression systems in industrial fermentation notably the production of biopharmaceuticals such as human insulin to treat diabetes and to manufacture enzymes topic protein production systems commonly used protein production systems include those derived from bacteria yeast baculovirus insect mammalian cells and more recently filamentous fungus such as my Celia for a thermophilic when biopharmaceuticals are produced with one of these systems process related impurities termed host cell proteins also arrive in the final product in trace amounts topic cell-based systems the oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell based and may be defined as the combination of an expression vector it's cloned DNA and the host for the vector that provides a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell that is produce proteins at a high level over expression is an abnormally and excessively high level of gene expression which produces a pronounced gene related phenotype there are many ways to introduce foreign DNA to a cell for expression and many different host cells may be used for expression each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities expression systems are normally referred to by the host and the DNA source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material for example common hosts are bacteria such as e.coli B subtilis yeast such as s cerevisiae or eukaryotic cell lines common DNA sources and delivery mechanisms are viruses such as baculovirus retro virus adenovirus plasmids artificial chromosomes and bacteria phage such as lambda the best expression system depends on the gene involved for example the Saccharomyces cerevisiae is often preferred for proteins that requires significant post translational modification insect or mammal cell lines are used when human-like spicing of mRNA is required nonetheless bacterial expression has the advantage of easily producing large amounts of protein which is required for x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for structure determination because bacteria are prokaryotes they are not equipped with the full enzymatic machinery to accomplish the required post translational modifications or molecular folding hence multi domain eukaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria often a non-functional also many proteins become insoluble as inclusion bodies that are difficult to recover without harsh denaturants and subsequent cumbersome protein refolding to address these concerns expression systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications firing the proteins be conformed as in or closer to eukaryotic organisms cells of plants ie tobacco of insects or mammalians ie bovines are transfected with genes and cultured in suspension and even as tissues or whole organisms to produce fully folded proteins mammalian in vivo expression systems have however low yield and other limitations time consuming toxicity to host cells to combine the high yield productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast and advanced epigenetic features of plants insects and mammalian systems other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes ie non-pathogenic Leishmania cells topic bacterial systems topic Escherichia coli e-coli is one of the most widely used expression hosts and DNA is normally introduced in a plasmid expression vector the techniques for overexpression in e.coli are well developed and work by increasing the number of copies of the gene or increasing the binding strength of the promoter regions so assisting transcription for example a DNA sequence for a protein of interest could be cloned or sub cloned into a high copy number plasmid containing the Lac often l AC UV v promoter which is then transformed into the bacterium ecoli addition of iptg a lactose analog activates the lac promoter and causes the bacteria to express the protein of interest ecoli strain BL 21 and BL 21 de 3 are two strains commonly used for protein production as members of the B lineage they'll a clone and though MPT proteases protecting the produced proteins from degradation the de 3 profit found in BL 21 de 3 provides t7 RNA polymerase driven by the LA cv 5 promoter allowing for vectors with the t7 promoter to be used instead topic kourin bacterium non-pathogenic species of the gram-positive Corin bacterium are used for the commercial production of various amino acids the C glutamic and species is widely used for producing glutamate and lysine components of human food animal feed and pharmaceutical products expression of functionally active human epidermal growth factor has been done in C glutamic and thus demonstrating a potential for industrial scale production of human proteins expressed proteins can be targeted for secretion through either the general secretory pathway SEC or the twin arginine translocation pathway tat unlike gram-negative bacteria the gram positive Corrin bacterium lacked Lipper polysaccharides that function as antigenic endotoxins in humans topic Pseudomonas fluorescens the non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens is used for high-level production of recombinant proteins commonly for the development bio therapeutics and vaccines P fluorescens is a metabolically versatile organism allowing for high throughput screening and rapid development of complex proteins P fluorescens is most well known for its ability to rapid and successfully produce high titor's of active soluble protein topic eukaryotic systems topic yeasts expression systems using either s cerevisiae or pitcher Posterous allows stable and lasting production of proteins that are processed similarly to mammalian cells at high yield in chemically defined media of proteins topic filamentous fungi filamentous fungi especially Aspergillus and Trichoderma but also more recently my Celia flora thermophilic Siwon have been developed into expression platforms for screening and production of diverse industrial enzymes the expression system Siwon shows a low viscosity morphology in submerge culture enabling the use of complex growth and production media topic baculovirus infected cells baculovirus infected insect cells sf9 SF 21 high five strains or mammalian cells Heller Peck 293 allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that cannot be produced using fungal or bacterial systems it is useful for production of proteins in high quantity genes are not expressed continuously because infected host cells eventually lies and died during each infection cycle topic non lytic insect cell expression non lytic insect cell expression is an alternative to the lytic baculovirus expression system in non lytic expression vectors are transiently all stabili transfected into the chromosomal DNA of insect cells for subsequent gene expression this is followed by selection and screening of recombinant clones the non lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus infected cell expression cell lines used for this system include SF 9 SF 21 from spa Diptera fruity / de cells high five from trico plush and e cells and schneider - cells and schneider 3 cells from Drosophila melanogaster cells with this system cells do not lies and several cultivation modes can be used additionally protein production runs are reproducible this system gives a homogeneous product a drawback of this system is the requirement of an additional screening step for selecting viable clones topic excavator Leishmania Terran taille cannot infect mammals expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield in chemically defined media produced proteins exhibit fully eukaryotic post translational modifications including glycosylation and disulfide bond formation topic mammalian systems the most common mammalian expression systems are Chinese hamster ovary Cho and human embryonic kidney Hecht cells Chinese hamster ovary cell Mouse myeloma lymphoblastoid eg ns0 cell fully human human embryonic kidney cells heck 293 human embryonic retinal cells crew cells per c6 human amnio sight cells like at open CV EC topic cell-free systems self reproduction of proteins is performed in vitro using purified RNA polymerase ribosomes tRNA and ribosomal based expression system due to the low expression levels and high cost of cell free systems cell based systems are more widely used topic see also Celes horas a database of cell lines gene
