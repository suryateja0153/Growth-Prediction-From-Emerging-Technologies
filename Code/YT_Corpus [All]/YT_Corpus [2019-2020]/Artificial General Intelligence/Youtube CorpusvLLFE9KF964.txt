 something that's striking about chatbots is the number of them intelligence agents and virtual companions there aren't very many of them because they're quite complex to build chat BOTS because they have a much more narrow focus people can think of applications for their much more easily and the development platforms for them are really quite accessible so we've seen a huge chatbot rise in 2015 we saw facebook am that was one of the first sort of well-known chat bots and then a development platforms coming from Facebook Microsoft Line IBM and so on that really sort of spurred on this development to the point where we were having hundreds of thousands of chat BOTS and companies like slack or even introducing development funds and analysts like Gartner were making some pretty strong statements saying in the next few years we'll see 50% of enterprises spending more on box than they do on apps so there's a real surge here but if you move forward a couple of years to sort of where we are now you can see some challenges starting to emerge and and even last year and this is what started some of the conversation for jonathan i akai last year was you could see people beginning to raise some questions around bots are in the marketplace but they're not really meeting the expectations and this there was some disappointments started to creep in although the trend is still positive and they continue to be really useful and the growth continues but you do see things like Facebook em shut down and then people asking questions like david feldman who is one of the sort of principal developers for facebook am asking questions about what happened to chat bots so jonathan i were thinking about this and we have a theory for this which is this is probably the Gartner hype cycle taking place you know in the beginning there's a lot of excitement people rush in a lot of box are being developed but then there's this point where either you reach saturation or some expectations are not being met so we start to dip and so we're in what garden would call this trough of disillusionment but the really encouraging thing about this that we feel is it can work its way back up again and it can work up to what garden would call the plateau of productivity so then the question becomes how do we move forward along the slope of enlightenment enlightenment and into the plateau of productivity so this is where Jonathan I was sort of reflecting on what what are the things that we've learned from looking at the literature and from our own experiences of developing these chatbots and working on agents so here are some things that we think there are more than this but here are some things that we think really lead to success when developing chatbots so keeping a really narrow focus really helps and finding areas that have specific markets so again thinking about things like a travel agent and being able to hit help people with travel recommendations or maybe even kind of book a flight when things are really specific like that they're really kind of helpful the other thing that was quite striking and this is where we get into the conversation about home Bart's was we realized that many times BOTS are actually continuing to reach out to humans too and that was kind of an interesting kind of aha moment because I think a lot of the industry is trying to enable BOTS and agents to go it along to just be the tech on itself and maybe the text not really ready for some of the things we wanted to do so there's nothing wrong with having a human in the loop and embracing this idea of humbugs so just to talk about this this one a little bit further there's a paper a couple of years ago around a Bart called calendar help and this was a bar that was to help people develop of rather book meetings it's a pain point that a lot of us have it seems like it's a really straightforward task you know where the rooms are you know the people you know the time and so on but it turned out to be surprisingly difficult and this is what Crenshaw and folks were talking about a couple of years ago in this kite paper and they actually found that only 5% of the successful meetings booked could only could be done by the tackle arm and the humans had to be in the loop the rest of the time and they ended up developing an escalation path which had different levels of human involvement but this is a good example of how humans and technology can continue to work together and and deal with some of the challenges we're starting to experience in the area so in terms of further challenges so like calendar da helped with showing us even the simplest task can often be quite complex you can easily get into a situation where if you don't maintain boundaries on what the task is you get mission creep and either the user is not sure about what the bot can do or the bart itself is starting to creep into other areas the travel bot for instance could start finding activities that are unrelated to travel I think we talked about this one a lot in the field but conversation and natural language is surprisingly difficult as humans we've been doing this for a really long time and so we're experts so the bar is really really high along with that come questions around trust and transparency personality and especially during the first run experience it's really critical that people have a good sense of where information is going if necessary how to retrieve information and they just feel that the experience is trusted especially when it's easy to make chatbots on development platforms you don't know who's making these things unless you you communicate that information and then the last challenge that we wanted to call out was one we call the demo trap so this goes back to we've made some pretty good platforms to develop bots and it's fairly straightforward to make them but to be successful it's not just about making it and getting into into the market place it's about working afterwards to see how the data is being how that the product is being used looking at the data that's being worked on and really continuing to improve so what does all this mean for the future well like we started at the beginning oftentimes it's best to look back so we can look back to some work that Licklider did in the 1960s again and he created these three stages of human-computer interaction the first phase was beginning in the 1960s and has continued forward to about where we are right now and the second phase is moving into this area of around human-computer partnerships who's probably the phase that we're in right now and it's hard to define how that's going to go and how long it's going to last but Licklider said it could last ten to five hundred years and it should be intellectually the most creative and enticing a part in history of humanity so that's a long period of time but it's kind of encouraging because it'll also mean the conferences like this or they will keep going for 500 years work it all out and then phase three is what Licklider calls the ultra intelligent machine which is the period where we'll get to the full general artificial intelligence [Applause] if you have a question please come to the microphone and introduce yourself ben shneiderman University of Maryland thank you interesting review could you or did you in your discussions or taxonomy look for the places where instead of the agent doing it in collaboration that the person did it themselves I mean I see that for a lot of tasks people the different kind of interfaces enable them to do it themselves like making flight reservations or a lot of different tasks so what is the under what circumstances is it better for a person to do it themselves and when is it better for a conversational agent to help them I can't I can't say that we have a direct answer for doing that I think it's a really good place to investigate next the the thing that we were generally finding goes back to how complex tasks are and there were very many places where it was good to have human involvement or at least some some level of curation by by the humans so there ended up being a lot of places where humans needed to be involved so I think as we take this forward I think they the human and bot partnership would be really usually does it themselves not have enough oh I see yeah no we should look at that further yeah yeah I am a cloud pianist RIVM research when we looked in our research into these issues we also see what we think there's an automation which is the speech where versus chatbot text and how that sort of sort of make the map into those two categories and and creates in in mm no no week away and I wonder if you have look into this issue can you say more about what you mean by speech like my legs like using speech a set speech based chat box versus set of it checks text based read BOTS like the difference that let me give you an example when most of most intelligent systems are going the direction of speech why most of the shed bots who they are in the text world and and we wonder what wide is going there and what happens in that the two empty dimensions of these I'm not sure if I'm being clear I think I think part of I think we're at a transition phase right now where intelligence assistants are moving much more towards a audio speech base way I could see chat box starting to go more in that direction as we move forward to so I it's hard to say what what the reasons are for that but I think I can see why you saying I March Allegra from Google there seems to be Assumption in here that chatbots are going to be talking to humans and humans the chat BOTS did you think about a future in which my chat bot talks to your chat bot and I'm out of the loop yes we we didn't cover that in here but we have been thinking about this a lot in terms of what are all the relationships that could happen between one chat bar to another chat bot the chat box through a intelligence assistance and then also what it means to have a human involved and not to I think that's going to be one of the next phases that we as a discipline start to investigate further because it gets complex really quickly trying to figure out what those what those combinations are but also what the relationships are as well so yeah yeah thank you for bringing that up let's techs reach out again for the great park [Applause]
