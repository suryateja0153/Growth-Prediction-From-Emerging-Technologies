 What's up YouTube Matt Voke, Callsign Jerry, today we're gonna look at openAI how's a mustache doing happy mustache March and some of openAI's pursuits towards general intelligence that artificial general intelligence is thought to be the holy grail of AI they get after some of the challenges with machine-machine teaming and human-machine teaming looking at cooperation and collaborat ion through one of the oldest games hide-and-seek very simple relatively straightforward game that doesn't take much intelligence but hide-and-seek is a perfect environment for demonstrating how a human is able to sense and interact with objects in their environments over potentially long time horizons you might have already heard me talk about long time horizons well click above to watch the video of AlphaStar from DeepMind defeating Starcraft 2 experts long time horizons challenged AI and it's understanding of its universe a game of hide-and-seek would be extremely difficult if the seeker didn't remember where they looked last pretty straightforward like we've seen in previous games reinforcement learning is great for training agents to perform desired tasks but open AI is interested more than training the agents to perform specific tasks they want to be able to generalize direct supervision does not scale it's just that simple you can't tag and train a robot an AI to do everything that they're potentially going to see in the future nor does it allow them to work in complex unbounded situations when the environment changes just a little bit traditionally trained models need to start learning completely over again they don't have the generalized ability to apply their previous learning to that new situation anyways hide seek is one of those games that requires several human relevant skills including collaborative tool use which is pretty dang cool if you watch these videos these agents have to work together to change the environment to suit their needs in order to win at the game all right all right enough intro so what specifically as open a I done here and why is this important what are these agents doing watch this these agents are teamed up in games of hide-and-seek hiders avoid the line of sight of the seekers and the seekers try to keep vision of the hiders pretty simple agents get rewarded by not being found or finding others depending on their team they are not told how to interact with the environment or are they incentivized to do so they've learned that on their own that's the second good part here is emergent learning emergent behaviors and strategies emerge based on these multi agent competitions no behaviors were specifically taught or incentivized to these agents they learned all of this and this is emergent on their own that's amazing if you want to think about it after 25 million episodes of hide-and-seek the hiders learn to use the tools to intentionally modify the environment 25 million episodes may be a lot but that's pretty amazing emergent discovery they learn that they can block themselves into rooms pretty incredible not only are they running away but they're able to box themselves in a room and not be found after 75 million episodes the Seekers then learn that they can use these rudimentary tools to their advantage watch them as they discover how to use the ramp to jump into these closed rooms made by the hiders another 10 million episodes later the hiders learned to lock the ramps to defend against the seekers use Wow AI has learned to sabotage its adversary great good job openAI. After about another three hundred and eighty million training episodes the Seekers learned that they could bring a box over to the edge of the play area get on top of that box and then surf it into the hider safehouse this is some crazy stuff 380 million training episodes have allowed these agents to emergently find this innovative strategy this is pretty crazy another cool aspect of openAI's development here that is easily overlooked is that these agents are required to cooperate and coordinate their actions you can see that both of the agents are blocking off their shelter and they're splitting up to better acquire the hiders it may not seem great but there's obvious applications beyond games for this AI and its capability to cooperate and coordinate finally I'd like to swing back to one first discuss for openAI's attempt of why they're doing this in the first place is that generalization of intelligence the holy grail of AI is far more important than just rewarding what the AI trains specifically in very narrow areas this AI isn't just beating games it's developing some sort of general intelligence that's able to cross from one domain of learning to another to this end the team created five intelligence tests where the hide-and-seek agents were asked to count objects perform sequential tasks and to create unique structures agents were already trained in hide-and-seek showed an increased ability generalized in these new intelligence tasks over models that were not previously trained or were trained by older systems or methods this demonstrated that there was generalization in these agents learning because they could cross into new tasks although the difference was slight and there is room for improvement this is still important coordination cooperation and learning emergent behavior and strategy is awesome it's pretty easy to see that cooperation and coordination is extremely beneficial for any multi-agent application of AI or specifically in human-machine teaming or machine-machine teaming where AI and the human won't be very efficient or effective if both are operating irrespective of the other's actions or intent they need to be able to work together if the multiple agents are working together they can more effectively and efficiently accomplish their tasks if integrated well the easiest way to demonstrate this is with game theory have you heard of the prisoner's dilemma it's a very simple game where two people are being interrogated by the police someone has committed a crime and the police are intent on pinning it on one or both of these crooks they're crooks can either rat out their buddy or stay silent the Nash equilibrium in these cases are significantly different if the crooks are able to talk to one another and cooperate if they can coordinate and cooperate their incentives are absolutely in line to shut their mouths and not rat on their buddy if they cannot coordinate and cooperate they will ultimately fall on ratting out their buddy and then they both get longer jail sentences this is significantly better outcome because they can talk to each other aka cooperate great so what about emergent behaviors and emergent strategies this is another really cool example area from this openAI learning in the example of hide-and-seek agents learn at least seven emergent strategies some of which would be extremely difficult to learn through traditional training models and methods let's analyze this emergently learned strategy compared to some of our approaches to training and wargaming just like we talked about in the last video on AlphaStar and Starcraft in 2016 when AlphaGo defeated lys at all and go sum of AlphaGo's emergent behaviors shocked the world the humans even declared these moves mistakes that's a very surprising move I thought you thought it was a mistake they quickly changed their tone though minutes later when they realized that emergent behavior that nobody has ever seen before that they thought was mistakes was able to set that AI up to defeat that Grand Master in the long term experts are still learning from AI's novel and unbounded approach to games like go like hide-and-seek where emergent behaviors are learned without the use of heuristics from humans or in the box thinking prepping those humans amazing these are exciting times indeed it's awesome that were able to glean so much from these AI playing such simple games I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next on their path to artificial general intelligence the application surface and room for improvement in areas from swarm cooperation to operational strategy are boundless we ought not rest on our laurels and should be applying some of these great lessons learned from academia and the corporate world great stuff if you guys stuck out this long you should definitely hit the subscribe so you can be alerted automatically when I release some future content that you're probably also gonna like hit the like, thumbs up please, and I would love some comments definitely let me know what you guys like give me some feedback hey I didn't like this recommend you do this so that I can prove this for you guys in the future I like putting these out for you guys to inform you on what's happening and then how we potentially can use that so please let me know how I can improve this & the content thanks SEEYA!
