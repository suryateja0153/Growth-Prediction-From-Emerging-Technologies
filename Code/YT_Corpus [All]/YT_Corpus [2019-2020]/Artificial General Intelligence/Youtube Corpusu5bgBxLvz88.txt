 Assalamualaikum and Greetings In the previous video, I talked about ANI Artificial Narrow Intelligence AGI Artificial General Intelligence and ASI Artificial Super Intelligence If we look at it, most AI are the Narrow AI ANI that can complete a single task I also mentioned that it's difficult to create AGI because we don't know our brain mechanism So it's difficult to create AGI The truth is, the possibility to develop AGI is very high I've mentioned in the previous DX series It is due to the supercomputer evolution Calculation made by supercomputer is way faster than our brain It is said that the neurons or axons in our brain can transmit information in 100 m/s 100 m/s is fast right? But this is slower than the speed of sound which travels at 340 m/s If we look at computer, it can calculate at the speed of light Although our brain is more advanced than a supercomputer It's not that our brain is fast but we have algorithms that are yet to be discovered We can plan we can be creative and go beyond things These things can't be replicated in computer But physically, the functionality and capability of a computer in terms of speed and capacity is higher than our brain After AGI, we have Artificial Super Intelligence I wanna ask Which is more difficult Artificial Super Intelligence or Artificial General Intelligence? Logically, it's definitely ASI, right? Because it's super intelligence But if we think carefully, I've talked about rocket before this It's difficult during take off its energy will decrease The steps to reach AGI is harder than the steps to reach AGI from ASI However, due to supercomputer, and big data In the next videos, I will share why does big data give a great influence to AI By putting large data into supercomputer we can create in a week, perhaps 20 years of value or time in the digital world causing AI to be intelligent quicker It is also said that the exponential growth Currently, we can see a slow movement from ANI to AGI But when it reaches AGI, within a short time It is said that human will reach the ASI stage Elon Musk also questions, do we need Super Intelligence? Because Super Intelligence can destroy human It's a very dangerous weapon It's dangerous than a nuclear bomb The ASI Lots of debates on this But if we look at human, AI scientists are eager Like I said, humans have wanted to create artificial humans in terms of the physical and mental It is a dream or desire for every scientist to achieve that It's hard to stop the desire This is basic human want especially for the intellectuals They want to go beyond Elon Musk also warns that this thing will backfire To a certain extent, we don't know how ASI thinks Perhaps it doesn't think like us anymore Logical thinking, the way it processes information and it can develop itself Thus, it doesn't need human at all, right Nowadays, we have many new technologies If we look at the development of AI, it's actually scary The way AI reacts looks like human It's not impossible that AI will be smarter than us, right Therefore, frontier AI company like DeepMind sets a guideline for a secure AI development To avoid problems in the future This thing is still in research So that one day, we don't want the AI goes beyond our control Next, I want to talk about the four functions of AI First is reaction machine Reaction machine is similar to its word For instance, the AI that is designed for chess game developed by IBM Deep Blue It won against Kasparov Reaction machine reacts according to the input In a chess game, when one player moves another player will move It doesn't create any simulation from the situation It only reacts It has preset knowledge that was learned then it will react When we are playing chess, it didn't learn anything It only responds to what was previously learnt This is an example of reaction machine The second stage of AI is called limited memory Limited memory means AI that stores information and experience and react based on those two Like I shared in Autonomous Driving Technology it has radar It needs to look over its surrounding if there's any person or object It will recreate the situation in its world It will store the information in its temporary memory and will react based on that This is what we called as limited memory The third type is the theory of mind that means the AI can understand our emotion and human sentiments Somehow it has its own reason Currently, we are in the process to complete this level Mostly in big data in variety Most data that we have are unstructured data such as sound, images, videos and many others In unstructured data, like our sound our face, video our voice have unlimited potentials to extract data When we look at human we can know his feeling What does he think? Is he stressed or happy? From his voice not only from his words but also from his tone We can know if he's tired or he's motivated Currently, from this kind of research with deep learning, I think we can create and extract this When it's paired with big data, it's almost done A famous research on this is Kismet When this robot sees us, it will emphasize It sees, understands and reacts based on our facial expression Kismet can replicate human that means it can understand Now we have something that is not recent Robot Sophia Robot Sophia is more complicated and advanced She has many intelligences to understand and react to our emotions She can talk with us, right Besides understanding us, Sophia can create reactions Meaning, she can react to our emotions It will simulate the emotions via her robot muscle It's quite interesting To say that she has her own mind, I think it's still a long way to go I think the theory of mind is the key to AGI The fourth function is self-awareness Self-awareness is a type of AI that is non-existent If it exists, it's in The Matrix level Agents, right? They have their own awareness in the simulation world as a software Awareness doesn't have to be like our awareness We are aware but the dimensions of awareness are high Humans have their own awareness same goes to animals We don't know the level of awareness The AI has its own awareness and reaction It can be said that self-awareness is close to Super Intelligence If we look at the types of AI, the first three, and lastly the fourth type They are quite similar but are actually different The stages are capability as well as functionality This is it for this time We'll meet again in the next video Assalamualaikum and Greetings
