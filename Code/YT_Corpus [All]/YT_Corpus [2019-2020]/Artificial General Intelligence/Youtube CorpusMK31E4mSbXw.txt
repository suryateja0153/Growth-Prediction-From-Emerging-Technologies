 artificial intelligence it will change everything but artificial intelligence is not a new concept in fact we've been writing about AI almost as long as stories have been written and we've been beguiled by novels movies and TV series about it ever since we've seen it developed from Turing simple predicting machine to beating our best at chess and now deep learning programs that promise to eradicate disease predict crime solve world poverty drive our cars understand world economies and save our planet through climate change predictions we're already using digital assistants that talk to us developing robots that work like us but what will happen when we develop systems that think like us but beyond human capacity we've stood at the edge of the fourth Industrial Revolution and we need to shape our future carefully so what do we need to know about AI there is not going to be anyone on the planet in the next 50 years who is going to be affected for better or worse by artificial intelligence in some way there's not going to be anyone who isn't affected by some of the big challenges that we face like climate change biodiversity loss sustainability that artificial intelligence my help us to solve although the word itself wasn't actually coined until 1956 at Dartmouth at the very famous conference on artificial intelligence and machine learning in our cultural imaginations in the West it goes right back to Homer what's so intriguing is that as a massive prehistory in literature and film our cultural imagination which is arriving with this artificial intelligence technology and shaping the way people are thinking about it beyond the reality of what's actually happening what made it possible is the speeding up of computers the fact that number crunching is far faster now because of Moore's law which makes computers get twice as fast every couple of years one of the really exciting things that's happened in AI and the reason it's been so revolutionary is that we have massive amounts of data for certain problems so we have the whole internet worth of text to learn about languages we have again the whole internet worth of images to learn about what images look like and these fields have progressed very quickly but that's that's hitting a limit many of the biggest challenges that we face in the coming century will involve making sense of huge amounts of information and complex interconnected systems whether it's making sense of our genomes be knowns proteomes or all of the complicated systems that make up the ecosystem around us human intelligence can make inroads into this but human intelligent combination with artificial intelligence and as a much more powerful ability to really understand these issues in machine learning you give the computer lots of data and then the computer has an algorithm that finds patterns in data reading and also includes the performance of the computer at some task and that sort of key idea learning from data is really what's revolutionized AI in the last decade or so we are using it in our mobile phones we are using it with face recognition we are using it in medicine in law and so on so it's already part of our daily life there's nothing intrinsically magical about artificial intelligence is just very clever algorithms that are being executed in a very clever ways in some ways it's easier to imagine the potential downsides of AI than the upsides now partly I think this is because we all know the Hollywood images of the machine intelligence breaking down our door and coming in with a machine gun whereas the positive sites are being dreamt up by thousands of people all over the world imaginative young people who see a problem and think about how they can solve it using AI so it's really difficult to predict all of the countless ways in which is going to make our lives better whether that's for example just recommending a new song you're going to like or curing us of cancer but there is great public concern about the impacts of automation and robots on our jobs some pessimistic studies report that up to 40% of jobs could be lost to AI with the first Industrial Revolution we mechanized much of human labour we replaced human muscle power what intelligent machines might do is also replace human brain power so it's natural that we're asking ourselves well what will we do where machines can do everything better than we can and at that point we might want to start asking is the paradigm of everybody working a nine-to-five job the one that we want to stay in long term I would ask question are there things that we value in society at the moment that we currently don't build into our and models of finance and economics I think for this to happen obviously there's got to be massive redistribution of wealth otherwise the wealth earned by the computers is going to go to the huge companies or to the individuals who own them and have the skill so I think we need massive socialist redistribution so to set up very large numbers of publicly funded and respected dignified jobs as carers and other kinds of social work still we have to think about what that transition looks like we have to make sure that nobody is left behind so we have to think about the kind of skills we need and how to manage the disruption of people losing jobs and seeking new ones history tells us that new jobs will be created that we can't even imagine yet imagine talking to your grandparents 50 years ago and telling them that the software engineer is going to be the job of the future AI is developing against a backdrop of a world that is becoming increasingly digitized while this brings great benefits there are concerns our infrastructure is becoming in digital our weapon systems our scientific processes artificial intelligence allows us to better make use of these systems and to optimize them however it means that new potential vulnerabilities will open up that may result in accidental problems but also present opportunities for hackers to manipulate our to attack systems these are systems that we build to empower us to do amazing things now what can go wrong with these tools is that they might exacerbate inequality for example you could cause geopolitical disruptions for example if AI is being used in warfare 4-leaf autonomous weapons and just generally changes to the way our society works changes that are too sudden for example the changes in democracy these things could cause unintended consequences we've already seen in recent elections what can be done if you have enough data and access to people's minds through social media and a I is going to bring that to a wholly new level or for example we'll be able to use AI to disable critical systems like energy grids and food supply systems and so forth and at the same time it's a flipside of the benefits of AI the more we come to rely on it to run our transport systems or our health systems for example the more vulnerable we become to when those systems are attacked so preparing for an age of intelligent machines is perhaps the greatest challenge of our time if you think about the world right now we have changed the world in a greater way than any species that has come before us both in positive ways and in negative ways and a very large part of that has been our intelligence that's what allowed us to populate the entire planet to change our environment to build the machines that we have and if we are introducing entities that are able to match or even surpass our problem-solving and scientific capabilities that's going to change the world even more than we have it can't simply be enough for the leading scientists as brilliant as they are to be pushing ahead as quickly as possible we need there to be ongoing conversations and collaboration between the people who are thinking about the ethical impacts of the technology how it's going to be deployed in different sectors what portions the population are going to be affected in different ways how we can make sure that the benefits of the technology reach as many people as possible our intelligence is central to being human so what will happen when we develop sentient AI that matches or surpasses human intelligence human capacities are of course a product of our very specific evolutionary history and of what you can fit inside one skull the machines were building I think will be completely different in a completely different history completely different constraints so they're going to force us to really expand our idea of what intelligence is if you develop general artificial intelligence I think all bets are off as to what it would mean to be human it's an open question what we even mean by general artificial intelligence broadly we use it to and refer to intelligence that is not just narrowly defined to do a particular task very well but intelligence that is able to go into a new environment make sense of it figure out what problems need to be solved and set about solving them when we develop artificial intelligence systems if we do they're able to achieve this I think it's fair to say we'll be introducing a new type of intelligence to the world and that that will change the world and our part in it in ways possible to predict this is an incredibly exciting time to be alive for millions of years we humans have lived with other kinds of intelligence with birds all around us in animals and bacteria that all in their various ways managed to solve the problems of life but now we are creating a wholly new form of intelligence and we don't know what that's going to be like we don't know what life in the age of intelligent machines is going to be like but I'm really excited about the possibilities there may be areas of scientific progress that are simply beyond us whether it's new forms of physics our deeper understanding of the universe or an understanding of our own biology and health that goes beyond what we can do without these tools the idea that artificial intelligence can help us to understand ourselves and to understand the universe at a much deeper level than we'd ever would be able to do without it I think is about as far reaching the goal for artificial intelligence as could be my special interest in space science and that's an arena where the robots clearly have an advantage because space is a hostile environment the people it's very expensive to send people into space but I expect that we will have much more sophisticated robots large the tillers of tiny machines exploring all the planets and the moons and also perhaps fabricators building huge structures up in space which are intense enough to do their work without human being so I see space as being an arena for robots and miniaturized probes which can be far more effective than human beings this is perhaps the most exciting time in the history of mankind we're only a decade or so away from the future where we will be able to converse across multiple languages where doctors will be able to diagnose better where surgeons will be able to operate more accurately where drivers will be able to drive more safely so I think in our research and in our work we should really embrace this technology and work together for the benefit of the society although machines are threatening one aspect of what it means to be human at the same time they ought to help us appreciate the incredible machinery of the human brain and body at just how much of the millions of years of evolutionary history have gone into making us embodied creatures that can function in the world and just how impressive that is [Music] you you
