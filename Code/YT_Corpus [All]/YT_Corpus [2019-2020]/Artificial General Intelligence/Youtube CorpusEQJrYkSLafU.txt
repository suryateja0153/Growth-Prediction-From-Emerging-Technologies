 all right good morning everyone why don't we get started no actually good afternoon everyone welcome I'm sue Jay King Lou the Dean of the College of Engineering and it's my pleasure and honor to kick off this first view from the top event of the fall 2019 semester this speaker series is assigned to bring leading leaders in business and technology to speak to our college of engineering community and today's special guests exemplifies this he is a visionary Silicon Valley entrepreneur Tom Siebel but before continuing I'd like to acknowledge the co-hosts of today's event that's how Beta Pi the engineering Honor Society let's give him a round of applause for helping us I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to all the members of the deans society and also everybody who's watching and joining us online before going on I'd also like to remind you of a couple of events that were happening next week so on Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. we're going to have a college of engineering community event to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the engineering student services Oh October 8th I'm sorry okay we've just postpone it because the ESS advisors are not available next week all right so on October 8th we're going to have a celebration of the engineering student services which really is designed to help to enhance our students learning experience so 10th anniversary and a new Welcome Center for the college so that mark your calendars for October 8th next week the next speaker in this series is Chandrika Tandon she is a businesswoman and an Grammy Award winning artist and humanitarian so she'll be joining us on this stage next Thursday and next Friday so please look for the announcements for these events on in your email alright so coming to today's event I think we all are availa where that advancements in information technology over the last decade a few decades had really led to faster and more cost-effective devices for communicating and processing and sensing information in our world and this has in turn transformed the way we live work and play so advancements in information technology have led to cloud computing in and out of things machine which in turn have enabled advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning and also Big Data and data science so the confluence that these four technologies is going to affect a digital transformation of businesses and governments which is going to have profound implications on our society now you might know that Berkeley engineering has been enabling an enabler in an innovating new technologies to have enabled that information technology revolution and we expect that we're going to be at the forefront of the AI or digital transformation revolution but also these this revolution really has some serious potential societal and ethical implications and as part of the larger Berkeley campus community we should take advantage of the breadth of excellence on our campus so that we can be leaders in addressing all the challenges that digital transformation will bring as long as along with the benefits so this is why I'm especially excited today to have our speakers our guest speaker talk about about his vision and his advice for leading the digital transfer and transformation of our society and at this point I'd like to invite professor Costas Panos to come up here and to set the stage for our speakers today Thank You CJ and good afternoon very nice crowd so welcome all to cities and the Bernardo Institute that is co-hosting this event alongside with the College of Engineering and today we're extremely glad and proud to introduce our speaker mr. Tom Siebel tom is the founder and chief executive officer of c3 dot a I a computer software company that provides platform as a service and software as a service applications for enterprise scale Big Data predictive analytics AI and IOT solutions tom was the founder exhibit a chief executive officer of Siebel systems one of the world's leading software companies it was founded in 1993 and simple systems pioneered the CRM customer management customer relationship management software and it became the global leader with more than 8,000 employees worldwide in 32 countries and over 4,500 customers an annual revenue in excess of two billion dollars in seven years Siebel systems merged with Oracle Corporation in January 2006 mr. Sibal is the chairman of the Thomas and Stacey Siebel foundation and serves on the college of engineering boards of the University of Illinois and the University of California Berkeley it has been a very good friend of our programs here are very grateful for that he's a director of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences tom is a graduate of the University of Illinois at urbana-champaign where he received a Bachelors of Arts in history an MBA and a Masters of Science in computer science he is the author of four books including most recently digital transformation survive and thrive in an era of mass extinction today's subject is going to be indeed digital transformation in a conversation with our distinguished colleague professor Santa Sastry I would like to welcome you both to stage [Applause] thank you Tom thank you for being here and thank you all the full house here so it's delighted to see tonight and to see our campus community I put a plunge right into it just so that you know you know we'll have I have a few questions we'll get going with this conversation but we want to throw it open to questions before not too long this by the way is the book I hope you already read it and yeah I I got to reread it and preparing for this it's just I uh say I really enjoyed ah here it is okay I enjoyed rereading it so Tom let me start off by asking you about Daniel Bell and his 1973 book the coming post-industrial age as you say in the preface of your book you didn't miss much but those book is really not standard fare how did you come upon this book I spent a lot of time at the university Keller University of Illinois at Urbana and my first degree was in history of science and then I went back to learn the languages of Commerce so I could play the game of business at a higher level and so I went to the Graduate School of Business to learn the languages of finance and marketing and accounting and what have you so I could play that game and I yeah of course that I really enjoyed was of course in operations research which brought way down into the computer lab and back then we were computing on these massive you know CDC cyber super super computers and coding and coding and Fortran on you know key punch machines with your large decks of Hollerith cards that we'd take in every evening to have you know read and we'd get to the third card and there'd be a typo so you'd have to anyhow in the course of you know you know I've really got it I spent a lot of time in the computer lab and got involved with the screech that it's simulation and whatnot and one day I was roaming through the bookstore in the Illini Union and stumbled upon a book published by Daniel Bell it had been published in 1973 and it was called the coming post-industrial Society and let's think about this 1973 okay this would be the era of the Ford Mustang this is the interstate highway act destroyed his King okay we you know we're up in the business of manufacturing you know goods as an economy and so Daniel Bell it turns out is a the the title of his book was the coming post-industrial Society and he was a Marxist sociologist from Harvard and really quite influential in the 70s in the United States one of the most influential thinkers and he his thesis in this book is that the global economy is about to go through a restructuring in the following decades you know on the order of the Industrial Revolution to what he calls the post-industrial society and he also coins the term the Information Age and I mean let's think about this 1973 I mean people this is before the mini-computer this is before the personal computer if you can imagine this it's before the cell phone okay as before the fax machine I mean before any of this he's you know he puts forth this idea that we're going to see a restructuring of the global economy on the order of the Industrial Revolution where you know the scarcest resources are going to change from in the industrial area where we have various forms of capital okay to the post-industrial area where the scarcest and most precious resource becomes information and timeliness and accuracy of information and so he kind of foretold whole story that we've been living in the last you know four or five decades and I found that very inspiring and so I have been taking some classes you know the campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana and some of you do it's kind of the you know the Demilitarized Zone line of demarcation is something called Green Street and north of that it's engineering and south of that of Liberal Arts and Sciences and so I've been taking some classes north of Green Street in the you know mostly in operations research and and managed to somehow get admitted to the Graduate School of Engineering for which I was completely unqualified and then this motivated me to get a degree in this field so I can play the game in this economy that Bell described and so I did my graduate work in relational database theory and for the past four decades have had a place at the table and an opportunity to play the game and seeing this whole future that Val foretold you know unfold right before eyes exactly as he described it so the title of the book is it says survive and thrive in an era of mass extinction and in chapters 1 & 2 you make a case for how the confluence of IOT AI machine learning and elastic cloud computing is likely to be really disruptive as in evolutionary biology and you talk about the punctuated equilibria so tell us your vision of the scale of this digital transformation and it's punctuated equilibria ok so we this efforts III day I we began in 2009 ok and as we looked in the world in 2009 it appeared to us that the next step function in information technology there was a lot of likely to change everything included elastic cloud computing big data the Internet of Things and AI and now I think that it's all there really wasn't much going on in 2009 but today there it turns out it turned out to be true now and so we basically worked on building a software platform there would allow organizations to take advantage of those technologies to build classes of applications that were to solve problems that were previously unsolvable we could talk about those later but you know in the course of you know traveling around the world and visiting chief executive officers and boards of directors in Shanghai Beijing Rome Paris London New York Minneapolis Chicago and San Francisco you know these people with whom I had done business now for decades you know all of a sudden were talking about this thing called in every boardroom in every CEOs office they were talking about this thing called digital transformation and candidly I found the idea completely perplexing I'm thinking like digital transformation as opposed to what as opposed to analog transformation and and the more and it was clearly something that was very important ok and it was urgent it was something that people needed to do now ok but when you poked at it in try to tease apart what they were thinking about I mean there was no commonality between their use of the term they candidly they had no idea what they were talking about and so you know this goes gets us from say 2009 through about 2014 and then I think I figured out what is happening and there's a there's a there was a what's going on in the world is that in the first two decades of the 21st century we're going through a mass extinction event in the corporate world and in fact in the first 18 years of this century 52 percent of the fortune 500 companies have disappeared ok where's Westinghouse where's Kodak where is Sears Roebuck I mean these companies aren't just gone and it's almost inconceivable that these companies begone ge will be the next to disappear and 52% or God so what we're dealing with for CEO is is an existential event and then you know many of you prep probably all of you have read this book called sapiens a pretty good book right and many of you either have read chapters of or all of so so I read sapiens and this started making started think me thinking about evolutionary biology and and I had had the opportunity to take a class in in in that area in the past and in this so I recalled you know the Origin of Species by by Charles Darwin and in the Origin he describes this process of natural selection is the driving force behind the speciation of the planet right you all know that story so we don't want to e to go into it and he did this as I recall this was like 1859 might give me a couple years one way or the other if I'm wrong but that's pretty close okay and the the problem that Darwin had is he couldn't explain the gaps in the fossil records and there was huge caps in the fossil records and his explanation was well we just haven't found him yet and it wasn't until 1972 that an evolutionary biologist by the name of Stephen Jay Gould at Harvard described when and by the way so people Darwin thought about the process is evolution it's kind of a continual process that handed hamp that took place relatively gradually over many many millennia kind of and moved constantly upward to the right kind of the way we think about Moore's law well Gould conceived of this came up with this concept called punctuated equilibrium and he said this is not the way that evolution works and so I think that you know the planet Earth has been around for roughly 4 and 1/2 billion years we've had life on the planet for three and a half billion years and in the last 440 million years alone which is relatively a blink of an eye and in this you got a big bigger picture we've had five mass extinction events on the planet Earth and it's through some of these extinction events there's you know glaciation tech you know tectonic issues you know the pole switching sides and you know and it during these extinction events as many as 96 percent of the species on earth became extinct and these speciation events would then be followed these hurry these extinction events would have long periods of stasis okay and that's that an extinction event followed by mass speciation of all these new species with new DNA and so the most recent of these events is the one with which everyone in this room is undoubtedly familiar called the KT extinction that happened I think about 65 million years ago when this meteor hit the Yucatan and then this caused massive climate change where as a result of volcanic eruption and 75% of the species on earth became extinct 65 million years ago and the kind of one of the one of the predominant species on the planet as of that time were the dinosaurs very successful species that have been you know had been on the planet for order of 150 million years and it disappeared and this is followed by Masri speciation and this turn of the story turned out pretty well for us because you know mammals I feel that filled that vacuum that was filled that was formerly occupied by the dinosaurs and so then we have homo sapiens and so far this is you know worked out pretty well and you know I know that we're only gonna last another 11 or 12 years but you know it's pretty good being a pretty good run so far okay now the and so what I the the fundamental thesis of this book is about drawing parallels between evolutionary biology and what's going on in in you know the intersection between technology and Homo sapiens so we've seen you know and we see again these long periods of stasis and then there's changes like the invention of fire the domestication of Agriculture the domestication of dogs okay the the invention of the printing press movable type how big was that okay this is this was a big event right resulting in the okay in the Reformation the the steam engine the jacquard loom in and in each of these events were massively disruptive and in many ways massively positive at the same time there were huge adverse consequences associated with each of them so let's think about the the press okay that movable type I mean the implications of that for the Western world okay worth it now you know the Bible was no longer hand scribed in one language okay interprete Balai one group so we could print the Bible in French and German in English and we did and it resulted in you know how many hundreds of years of religious wars that followed you know after Martin Luther you know nailed you know nailed some declarations to the door of a church I think in Wittenberg and or the the steam edge and the jacquard loom well what followed from that would be the Industrial Revolution right most people would argue that the Industrial Revolution was a pretty good thing and the people live longer and they live healthier they're you know they're they're better fed we have you know civilization and lots of parts of the world I think most people would argue it was a pretty good thing at the same time you can draw a direct line from the steam engine okay and the jacquard loom to child labor okay communism World War One World War two I mean it's a straight line okay and so there were some pretty significant adverse consequences that that that resulted from these type oh geez so that's kind of the big idea is to is to draw parallels between evolutionary biology and what goes on in the intersection of of mankind and technology and I think we're seeing a disruptive event okay not less significant than the jacquard loom not less significant than the then the steam engine or the or movable type okay and it I think this this is what I think digital transformation is about so this is about the confluence of elastic cloud computing big data the Internet of Things and AI and it changes everything so if we look at the information technology industry when I left college and what to work for a young entrepreneur in Menlo Park for the NEMA Larry Ellison turned out to be a pretty good idea you know they the worldwide market for information technology was order of fifty billion dollars today it's three point five trillion okay and in you know in five years it will be order of nine trillion okay and this exponential growth is all a function in my opinion of these technologies that you know that I'm talking I think you know 5g you don't might have an impact also but that's the big idea you know to this audience of course they want me to answer all your technical questions but I want to continue with what you began so in Chapter nine moving ahead in the book you talk about how the case with digital change is led from the top by the milk O'Shea at NL Mike Roman that's 3m Karachi Francesco at NL and secretary Heather Wilson at USF tell us what resemblance you see in in this leadership group that's actually making this change to keep them out of the punctuated equilibrium the extinction events that you talk about here okay so I have been this is my fourth decade in the information technology industry I've seen the transition from mainframe many computers - personal computers internet Ethernet the Internet cloud computing SAS computing enterprise application software I have been there I have done there I've seen it ok and I was involved in bringing many of these technologies to market and I would say in the last 30 years you know these technology decisions were made in universities and research institutions and the government and private enterprise by the CIO the CIO was the person who would say you know well you know we're never gonna use him any computer or we're never gonna use either we're never here's the personal computer see you wait for that person to get fired and you come back two years later okay and this is how the industry grew it was always the CIO who made these decisions and the CIO CEO was nowhere to be found now if you installed you know maybe he had an enterprise application software system that reads to a hundred thousand people in a place like IBM then you'd spend some time with Lou Gerstner or if you did the same thing in General Motors he actually general like he gets read some time with Jack Welch but it was definitely the CIO making all these decisions and the CIO he or she would then brief the chief executive officer once a quarter on what if anything was being done now what I found curious as I began traveling a globe in this most recent effort say in 2009 it's the chief executive officer was that was in every meeting okay and this chief executive officer was driving every discussion and and the CIO was no place to be found the CIO was off you know installing sales floors your single sign-on or or something I'm trying to figure out how to get si P to work and the CIO was not in the room CEO always in the room you know mandating digital transformation where'd the CEO come from okay and so this kind of led me to this idea of an existential of that and I think you have you have kind of two classes of CEOs out there you have those that are complacently waiting to get their pensions okay they don't care okay and all they want this is their pensions they're not really representing the interests of their shareholders and then you have these visionary CEOs who are driving change and assuring taking the action necessary personally to ensure that their companies have sustainable competitive advantage in the 21st century economy and these would be people like Isabel Koecher who is a physicist and a great visionary at a company called ng in France and and my friend Jacques vo knows her very well and ng is a about a seventy billion euro integrated energy company or francisco´s Taraki at a company called NL in Rome and now is the largest power utility in the free world they have about sixty million meters in 40 countries to put that in a perspective there are about a hundred 100 million meters in in the utility system in the United States so there's a pretty big utility and by the way there's 100 million meters are serviced by thirty two hundred and fifty utilities Mike Roman the CEO of 3m Heather Wilson the secretary of the air force Ryan McCarthy ok the the Secretary of the army and these people are visionaries they are driving change in their organizations there they are generally aligning himself with a new executive if somebody calls a chief digital officer who has you know the license and the authority to get this job done and they don't meet quarterly they meet daily and so these are you know people who are taking the time you know to you know understand the technology they are picking up books they're reading books they're becoming personally conversant with these technologies and they are driving change in everything about the way that they design products and services manufacture products deliver products service customers train their people compensate people run the organization it changes everything about digital transformation nut is not simply about installing technology it's about changing every manner in which these organizations operate wonderful you know there are other questions related to this change management which I want to come back to what eh tell you Berkeley is the guy that did the yucatan water in Louise Alvarez I think this work was done here yeah yeah there it's not a place that's averse to punctuated equilibria 65 million year old one anyhow but ok ok no more no more about I want to talk about you in the book here not about Berkeley is a great place ok I chapter I think you provide a very nice primer of the multiple cycles of AI and machine learning which a lot of us in this audience have suffered through these AI winters and so on but you know and you talk a little bit about the emergence of yeah I'm a I am a in machine learning and especially deep learning well some people are really concerned about sort of the brittleness of these algorithms but give us your sense of how come you you know what's ready for use in practice and how is it likely to play forward going forward well the concept of AI is not new right this came about what in the 50s with Marvin Minsky and these guys at MIT okay and kind of nothing happened for 70 years and what that was called the the winter of AI but you know what was what was what you know what what we were lacking with the underlying enabling technologies okay and the under one underlying enabling technology would be the elastic cloud I mean with the elastic cloud we have all of us immediately available today virtually infinite computing capacity and infant storage capacity at virtually no cost and by the time Satya and Jeff Bezos and Andy jazz yeah through slitting one another's throats I mean this stuff is gonna be free well and you know and so it'll essentially be you know he's it's approaching you know I mean infinite is a big number I mean it was some of there's people in this room who have done tree you know done serious computing on 8-bit processors that operated at three and a Hertz cycles you'll remember that you had to think okay and you're getting some people in this room who remember the storage is something that you will bring in in a forklift okay into the into a machine room okay today with this elastic cloud I mean we're not looking at 8-bit processors or 300 Hertz articles we could spool up literally tens of thousands of 64 foot you know of processors doing virtual machines doing 64-bit floating-point operations to 3 gigahertz cycles right and store you know virtually unlimited amounts of data so that is what you know that Ian that was fundamental okay to be able to solve these problems because the datasets are staggering and the computational requirements are breathtaking you to solve some of these machine learning problems so what can we do so I think about it Julius Caesar used to talk about Gaul divided into three parts right and so I think at AI is divided into three parts and this will be controversial here so I'm probably gonna get stoned in a minute okay and and I never get through one of these things without breaking a little glass and I'm surprised to ever get invited back the okay but I think if you look at AI you know there's kind of three areas number one we have a GI which is artifice re you know artificial general intelligence and this would be like the google deepmind project this would get to you know Kurt's while in the kurtzweil and the singularity this is the idea that we're going to have computers that are equivalent to or smarter than human beings okay I don't think there's any question that we can get a computer that could do any individual tasks better than a human perhaps drive a car play chess to let go but I but I think the idea that we're gonna have computers that are gonna do you know all tasks better than a human being any time in the future or be more intelligent than a human being any time in the foreseeable future in my opinion is highly unlikely and so this Elon Musk rant and by the way Elon is a very very bright guy and someone for whom I have a normal normos professional respect but but I'd and and personal admiration but I do not think we need to worry about you know the malevolent computer refrigerator taken over the household okay it's not gonna happen anytime soon and I think we underestimate okay the capacity of the human mind and the human spirit and in candidly I think the most powerful computer that we can see can't conceive of today might have in it you know intellectual capacity equivalent to a mealworm okay now the second area of AI relates to the application of AI in the field of social media this is actually pretty troubling and where we you know through you know we're you know social media companies have figured out how to use computers to manipulate people say 2.2 billion at a time at the level of the limbic brain so this has an Olympic brain is that part of the brain that we have that were evolved maybe 200 million years ago and that's what we have that part of the brain neural nervous system that we have in common with a lizard okay and it does deals with the stuff of survival okay what would that be food water sex okay and it and it releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine which is the pleasure center of the brain and this is how we learn to do things that result in the survival of the species okay like heat and drink and you know whatever else okay now here we are definitely manipulating me up a a I and you know he and I some pretty nefarious ways and I think some of the consequences of this on human beings and society are pretty deleterious and you know we have this whole concept of ijen or this post millennial generation where we have you know massive depression loneliness you know people don't have friends people don't have dates people don't have socialized we have the weaponization of these of these media by bad actors that call into question whether or not we're gonna be able to conduct a democratic society so there's really some troubling things going on there okay then we have so we get in a maxi for those of you know about Siebel scholars who are holding a Siebel scholars conference on that on that topic at the University of Chicago next month that I'm really looking forward to now the third general area of AI it relates the application of AI to commercial industrial and government processes and there are classes of problems there that might seem relatively mundane but they were unsolvable as recently as 10 years ago and they result in enormous social and economic benefit let's say AI base predictive maintenance okay we can go into a power of great infrastructure let's apply let's talk about smart grid analytics in general where we can go to the grid infrastructure the grid being the most large and most complex machine ever built an according to the National Academy of Engineers the most significant scientific achievement in the 20th century we're now in the last ten years we've been upgrading this heat grid infrastructure so that all of the all of the components of the grading structure are being upgraded with so that there were remotely machine addressable this is what we call IOT right so generation transmission distribution transformer substation tree closures capacitance mechs they're all remotely machine addressable so we can use AI to aggregate all those data and these datasets are massive and operating at a very high velocity with some of these data arriving at say 90 Hertz cycles we can we can run these data through a machine learning models at the rate that these data arrive and dramatically increase the resilience okay lower the cost reduce the amount of fuel reduce the vulnerability to cyber security increase the reliability and reduce the greenhouse gas footprint by a factor of two so this is something we do today in in Spain we do it Italy we do it in France we do it in New York digital oil fields okay I know that the summer believe that you know in two years we're all gonna stop using hydrocarbon products globally but don't bet on it okay and the the you know we you know we can in fact use AI in upstream downstream midstream to you know increase productivity increase safety in case reliability lower the cost of human cost associated with injury lower the human cost associated with environmental impact like environmental disaster other examples of AI that are very calm and relate to financial services tion the financial services industry fraud detection and I money-laundering Volker app compliance entered a liquidity which has to do with it's basically stochastic optimization of the supply chain it's an inventory optimization problem how much cash do I need where when to meet the needs of the market was the killer application AI it would be pretty AI based predictive maintenance okay whether it's a caterpillar Tractor whether it's a Boeing 737 or whether it's f-35 Joint Strike Fighter okay we can use we can take all the telemetry from these systems and run these telemetry to your machine learning models and predict system failure in advance whether its propulsion artillery power unit pressurization flight controls and if we can predict the failure say 50 to 100 flight hours in advance we can avoid unscheduled may and you know increase the availability of aircraft and also dramatically decrease their accidents and we do this for example for the United States Air Force United States Air Force has 4600 aircraft and today we're doing a operation for this predictive maintenance for e3 century that's the AWACS f15 f-16 f-18 f-35 Joint Strike Fighter and we increase the availability of some of these aircraft from order of 50% to order of 80% and if you're in the business of being the secretary of defense that's actually a pretty big deal you know what some of these aircraft cost say a hundred million dollars a copy and they're grounded these are types of applications that we do every day what will the largest application of AIP hard stop precision medicine I mean we can you we we can and do okay so is within the state-of-the-art okay to aggregate the healthcare records of say the population of the United States into unified Federation image symbol with this will include the genome sequence okay so you know what are things that we can do that we can do we can we can predict across a population I'm say 330 million people who is gonna be a diagnosed with what disease in the next five years with very high levels of precision say diabetes this gives us the opportunity to or heart disease or breast cancer or whatever it may be and it gives us the opportunity to intervene clinically now and avoid the diagnosis how about genome specific medical protocols you know we would really they'll be much more efficacious at much lower cost now I'm not buying any of the Watson has that these AR AI is gonna replace physicians I don't believe it but I do that hey about but unquestionably AI is going to assist physicians in diagnosis diagnosis will be this radiology or whatever it may be and so adverse drug reaction I can we've demonstrated that we can take the popular we've taken there the medical records for 40% of the United States is 125 million people aggregated those records you know unified federated image and build a machine learning model that will predict with 85 percent precision and 80 percent recall that's kind of a I talk for pretty accurate okay and actually highly accurate and and predict you know were we to prescribe opiates to this population whose previous about sorts addiction so it's so that will be unquestionably ok the largest application of AI is precision medicine and we will lower the cost of medicine we will live longer and will be healthier you know your last comment Eric Topol has this book I don't know if you see the deep medicine which he really you know it's a big same case he's a you know he's a practicing surgeon head of the Cleveland Clinic is now in La Jolla who makes the case that deep learning will actually allow clinicians and he was to spend time doing what they were supposed to do namely healing rather than you know all the stuff that's needed so anyhow listening to you really you know I think it reminded me of okay Jane's telling me I shouldn't ask too many questions because you gotta get some to the audience but I want to ask you one there's one last one Jane okay okay there are a lot of other questions I sorry couldn't get to them all but one last one throughout the book you know I promise I promise about the need to revisit force and your experience in this regard at c3 so share with us you know because the major leadership action plans for us also in academia to prepare students for this huge transformation so propose well let's let's talk about the future of work okay will these technologies have a disruptive impact on the end of the work force abso lutely okay did the automobile have a disruptive impact on the order forth absolutely okay did did the jacquard loom did the Industrial Revolution I mean all of these technologies okay people were left behind okay who didn't keep up now okay this is going to have you know this is going to have a significant impact on the word force I mean when we have autonomous vehicles okay what taxi driver is going to do okay and the I mean there's kind of two ways that companies can prepare for this they can get ready to fire everybody and hire a new workforce or they can train the workforce that we have and I think there are companies who are really leaders in this field are leaning on these technologies many of them developed right here some of them developed at the University Illinois MIT Stanford you name it okay for continuous learning at c3 today we employ about 400 people about 65% of our people have advanced degrees and they have their degree you know they have their PhDs or master's degrees in data science from UC Berkeley MIT Carnegie Mellon you name it okay okay and they are obsolete two weeks after they show up to work okay okay hey wait seriously okay if you don't have a book in your hand if you're not constantly learning in the 21st century you have a problem okay Andy so what we do at c3 and I think what many companies will be doing is investing in their human capital learn the skills that we need and so for example at c3 we've curated a curriculum from Coursera in machine learning deep learning supervised learning on you know kubernetes okay virtualization elastic cloud computing natural language processing you know you know Bayesian processes you name it okay and we encourage people to take these classes and get their certificates and we pay them I don't know a thousand or two thousand dollars when they get their certificate and then we we feature them in the newsletter and we feature their names on you know the The Wall of Fame in our headquarters building and now for people that want to get master's degrees in computer science or data science I know they have a similar program here but there's a program at you know another okay computer science program at the University of Illinois for those people who want to get their math advanced degree in data science or computer science okay they enroll and get admitted which is not that easy to get admitted as you know okay and then we pay the tuition we pay the fees we pray we provide them a twenty five thousand dollar bonus when they get their degree and we get a fifteen percent increase in cash compensation and an additional equity in the company so at c3a all your learning is a core part of the culture and i think i think that in companies that that really thrive okay in the 21st century learning will be a core part of the culture to ensure that their workforce has the skills okay to meet the needs of this digitally transformed economy fantastic alright i promised i think we have time for just a few questions speak a little louder I don't think it Mike hi alright welcome to Berkeley I know you touched on early in this lecture how during the start of the 21st century there are a lot of companies that went out of business that were big players in the 20th century I'm wondering why you think about how you know some of the big players such as you know Amazon and Walmart that are sort of expanding their reach in the retail and market space are possibly like what what sort of role do these like major actors have on this sort of like company extinction and and the shrinkage of the number of companies in the market 8,000 retail outlets have gone out of shuttered their doors in the last 12 months in United States you know big-box stores you name it and I think you know while Amazon looks like a major disrupter in that place in that space I think if Walmart doesn't get their act together I think they're kind of looking down the barrel of a gun you pointed out I'm from Amazon and I wall Mart doesn't get their act together in a world of hurt thank you you've mentioned being trained in history of science and you've talked a lot about the technology relationship to human beings I wonder what do you think for today's and undergrad students or even employees in your company what do they need to know about history or about the relationship of Technology and society I think people need to know everything about history in other words let me comment you know I know that it's very vogue and you know and I got in trouble with sue J at one of her meetings when I went off on a dragon I know I won't be invited back to that okay there's this emphasis that you know everybody has to study you know science technology you know engineering and mathematics I mean really why why I mean what's the matter with classics how about literature okay if you don't understand history I mean how can you operate in this you know in this world so I think all of these things are important and I think they're equally as important okay as electrical engineering and data science let me give you one example okay we were we were working with and now doing predictive maintenance oh don't know hey doing a fraud detention okay for energy in Italy and we had some of the best data scientists on the planet Earth is eco Colter from Carnegie Mellon Henrik Olsen from UC Berkeley I mean these guys are genuine big shots okay brick in their picks on building a building a your machine learning models that would predict you know who's doing the energy how much are they stealing and how they doing with any degree of decision this is going on for six months we have very high levels of precision in recall and Sicily like 85% and everybody place Alice is like eight percent which is I'm sure you're not acceptable and so I sat down with these guys and I said well let me see the data and they looked at well all the true positives were basically coming from Sicily and what they had done they haven't built they were trying to build machine learning models for Italy and they'd built a pretty good machine learning model that operated and I think about 800 dimensional space it was a supervised learning model that were for Sicily and I said you know many guys ever read history I mean you know idli is not one country I mean I mean Italy used to make hundreds of city-states and then it was 14 kingdoms so went on I went on on you know some of you heard Machiavelli you remember this stuff right and and so I went on Wikipedia that night and printed out a map of the 14 kingdoms of Italy ok what year would that have been that we had 14 kings of Italy use it would be night might have been as late as the 18th ok ok so the 14 kingdoms of Italy and I brought the map into the office in the 14 kingdoms of Italy happen to map exactly to the 14 regions of an L in Italy which they operate was called ETA which they're operating regions and I said the problem is you don't need one machine learning model you need 14 machine learning models didn't think about it the way thing when you go out the people in Sicily in the people in Venice they have different genomes they're different diets they have different forms of work and they steal energy differently okay so so then that's what they did they built 14 different machine learning models it increased our precision by an order of magnitude and completely solved the problem so yes I think history's important [Laughter] all right thank you so much Tom I think we'll have to conclude the formal portion of our event today but before you leave Tom we'd like to have our students out from Tau Beta Pi present you with a gift token of our appreciation for spending time with us today all right I need that all right into everybody in the audience tom has been great very generous he's going to provide copies of his book and he's willing to sign them thank you so much Tom and we're going to provide ice cream also outside so please join us outside for a reception and join me in thanking Tom again for a wonderful time [Applause]
