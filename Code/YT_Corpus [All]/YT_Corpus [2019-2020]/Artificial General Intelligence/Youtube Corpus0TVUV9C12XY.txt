 [Music] everybody worries about about work and the role of humans in when we start to have these systems that are highly automated producing everything conceivably and doing a lot of things where are humans and then I think what's left is our humanity right the characteristics of human beings that machines don't share right so sometimes people use the word empathy for this on the shoes could mimic that they can mimic it but they don't know what it's like doesn't matter yeah distinction of matter matter it matters a lot because what it's like then directly affects how you respond to it and so for example I if I'm writing a poem you know by reading my own poem I can get a sense of how it would feel for you to read the poet or I write a joke I can see you know is it funny right and this is one of the one of the things that machine's like they are funny but only by accident and you know in principle you could superficially learn by you know if I if I give you some people are trying this right you know I find you know five million jokes and five million non jokes and I try to learn a distinguishing thing you know but that's not the same as actually finding anything funny right she just doesn't find it funny so it doesn't it doesn't really know and that I think you know in the more complex settings of interpersonal relationships I think we have this comparative advantage and we may may we may even want to reserve the realm of interpersonal relationships for humans there's some where actually argue that you could actually perhaps show empathy much better with automated systems yes you can add them simulate empathy but a part of what I value is that you actually care not that you appear to care and I think that's that's really important ok so the question is so interpersonal relationships great you know and there are some professions that do this already the the executive coach right the child in child care you know with psychotherapists and so on and it's a mixed bag as to whether these are well-paid high status jobs but mostly when you look at you know in terms of numbers the vast majority are child care and elder care which are low stages low paid jobs yeah so the question is why right I mean our children and our parents are like the most precious things and and yet we're paying $6 an hour and everything you can eat from the fridge for someone to look after our children whereas you know if I've got a broken leg you know I'm paying $6,000 an hour to the orthopedic surgeon to fix my broken leg why well because the orthopedic surgeon is resting on hundreds of years of medical research and ten years of training whereas you know for childcare there's almost no training and we don't know how to train them because we don't know the science how does one person improve the life of another right we know there are people who can do it but generally speaking there's no how-to manual there's no science there's no engineering of this we put enormous resources you know in the trillions of dollars into the science and engineering of the cellphone I but not into the science and engineering of how one person can improve the life of another and I think that's what we're going to need in spades because having material abundance is one thing having a rich and fulfilling life is another you
