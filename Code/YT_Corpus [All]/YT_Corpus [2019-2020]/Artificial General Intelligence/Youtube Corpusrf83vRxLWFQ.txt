 [Music] hi everyone thank you so much for coming to the session on designing human centered AI products my name is Kristy Fisher and I'm a UX researcher on Google Ads and I'm also a contributor to the people and AI research team thanks and I'm just hole broke I'm one of the leads of our people plus AI research team here at Google we usually go by the acronym pair so I'll be calling us that from now on and the pair team looks at human in AI interactions across a number of domains and one there's something that we've noticed recently that I'm guessing you have as well AI is everywhere right now yeah it's everywhere it's in the products that we use every day it's at the forefront of just about any base innovations in just about every industry we can think of and obviously we're seeing more interest in AI development from developers like yourselves than we ever have before but beyond that if you're at i/o we're guessing that you want to accomplish a couple of things you probably are interested in AI if you're in our session of course but we're guessing that you want to do something big and important with it and we're guessing that you actually want to put the user first at every step of the way at the same time every developer wants to manage their time and resources to make sure that they're building something that people are going to love that works great and that you can build a business around and so today we're going to talk about a resource that we launched today to help you do both of those things we're calling it the people plus AI guidebook on and we're which is live today ready to go and something we been working on for about the past year the guidebook is a toolkit that you can use to ensure that the time and energy and resources you put into development can make AI development can have a big impact and put the user first the entire time it's the result of contributions from over a hundred Googlers and it's really a synthesis of everything that we've learned about how to practice human centered approach to AI over the past few years the guidebook you know sits already in an ecosystem of reefs versus you know we're not the first piece of guidance around AI that Google has provided to you so the best way to think about the guidebook is we on one side we have the AI principles these are our Northstar these are what guide every major decision we have on the other side we have the basic frameworks and tools that you already know tensorflow ml kit all these things the guidebook is really a connection between the two it's a way to actually put a lot of the AI principles into practice and a different way of approaching your work when using the tools that are out there it's a way of working versus another technical guide or design spec or something like that the guidebook has six chapters which really cover the entirety of the development process from defining and identifying and defining user needs and success to how to collect data to build the right kind of AI model how to explain your AI ones to users once it's been developed all the way to the inevitable failure of the AI and how to do that in a graceful way where people don't abandon your product and still want to to continue to use it one of the things we're really proud of as well is the guidebook content is very tactical and hands-on you should be able to go back you know I feel like you should be able to read it in the morning and go back to your desk in the afternoon and put it into action it's chocked full of worksheets and things that you can print out and use with yourself and your team as well there's more in the guidebook than we could cover in one talk or many many talks so today we're really just going to focus on three chapters and one insight from each chapter that we think are some of the most important ones to think about if you want to be practicing developing AI and a human centered way first we're going to pull from the user needs in defining success chapter and talk about how to identify if AI even adds unique value to your product despite what you might hear you don't have to add AI to every single thing that you're building second from the data and collection and evaluation chapter we're going to talk about how to translate the user needs that you identify into data needs finding that data and training the right model and from the explained ability and Trust chapter we're going to talk about ways that you can explain your AI and and what your AI is doing to users in ways that they will understand and feel in control while using your product so to start we're going to talk about how to identify if AI adds unique value to your product and to do so we have to walk through a few big questions you have to ask yourselves so first is is there a user need and associated pattern of behavior with that need next is is there a definition of success to optimize for in this one we know that there's lots of metrics you could optimize an AI for we're going to talk about how you do that in a people centered way after that we're going to look at how you think about given the scope of the need you've identified could an on AI solution work like I said we don't have two AI every single thing and lastly if AI is needed which type is best ai exists along many different spectrums one of them is really from almost automation to augmentation we'll kind of talk about those two ends a lot of this is shifting the mentality from a technology centered one to a people centered one one of the ways we think about this is right now a lot of people approach a problem and say can we use AI to blank whatever they're trying whatever they're thinking their business problem is and it's really moving to how might we solve blank or solve for blank and then can a I solved this problem in a unique way that's moving things to much more people centered version of AI so everything I've said so far has still been a little abstract and one of the ways that we hope that we can really communicate this clearly to you is through an example so just to kind of start us off and get everybody a little loose who here flew to get here to i/o okay quite a few people Cristina me too and of the people who flew how many of you like did some research to figure out what was a good price for airfare before you came here okay and then lastly did anybody use Google flights to do that okay a few thank you for the business we appreciate it so Google flights team the Google flights app has a feature called flights insights and so it's a it's a feature that uses AI to help you know when the best time to buy a flight is and this team actually used insights from the guidebook in the guidebook itself over the past year to build this feature so throughout this talk we're gonna introduce some guidance from the guidebook but then use the Google flights case to really ground it out and let you know what another team already used this this content okay getting back to the four questions we just had there so first you need to ask yourself is there a clear need and associated behavior pattern you've if if you're at all familiar with human centered design it always starts with you starting with a user need or a human need or a person's need starting with there is basically guaranteeing that you're going to find something interesting along the way it may not be that exact thing you find at the beginning but you will get there if you have the ability to do formal user research we of course encourage that if you don't have that ability or don't have the resources just talking to some of your current users or prospective users will really help you understand their needs then there's this associated behavior pattern one of the really interesting things there is it gives you a baseline for the state of the world but it also starts to give you the scent of the trail that you want to be on to find the right data that you'll need later to train your AI model in the flights example they they were if we go the flights example they had a really clear need they knew from their user research and talking to their customers that people wanted to know when to book a flight for the best price and not get burned they also had a really good knowledgeable they already knew a the pattern of behavior people were using at the time so people would go back to the same sites over and over again at different times because people were trying to figure out when is the best time to buy is it Tuesday night is it Saturday morning is it a full moon I don't know I can't figure this out and so they had some data there and they had some needs that they knew that they could address next they moved on - is there a clear definition of success to optimize for we all know metrics like views and some engagement and clicks and things like that defining success and the people centered way is a lot harder than you might think we spend a good amount of time about this on this in the guidebook you want to be focusing on some harder to measure but more important things like are you increasing your users well-being are you increasing their long term success and long term engagement with your product and things like are you making their them happier are they enjoying your products so much they're gonna go tell somebody about it which is a lot harder you also want to make sure sorry behind one you also want to make sure and watch out for secondary effects so some of the secondary effects are things like what if you're too good at the metric you optimize for or what if it's done in a malicious way so one of the ways that this happens is like clickbait articles like they have really good engagement and they have all these numbers but they actually disappoint a lot of people and are negative for the overall ecosystem and we get into this a lot in the guidebook another way you can think about defining success is through the old good old confusion matrix when considering any kind of AI model I'm guessing we're not going to get into this in any depth here but you know this kind of underlies a lot of the predictive AI models where you have the reference which is the true state of the world either something is or isn't in a category and you have the AI prediction that it is or isn't and so there we have our true and false true positives and negatives and our false positives and negatives in a in a typical model those are considered equal but when you're thinking about the user experience you may actually want your your model to focus on one versus the other so if we move back to the Google flights example this was their confusion matrix for flights prediction so they're trying to predict is the price of a flight going to go up in the future so we have our two outcomes here that the price in fact does go up in the future and the AI model thought it would and that the price does not go up in the future in the AI model thought it would not all good no problems there when we get to the errors though something kind of something interesting happens so in the case where the model predicted the price would go up but it didn't that's actually not that bad of an error because the person would just buy the ticket at the price at the best price they could but maybe just a little earlier than they had to not all that bad the really bad one is when there was no when there was a price increase and the model decided in the model did not think there was one right because this could cost somebody a lot of money or even miss their flight or something like that we don't just have guidance we also have a lot of tools to help you actually inspect the data one of those is something from the pair team that's called the what-if tool so the what-if tool allows you to upload and dig into your data and explore the consequences of false positives and negatives allows you to examine different precision and recall thresholds and trait and associated trade-offs and even compare the output from multiple models so you can start to understand the errors an AI model is making for whom and in what context a lot better so going to the flights example is there a clear definition of success to optimize your AI for success yes buying at the right time at the right price was the clear success for them success definition of success for them was there something they could optimize for yes the best time to buy and like we mentioned is all about avoiding those false negatives or those cases where the model did not think them the price would go up and it did next we want to consider given the scope of the need you've identified could a non AI solution work the Google flights team had a non AI solution working in place but it was extremely hard to maintain and the accuracy was hard to keep at users expectations they also have millions of daily active users and cash flights up to a year in advance so there's a huge complexity to this to their to their need so the scope is appropriate AI is needed because there's just too much complexity to scale their current solution to their users needs but still it was really grounded in in that maintenance of meeting their users expectations and the engineering sustainability of that of a heuristic person AI option now we're at since AI is needed which type is best so AI tends to be better at it you know humans are good at certain things and AIS are good at certain things when we think about the spectrum of AI and how it can help out there's two kind of useful categories one is automation and the others augmentation automation tends to be automation is you know just automating a task essentially a way augmentation is a way to extend people's abilities in but they retain agency so for automation it's a lot it's very good when people don't know how to do something people literally can't do something so for example if you said you know process these millions of rows of flight data a human just can't really do that or if a task is boring repetitive or dangerous something like maybe measuring air quality in in potentially toxic areas augmentation is often preferred and better when people enjoy or feel responsible for a task like writing a birthday card there are high stakes situations or complicated personal preferences in the flights example there are both high stakes it's both a high-stakes situation and their complicated personal preferences high stakes because flights are expensive and getting to a family wedding is important cristy flies out tonight to a wedding and she can attest that it's very important that she gets there on time and not late in any way so we got to make sure we end on time in terms of preferences there are many complicated personal preferences as everyone likes to fly in their own way one of the big divisive ones for the flights team was over night flights some people really really love over night flights some people will never ever ever go on an overnight overnight flight no matter what and so they really wanted to augment that person's ability to make that decision versus make it for them so what did the Google flights team do to identify if a iods unique value to their product they identified people's needs and behavior patterns they defined AI success and a people centered way they determined if the scope of the problem needed AI and determined that it did and they decided on the right type of AI to augment people's ability to make those decisions and so once I identified that need it was time to translate that need into data and Kristi's going to tell us about how they did that thank you so a big thing that we learned synthesizing all of our knowledge across Google about building people centered ai is that it's often very tempting to look at the data that you have and then say huh what kind of AI could I create from these data but that is really doing yourself and your future users a disservice the right thing to ask is given my user need what scope of data what I need in order to then train an AI that could actually meet that need well so if you don't take a step back and go through that human centered design process you're going to end up with an AI that maybe works great but doesn't actually do what people need it to do so to avoid that we want to make sure we are translating our users needs into a data set that can be used to train our AI so how to think about doing this the first thing to do is to ask yourself whether users needs a line clearly with AI outputs that an AI could actually provide then you need to think about mapping those outputs onto a data set that you actually have access to then you need to think about given the data set that I need can i source it in a way that is responsible to make sure that I have no fairness or bias issues in my data and to make sure that my data is my data set is robust enough to actually train a model that will work and then of course you have to do the really hard stuff that there's a dozen other talks on here today at i/o which is build and train your model but then as you do that iteratively and tune your model over time to get better and better we're gonna challenge you to do that in a way that really keeps people in mind and is not just focused on getting to a certain statistic so let's start by thinking about how to align users people's needs with data so this is really simple it's really just taking a few hours talking with your team thinking through it yourself going back to that research you did with people and thinking carefully about all the different parts of the need of the person who will be using this then thinking about given what they need what could an out AI output be that could meet that need so for example on the flights team as just mentioned the real big question that people had was when do I need to book this is it gonna go up tomorrow or can I wait and maybe get paid first before I jump and buy that ticket so in order to meet the users needs the AI output had to provide first an understanding of what the present price is is this current price low medium or high then they also had to say what do we think will happen in the future is it gonna go up is it gonna go down or is it gonna stay the same so in order to actually meet the users need and help them buy a flight at the right time the AI output had to provide these two key things so once you understand what the AI really needs to do to meet the person's need then you can start thinking about what sort of elements need to be in your data set in order to then train an AI that can deliver those outputs so as many of you probably know if you are experimenting with machine learning in your own development structured data sets are a really common way to train models through supervised learning and structured data sets contain examples examples are essentially the rows of your data set and those examples contain features which are the categories of information in your data set and then lastly you have labels labels are often qualitative bits of data and they're often generated by people so as you think about what data do you need you need to be thinking about can I get a data set with all of the features that would be required to get an AI output that would meet my my users needs and can I get all the labels that I need to meet that need so for example for the price team are sorry for the flights team if they only had price data about what the what the historical price was but they didn't know what day it was today and what the price was today then that wouldn't really give them what they needed to meet people's needs people need to know both what is the price today and what was the price in the past in order for the AI output to give them what they needed in terms of putting the price in context and knowing what would happen in the future so you really need to think about do I have can I get all the right features in night data set that could then lead me to an AI output that would be valuable to people and then once you know all the data that you need to train your AI model now you actually have to find it and this is no easy task so for the flight's team they already had a heuristic based tool in place before they decided to try to use AI for flight insights and even then with all this data that had been coming in for many months and years it still takes a lot of time and effort as many of you know to actually clean up that data and restructure it and make sure that it's in the proper format to then train a model but for you you might not even have that huge pool of data sitting around like Google does so it's going to take you even more time and effort if you've never worked with machine learning and AI before you might not realize just how much time and effort this takes but please know that this is the best place to spend that time and effort because really making sure that you have the right data that can then deliver the right AI outputs that can then meet the person's need is going to make all the difference so some key things to ask yourself as you're going on this quest for your data is is there a publicly available data set that I could use or do I have to build one from scratch and then does my dataset contain enough example diversity to give me the types of AI outputs that I need so for example again thinking of flights if they're going to be able to provide meaningful insights for anyone across the world looking for a flight they need millions of examples of historical flights including all the features we talked about where the flight was or originating from where it was going how much it cost when the per ticket was purchased all of that stuff and then lastly is your data set free of issues privacy fairness bias etc so each of those big questions could of course be a series of i/o talks and there's many specific talks about these today and tomorrow as well and probably yesterday so we're not going to go into all of that detail but we just want to remind you that we have a lot of resources on Google AI as well as provided by the pear team and some tips in the guidebook for building your own data set making sure you're using all the possible resources that Google has made available to make sure that you're getting the best possible data at a trainer model and there's one tool you might not be aware of yet called the facets tool the facets tool allows you to visualize what is inside of your data set before you put it into your model to train your ml so what's really helpful about this is when you suddenly see all of your data categorized and colored it can be really obvious if something is missing or if there's a disproportionate amount of one category of data versus another the flight's team was actually able to catch a few errors itself by using this tool so you finally figured out what data you need and you spent all the time getting the right data set and building and training your model now you have to make sure that you can continue to tweak and tune it to make it as accurate and as reliable as it can possibly be and as you do this we're gonna give you a framework for how we'd like you to think about this to do this in a way that's people centered so that framework is this if some metric for Rai changes the Delta drops above or goes below a certain threshold then we're going to take a certain action so what this meant for the flights insights team was if bookings from this new AI powered flight insights tool dropped below a certain percentage so people weren't using it they weren't finding it valuable during the beta phase then the flights team would needed to do something about it they needed to then perhaps adjust the confidence to make sure that only the highest confident highest confidence flight insights predictions were actually making it in to the flights insights UI so what the flights team did to translate user needs into data was first make sure that the needs of the people who be using flight insights could be aligned with AI outputs as we said those AI outputs our current understanding of the existing price today and a prediction for how that flight will change in the future then they had to map those AI outputs onto if a training data set they could actually acquire make sure that it was sourced well and didn't have any issues and lastly they had to continue to tune an iterate on the model in a way that was people centered so now you might think we've really done the hard work we have built an AI that works like that is so hard it can take months it can take a team of engineers a really a long time even with all the tools that we've made available at Google to democratize AI it can be really hard but unfortunately there's still more you have to do I'm tired sorry to tell you because if you build a great a AI but people don't understand it then do you risk them misunderstanding your model using it incorrectly or simply ignoring your AI product altogether this is something that I think about every day because on the Google Ads team we build really complex AI driven forecasting tools that can help advertisers make the hard decisions but if they don't understand what went into this forecast and how they're meant to use it and how confident they should be in it then they're not really sure how to incorporate it into their workflows so we're always having to work really hard to make it better so for you what to think about when you're thinking about how to explain your AI system to the people who are using it it's first think about what explanations are needed to build something that we call calibrated trust calibrated trust means that somebody does not under trust or over trust your AI under trusting is this recommendation is crap and I'm never going to use that ever over trusting is oh well if the AI says so it must be the truth I will take it no matter what so with calibrated trust people know when they should use what the AI gives them without question and when they should maybe double check it or apply their own judgement the next question to consider when considering how to explain your AI to the people using it is what level of technical expertise do people have because people with higher technical expertise may need or expect more information about the AI in order to build that calibrated trust compared with people who are non experts so for example somebody who's a neuron who's a neurologist who is using an AI system to help them diagnose a patient they're gonna really want to make sure they understand all the ins and outs of the AI and how it was programmed and what data it was trained on before they're willing to trust it because their patient's life is in their hands meanwhile if I'm just using maps to like find my way out of here so I can get back to the office I don't need to know all the details of how Google Maps helped me get to this direction in this route and lastly you need to think about if and how to display your AIS prediction confidence so most a AI systems can generate some sort of measure of how confident they are in a given output or a given prediction and how to visualize that to people and whether they need that information at all is something to think really carefully about and something that we give a lot of guidance on in the guidebook so first thinking about how to build calibrate a trust usually people do not need to know everything and sometimes full disclosure is less helpful than just the key pieces of information that are most important so through doing research and through doing lots of testing and iterating you will come to know what information the people using your product need in order to under in order to trust it and use it effectively so typically you're not going to give a full explanation of here's everything about how my AI system works you're going to give a partial explanation and typically those partial explanations should include what sources of data were used by the AI this is important because users need to understand when they might have information that the system doesn't have so going back to that neurologists example they need to know whether this prediction from the AI that this person has a tumor is just based on lots of imaging data from lots of people or whether it's also taking the very unique patient history of this one person in front of me into account without knowing that where what the source of data is is hard for that neurologist to then trust the AI and generally speaking these partial explanations of AI should include inputs outputs capabilities and limitations of the system so this is what the AI is expecting from you this is what you can expect to get back in return and this is what it simply can and can't do and as I mentioned before and I will mention several more times before I give the clicker back to Jess is that it's displaying the confidence of the AI system is not always useful to help the person use it effectively so for the flight's team when we think about what information the the users of flight insights needed in order to trust the system they needed to know what Airlines and options were or were not included as just mentioned if I am totally willing to take overnight flights in order to save some money I want to make sure that the AI knows that and it's taking all of those options into account and through a research the flights team learned as well that only very confident predictions were going to actually be useful to the people using flight insights so if if a prediction was only about 50 percent confident that the flight price would or would not go up people didn't want to see that didn't see much better than what they were currently doing so next is act technical expertise so thinking again about flights obviously we can assume low technical expertise whether even if you are only flying once a year you could still use flights in sites it's mid for people all over the world who are in lots of different geographies and who do fly a lot don't fly a lot so you can make sure that we're this is understandable and in plain language that lots of different people can understand so understanding the low expertise of the user the flights team built a framework for communicating in plain language what the AI behind flight insights was predicting so they started off building simple sentences that explained the current state of the world and what the AI predicted for the future so for example prices are currently either low medium or high and then what the AI predicted would happen next so to walk through a couple of examples let's say prices are currently high and this system does not have a high confidence prediction for what will happen next if they'll go up or down in this case the flight insights tool might just say prices are high I don't have a good prediction for what happens next but just so you know for context prices are high if the flight insights model did have a good prediction for what would happen next it would again explain this to the people in plain language so prices are currently medium but they will generally go up our prices are currently low and so today is a good day to book as we already mentioned displaying model confidence is not always useful and lots of different types of displays exist and everyone has trade-offs we unfortunately aren't able to give you the out-of-the-box solution of this way of displaying confidence for your a I will work for everyone all of the time what we can tell you is here are some examples here are the trade-offs and for you you need to test and iterate a lot to get it right so some common ways of displaying AI prediction confidence are categorical in best numeric and data vis so in categorical you're simply chunking your predictions into really confident kind of confident and not so confident in invest you're giving a result and then you're saying here are some backups just in case we're wrong so for example here's a picture of Tokyo but it might also be a picture of New York or Los Angeles or somewhere else and numeric is simply giving the number that the system has given you I am 88% confident that this recommendation is true and DataViz you might show graphically what the AIS prediction is and then put some confidence intervals or some error bars around it and again thinking about the trade-offs and again about the user is likely technical expertise keep in mind that they don't need to understand the AI as well as you the person that built it they just need to understand it enough to know what to do next so when you think of something like the numerical image indicator if you tell me that you're 88% confident I'm gonna love this t-shirt is that good or bad do I need to know that level of granularity is 86% that much better or worse than 88 so those are kinds of things to think about so again for displaying the AI prediction confidence to the flight's team they decided not to give any kind of indicator of how confident the system was they simply decided not to display it if it was comped if it was not confident so instead their design challenge was how do we display only these very confident predictions in a way that's simple and usable and elegant so here's what the Google flights UI looks like and if we zoom in here here's the indicator that again explains in plain language what the AI is predicting so here's the current price and here's what we think will happen next so to recap you need to build calibrate a trust with your users you need to keep their expertise in mind when you're creating these explanations and you need to decide and think very carefully about if and how to display model confidence so that's how the flights team built this insights tool just how did their people-centred approach to AI a design work yeah so the team took insights from the guidebook take a human center people centered approach and we can't share exact numbers but things have been going really well they get very positive feedback and one of the most important things to know is when you build in a people centered way people will tell you that you did people will tell you if you succeeded there'll be very little guesswork so to zoom back out from the Google flights example back to the general ideas what we've covered today is in our few insights from three of the chapters how to identify if AI adds unique value for your product or your use case how did then take that and translate that user need into data needs and requirements for your AI model and then once you have a functioning model how to explain it well to users in a way that they understand and that they can feel in control of what they're doing like we said at the beginning there are six chapters in the guidebook total each has many of these kind of insights in them and so there's just a ton more for you to check out the you can check it out here we hope everyone goes takes a look at it we hope you use it we hope it's useful to you really importantly we really hope you send us feedback there's a big feedback button along the whole thing because we want to make something that's useful for everyone out there we really appreciate your time today if you want to keep the conversation going we'll be at the material design and accessibility sandbox at about 250 later on so thank you very much [Applause] [Music]
